AB Payments for environmental services (PES) are often viewed as a way to simultaneously improve conservation outcomes and the wellbeing of rural households who receive the payments. However, evidence for such win-win outcomes has been elusive. We add to the growing literature on conservation program impacts by using primary household survey data to evaluate the socioeconomic impacts of participation in Costa Rica's PES program. Despite the substantial cash transfers to voluntary participants in this program, we do not detect any evidence of impacts on their wealth or self-reported well-being using a quasi-experimental design. These results are consistent with the common claim that voluntary PES do not harm participants, but they beg the question of why landowners participate if they do not benefit. Landowners in our sample voluntarily renewed their contracts after five years in the program and thus are unlikely to have underestimated their costs of participation. They apparently did not invest additional income from the program in farm inputs such as cattle or hired labor, since both decreased as a result of participation. Nor do we find evidence that participation encouraged moves off-farm. Instead, semi-structured interviews suggest that participants joined the program to secure their property rights and contribute to the public good of forest conservation. Thus, in order to understand the social impacts of PES, we need to look beyond simple economic rationales and material outcomes.

AB Land-cover change detection using satellite remote sensing is largely confined to the era of Landsat satellites, from 1972 to present. However, the Corona, Argon, and Lanyard intelligence satellites operated by the U.S. government between 1960 and 1972 have the potential to provide an important extension of the long-term record of Earth's land surface. Recently declassified, the archive of images recorded by these satellites contains hundreds of thousands of photographs, many of which have very high ground resolution- 6-9 ft (1.8-2.7 m) even by today's standards. This paper demonstrates methods for extending the span of forest-cover change analysis from the Landsat-5 and -7 era (1984 to present) to the previous era covered by the Corona archive in two study areas: one area covered predominantly by urban and sub-urban land uses in the eastern US and another area by tropical forest in central Brazil. We describe co-registration of Corona and Landsat images, extraction of texture features from Corona images, classification of Corona and Landsat images, and post-classification change detection based on the resulting thematic dataset. Second-order polynomial transformation of Corona images yielded geometric accuracy relative to Landsat-7 of 18.24 m for the urban area and 29.35 m for the tropical forest study area, generally deemed adequate for pixel-based change detection at Landsat resolution. Classification accuracies were approximately 95% and 96% for forest/non-forest discrimination for the temperate urban and tropical forest study areas, respectively. Texture within 7 x 7- to 9 x 9-pixel (similar to 13.0-16.5 m) neighborhoods and within 11 x 11-pixel (similar to 30 m) neighborhoods were the most informative metrics for forest classification in Corona images in the temperate and tropical study areas, respectively. The trajectory of change from the 1960s to 2000s differed between the two study areas: the average annual forest loss rate in the urban area doubled from 0.68% to 1.9% from the 1960s to the mid-1980s and then decreased during the following decade. In contrast, deforestation in the Brazilian study area continued at a slightly increased pace between the 1960s and 1990s at annual loss rate of 0.62-0.79% and quickly slowed down afterward. This study demonstrates the strong potential of declassified Corona images for detecting historical forest changes in these study regions and suggests increased utility for retrieving a wide range of land cover histories around the world.

AB Chronosequences, commonly used to assess succession, have been questioned because of their failure to project successional trajectories. Here, we develop a simple analytical approach combining both chronosequence and dynamic data to test the power of age of abandonment and site factors to explain and predict succession. The approach proceeds by first fitting statistical models relating age to attribute values (the chronosequence model) and their observed changes (the dynamic model) to test explanatory power. Predictive power is then tested by bootstrapping the chronosequence model to derive confidence intervals for expected changes and comparing them with the dynamic model. Finally, residuals from both models are tested against site factors. The procedure was applied to six attributes (basal area, plant density, mean plant height, species richness, evenness, and composition) of the woody community (plants >1cm dbh within 0.1-ha plots) in nine abandoned cattle pastures (0-12yr) and three old growth tropical dry forests monitored over 6yr. Age explained 60-97 percent of the variance in community attributes and only 32-57 percent in observed changes. It significantly overestimated basal area and mean height, while species richness and composition were highly predicted. Besides age, management history also explained successional dynamics. Our results suggest age is not necessarily a reliable predictor of short-term successional dynamics, and explanatory power is not indicative of predictive power. Because of this low reliability, caution is needed when applying chronosequences to evaluate ecosystem services' recovery. The analytical approach developed here contributes to a better exploration of those possible limitations.
   Resumen El uso de la cronosecuencia como herramienta para conocer la sucesion ha sido cuestionado debido a la incapacidad de esta para predecir las trayectorias sucesionales. En este estudio se presenta una aproximacion analitica sencilla que combina la informacion de cronosecuencia con informacion dinamica obtenida de mediciones repetidas en el tiempo, para poner a prueba la capacidad de la edad de abandono y de los factores de sitio para explicar y predecir la sucesion. El primer paso consiste en el ajuste de modelos estadisticos que relacionan la edad de abandono con atributos del ecosistema (modelo de cronosecuencia) o con los cambios observados en dichos atributos a traves del tiempo (modelo de la dinamica), lo que permite poner a prueba la capacidad explicativa de la edad de abandono. Aplicando un muestreo con remplazamiento a los datos del modelo de cronosecuencia (bootstrapping) se derivan los intervalos de confianza para los cambios esperados a partir del mismo. La capacidad predictiva del modelo de cronosecuencia se somete a prueba mediante la comparacion de dichos intervalos con el modelo dinamico. Finalmente, el efecto de los factores de sitio se pone a prueba relacionando estos ultimos con los residuales de ambos modelos. Este procedimiento se aplico al analisis de seis atributos (area basal, densidad, altura promedio, riqueza de especies, equitatividad y composicion) de la comunidad de plantas lenosas (plantas >1cm de diametro a la altura del pecho al interior de parcelas de 0.1-ha) en nueve potreros abandonados (0-12 anos de abandono) y tres bosques maduros ubicados en una tropical estacionalmente seca y que fueron monitoreados durante 6 anos. La edad explico 60-97 por ciento de la varianza en los atributos de la comunidad, pero solo 32-57 por ciento para los cambios observados. La edad sobreestimo de manera significativa los cambios en area basal y altura promedio, mientras que los cambios en riqueza y composicion de especies fueron adecuadamente predichos. La historia de manejo tambien explico los cambios observados en los atributos. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la edad no es necesariamente un predictor confiable de los cambios sucesionales en periodos cortos de tiempo y que la capacidad explicativa de los modelos no indica su poder predictivo. Debido a esta baja confiabilidad, la aplicacion de los modelos de cronosecuencia en la prediccion de la recuperacion de los servicios ecosistemicos a traves de la sucesion debe hacerse con cautela. La aproximacion analitica desarrollada en el presente estudio contribuye a la exploracion de dichas limitantes de las cronosecuencias.

AB Forest and water protection once relied primarily on regulatory means to achieve conservation ends, but an explosion of market-based and neoliberal approaches to environmental policy now depend instead on the creation and harnessing of financial instruments to value environmental goods and provide the funding needed for their preservation. Payments for environmental services (PES), which provides incentives for soil, water and forest conservation from users of services to those who provide them, is one of the most well-known of these approaches. However, many challenges remain for PES as a policy approach, and this paper explores how PES schemes have been implemented in practice in developing countries, how well they fit with descriptions of neoliberal environmental governance, and how these policies are being shaped by rural actors to make them more favourable to social, cultural or economic priorities in local areas. The paper shows that seemingly neoliberal policies like PES are actually a mix of both market economic incentives and regulatory approaches, and thus should not be labelled solely "neoliberal" per se. Further, much of this variegation in PES policy has resulted from active engagement of rural actors in shaping the parameters of what parts of neoliberal policy are acceptable, and what are not, and data from a Vietnam case study emphasize this point. Finally, the paper shows how key goals of neoliberal approaches, namely efficiency and conditionality, are often actually the weakest components of PES schemes, in Vietnam and elsewhere, particularly when they clash with local concerns over equity, which should pose a rethinking of how to understand PES success. The article concludes that PES plans should not be considered exclusively neoliberal per se, as they may in fact strengthen both state regulation and local participation and involvement in rural environmental management at the same time.

AB Little is known about the impact of disturbances on functional diversity and the long-term provisioning of ecosystem services, especially in animals. In this work we analyze the effect of wildfire on the functional composition of Mediterranean ant communities. In particular, we asked whether a) fire changes functional composition (mean and dissimilarity of trait values) at the community level; and b) such fire-induced functional modification is driven by changes in the relative abundance-dominance of species or by a replacement of species with different traits. We sampled ant communities in burned and unburned plots along 22 sites in a western Mediterranean region, and we computed two complementary functional trait composition indices (trait average' and trait dissimilarity') for 12 functional traits (related to resource exploitation, social structure and reproduction) and with two different datasets varying in the way species abundance is considered (i.e. abundance and occurrence data). Our results suggest a set of functional responses that seem to be related to direct mortality by fire as well as to indirect fire-induced modifications in environmental conditions relevant for ants. Trait average of colony size, worker size, worker polymorphism and the ratio between queen and worker size, as well as the trait dissimilarity of the proportion of behaviorally dominant species and of liquid food consumption, and overall functional diversity, were higher in burned than in unburned areas. Interestingly, different patterns arise when comparing results from abundance and occurrence data. While the response to fire in trait averages is quite similar, in the case of trait dissimilarity, the higher values in response to fire are much more marked when considering occurrence rather than abundance data. Our results suggest that changes in trait average are driven at the same time by replacement of species with different traits and by changes in the relative abundance-dominance of species, while fire promotes a higher diversity of functions that is primarily driven by rare species that are functionally unique. Overall, we observed major fire-induced changes in functional composition in Mediterranean ant communities that might have relevant consequences for ecosystem processes and services.

TI Ocean Acidification Disrupts Prey Responses to Predator Cues but Not Net

AB Background: Most research on Ocean Acidification (OA) has largely focused on the process of calcification and the physiological trade-offs employed by calcifying organisms to support the building of calcium carbonate structures. However, there is growing evidence that OA can also impact upon other key biological processes such as survival, growth and behaviour. On wave-swept rocky shores the ability of gastropods to self-right after dislodgement, and rapidly return to normal orientation, reduces the risk of predation.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The impacts of OA on this self-righting behaviour and other important parameters such as growth, survival, shell dissolution and shell deposition in Concholepas concholepas (loco) were investigated under contrasting pCO(2) levels. Although no impacts of OA on either growth or net shell calcification were found, the results did show that OA can significantly affect self-righting behaviour during the early ontogeny of this species with significantly faster righting times recorded for individuals of C. concholepas reared under increased average pCO(2) concentrations (+/- SE) (716 +/- 12 and 1036 +/- 14 mu atm CO2) compared to those reared at concentrations equivalent to those presently found in the surface ocean (388 +/- 8 mu atm CO2). When loco were also exposed to the predatory crab Acanthocyclus hassleri, righting times were again increased by exposure to elevated CO2, although self-righting times were generally twice as fast as those observed in the absence of the crab.
   Conclusions and Significance: These results suggest that self-righting in the early ontogeny of C. concholepas will be positively affected by pCO(2) levels expected by the end of the 21st century and beginning of the next one. However, as the rate of self-righting is an adaptive trait evolved to reduce lethal predatory attacks, our result also suggest that OA may disrupt prey responses to predators in nature.

AB The effect of herbivory on plant performance is the subject of a large number of ecological studies, and plant responses to herbivory range from reduced reproduction to overcompensation. Because plant defenses, stored resources, and allocation demands change throughout a plant's lifetime, it can be hypothesized the effects of herbivory also vary with development. The present work extends previous analyses to incorporate hundreds of studies in a new meta-analysis addressing this topic. Herbivores had an overall negative effect on plant growth and reproduction, and, in contrast to a previous meta-analysis, this work shows the timing of herbivory is relevant. Differences in the effects of herbivory between life stages existed for woody plant reproduction and perennial herb growth. In addition, tree and shrub growth was reduced by herbivore damage at early ontogenetic stages, and perennial herb reproduction was limited by adult stage herbivory. These results partially support the continuum of an ontogenetic response model. Finally, consideration of this synthesis in conjunction with other work led to the conclusion that different plant groups optimize their defense investments in unique ways. Slow-growing plants may strongly chemically defend young tissues, supporting the plant-age hypothesis, because early herbivory is detrimental to growth. Faster-growing herbs may invest more in antiherbivore defense when they are older, supporting the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, because later herbivory limits their reproduction.

TI Elevational Gradients in Fish Diversity in the Himalaya: Water Discharge
   Is the Key Driver of Distribution Patterns
SO PLOS ONE

   EASTERN HIMALAYA; BIODIVERSITY; ENERGY; ARALIACEAE; ENDEMISM
AB Background: Studying diversity and distribution patterns of species along elevational gradients and understanding drivers behind these patterns is central to macroecology and conservation biology. A number of studies on biogeographic gradients are available for terrestrial ecosystems, but freshwater ecosystems remain largely neglected. In particular, we know very little about the species richness gradients and their drivers in the Himalaya, a global biodiversity hotspot.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We collated taxonomic and distribution data of fish species from 16 freshwater Himalayan rivers and carried out empirical studies on environmental drivers and fish diversity and distribution in the Teesta river (Eastern Himalaya). We examined patterns of fish species richness along the Himalayan elevational gradients (50-3800 m) and sought to understand the drivers behind the emerging patterns. We used generalized linear models (GLM) and generalized additive models (GAM) to examine the richness patterns; GLM was used to investigate relationship between fish species richness and various environmental variables. Regression modelling involved stepwise procedures, including elimination of collinear variables, best model selection, based on the least Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and the highest percentage of deviance explained (D-2). This maiden study on the Himalayan fishes revealed that total and non-endemic fish species richness monotonously decrease with increasing elevation, while endemics peaked around mid elevations (700-1500 m). The best explanatory model (synthetic model) indicated that water discharge is the best predictor of fish species richness patterns in the Himalayan rivers.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study, carried out along one of the longest bioclimatic elevation gradients of the world, lends support to Rapoport's elevational rule as opposed to mid domain effect hypothesis. We propose a species-discharge model and contradict species-area model in predicting fish species richness. We suggest that drivers of richness gradients in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are likely to be different. These studies are crucial in context of the impacts of unprecedented on-going river regulation on fish diversity and distribution in the Himalaya.

AB The state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, has experienced rapid land use changes from the expansion of rain-fed agriculture (primarily soybean and pasture). This study presents changes to evapotranspiration contributions from terrestrial ecosystems in Mato Grosso over the 2000-9 period. Instead of focusing on land use change to infer hydrologic change, in this paper we assess hydrologic changes using remote sensing, meteorological and agricultural production data to determine the rainforest, crop and pasture components of total evapotranspiration. Humid tropical rainforest evapotranspiration represented half of the state's total evapotranspiration in 2000 despite occupying only 40% of the total land area. Annual evapotranspiration fluxes from rainforest declined at a rate of 16.2 km(3) y(-1) (R-2 = 0.82, p-value < 0.01) as a result of deforestation between 2000 and 2009, representing a 25% decline in rainforest evapotranspiration since 2000. By 2009, rainforest cover accounted for only 40% of total evapotranspiration. Over the same period, crop evapotranspiration doubled, but this increase was offset by a decline in pasture evapotranspiration. Pasture fluxes were at least five times larger than crop evapotranspiration fluxes in 2000-9, with increases spatially focused at the agricultural frontier. The results highlight the expanding appropriation of soil moisture stocks for use in Mato Grosso's rain-fed agroecosystems.

AB Two opposing niche processes have been shown to shape the relationship between ecological traits and species distribution patterns: habitat filtering and competitive exclusion. Habitat filtering is expected to select for similar traits among coexisting species that share similar habitat conditions, whereas competitive exclusion is expected to limit the ecological similarity of coexisting species leading to trait differentiation. Here, we explore how functional traits vary among 19 understory palm species that differ in their distribution across a gradient of soil resource availability in lower montane forest in western Panama. We found evidence that habitat filtering influences species distribution patterns and shifts community-wide and intraspecific trait values. Differences in trait values among sites were more strongly related to soil nutrient availability than to variation in light or rainfall. Soil nutrient availability explained a significant amount of variation in site mean trait values for 4 of 15 functional traits. Site mean values of leaf nitrogen and phosphorus increased 37 and 64%, respectively, leaf carbon: nitrogen decreased 38%, and specific leaf area increased 29% with increasing soil nutrient availability. For Geonoma cuneata, the only species occurring at all sites, leaf phosphorus increased 34% and nitrogen: phosphorus decreased 42% with increasing soil nutrients. In addition to among-site variation, most morphological and leaf nutrient traits differed among coexisting species within sites, suggesting these traits may be important for niche differentiation. Hence, a combination of habitat filtering due to turnover in species composition and intraspecific variation along a soil nutrient gradient and site-specific niche differentiation among co-occurring species influences understory palm community structure in this lower montane forest.

AB Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) provides financial compensation to land owners who avoid converting standing forests to other land uses. In this paper, we review the main opportunities and challenges for REDD+ implementation, including expectations for REDD+ to deliver on multiple environmental and societal cobenefits. We also highlight a recent case study, the Norway-Indonesia REDD+ agreement and discuss how it might be a harbinger of outcomes in other forest-rich nations seeking REDD+ funds. Looking forward, we critically examine the fundamental assumptions of REDD+ as a solution for the atmospheric buildup of greenhouse gas emissions and tropical deforestation. We conclude that REDD+ is currently the most promising mechanism driving the conservation of tropical forests. Yet, to emerge as a true game changer, REDD+ must still demonstrate that it can access low transaction cost and high-volume carbon markets or funds, while also providing or complimenting a suite of nonmonetary incentives to encourage a developing nation's transition from forest losing to forest gaining, and align with, not undermine, a globally cohesive attempt to mitigate anthropogenic climate change.

AB Ateline monkeys, the largest primates in the Neotropics, may disperse more than one million seeds/km(2)/d at sites where they are abundant, but it is unclear whether a reduction in their populations can alter plant diversity patterns. The species richness and composition of regenerating plants as a proxy of future plant communities were studied by comparing 16 sites with different attune abundance in three countries in northwestern South America. A total of 3658 plots included 94,340 regenerating plants, which were assigned to species or morphospecies. Paired t-tests comparing sites in the same region but with different densities of atelines, and regression analyses showed a consistent positive relationship between ateline density and plant diversity. These results were due to the larger number of stems per area and higher evenness at sites with more atelines, suggesting higher recruitment rates for dispersed seeds. Differences were also found in plant composition, as canopy, endozoochorous, and medium seed size plants were consistently more abundant in sites with more ateline monkeys than in sites with less atelines. The findings of this study suggest that these primates play a key role in plant regeneration. In order to maintain the diversity and plant composition of tropical forests for future generations, conservation of these large frugivores and other key game species is imperative.

AB For organisms living in the intertidal zone, temperature is an important selective agent that can shape species distributions and drive phenotypic variation among populations. Littorinid snails, which occupy the upper limits of rocky shores and estuaries worldwide, often experience extreme high temperatures and prolonged aerial emersion during low tides, yet their robust physiology coupled with morphological and behavioral traits permits these gastropods to persist and exert strong grazing control over algal communities. We use a mechanistic heat-budget model to compare the effects of behavioral and morphological traits on the body temperatures of five species of littorinid snails under natural weather conditions. Model predictions and field experiments indicate that, for all five species, the relative contribution of shell color or sculpturing to temperature regulation is small, on the order of 0.2-2 degrees C, while behavioral choices such as removing the foot from the substratum or reorienting the shell can lower body temperatures by 2-4 degrees C on average. Temperatures in central California rarely exceeded the thermal tolerance limits of the local littorinid species during the study period, but at sites where snails are regularly exposed to extreme high temperatures, the functional significance of the tested traits may be important. The mechanistic approach used here provides the ability to gauge the importance of behavioral and morphological traits for controlling body temperature as species approach their physiological thresholds.

AB Roads are recognised as having different ecological roles such as barrier, corridor or habitat, but the spatial extent of road effects on plant communities in forests remains unclear. We studied the effect of forest road distance on plant understory diversity at 20 sites in young and adult oak stands in a French lowland forest with a long history of management and road construction. All vascular and bryophyte species were collected at five distances ranging from the road verge to 100 m into the adjacent forest stand. We analysed species composition, individual species response, a priori life-history traits response - life form, habitat preference and dispersal mode - and environmental indicator values in relation to road distance and stand age. Plant composition strongly differed between road verge and forest interior habitats. The main road effect extended less than 5 m into the forest stand. A third habitat was detected at the forest-road edge resulting from the road effect on light and soil conditions, and from edge-specific topography. Non-forest species were almost absent from the forest interior. In contrast, many bryophytes and several vascular plants kept away from the road. We identified a posteriori six species groups that better explained the variability of plant response profiles than a priori life-history traits. Plant response to road distance was also dependent on stand age: some species colonised from the road into the forest interior in young stands following regeneration cutting, while other species displayed the reverse pattern in adult stands once canopy closed above the forest road. Even if the depth of forest road effect measured in lowland managed stands was narrow, building of a new forest road has non-negligible effects on plant population dynamics. Forest managers should take into account the impacts of roads on biodiversity, since the expected intensification of silviculture in response to global changes is set to accentuate the effect of forest roads. We recommend further study on the role of dispersal by vehicles (i.e. agestochory) in road effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although it is well known that riparian zones can contribute strongly to between-habitat beta diversity, for most taxa it is not clear how far this 'zone' extends, and whether it corresponds to easily recognizable topographic features. Forty 200-m(2) plots were installed in a terra firme tropical forest to detect compositional variation in terrestrial herbs from the margins of small streams to the uplands. Plots were ordinated by their dissimilarity in species composition with non-metric multidimensional scaling. The riparian zone around streams was distinct in understorey herb composition from upland areas for about 100 m from the streams, or about 70 m asl in elevation, the exact distance depending on the size of the stream valley. However, the only assemblage that was almost completely distinct occurred as a narrow band a few metres wide along the streams. The rest of the riparian zone appears to represent an ecotone with continuous change, most of which occurs out to a distance of about half the width of the riparian zone as we defined it. Although riparian zones are legally protected in Brazil, they arc frequently degraded. The complex factors leading to zonation around streams need to be understood to effectively manage these areas.

AB Close correlations between specific leaf area (SLA) and relative growth rate (RGR) have been reported in many studies. However, theoretically, SLA by itself has small net positive effect on RGR because any increase in SLA inevitably causes a decrease in area-based leaf nitrogen concentration (LNCa), another RGR component. It was hypothesized that, for a correlation between SLA and RGR, SLA needs to be associated with specific nitrogen absorption rate of roots (SAR), which counteracts the negative effect of SLA on LNCa.
   Five trees and six herbs were grown under optimal conditions and relationships between SAR and RGR components were analyzed using a model based on balanced growth hypothesis.
   SLA varied 1.9-fold between species. Simulations predicted that, if SAR is not associated with SLA, this variation in SLA would cause a 47% decrease in LNCa along the SLA gradient, leading to a marginal net positive effect on RGR. In reality, SAR was positively related to SLA, showing a 3.9-fold variation, which largely compensated for the negative effect of SLA on LNCa. Consequently, LNCa values were almost constant across species and a positive SLA-RGR relationship was achieved.
   These results highlight the importance of leaf-root interactions in understanding interspecific differences in RGR.

AB Tropical forests contain the majority of extant plant diversity and their role as a cradle and/or museum of biodiversity is an important issue in our attempts to assess the long-term consequences of global climate change for terrestrial biomes. Highly diverse groups of liverworts are an often ignored but extremely common element in rainforests, and thus their evolution may shed light on the ecological robustness of rainforest biomes to climate fluctuations. We record a remarkable constant accumulation of diversity through time for the most species-rich family of liverworts, Lejeuneaceae, inferred by divergence time estimates. The observed pattern supports the recently developed concept of a dual role of the tropics as both a museum and a cradle of biodiversity.

AB Background and Aims In spatially heterogeneous environments, a trade-off between seedling survival and relative growth rate may promote the coexistence of plant species. In temperate forests, however, little support for this hypothesis has been found under field conditions, as compared with shade-house experiments. Performance trade-offs were examined over a large resource gradient in a temperate hardwood forest.
   Methods The relationship between seedling Survival and seedling relative growth rate in mass (RGR(M)) or height (RGR(H)) was examined at three levels of canopy cover (forest understorey, FU; small gap, SG; and large gap, LG) and at two microsites within each level of canopy cover (presence or absence of leaf litter) for five deciduous broad-leaved tree species with different seed sizes.
   Key Results Within each species, both RCRm(M) and RGR(H) usually increased with increasing light levels (in the order FU < SG < LG), whereas little difference was observed based on the presence or absence of litter. Seedling survival in FU was negatively correlated with both RGR(M) and RCRH in both LG and SG. The trade-off between high-light growth and low-light survival was more evident in the relationship with LG as compared with SG. An intraspecific trade-off between survival and RGR was observed along environmental gradients in Acer mono, whereas seedlings of Betula platyphylla var. japonica survived and grew better in LG.
   Conclusions The results presented here strongly support the idea of light gradient partitioning (i.e. species coexistence) in spatially heterogeneous light environments in temperate forests, and that further species diversity would be promoted by increased spatial heterogeneity. The intraspecific trade-off between survival and RGR in Acer suggests that it has broad habitat requirements, whereas Betula has narrow habitat requirements and specializes in high-light environments.

AB Frequent fire is a feature of the mesic Australian savannas, yet little is known about its effect on tree growth rates. Growth data are critical for the development of demographic models to understand the consequences of different land management regimes. We used generalized linear mixed effects models and information-theoretic multi-model inference to analyse annual diameter growth of adult trees (>= 5 cm diameter at breast height, DBH) and saplings (>= 1.5 m height and < 5 cm DBH) and height growth of juveniles (< 1.5 m height) in response to fire, tree size, stand basal area, annual rainfall, and for adult trees, the presence of the introduced Asian swamp buffalo (a potentially growth-limiting herbivore). The analysis was based on two medium-term datasets from natural eucalypt savanna in Kakadu National Park in the Australian monsoonal tropics. One dataset was based on a 7-year experiment examining the effect of buffalo removal during which three fires occurred, and the second was derived from a 4-year study in which three experimental fire treatments (annual early dry season fire, annual late dry season fire and no fire) were imposed. An unplanned, extremely severe fire burnt some of the previously unburnt trees in the final year of this latter experiment, so we considered it as an additional fire treatment. Despite high variance, there was strong evidence for differential effects of the fire treatments on tree growth, and these effects differed among the three size groups. Late and extreme fires resulted in a high proportion of individuals with negative DBH increments (due to burning or shedding of bark, and also to stems being killed and replaced by small stems), and decreased average DBH growth of saplings (-0.17 and -1.38 cm year(-1), respectively-cf. 0.22 cm year(-1) for no fire) and adult trees (0.01 and 0.03 cm year(-1), respectively-cf. 0.18 cm year(-1) for no fire). Early fires decreased DBH growth of saplings (0.11-cf. 0.22 cm year(-1) for no fire) but increased growth of adult trees (0.29-cf. 0.18 cm year(-1)). Height growth of juvenile trees was reduced by early fires (0.01-cf. 0.06 m year(-1) for no fire) but was increased by late fires (0.10 m year(-1)), probably because juveniles are physiologically active early in the dry season, but are effectively dormant in the late dry season. When stand basal area was high there was evidence of growth suppression in adults, saplings and juveniles. Growth of adult trees was lower in years with high rainfall and where buffalo were removed, possibly because of increased competition from ground layer vegetation. Our study casts doubt on the sustainability of the frequent, early dry season fires that have become a management goal in much of northern Australia. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Yasuni National Park and Biosphere Reserve in Ecuador's Amazon basin is home to the Huaorani and an area of high conservation value. As a result of oil development in the early 1990s, a road was constructed in the northern region of the Park. Three Huaorani communities have since been established in proximity to the road, two of them when the road was built, ten years prior to this study, and the third in a previously uninhabited area. This allowed for a natural experiment comparing harvest compositions across communities of different ages at one point in time. Harvest profiles suggest that the spider monkey Ateles belzebuth is facing local depletion near the two old communities and the howler monkey Alouatta seniculus may also be depleted near one of the old communities. That the two oldest communities still harvested a relatively high number of other vulnerable species is attributed to their use of the road to increase forest access. The spider monkey appears to be the first species to become depleted in persistently hunted areas.

   2 Using ecological and molecular analyses we found that its range is limited by the absence of efficient dispersal mechanisms rather than by habitat availability, or as a result of a recent bottleneck or of reproductive failure.
   3 Resprouts can take over the position of senesced plants, even in the absence of disturbance, allowing local persistence and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Long-term persistence and preferential outcrossing further favour relatively high levels of diversity (H-E = 0.542) despite a small effective population size (N-e = 21.6).
   4 We used eight life-history traits to assess if the E. hardeniana findings were valid across 258 local taxa. Current distribution patterns of rain forest species within a species-rich community were accounted for by linking two important components of community assembly theory: dispersal and niche assembly.
   5 The interaction of the seed-based dispersal dimension and resprouting potential best explains the current distribution of rare local taxa. Major dimensions of life-history trait variation were identified among local plant species, suggesting that a range of interacting traits contribute to a species' response to environmental variables and mitigate the influence of potentially adverse circumstances.
   6 The benefits of merging ecological and genetic approaches to interpret species distribution and population structure are applicable across a broader range of studies. Our findings highlight how currently constrained palaeo-endemic species with small populations in refugial habitats may retain the capacity to both persist and expand in response to changing circumstances and opportunities. This has important implications for species conservation, habitat management and reserve design.

AB A reliable characterization of community diversity and composition, necessary to allow inter-site comparisons and to monitor changes, is especially difficult to reach in speciose invertebrate communities. Spatial components of the sampling design (sampling interval, extent and grain) as well as temporal variations of species density affect the measures of diversity (species richness S, Buzas and Gibson's evenness E and Shannon's heterogeneity H). Our aim was to document the small-scale spatial distribution of leaf litter ants in a subtropical dry forest of the Argentinian Chaco and analyze how the community characterization was best achieved with a minimal sampling effort. The work was based on the recent standardized protocol for collecting ants of the leaf litter ("A.L.L.": 20 samples at intervals of 10 m). To evaluate the consistency of the sampling method in time and space, the selected site was first subject to a preliminary transect, then submitted after a 9-month interval to an 8-fold oversampling campaign (160 samples at interval of 1.25 m). Leaf litter ants were extracted from elementary 1 m(2) quadrats with Winkler apparatus. An increase in the number of samples collected increased S and decreased E but did not affect much H. The sampling interval and extent did not affect S and H beyond a distance of 10 m between samples. An increase of the sampling grain had a similar effect on S than a corresponding increase of the number of samples collected, but caused a proportionaly greater increase of H. The density of species m(-2) varied twofold after a 9-month interval; the effect on S could only be partially corrected by rarefaction. The measure of species numerical dominance was little affected by the season. A single standardized A.L.L. transect with Winkler samples collected <45% of the species present in the assemblage. All frequent species were included but their relative frequency was not always representative. A log series distribution of species occurrences was oberved. Fisher's alpha and Shannon's H were the most appropriate diversity indexes. The former was useful to rarefy or abundify S and the latter was robust against sample size effects. Both parametric and Soberon and Llorente extrapolation methods outperformed non-parametric methods and yielded a fair estimate of total species richness along the transect, a minimum value of S for the habitat sampled.

AB The pollinators of 29 ginger species representing 11 genera in relation to certain floral morphological characteristics in a mixed-dipterocarp forest in Borneo were investigated. Among the 29 species studied, eight were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae), 11 by medium-sized Amegilla bees (Anthophoridae), and ten by small halictid bees. These pollination guilds found in gingers in Sarawak are comparable to the pollination guilds of neotropical Zingiberales, i.e., hummingbird; and euglossine-bee-pollinated guilds. Canonical discriminant analysis revealed that there were significant correlations between floral morphology and pollination guilds and suggests the importance of plant-pollinator interactions in the evolution of floral morphology. Most species in the three guilds were separated on the plot by the first and second canonical variables. Spiderhunter-pollinated flowers had longer floral tubes, while Amegilla-pollinated flowers had wider lips than the others, which function as a platform for the pollinators. Pistils and stamens of halictid-pollinated flowers were smaller than the others. The fact that gingers with diverse morphologies in a forest with high species diversity were grouped into only three pollination guilds and that the pollinators themselves showed low species diversity suggests that many species of rare understory plants have evolved without segregating pollinators in each pollination guild.

   COAST; TRIMUSCULUS-COSTATUS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION
AB The Siphonariidae are regarded as a primitive family of basommatophoran pulmonate limpets which probably have a marine ancestry. They have a broad global distribution but are most abundant on rocky shores in lower latitudes of the Indo-Pacific, especially within the southern hemisphere. This review examines a number of aspects of the physiology, behaviour, ecology and reproduction of these pulmonates in relation to their intertidal existence.
   Despite limpets being poorly designed to minimize heat stress and desiccation, siphonariids are particularly abundant in warmer climates, unlike many prosobranch limpet taxa which decline towards the tropics. The success of siphonariids in lower latitudes, when compared with patellogastropods, does not appear to be due to greater temperature or desiccation tolerances, although important data from subtropical and tropical species are lacking. However, a number of physiological adaptations that may contribute to their successful occupation of lower latitudes are discussed including: a) efficient respiration in air and water; b) facultative metabolic rate depression; c) anaerobiosis; d) rapid re-hydration after water loss. Siphonariids are osmoconformers, but have a wide tolerance to hypo- and hyper-osmotic conditions. Such tolerance has enabled these limpets to exploit habitats (e.g. rock pools and estuaries) generally not utilized by patellogastropods.
   The behavioural adaptations of siphonariids also help them reduce the physical and biological stresses of the intertidal zone. These adaptations (with few exceptions) include rigid homing to a scar or crevice, and confining foraging activity to moist or humid conditions often when wave activity is minimal. High shore species tend to be active when exposed at night, whereas lower shore species are more active when awash. Foraging is adjusted both in duration and distance in relation to day/night and spring/neap cycles. Although the timing of foraging may also serve to minimize predation, nearly all siphonariids are unpalatable to predators, possessing multicellular epidermal glands that produce polypropionate chemicals. This ability to avoid the many predators of lower latitudes may be a major factor in explaining the success df siphonariids in these habitats.
   Siphonariids primarily feed on foliose macroalgae, cropping the algae but never removing them completely. On the whole they do not influence algal community structure in the same way as patellogastropods. Even though siphonariids and patellogastropods generally do not compete for the same food resource, on many temperate shores direct and indirect interactions between the two limpet taxa occurs. Because of their weaker radula, siphonariids are often out-competed, but never completely eliminated, by the patellogastropod fauna. There are, however, examples of siphonariids outcompeting the patellogastropod fauna. Siphonaria spp. can also interact with fissurellid gastropods, the outcomes of these interactions being variable. The grazing activities of Siphonaria may be crucial to the survival of other limpets as well as other intertidal invertebrates (e.g. barnacles). These are discussed.
   Like all pulmonates the Siphonariidae are hermaphrodites which have internal fertilization. Eggs are laid in egg capsules which are embedded in a protective gelatinous matrix. Ribbons of eggs are usually cemented to rocks within the intertidal, although in two species, pelagic egg ribbons are produced. Two reproductive strategies have evolved; most species produce numerous small eggs which hatch into planktotrophic larvae within seven days of being laid; several species deposit fewer, larger eggs which undergo direct development, crawling larvae emerging from the egg ribbons within 35 days. Both adaptive and phylogenetic hypotheses have been proposed to explain these two life history strategies and these are discussed. Whatever the reproductive strategy, most species studied have a seasonal pattern of reproduction with individuals laying more than one ribbon per season. Copulation and spawning are often linked to tidal and/or lunar cycles which are not only thought to provide the maximum time for egg Laying, but may also improve the chances of survival of the eggs and the larvae.

AB The large Saw-billed Hermit Ramphodon naevius and its foraging behaviour on a variety of ornithophilous flowers were studied at one site in the Atlantic rainforest in southeastern Brazil.  The flower assemblage visited by this endemic hermit throughout the year is composed mainly by epiphytes and herbs, Bromeliaceae and Heliconiaceae being the staple foodplants.  Most of the plant species present steady-state, long-tubed and high-reward flowers, and bloom sequentially.  The Saw-billed Hermit is a year-round resident and traplining forager, behaves aggressively over its feeding routes, and excludes conspecifics and other hummingbird species from its main flower sources.  This large hermit regularly visited and pollinated about 45% of the native ornithophilous plants at the study site, thus acting as the major pollinator on this flower assemblage.

AB Data on the ecology and diet of buffy sakis (Pithecia albicans) were obtained during a 20-month study in an entirely undisturbed terra firme forest in the upper Urucu river, Amazonas, Brazil. Groups of 3-7 sakis found in a 900-ha study plot used large home ranges (147-204 ha), which overlapped extensively with those of neighboring groups. Similar to other pitheciines, buffy sakis were primarily seed predators, relying heavily on young seeds of certain key plant families, such as the Sapotaceae and Leguminosae. Ripe fruits, ripe seeds, young leaves, flowers, and nectar were eaten to a lesser extent, Whether or not feeding, sakis spent most of their time in the canopy and subcanopy, a pattern similar to that of other southwestern Amazonian saki species, but sharply different from that of Guianan sakis (Pithecia pithecia), which use considerably lower levels of the forest. Comparisons are made between different Pithecia species to show whether and how P. albicans diverges ecologically from its congeners.   (C) 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB The Anthropocene presents formidable threats to freshwater ecosystems. Lakes are especially vulnerable and important at the same time. They cover only a small area worldwide but harbour high levels of biodiversity and contribute disproportionately to ecosystem services. Lakes differ with respect to their general type (e.g. land-locked, drainage, floodplain and large lakes) and position in the landscape (e.g. highlandversuslowland lakes), which contribute to the dynamics of these systems. Lakes should be generally viewed as 'meta-systems', whereby biodiversity is strongly affected by species dispersal, and ecosystem dynamics are contributed by the flow of matter and substances among locations in a broader waterscape context. Lake connectivity in the waterscape and position in the landscape determine the degree to which a lake is prone to invasion by non-native species and accumulation of harmful substances. Highly connected lakes low in the landscape accumulate nutrients and pollutants originating from ecosystems higher in the landscape. The monitoring and restoration of lake biodiversity and ecosystem services should consider the fact that a high degree of dynamism is present at local, regional and global scales. However, local and regional monitoring may be plagued by the unpredictability of ecological phenomena, hindering adaptive management of lakes. Although monitoring data are increasingly becoming available to study responses of lakes to global change, we still lack suitable integration of models for entire waterscapes. Research across disciplinary boundaries is needed to address the challenges that lakes face in the Anthropocene because they may play an increasingly important role in harbouring unique aquatic biota as well as providing ecosystem goods and services in the future.

TI Temporal variation in plant-pollinator networks from seasonal tropical

AB The temporal dynamics of plant phenology and pollinator abundance across seasons should influence the structure of plant-pollinator interaction networks. Nevertheless, such dynamics are seldom considered, especially for diverse tropical networks. Here, we evaluated the temporal variation of four plant-pollinator networks in two seasonal ecosystems in Central Brazil (Cerrado and Pantanal). Data were gathered on a monthly basis over 1year for each network. We characterized seasonal and temporal shifts in plant-pollinator interactions, using temporally discrete networks. We predicted that the greater floral availability in the rainy season would allow for finer partitioning of the floral niche by the pollinators, i.e. higher specialization patterns as previously described across large spatial gradients. Finally, we also evaluated how sampling restricted to peak flowering period may affect the characterization of the networks. Contrary to our expectations, we found that dry season networks, although characterized by lower floral resource richness and abundance, showed higher levels of network-wide interaction partitioning (complementary specialization and modularity). For nestedness, though, this between-seasons difference was not consistent. Reduced resource availability in the dry season may promote higher interspecific competition among pollinators leading to reduced niche overlap, thus explaining the increase in specialization. There were no consistent differences between seasons in species-level indices, indicating that higher network level specialization is an emergent property only seen when considering the entire network. However, bees presented higher values of specialization and species strength in relation to other groups such as flies and wasps, suggesting that some plant species frequently associated with bees are used only by this group. Our study also indicates that targeted data collection during peak flowering generates higher estimates of network specialization, possibly because species activity spans longer periods than the targeted time frame. Hence, depending on the period of data collection, different structural values for the networks of interactions may be found.Synthesis. Plant-pollinator networks from tropical environments have structural properties that vary according to seasons, which should be taken into account in the description of the complex systems of interactions between plants and their pollinators in these areas.

AB While community-weighted means of plant traits have been linked to mean environmental conditions at large scales, the drivers of trait variation within communities are not well understood. Local environmental heterogeneity ( such as microclimate variability), in addition to mean environmental conditions, may decrease the strength of environmental filtering and explain why communities support different amounts of trait variation. Here, we assess two hypotheses: first, that more heterogeneous local environments and second, that less extreme environments, should support a broader range of plant strategies and thus higher trait variation. We quantified drivers of trait variation across a range of environmental conditions and spatial scales ranging from sub-meter to tens of kilometers in montane and alpine plant communities. We found that, within communities, both environmental heterogeneity and environmental means are drivers of trait variation. However, the importance of each environmental factor varied depending on the trait. Our results indicate that larger-scale trait-climate linkages that hold across communities also apply at small spatial scales, suggesting that microclimate variation within communities is a key driver of community functional diversity. Microclimatic variation provides a potential mechanism for helping to maintain diversity in local communities and also suggests that small-scale environmental heterogeneity should be measured as a better predictor of functional diversity.

AB AimTo propose and compare priority sites for conservation and restoration of woody plants under diverse climate and land use scenarios, considering socio-economic costs, presence of protected areas and distribution of forest remnants.
   LocationThe Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil.
   MethodsWe used ecological niche modelling to estimate geographical distributions for 2,255 species under current and future climate scenarios, which we analysed in relation to spatially explicit land use projections, maps of forest remnants derived from remote sensing and socio-economic variables for each municipality within the Atlantic Forest region. We identified spatial priorities that complement the current network of protected areas under three different prioritization scenarios: (1) conservation of existing forest remnants only; (2) conservation of remnants followed by restoration of degraded habitat; and (3) unconstrained actions, in which management location is not defined a priori. We compared our results under different levels of land protection, with targets of 10%, 17% and 20% of the Atlantic Forest extent.
   ResultsCurrent forest remnants cover only 12% of the Atlantic Forest, so targets of 17% and 20% were achieved only through active restoration. Targets of 17% and 20% captured most species and represented on average 26%-34% of species' distributions. The spatial pattern of degraded habitats negatively affected representation of biodiversity and implied higher costs and reduced efficiency of planning. We did not observe major differences between conservation prioritizations based on contrasting climate change scenarios.
   Main conclusionsProtection of forest remnants alone will not suffice to safeguard woody plant species under climate and land use changes; therefore, restoration actions are urgently needed in the Atlantic Forest. With integrated management actions and multicriterion nationwide planning, reaching the 17% of land protection of Aichi biodiversity targets will constitute an important step towards protecting Atlantic Forest biodiversity.

AB Livestock play a key role in the climate change debate. As with crop-based agriculture, the sector is both a net greenhouse gas emitter and vulnerable to climate change. At the same time, it is an essential food source for millions of people worldwide, with other functions apart from food security such as savings and insurance. By comparison with crop-based agriculture, the interactions of livestock and climate change have been much less studied. The debate around livestock is confusing due to the coexistence of multiple livestock farming systems with differing functions for humans, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission profiles and different characteristics and boundary issues in their measurement, which are often pooled together. Consequently, the diversity of livestock farming systems and their functions to human systems are poorly represented and the role of the livestock sector in the climate change debate has not been adequately addressed. In this article, building upon the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC 5AR) findings, we review recent literature on livestock and climate change so as better to include this diversity in the adaptation and mitigation debate around livestock systems. For comparative purposes we use the same categories of managerial, technical, behavioral and policy-related action to organize both mitigation and adaptation options. We conclude that different livestock systems provide different functions to different human systems and require different strategies, so they cannot readily be pooled together. We also observe that, for the different livestock systems, several win-win strategies exist that effectively tackle both mitigation and adaptation options as well as food security.

ID ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; PAYMENTS; LIMITS; PROGRAMS
AB Green economy aims to use economic rationality and market mechanisms to mute the most ecologically damaging effects of globalized capitalism while reviving economic growth in the global North, fostering development in the South, and decoupling economic growth from environmental decline. An archetypal application of green economy is transnational trade in ecosystem services, including reduced emissions for deforestation and degradation (REDD+). By compensating developing countries for maintaining forests as carbon sinks, this approach is meant to transcend politics and circumvent conflicts over the responsibilities of industrialized and 'less-developed' countries that have stymied global climate policy. However, carbon-offset trading is unlikely to result in lower greenhouse gas emissions, much less combined conservation and development gains. The troubled record of payment for environmental services and other schemes or commodification of nature illustrates that living ecosocial systems do not fit the requirements of market contracts. Disputes over proto-REDD+ projects point to the dangers that REDD+ will disadvantage or dispossess rural communities and distract attention from underlying causes of forest and livelihood loss. Two decades of all-but-futile climate negotiations have shown that global warming cannot be managed by means of technocratic expertise nor dealt with separately from the politics of inequality and the paradox of economic growth. The deceptive promise of greening with growth can blind us to these realities. Counter-hegemonic discourses to growth-centered green economy under the headings of buen vivir, mainly in the global South, and degrowth, mainly in the global North, therefore merit attention.

AB Tropical biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions have become heavily eroded through habitat loss. Animal-mediated pollination is required in more than 94% of higher tropical plant species and 75% of the world's leading food crops, but it remains unclear if corridors avert deforestation-driven pollination breakdown in fragmented tropical landscapes. Here, we used manipulative resource experiments and field observations to show that corridors functionally connect neotropical forest fragments for forest-associated hummingbirds and increase pollen transfer. Further, corridors boosted forest-associated pollinator availability in fragments by 14.3 times compared with unconnected equivalents, increasing overall pollination success. Plants in patches without corridors showed pollination rates equal to bagged control flowers, indicating pollination failure in isolated fragments. This indicates, for the first time, that corridors benefit tropical forest ecosystems beyond boosting local species richness, by functionally connecting mutualistic network partners. We conclude that small-scale adjustments to landscape configuration safeguard native pollinators and associated pollination services in tropical forest landscapes.

AB Understanding causes of variation in multispecies assemblages along spatial environmental gradients is a long-standing research topic in ecology and biogeography. Ecological networks comprising interacting species of plants and pollinators are particularly suitable for testing effects of environmental gradients on the functional structure and specialization in multispecies assemblages. In this study, we investigated patterns in functional assemblage structure and specialization of hummingbirds at the individual and species level along a tropical elevational gradient. We mist-netted hummingbirds at three elevations in Costa Rica in seven temporally distinct sampling periods and used the pollen carried by hummingbird individuals to construct plant-hummingbird networks at each elevation. We measured four functional traits of hummingbird species and quantified different metrics of functional community structure. We tested the effect of elevation on functional metrics of hummingbird assemblages and specialization within the networks, employing the variability across sampling periods and hummingbird species to compare the respective metrics among elevations. Hummingbird species and individuals were more specialized at low and mid elevations than at the highest elevation. This pattern corresponded to a more even and over-dispersed assemblage structure at the lower elevations throughout the year and suggests a high level of floral resource partitioning in functionally diversified communities. In contrast, an uneven and clustered functional structure of the highland assemblage across all sampling periods suggests that this assemblage was structured by environmental filtering and by niche expansion of hummingbird individuals and species at this elevation. We conclude that high degrees of specialization on specific floral resources might be crucial for the coexistence of hummingbird species in diversified lowland communities. Spatial variation in animal resource use may be an important crucial driver of spatial patterns in the functional structure of diversified species assemblages also in other types of ecological networks.

AB Copulatory wounding (CW) is widespread in the animal kingdom, but likely underreported because of its cryptic nature. We use four case studies (Drosophila flies, Siphopteron slugs, Cimex bugs, and Callosobruchus beetles) to show that CW entails physiological and life-history costs, but can evolve into a routine mating strategy that, in some species, involves insemination through the wound. Although interspecific variation in CW is documented, few data exist on intraspecific and none on individual differences. Although defensive mechanisms evolve in the wound recipient, our review also indicates that mating costs in species with CW are slightly higher than in other species. Whether such costs are dose-or frequency-dependent, and whether defense occurs as resistance or tolerance, decisively affects the evolutionary outcome. In addition to sexual conflict, CW may also become a model system for reproductive isolation. In this context, we put forward a number of predictions, including (1) occasional CW is more costly than routine CW, (2) CW is more costly in between-than within-population matings, and (3) in the presence of CW, selection may favor the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases if they induce resource allocation. Finally, we outline, and briefly discuss, several medical implications of CW in humans.

AB Forecasting the response of species and communities to environmental change is a priority for multiple disciplines in the natural sciences. In looking toward the future, much can be learned from examining faunal response under past episodes of environmental change. Typically, retrospective approaches are limited to one spatial and temporal scale. Here, we illustrate how integrating across spatiotemporal scales can provide powerful insights into faunal response, and can inform conservation and management. To do this we compare paleontological and neontological studies on the small mammal fauna of the Great Basin. Small mammal species and their assemblages have long been recognized as indicators of ecological change and ecosystem health. We use fossil data from two long-term owl roosts to reconstruct patterns of richness and the apportioning of abundance among functional groups across multiple episodes of warming during the Holocene (last 10,000 years). We then use these findings as a climate-only baseline against which to compare changes in richness and abundance in 2 independent mountain ranges over the past century. While the past century has been marked by climate warming, the modern day Great Basin landscape also has been subject to intense human land-use practices and the introduction of nonnative plant species. Our contrast highlights that for Great Basin small mammals, modern-day land-use practices are modifying climate-based expectations.

AB We analyzed the effects of climate and drought on radial growth using dendrochronology in seven deciduous tree species coexisting in a Bolivian tropical dry forest subjected to seasonal drought. Precipitation, temperature and a multiscalar drought index were related to tree-ring width data at different time-scales (from one month to 42 years). Precipitation affected positively tree growth in all species, mainly during the wet season, while temperature affected it negatively in five species. Tree growth responses to precipitation and temperature were species-specific and peaked at short-time scales, specifically from one to nine months. At inter-annual scales tree growth always responded positively to less dry conditions at short-time scales, particularly from two to seven months, and also at long-time scales from six to 30 years. Tree growth was mainly sensitive to multi-annual droughts and such sensitivity differed among species. Our findings suggest that tree species of the studied tropical dry forest are predominantly sensitive in terms of growth reduction to long-lasting droughts. This time-dependency of growth responses to drought should be explicitly considered as an additional constraint of the community dynamics in evaluations of the future responses of tropical dry forests to climate warming.

AB The recent history of biodiversity conservation practice has been characterised by the increasing use of market-based instruments. In seeking to understand this development, an emerging body of critical social science research tends to characterise conservationists as being ideologically in favour of markets in conservation. An alternative possibility is that conservationists pursue market solutions as a pragmatic response to prevailing political and economic circumstances. In this paper we seek to establish empirically what a sample of conservation professionals actually think about markets in conservation. We used Q-methodology, a tool for analysing structure and form within respondents' subjective positions. The results show that our respondents are circumspect about the growing use of markets in conservation. We identify two dominant discourses that we label 'outcome focused enthusiasm and 'ideological scepticism'. Neither of these perspectives indicates strong, or uncritical, support for market approaches, and the views of our respondents appear to recognise the limitations of markets both in theory and practice. While there is some difference in views between the two dominant discourses that we document in this paper, there is considerable convergence towards a position that we label 'cautious pragmatism'. We conclude that those studying conservation need to be cautious about over-generalising the perspectives and values held by conservation professionals, as there appears to be far less consensus about the adoption of market-led approaches in this sector than has been suggested. Further research could investigate the drivers of pro-market behaviour at the organisational level given the evident personal scepticism of our respondents. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Documenting patterns of published studies on the biodiversity of megadiverse countries can offer valuable insights on global biodiversity knowledge. Here, I present results from a bibliometric analysis of 5,264 indexed publications on biodiversity in Colombia published during the period 1990-2011 and gathered by searching the Web of Knowledge database. I classified studies into six overlapping subjects: taxa lists, new taxa, new records, conservation, genetic diversity, and other. Publications were also classified by geographic location and the taxonomic group studied. I found variation in the number of studies per year, which presented a long-term trend of increasing volume. The 31 continental departments of Colombia and both the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans were represented in the studies, which included 98 taxonomic classes from 47 phyla. However, there were strong biases in taxonomic, geographic, and subject coverage. For instance, 75 % of studies focused on animals; and the Atlantic Ocean showed the highest number of studies, followed by Antioquia and Valle del Cauca departments. Genetic diversity and conservation were the least-studied subjects. I also found that Colombian researchers and Colombian institutions have played an important role in documenting the country's outstanding biodiversity. However, Colombian biologists still prefer to publish in domestic or Latin American journals, which are mainly regional and have low international visibility. The patterns I present here can have important implications for optimizing and guiding research on Colombian biodiversity, and the paper concludes with some recommendations.

AB The combined use of high technology instruments and appropriate techniques for discriminating tree species is necessary to improve the biodiversity inventory system in tropical countries. The Fourier-Transform Near-Infrared (FT-NIR) Leaf Spectroscopy appears to be a promising tool for plant species discrimination. In this study, we demonstrate an outstanding performance of FT-NIR, extracted from dried whole leaves, to discriminate closely related species of Eschweilera and Corythophora, Lecythidaceae, a major component of Amazonian forests. We obtained 36 spectral readings, from the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of dried leaves, for 159 individuals representing 10 species. Each spectrum consisted of 1557 FT-NIR absorbance values. We compared the rate of correct specimen (individual tree) identification to species for different datasets and discriminant models, in which individual spectrum consisted of different combinations as to the number of variables (all, stepwise selected), different number of reads per specimen (all reads, adaxial, abaxial, randomly selected), and discriminant models (cross-validation, test set validation). The best results indicated 99.4% of correct specimen identification when we used the average of all 36 spectral readings per specimen and stepwise selected variables. The lowest rate was on average 96.6% when a single spectral reading was used per individual tree (randomly sampled over 100 replicates). Overall, the rate of correct species discrimination was always high and insensible to variable selection, to the different datasets, and to the two major validation models we used. These Species Spectral Signature (SSS) provided better results than current DNA barcoding for plant identification in tropical forests, and represents a fast, low-cost sampling technique. Although further tests are required to assess the potential of FT-NIR spectroscopy for plant identification at broader geographical and phylogenetic scales, the results presented in this paper indicate that SSS extracted from herbarium specimens can be a powerful reference to identify specimens, even when lacking reproductive structures, an so of particular interest for forest inventory and management.

AB Aim Management practices in the landscape matrix can have significant effects on the spatial distribution of animals within adjacent protected areas. This has been well established in agricultural and forested areas, but less is known about how management of the suburban matrix affects adjacent reserves. We argue that it is critically important to understand the impact of suburban management on reserves, as flawed planning decisions can have negative conservation outcomes and waste limited resources. Location Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Methods We examined bird distribution patterns in suburbs and adjacent reserves to the effects of two suburban management practices: (1) street tree planting and (2) boundary design. We focused on three groups of birds with known responses to urbanization: native urban-intolerant species (native avoiders), native urban-tolerant species (native adapters) and exotic urban-tolerant species (exotic adapters). Results We found that suburbs with 30% native (Eucalyptus) street trees and reserves adjacent to these suburbs had significantly higher bird species richness, native adapter species richness and probability of reporting exotic adapters than those with exotic trees. The type of street trees, however, did not affect the probability of reporting native avoiders. These species were more likely to be reported when habitat complexity was high. Only native adapters responded to boundary design, with higher species richness when the boundary type was a local or unsealed road as opposed to an arterial road. Main conclusions Native street trees provide foraging resources for birds that would be reduced or absent in exotic streetscapes, enabling native streetscapes to support a rich community of birds. Furthermore, native streetscapes increase bird richness and diversity in adjacent reserves. This result has important conservation implications for suburb and reserve management practices. Our study provides evidence that the establishment and retention of native suburban streetscapes is an important management strategy for improved bird conservation.

AB In arid and semi-arid regions, pioneer organisms form complex communities that penetrate the upper millimetres of the bare substrate, creating biological soil crusts (BSC). These thin crusts play a vital role in whole ecosystem functioning because they enrich bare surfaces with organic matter, initiate biogeochemical cycling of elements, modify hydrological cycles, etc., thus enabling the ground to be colonized by vascular plants. Various hydrolase enzymes involved in the carbon (cellulase, beta-glucosidase and invertase activities), nitrogen (casein-protease and BAA-protease activities) and phosphorus (alkaline phosphomonoesterase activity) cycles were studied at three levels (crust, middle and deep layers) of three types of BSCs from the Tabernas Desert (SE Spain), representing an ecological gradient ranging from crusts predominated by cyanobacteria to crusts predominated by lichens (Diploschistes diacapsis, Lepraria crassissima). All enzyme activities were higher in all layers of all BSCs than in the bare substrate. The enzymes that hydrolyze low molecular weight substrates were more active than those that hydrolyze high molecular weight substrates (cellulase, casein-protease), highlighting the pioneering characteristics of the BSCs. The hydrolytic capacity developed in parallel to that of ecological succession, and the BSCs in which enzyme activity was highest were those under L crassissima. The enzyme activity per unit of total organic C was extremely high: the highest values occurred in the BSCs formed by cyanobacteria and the lowest in those formed by lichens, which indicates the fundamental role that the primary colonizers (cyanobacteria) play in enriching the geological substrate with enzymes that enable degradation of organic remains and the establishment of more developed BSCs. The results of the study combine information on different enzyme activities and provide a clear vision of how biogeochemical cycles are established in BSCs, thus confirming the usefulness of enzyme assays as key tools for examining the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function in biological soil crusts.

AB Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) applied to agricultural systems, such as tropical rangelands, seeks to provide multiple services while sustaining food production. However, there is considerable debate regarding the effectiveness of PES programs for changing farmer behavior and enhancing conservation. We interviewed 101 cattle farmers in Costa Rica following the Regional Integrated Silvopastoral Approaches to Ecosystem Management Project (RISEMP) PES pilot (2002-2008). We evaluated adoption of silvopastoral conservation practices-reintroducing trees and shrubs into permanent pastures that provide varying proportions of public and private benefits; we estimated influence of PES, technical assistance (e.g., farmer training) and information sharing on stimulating their adoption. Our analysis included evaluation of information sharing pathways and accounted for key farm capital characteristics. We found that technical assistance associated with PES had a positive influence on adoption rates, particularly for practices with private benefits of improving rangeland productivity. PES payments alone had the most detectable, positive influence on the adoption of only one type of practice, multistrata live fences, which primarily provides public goods such as biodiversity habitat and carbon sequestration, but are perceived by many farmers to reduce rangeland productivity. Farmers accessed information about management practices through both social and institutional sources. While the RISEMP pilot focused on institutional information sources and technical assistance, future policy design should also include social information networks and consider how farmer-to-farmer communication influences conservation practice adoption.

AB Toucans (Ramphastidae) are highly frugivorous, widespread throughout the Neotropics, and travel long distances, thus likely providing dispersal for many tropical trees. Despite being large conspicuous members of the canopy and subcanopy bird community, their movement ecology has been little studied. To understand how these frugivores move through a lowland tropical forest, I tracked the movements of Ramphastos tucanus (White-throated Toucan), Ramphastos vitellinus (Channel-billed Toucan), and Pteroglossus pluricinctus (Many-banded Aracari) in Yasuni National Park, Ecuador. The objectives of this study were to use radiotelemetry to estimate toucan home ranges, movement patterns, and potential seed dispersal distances. Using canopy nets, a total of 20 P. pluricinctus and three Ramphastos toucans were captured, radio-tagged, and tracked over a 4-yr period from 2001 to 2005. Average home range sizes were 191 and 86 ha for P. pluricinctus and Ramphastos toucans, respectively. The maximum travel distance in a single 30-min tracking interval was 3665 m for P. pluricinctus and 3027 m for Ramphastos. Estimated dispersal distances of medium-sized seeds ranged from 269 to 449 m. Large home range size and long-distance movements indicate that toucans likely disperse seeds over a scale of hundreds of meters. This study is the first to estimate home range size of any toucan species in intact closed-canopy forests.

AB Life-history traits of invasive exotic plants are typically considered to be exceptional vis-a-vis native species. In particular, hyper-fecundity and long range dispersal are regarded as invasive traits, but direct comparisons with native species are needed to identify the life-history stages behind invasiveness. Until recently, this task was particularly problematic in forests as tree fecundity and dispersal were difficult to characterize in closed stands. We used inverse modelling to parameterize fecundity, seed dispersal and seedling dispersion functions for two exotic and eight native tree species in closed-canopy forests in Connecticut, USA. Interannual variation in seed production was dramatic for all species, with complete seed crop failures in at least one year for six native species. However, the average per capita seed production of the exotic Ailanthus altissima was extraordinary: > 40 times higher than the next highest species. Seed production of the shade tolerant exotic Acer platanoides was average, but much higher than the native shade tolerant species, and the density of its established seedlings (>= 3 years) was higher than any other species. Overall, the data supported a model in which adults of native and exotic species must reach a minimum size before seed production occurred. Once reached, the relationship between tree diameter and seed production was fairly flat for seven species, including both exotics. Seed dispersal was highly localized and usually showed a steep decline with increasing distance from parent trees: only Ailanthus altissima and Fraxinus americana had mean dispersal distances > 10 m. Janzen-Connell patterns were clearly evident for both native and exotic species, as the mode and mean dispersion distance of seedlings were further from potential parent trees than seeds. The comparable intensity of Janzen-Connell effects between native and exotic species suggests that the enemy escape hypothesis alone cannot explain the invasiveness of these exotics. Our study confirms the general importance of colonization processes in invasions, yet demonstrates how invasiveness can occur via divergent colonization strategies. Dispersal limitation of Acer platanoides and recruitment limitation of Ailanthus altissima will likely constitute some limit on their invasiveness in closed-canopy forests.

AB This study examined relationships between foliar morphology and gas exchange characteristics as they vary with height within and among crowns of Sequoia sempervirens D. Don trees ranging from 29 to 113 m in height. Shoot mass: area (SMA) ratio increased with height and was less responsive to changes in light availability as height increased, suggesting a transition from light to water relations as the primary determinant of morphology with increasing height. Mass-based rates of maximum photosynthesis (A(max,m)), standardized photosynthesis (A(std,m)) and internal CO2 conductance (g(i,m)) decreased with height and SMA, while the light compensation point, light saturation point, and mass and area-based rates of dark respiration (R-m) increased with height and SMA. Among foliage from different heights, much of the variation in standardized photosynthesis was explained by variation in g(i), consistent with increasing limitation of photosynthesis by internal conductance in foliage with higher SMA. The syndrome of lower internal and stomatal conductance to CO2 and higher respiration may contribute to reductions in upper crown growth efficiency with increasing height in S. sempervirens trees.

AB Habitat fragmentation and deforestation are thought to disrupt host-parasite interactions and increase the risk of epizootic outbreaks in wild vertebrates. A total of 220 individuals from three species of African rain-forest bird (Andropadus latirostris, Andropadus virens, Cyanomitra obscura), captured in two pristine and two agroforests in Cameroon. were screened for the presence of avian haemosporidian parasites (species of Plasmodium and Haemwoproteus) to test whether habitat differences were associated with differences in the prevalence of infectious diseases in natural populations. Thirteen mitochondrial lineages, including 11 Plasmodium and two Haemoproteus lineages were identified. Whereas levels of Haemoproteus spp. infections were too low to permit analysis, the prevalence of infections with Plasmodium spp. reached significantly greater levels in undisturbed mature forests. Importantly however, the significant association between forest type and parasite prevalence was independent of host density effects, suggesting that the association did not reflect changes in host species composition and abundance between forest types. Our results illustrate how characterizing land-cover differences, and hence changes, may be a prerequisite to understanding and predicting patterns of parasite infections in natural populations of rain-forest birds.

AB Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) is likely to be central to a post-Kyoto climate change mitigation agreement. As such, identifying conditions and factors that will shape the success or failure of a reduced deforestation scheme will provide important insights for policy planning. Given that protected areas (PAs) are a cornerstone in forest conservation, we draw on interviews and secondary data to analyze the effects of available PA resources, governance ability, the level of community involvement, and provincial deforestation rates on land-cover change in nine PAs in Panama. Our results illustrate that coupling surveillance measures with greater funding and strong governance are paramount to reducing deforestation. Alone, however, these factors are insufficient for forest protection. We argue that conservation approaches that complement effective Surveillance with community participation and equitable benefit sharing will address the wider issues of leakage and permanence.

AB Forest change is of great concern for land use decision makers and conservation communities. Quantitative and spatial forest change information is critical for addressing many pressing issues, including global climate change, carbon budgets, and sustainability. In this study, our analysis focuses on the differences in geospatial patterns and their changes between federal forests and nonfederal forests in Alabama over the time period 1987-2005, by interpreting 163 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes using a vegetation change tracker (VCT) model. Our analysis revealed that for the most part of 1990 s and between 2000 and 2005, Alabama lost about 2% of its forest on an annual basis due to disturbances, but much of the losses were balanced by forest regeneration from previous disturbances. The disturbance maps revealed that federal forests were reasonably well protected, with the fragmentation remaining relatively stable over time. In contrast, nonfederal forests, which are predominant in area share (about 95%), were heavily disturbed, clearly demonstrating decreasing levels of fragmentation during the time period 1987-1993 giving way to a subsequent accelerating fragmentation during the time period 1994-2005. Additionally, the identification of the statistical relationships between forest fragmentation status and forest loss rate and forest net change rate in relation to land ownership implied the distinct differences in forest cutting rate and cutting patterns between federal forests and nonfederal forests. The forest spatial change information derived from the model has provided valuable insights regarding regional forest management practices and disturbance regimes. which are closely associated with regional economics and environmental concerns.

AB This research investigates spatial configuration changes of five forest types and introduces uncommon exploration of urban changes in Mount Lebanon. A forest map of 1965 and satellite images of Landsat TM (1987) and Spot 5 (2003) were used. Forest area has reduced by 7%, having low annual deforestation rate (< 1%). Oak, cedar and cypress forests increased from 13% to 15%, 0.8% to 1% and 0% to 0.1% respectively; while pine and juniper forests decreased from 1 % to 0.8% and 12% to 3% respectively. Grassland covered 20% of the original forest area followed by agriculture and urban. Forest patches were investigated in each 100 m distance from the edge of the old forests. Regenerated oaks were found within the first 100 m. Pine and cedar forests appeared at the 400 m distance. Urban settlements showed 4 m yr(-1) moving progress toward forest patches. Landscape indices demonstrated increase in the number of forest patches (from 169 to 432) and in the mean proximity index (from 78.29 to 225.15) and decrease in mean patch area (from 219 to 70 ha) and largest patch index (from 15.45 to 10.32). The observed trends revealed major deforestation and fragmentation in 1965-1987, followed by a lesser deforestation tendency in 1987-2003. Each forest type behaves differently to deforestation and therefore requires special management practices. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We evaluated the potential of different types of urban green spaces for conservation of ground-dwelling ants. The study area, which included 12 public squares, two urban parks, and three natural reserves, is within the highly threatened Cerrado biome of central Brazil. We compared ant species richness and composition among the different types of urban green spaces, and evaluated how ant communities are affected by the structural characteristics of these spaces. The results indicate that public squares in commercial areas presented the least conservation value given the predominance of exotic ant species (mostly Pheidole megacephala). Public squares in residential areas ranked second, given the relative scarcity of exotic species and the greater richness of native species in these locations compared to those in more urbanized areas. The greatest conservation value was achieved by urban parks, which supported the greatest number of native species and were apparently free of exotic species. The closer proximity of urban parks to other natural areas and the presence of native vegetation within the boundaries of those parks appear to be key characteristics for the existence and maintenance of a relatively diverse ant fauna.

AB Considering the floodplain landscape as a mosaic of habitat patches at different successional stages is useful for understanding (1) the processes associated with individual floods and (2) the legacy of flood history. Here, we investigate the applicability of the mosaic model to opportunistic ant species inhabiting the floodplain. Ground-active ant assemblages in river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) floodplain forest in south-eastern Australia were sampled before and for two years after a major flood in 2000-2001 at 24 sites with different inundation histories. Despite the mobility and opportunistic life history traits of floodplain ants, flood history appeared to impose a persistent mosaic structure on ant assemblages. Increasing duration of inundation of the forest floor was associated with decreasing species richness. beta-diversity was low, with the ant species at the most inundation-prone sites being a subset of those at drier sites. Less extensive flooding occurred in 2002-2003, enabling the consistency of short-term responses to inundation to be assessed. Flooding acts as a resetting mechanism, creating a characteristic ant assemblage. After floodwaters receded, there was little evidence of convergence in the structure of ant assemblages through time between sites flooded for different durations. The persistence of dissimilarities in ant assemblages suggests that succession towards terrestrialization was either not occurring or that it was operating at a rate that was too slow to be detected.

AB In uneven-aged ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Mirbel) Franco) stands managed by individual tree selection, the recruitment of new sapling cohorts necessary to sustain structure and composition is generally assumed to occur within canopy openings created by harvest. However, few studies have examined the spatial patterns of new regeneration in relation to reserve trees in the overstory in this forest type. In this study, we analyzed the spatial distributions and associations between saplings and overstory trees using univariate and bivariate transformations of Ripley's L-functions. Furthermore, we introduced a ratio-based index to quantify the strength of bivariate spatial associations, which allowed us to further evaluate potential causes for the observed patterns. We found that saplings of both ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir established predominantly in clumps, and that saplings of the two species generally had a positive association with one another at short scale (up to 5 m). We found no evidence to suggest that saplings of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir occupied separate spatial locations in these stands. We also found mixed results for bivariate associations between saplings of both species and overstory trees, where both positive and negative spatial associations occurred depending on the putative moisture level of plots indicated by habitat type group. The strength of positive spatial association between saplings and medium-sized overstory trees appeared to decrease as plot moisture-level increased, suggesting that sapling establishment and survival might be facilitated by shading on moisture-limited sites.

AB Here, we tested two hypotheses: shading increases light interception efficiency (LIE) of broadleaved tree seedlings, and shade-tolerant species exhibit larger LIEs than do shade-intolerant ones. The impact of seedling size was taken into account to detect potential size-independent effects on LIE. LIE was defined as the ratio of mean light intercepted by leaves to light intercepted by a horizontal surface of equal area.
   Seedlings from five species differing in shade tolerance (Acer saccharum, Betula alleghaniensis, A. pseudoplatanus, B. pendula, Fagus sylvatica) were grown under neutral shading nets providing 36, 16 and 4% of external irradiance. Seedlings (1- and 2-year-old) were three-dimensionally digitized, allowing calculation of LIE.
   Shading induced dramatic reduction in total leaf area, which was lowest in shade-tolerant species in all irradiance regimes. Irradiance reduced LIE through increasing leaf overlap with increasing leaf area. There was very little evidence of significant size-independent plasticity of LIE.
   No relationship was found between the known shade tolerance of species and LIE at equivalent size and irradiance.

AB The amount of solar radiation absorbed by an organism is a function of the intensity of the radiation and the area of the organism exposed to the source of the radiation. Since the prosobranch gastropod Echinolittorina peruviana is longer than it is wide, its areas of the lateral sides are approximately twice as large a's the. areas of the frontal and dorsal faces. We quantified the orientation of the intertidal prosobranch E peruviana with respect to the position of the sun and solar heat gain in the different orientations. In the field, 80.9% of the E. peruviana monitored on sunny summer days tended to face the sun frontally or dorsally while only 19.1% faced the sun with the larger lateral sides. On overcast sum mer or on winter days, this trend Was not observed. We then show that the body temperature of individuals increases more rapidly and reaches higher equilibriums when the lateral sides are facing the sun than when they face the sun with either of the smaller frontal or dorsal sides. These results therefore show that the orientation behavior of E. peruviana is thermoregulatory and that it permits the organisms to maintain lower temperatures on hot summer days.

AB The impacts of forest fragmentation on the pteridophyte communities of the Una region of Bahia, Brazil, were investigated by comparing species richness and ensemble diversity among areas of large forest fragments (> 900 ha), small forest fragments (< 100 ha), and landscape matrix. We inventoried the pteridophytes below 1 m in height in interiors of small fragments, interiors of large fragments (control areas), edges of fragments, edges of continuous forest, capoeiras (initial stages of forest regeneration) and cabrucas (cocoa plantations). All ferns were collected following the plot method (plots of 120x10 m, each). Sampling units were established in the six main ecotypes of the Una region. These units were allocated within three sampling blocks of 5 per 5 km, which were chosen in order to include the largest forest patches that still remain. Results suggest that fragmentation has a negative impact on species richness at the matrix and the edges of forest remnants. A similar negative matrix end edge effect is reported for diversity of those sites measured by the alpha Log-series Index. However, small forest fragments have pteridophyte species richness and diversity rates similar to large ones so they should be considered of utmost importance to the conservation of forest-related species in the region.

AB Habitat fragmentation is a leading cause of extinction, with effects that may be particularly pronounced in tropical ecosystems. However, little is known regarding the demographic mechanisms underlying changes in abundance in fragmented landscapes. Using six years of demographic data collected from > 6600 individuals of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata, we calculated population growth rate (lambda) in experimentally isolated 10-ha forest fragments, 1-ha forest fragments, and continuous forest. We then used life-table response experiment analyses to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for observed differences in lambda. On average, lambda approximate to 1.05 in continuous forest, while lambda approximate to 1 in both 1-ha and 10-ha fragments. However, while the differences in X between 10-ha fragments and continuous forest were largely attributable to the negative contribution of stage-specific fertility rates, reduced lambda in 1-ha fragments was due to both reductions in reproductive rates and changes in the rate of plant growth. Our results show that similar reductions in lambda in fragments of different sizes can be driven by distinct demographic mechanisms. Without comprehensive demographic data, attempts to mitigate the decline of populations in fragmented landscapes could be unsuccessful because they might be focusing on inappropriate demographic targets.

AB Little is known about the diversity of tropical animal communities in recently fire-affected environments. Here we assessed species richness, evenness, and community similarity of butterflies and odonates in landscapes located in unburned isolates and burned areas in a habitat mosaic that was severely affected by the 1997/98 ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) event in east Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. In addition related community similarity to variation in geographic distance between sampling sites and the habitat/vegetation structure Species richness and evenness differed significantly among landscapes but there was no congruence between both taxa. The species richness of butterflies was, for example, highest in sites located in a very large unburned isolate whereas odonate species richness was highest in sites located in a small unburned isolate and once-burned forest. We also found substantial variation in the habitat/vegetation structure among landscapes but this was mainly due to variation between unburned and burned landscapes and variation among burned landscapes.
   Both distance and environment (habitat/vegetation) contributed substantially to explaining variation in the community similarity (beta diversity) of both taxa. The contribution of the environment was, however, mainly due to variation between unburned and burned landscapes, which contained very different assemblages of both taxa. Sites located in the burned forest contained assemblages that were intermediate between assemblages from sites in unburned forest and sites from a highly degraded slash-and-burn area indicating that the burned forest was probably recolonised by species from these disparate environments. We, furthermore, note that in contrast to species richness (alpha diversity) the patterns of community similarity (beta diversity) were highly congruent between both taxa. These results indicate that community-wide multivariate measures of beta diversity are more consistent among taxa and more reliable indicators of disturbance, such as ENSO-induced burning, than univariate measures.

AB Arthropods were monitored by local parataxonomists at 12 sites of increasing anthropogenic disturbance (old and young secondary forests, savanna and cultivated gardens) at Gamba, Gabon. We report on the discriminatory power of different data sets with regard to the classification of sites along the disturbance gradient, using preliminary data accounting for 13 surveys and 142425 arthropods collected by Malaise, pitfall and yellow-pan traps. We compared the performance of different data sets. These were based upon ordinal, familial and guild composition, or upon 22 target taxa sorted to morphospecies and either considered in toto or grouped within different functional guilds. Finally we evaluated 'predictor sets' made up of a few families or other target taxa, selected on the basis of their indicator value index. Although the discriminatory power of data sets based on ordinal categories and guilds was low, that of target taxa belonging to chewers, parasitoids and predators was much higher. The data sets that best discriminated among sites of differing degrees of disturbance were the restricted sets of indicator families and target taxa. This validates the concept of predictor sets for species-rich tropical systems. Including or excluding rare taxa in the analyses did not alter these conclusions. We conclude that calibration studies similar to ours are needed elsewhere in the tropics and that this strategy will allow to devise a representative and efficient biotic index for the biological monitoring of terrestrial arthropod assemblages in the tropics.

AB Given current accelerated trends of tropical land conversion, forest fragments are being incorporated into many conservation programs. For investing in fragments to be a viable conservation strategy, forest fragments must maintain their ecological integrity over the long term. Based on fieldwork in 22 forest fragments in the crater lakes region of western Uganda and in the continuous forest of Kibale National Park, we examined (1) seed predation on experimentally dispersed seeds, (2) abundance and composition of the dung beetle community that may play a major role in removing seeds from sites of high seed predation, and (3) compared the fragments' seedling community composition to adult tree community composition and the seedling community in continuous forest. First, the rate of seed removal at experimental stations was lower in forest fragments (85% remaining after 1 day) than at stations in the continuous forest (79% remaining) and the probability of stations being discovered by seed predators was lower in fragments (23%) than in the intact forest (41%). Second, there was a 62 percent decline in fragment dung beetle abundance. The magnitude of this decline varied among dung beetle guilds that process dung and seeds in different fashions. The abundance of large rollers that move large seeds away from sites of defecation did not differ, but medium and smaller rollers and burying beetles that process small and medium-sized seeds were less common in the fragments than in the intact forest. Finally, we compared the seedling community composition relative to adult tree community composition by identifying all adult trees in each fragment and by sampling the composition of the seedling community. We found some evidence to suggest that there was movement of seeds among forest fragments by large-bodied dispersers, particularly chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and hornbills (Ceratogymna subcylindricus).

AB Collection of plants and seeds from wild populations threatens a large number of cycad species. We investigated to what extent individual life history stages contribute to population growth (lambda) and compared two species with major differences in life histories in the African genus Encephalartos: Encephalartos cycadifolius, a highly persistent grassland species that resprouts after fire, and Encephalartos villosus, a relatively fast growing, non-sprouting forest species. Several harvesting scenarios impacting different sized individuals were simulated to determine the sensitivity of the two functional types to harvesting. In both species lambda was most sensitive to changes in abundance of adult plants. The harvesting of seeds had minimal impact on population growth rates, whereas harvesting of adult plants led to rapid population decline. This response from two very different functional types suggests that the conservation of adult plants is critical for all cycad species. Despite similar responses to adult mortality, the two species had substantially different population growth rates. This determined recovery time after harvesting of adult individuals. Encephalartos cycadifolius is typical of highly persistent plant species associated with low levels of recruitment and unable to recover from even small losses of adults within a reasonable conservation time frame (<100 years). Our results suggest that the ability to recover from loss of individuals is an important factor that should be considered when assessing the vulnerability of wild populations to threats.

AB Currently biological invasions are considered one of the world's most serious conservation problems. Ligustrum lucidum is the most abundant exotic tree in secondary forest patches of montane forests of NW Argentina. We studied the determinants of success of the early stages of its life cycle in distinct habitat types, with the hope of identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited to control the invasion. Seed arrival, germination, seedling recruitment and survival, and sapling growth were studied in edges, gaps and forest interior. Seed arrival was also assessed under perches and in open fields. Germination was studied in forest and grassland patches. L. lucidum seedling survival and sapling growth were compared with the most abundant native species survival and growth. Seed arrival was strongly seasonal with a peak in mid-August. Seed rain did not differ significantly among habitat types, however there was a tendency for edges to receive more seeds when only dispersed seeds were considered. Perches strongly enhanced seed arrival; more than 40 times the number of seeds were dispersed beneath citrus plants (i.e. perches) than found in paired open areas. In the forest, seeds in gaps and edges had higher germination rates, but there was no difference in seedling survival. Fruits under closed canopy exhibited the lowest germination. Germination and survival were low in open areas. Neither seedling recruitment nor sapling growth differed between gaps and forest interior. L. lucidum saplings grew significantly more than saplings of the most common native species, and also showed higher seedling survival. L. lucidum is a prolific fruit producer, is capable of germinating and surviving in a broad range of forest environments, it is relatively shade tolerant and has higher survival and faster growth rate in comparison to the most common native species. All these characteristics highlight its potency as a successful invader, and point to few vulnerabilities that could be targets of control measures.

AB In a comparative study of Saguinus mystax and Saguinus fuscicollis, we examined the spectrum of plant species whose seeds are dispersed by these two tamarin species. We characterize these plants in terms of life form, fruit colour, pulp consistency and seed dimensions. The tamarins disperse a much broader spectrum of plant species than previously reported (88 of the total of 155 species exploited for fruit). While the distribution over plant life form, fruit colour and pulp consistency is identical between dispersed plant species and the overall spectrum of consumed plant species, clear differences exist in all seed parameters (length, width, height, volume, mass) except specific weight between dispersed and non-dispersed plant species for both tamarin species. Plant and fruit characteristics and seed parameters of dispersed plant species do not differ between S. mystax and S. fuscicollis, suggesting that their ecological and evolutionary interaction with plants is very similar or identical.

AB Montane evergreen forests in northern Thailand are high in biodiversity and becoming increasingly fragmented. We studied fragmentation and wildlife response in two contiguous wildlife sanctuaries. Om Koi still maintained relatively large patches (>400 ha) with some connectivity while Mae Tuen was comprised mainly of small and isolated patches (<100 ha). Mae Tuen lost 2640 ha of montane evergreen forest between 1954 and 1996 compared to a loss of 888 ha in Oni Koi. We compared the wildlife between four forest patches in Mae Tuen, with four in Om Koi finding nine mammals and 89 birds in Mae Tuen and 19 mammals and 119 birds in Ora Koi. Om Koi still supports populations of large mammals and frugivorous birds extirpated in Mae Tuen. The results document the high rate of fragmentation in protected areas that often interact synergistically with other pressures to reduce biodiversity.

AB Theory predicts that nectarivores respond to changes in profitability of patches of flowers or feeders by adjusting visitation rate to increase reward size. We conducted a set of experiments in an outdoor enclosure with seven feeders to determine how Phaethornis longirostris, a traplining hummingbird, adjusts its visitation rates in response to changes in sucrose solution delivery rates. Each experiment tested the response of P. longirostris to the following changes in the timing and volume of sucrose solution delivery: (1) increases in sucrose solution abundance at all feeders (mimicking seasonal increases in numbers of open flowers or nectar output); (2) large changes in sucrose solution availability at one feeder (mimicking increases or decreases of parch profitability); and (3) sudden unexpected decreases in sucrose solution availability at one feeder (mimicking loss of nectar to competitors). We found that P. longirostris (1) decreased visitation rates when the sucrose solution delivery rate was higher at all feeders, (2) increased visitation rates to individual feeders when their profitability increased for whole days but did not significantly decrease visitation rates when feeder output decreased; and (3) responded to sudden food losses at a feeder (due to simulated competition) by increasing use of that feeder for 1 or 2 h after the loss.

AB The spatial distribution of two rain forest tree species, Carapa procera (Meliaceae) and Vouacapoua americana (Caesalpiniaceae) was analysed within and between plots of different sizes (6.25 and 25 ha) at Paracou, French Guiana. The L(d) function was used to characterize spatial patterns, and the L-ij(d) intertype to study independancy between young and adult trees. Although both species are known to be dispersed by caviomorph rodents within short distances (c. 10-20 m and up to 50 m) of parent tree crowns, the analysis of tree positions led to different spatial patterns between species depending on soil drainage characteristics. Overall, while V. americana showed a strongly aggregated spatial distribution, C. procera had a weaker propensity to depart from complete spatial randomness (CSR). A complex distribution, sometimes clustered in areas with hydromorphic soils (swamps and around streams) and sometimes very near CSR outside these areas characterized the C. procera population. When C. procera tree aggregation occurred, there was a slight attraction between juveniles and adults. The aggregation of V. americana trees was evidenced at different levels depending on the scale of investigation. Within small plots (6.25 ha), a first level of aggregation with short distance radii of c. 10-25 m giving small clusters, and a second level which is composed of small clusters aggregated at c. 40-50 m distance radius, were observed. A third level of aggregation was suggested by analysing the tree population at the larger scale (25 ha) whose boundaries outside the plot were not delimited. Aggregation of V. americana trees at all levels was enhanced by a strong attraction between juveniles and adults. These results were discussed in light of seed and seedling ecology, especially with regard to seedling and sapling gap-dependence and soil drainage, which likely affected the recruitment of juvenile trees, and henceforth final tree spatial pattern.

AB The population biology, habitat utilisation and diet of a small, isolated population of long-nosed bandicoots (Perameles nasuta) was studied over a 22-month period at North Head in Sydney Harbour National Park, New South Wales. Reproductive output in this urban environment was high, with a mean litter size of 2.3 and production of up to four litters per year. The peak of reproductive activity was in late spring and early summer, with a cessation of breeding in late autumn or early winter. The main causes of death were identified as road trauma (58% - probably an overestimate because of the ease of finding road deaths) and predation by cats and foxes (37% - probably an underestimate because of the difficulty of locating carcasses unless radio-collared). Bandicoots utilised all macrohabitats (open grassed areas, heath, forest, swamp and scrub), but extensively used open grassed areas for foraging. Males had larger home ranges (4.4 +/- 0.8 ha) than females (1.7 +/- 0.2 ha). The largest home ranges of males coincided with the peak of the breeding season (September-November). Throughout the year P. nasuta fed primarily on beetles, invertebrate larvae and ants, but also on other invertebrates and on plant and fungal material. Some vertebrate and human-derived material (birdseed, vegetable scraps, plastic, twine) was also eaten. Although remarkably adaptable in its reproductive and dietary strategies, this population of long-nosed bandicoots is likely to follow other urban bandicoot populations toward extinction unless there is active management to reduce the high rate of mortality from motor vehicles and introduced predators.

AB Gastropod shells serve as a portable shelter for hermit crabs and provide protection for their otherwise vulnerable, soft abdomens. This study investigates the effect of prior shell experience and water flow on hermit crab shell selection. Research at Bodega Bay, California, examined shell selection in Pagurus granosimanus (Stimpson) and Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson) as a function of previous shell occupancy. Laboratory experiments found that when Pagurus granosimanus was presented two weight-matched shells of Olivella biplicata (Sowerby) and Tegula funebralis (Adams), it was significantly more likely to choose the shell species that it was collected in. Survey data yielded different shell use patterns between Pagurus granosimanus and Pagurus samuelis, with Pagurus samuelis using almost exclusively Tegula funebralis and Pagurus granosimanus using Olivella biplicata and Tegula funebralis at one site while using Tegula brunnea (Philippi) at another site. It was also found that Pagurus granosimanus is found deeper in the intertidal than Pagurus samuelis. Research conducted on Mo'orea, French Polynesia, examined the effect of water how on shell selection by hermit crabs. Population surveys and laboratory experiments were combined to determine if Calcinus seurati (Forest) from high flow and low flow environments select shells of different weight. It was found that Calcinus seurati collected from a high flow site selected significantly heavier shells than those collected from the still water site. Laboratory experiments also showed a tendency for Calcinus seurati to select heavier shells in a high flow treatment than in a no how treatment. Reef crest populations of Calcinus gaimardii (Edwards) and Calcinus elegans (Edwards) were also surveyed and compared with Calcinus seurati survey data. A significant difference in shell weight was found between Calcinus gaimardii and Calcinus seurati from the still water site. No other significant differences were found among species. Regression analyses indicate a correlation between hermit crab weight and shell weight for all three Mo'orean species. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The hermit crab assemblage of Calcinus laevimanus, Ca, latens, and Clibanarius humilis was studied on the intertidal rocky shores of the Maldivian atolls. The species were segregated across the intertidal area, Ca. laevimanus and Cl. humilis occurring in the midlittoral zone and supralittoral fringe, and Ca. latens in the infralittoral fringe and shallow subtidal. Habitat partitioning may be responsible for the coexistence of the two dimensionally closest species, Ca, laevimanus and Ca. latens. Resource partitioning probably plays the greater role in allowing Cl. humilis to share the same macro- and microhabitats with the larger and possibly dominant Ca, laevimanus, since the two species occupy gastropod shells with opposite architecture. However, patterns of growth and morphology, reproductive traits, as well as the different ecological role of shell types, can negate the impact of resource overlap between these two coexisting species, since these differences may possibly have evolved under pressures other than interspecific competition for resources.

AB Seed production of a population of 193 reproductive individuals of Euphorbia characias from the north-east Iberian peninsula was estimated at 155 000 seeds per year. The dehiscence period lasts for four weeks. The timing of ballistic dispersal is uniformly distributed throughout the day. Seeds remain on the surface a mean time (+/-SE) of 52.3 +/- 6.7 min. Several ant species take the seeds in varying proportions: Messor barbarus (0.225), a granivorous ant which ears the seeds; Aphaenogaster senilis (0.313), Pheidole pallidula (0.296) and Tapinoma nigerrimum (0.162) which take the seeds to their nests but do not eat them. Half a million ant foraging trips per day indicate a very strong short term influence of ants on fate of Euphorbia seeds. Ants as a group have a dual role of predation and dispersal of Euphorbia characias seeds. The characteristics of this Euphorbia (sclerophylly, diplochory, firmness of elaiosome, absence of subsidiary myrmecochorous features) better fit the syndrome described for Australian myrmecochores than the one proposed for European and North American myrmecochores.

AB The reproductive biology of three syntopical palm species, Bactris bifida, B. monticola, and B. gasipaes was investigated to determine their pollination strategies and pollinators, and to elucidate their impact on pollination for the local palm assemblage.
   In Peruvian Amazonia, Bactris is pollinated mainly by beetles of the genera Phyllotrox (Curculionidae) and Epurea (Nitidulidae), which are attracted to the protogynous, heavily scented inflorescences for mating and oviposition. In experiments (N = 15), beetles were constantly raised in the staminate flowers, which abscise after anthesis. Pollinator activity is crepuscular-nocturnal and the beetles change from male phase inflorescences to female phase inflorescences during twilight. The non-overlap of sexual phases within individuals largely promotes outbreeding in Bactris. The extensively cultivated B. gasipaes is pollinated by other species of Phyllotrox and Epurea than the primary forest species B. bifida and B. monticola. The latter two share the same pollinators with two species of Desmoncus. These species constitute an assemblage of reproductively similar palms. The beetle pollinators are associated with the palms mainly ar. and above the generic level, although development of their larvae in the abscised flowers of the host species probably leads to a chemical preference and thus ''flower constancy'' to that species. At the end of the host plant's flowering period beetles may switch to another assemblage member, because the palms provide the same resources. The assemblage members are patchily distributed, and population density in such parches is extremely high. They show staggered flowering and the most abundant species within the assemblage flower 2 or even 3 times a year, while less abundant species flower once a year.

AB Most species of the neotropical genus Siphocampylus are believed to be bird-pollinated. The pollination biology of Siphocampylus sulfureus was studied in a montane region in SE Brazil. This species has features intermediate between ornithophilous and chiropterophilous syndromes: it presents a striking combination of yellowish flowers with strong odour (chiropterophilous features), and diurnal anthesis and sucrose-dominated nectar (ornithophilous features). Major pollinators were hummingbirds by day, and a phyllostomid bat by night. Siphocampylus sulfureus may be viewed as a recent derivate from the presumed ornithophilous stock within sect. Macrosiphon, and thus benefits from the activity of both diurnal and nocturnal vertebrate pollinators.

AB The role of recruitment of turf-forming algae in maintaining a low rocky intertidal plant mosaic on the central Oregon coast was investigated. Monthly samples suggested that spore release by one of the most abundant turf-forming red algae at wave-exposed sites (Constantinea simplex Setchell) occurred only in spring. In contrast, spore release by the two most abundant wave-sheltered red algae [Odonthalia floccosa (Esper) Falkenberg, Neorhodomela larix (Turner) Masuda] occurred at all times but winter. At wave-exposed sites, the turf-dominant colonized clearances frequently. At wave-sheltered sites, one dominant colonized frequently and the other turf-dominant colonized clearances infrequently. Experiments evaluated the rates of recruitment of these algae to manually cleared plots with respect to distance and direction from spore source, species of colonist, presence or absence of early colonists, wave turbulence (wave-exposed or wave-sheltered), and location. We also tested the effect of grazing at wave-exposed but not at wave-sheltered sites (where grazers were scarce). At one wave-exposed site, but not the other, recruitment of Constantinea within 1 x 2 m cleared areas responded differently to distance depending on its direction from the propagule source. Significant variation also occurred between clearances and sites. The effects of preemptive competition and grazing were not significant. At wave-protected sites, recruitment of Odonthalia but not Neorhodomela varied significantly with several factors. These included presence of early colonists, blocks (one site only), and sites. However, no variation in recruitment of either species occurred with respect to direction or distance from propagule source. Compared to Odonthalia, recruitment of Neorhodomela was extremely low suggesting that the high abundance of the latter depends on vegetative growth and long persistence. We conclude that recruitment processes can contribute to the maintenance of a high diversity mosaic at wave-exposed sites, but are of minor importance at wave-sheltered sites.

AB Cropland abandonment has emerged as a common phenomenon in land use transitions. Both cropland abandonment and Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs can facilitate the provision of ecosystem services. However, the relationship between cropland abandonment and PES programs remains poorly understood. China has recently undergone considerable cropland abandonment in mountainous areas. Meanwhile, China adopted a series of forest conservation and restoration policies under the scheme of PES starting in the late 1990s. In this study, we track the temporal trend of cropland abandonment under China's two PES programs, Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program (CCFP) and Ecological Welfare Forest Program (EWFP), in Tiantangzhai Township, Anhui Province. We use a random-coefficients logistic regression model to examine the roles that these two PES programs, together with other factors, played in cropland abandonment. Results indicate that: 1) the overall cropland abandonment rates for the CCFP-participating households were lower than those for the non-participants in the years immediately after the implementation of the CCFP, but there was an acceleration of cropland abandonment by the CCFP participants afterwards, leading to the convergence of cropland abandonment rates between the two types of households. 2) Although CCFP payment did not have a long-term effect on cropland abandonment, a larger amount of EWFP payment significantly increased the likelihood of cropland abandonment. 3) Land parcel biophysical characteristics that facilitated cropland abandonment include proximity to EWFP and CCFP forests, poor accessibility and unfavorable topographic positions, and 4) among household socioeconomic conditions, poor farm labor availability and high proportion of local off-farm income in total gross income increased the likelihood of cropland abandonment, while owning domestic animals decreased the likelihood of abandoning cropland. EWFP cash compensation (socioeconomic factors) and distances from cropland parcels to both EWFP and CCFP forest lands (geographic factors) had direct and indirect impacts on cropland abandonment, potentially facilitating the provision of ecosystem services through forest restoration and regrowth on the abandoned land. These findings are highly valuable for policy-makers designing similar PES programs with higher cost-effectiveness and better selection of croplands as targets for reforestation.

AB 1. The abundance of nitrogen (N)-fixing plants in ecosystems where phosphorus (P) limits plant productivity poses a paradox because N fixation entails a high P cost. One explanation for this paradox is that the N-fixing strategy allows greater root phosphatase activity to enhance P acquisition from organic sources, but evidence to support this contention is limited.
   2. We measured root phosphomonoesterase (PME) activity of 10 N-fixing species, including rhizobial legumes and actinorhizal Allocasuarina species, and eight non-N-fixing species across a retrogressive soil chronosequence showing a clear shift from N to P limitation of plant growth and representing a strong natural gradient in P availability.
   3. Legumes showed greater root PME activity than non-legumes, with the difference between these two groups increasing markedly as soil P availability declined. By contrast, root PME activity of actinorhizal species was always lower than that of co-occurring legumes and not different from non-N-fixing plants.
   4. The difference in root PME activity between legumes and actinorhizal plants was not reflected in a greater or similar reliance on N fixation for N acquisition by actinorhizal species compared to co-occurring legumes.
   5. Synthesis. Our results support the idea that N-fixing legumes show high root phosphatase activity, especially at low soil P availability, but suggest that this is a phylogenetically conserved trait rather than one directly linked to their N-fixation capacity.

AB By specialising on specific resources, species evolve advantageous morphologies to increase the efficiency of nutrient acquisition. However, many specialists face variation in resource availability and composition. Whether specialists respond to these changes depends on the composition of the resource pulses, the cost of foraging on poorly matched resources, and the strength of interspecific competition. We studied hummingbird bill and plant corolla matching during seasonal variation in flower availability and morphology. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we accounted for the detectability and spatial overlap of hummingbird-plant interactions. We found that despite seasonal pulses of flowers with short-corollas, hummingbirds consistently foraged on well-matched flowers, leading to low niche overlap. This behaviour suggests that the costs of searching for rare and more specialised resources are lower than the benefit of switching to super-abundant resources. Our results highlight the trade-off between foraging efficiency and interspecific competition, and underline niche partitioning in maintaining tropical diversity.

AB Questions: What is the magnitude of the differences in environment and chronic human disturbance between contrasting slope aspects and topographic positions in a seasonally dry tropical forest? What is the effect of such topography-related differences on composition, structure and diversity attributes of the tree community of this forest?
   Location: Tziritzicuaro, Michoacan State, southern Mexico.
   Methods: Vegetation was sampled in 36 100-m(2) plots evenly distributed among three topographic positions (lower, middle and upper parts of a slope) and two slope aspects (N- and S-facing). Environment at these sites was described through modelling incoming solar radiation and in situ recording of temperature during 1 yr. Disturbance was visually assessed in the field to calculate a Chronic Disturbance Index. Vegetation structure and diversity were compared among the resulting combinations of slope and topographic position. PERMANOVA and CCA were used to examine the multivariate relationship among vegetation, topography and disturbance.
   Results: Slope aspects and topographic positions differed in terms of annual mean temperature, potential energy income and evapotranspiration. Conversely, disturbance was not so clearly related to topography. Regarding vegetation structure, significant differences were only found for individual sizes and abundance; these values increased towards the upper portion of S-facing slopes, but decreased with elevation in N-facing slopes. Species diversity (S, Jacknife 1 and Fisher's alpha) was higher in S-facing slopes and increased from lower to upper topographic positions. PERMANOVA showed that vegetation structure and diversity were influenced by topographic position (12.9%) and the interaction between soil moisture and chronic disturbance with slope aspect (8.2% and 8.3%, respectively). CCA showed that a modest proportion (21%) of variation in species composition is explained by the combination of environmental and disturbance variables.
   Conclusions: Slope aspect and topographic position represent axes of environmental and disturbance differentiation. Although vegetation attributes respond to these ecological factors, they do not show homogeneous responses. Floristic composition is clearly linked to environmental heterogeneity, while structural attributes and alpha-diversity appear to be more closely related to human disturbance and soil moisture, particularly on S-facing slopes. Integrating environmental heterogeneity and human disturbance with topographic variability enhances our understanding of large variation in tree community attributes in seasonal dry tropical forests.

AB Government and international agencies have highlighted the need to focus global change research efforts on tropical ecosystems. However, no recent comprehensive review exists synthesizing humid tropical forest responses across global change factors, including warming, decreased precipitation, carbon dioxide fertilization, nitrogen deposition, and land use/land cover changes. This paper assesses research across spatial and temporal scales for the tropics, including modeling, field, and controlled laboratory studies. The review aims to (1) provide a broad understanding of how a suite of global change factors are altering humid tropical forest ecosystem properties and biogeochemical processes; (2) assess spatial variability in responses to global change factors among humid tropical regions; (3) synthesize results from across humid tropical regions to identify emergent trends in ecosystem responses; (4) identify research and management priorities for the humid tropics in the context of global change. Ecosystem responses covered here include plant growth, carbon storage, nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and disturbance regime shifts. The review demonstrates overall negative effects of global change on all ecosystem properties, with the greatest uncertainty and variability in nutrient cycling responses. Generally, all global change factors reviewed, except for carbon dioxide fertilization, demonstrate great potential to trigger positive feedbacks to global warming via greenhouse gas emissions and biogeophysical changes that cause regional warming. This assessment demonstrates that effects of decreased rainfall and deforestation on tropical forests are relatively well understood, whereas the potential effects of warming, carbon dioxide fertilization, nitrogen deposition, and plant species invasions require more cross-site, mechanistic research to predict tropical forest responses at regional and global scales.

AB The aim of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of the PES scheme actually used in the Sicilian rural development program, based on an egalitarian criterion, and proposing an alternative scheme in order to guarantee a greater equity and fairness of premium distribution in relation to soil carbon (C) sequestration potential. We, first, assessed the ecosystem services (ES) provided by agri-environmental measures (AEM) in terms of SOC stock increase in Sicilian vineyards. Based on these data we evaluated the efficiency of agro-environmental payments according to an egalitarian criterion and simulated the effects of the actual provision criterion adoption. Results showed that the adoption of an egalitarian criterion generates an inequitable distribution of agri-environmental payments, which could potentially be mitigated by a scheme such as actual provision. The latter, indeed, leads to a greater efficiency in the distribution of financial resources among land users and offers a higher premium to land users that, by adopting an agro-environmental practice, contribute to increase soil C sequestration.

AB Numerous grassland experiments have found evidence for a complementarity effect, an increase in productivity with higher plant species richness due to niche partitioning. However, empirical tests of complementarity in natural forests are rare. We conducted a spatially explicit analysis of 518433 growth records for 274 species from a 50-ha tropical forest plot to test neighborhood complementarity, the idea that a tree grows faster when it is surrounded by more dissimilar neighbors. We found evidence for complementarity: focal tree growth rates increased by 39.8% and 34.2% with a doubling of neighborhood multi-trait dissimilarity and phylogenetic dissimilarity, respectively. Dissimilarity from neighbors in maximum height had the most important effect on tree growth among the six traits examined, and indeed, its effect trended much larger than that of the multi-trait dissimilarity index. Neighborhood complementarity effects were strongest for light-demanding species, and decreased in importance with increasing shade tolerance of the focal individuals. Simulations demonstrated that the observed neighborhood complementarities were sufficient to produce positive stand-level biodiversity-productivity relationships. We conclude that neighborhood complementarity is important for productivity in this tropical forest, and that scaling down to individual-level processes can advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stand-level biodiversity-productivity relationships.

AB Forests around the world are increasingly fragmented, and edge effects on forest microclimates have the potential to affect ecosystem functions such as carbon and nutrient cycling. Edges tend to be drier and warmer due to the effects of insolation, wind, and evapotranspiration and these gradients can penetrate hundreds of metres into the forest. Litter decomposition is a key component of the carbon cycle, which is largely controlled by saprotrophic fungi that respond to variation in temperature and moisture. However, the impact of forest fragmentation on litter decay is poorly understood. Here, we investigate edge effects on the decay of wood in a temperate forest using an experimental approach, whereby mass loss in wood blocks placed along 100m transects from the forest edge to core was monitored over 2years. Decomposition rate increased with distance from the edge, and was correlated with increasing humidity and moisture content of the decaying wood, such that the decay constant at 100m was nearly twice that at the edge. Mean air temperature decreased slightly with distance from the edge. The variation in decay constant due to edge effects was larger than that expected from any reasonable estimates of climatic variation, based on a published regional model. We modelled the influence of edge effects on the decay constant at the landscape scale using functions for forest area within different distances from edge across the UK. We found that taking edge effects into account would decrease the decay rate by nearly one quarter, compared with estimates that assumed no edge effect.

AB Phenotypic adaptation to environmental fluctuations frequently occurs by preexisting plasticity and its role as a major component of variation in physiological diversity is being widely recognized. Few studies have considered the change in phenotypic flexibility among geographic populations in marine calcifiers to ocean acidification projections, despite the fact that this type of study provides understanding about how the organism may respond to this chemical change in the ocean. We examined the geographic variation in CO2 seawater concentrations in the phenotype and in the reaction norm of physiological traits using a laboratory mesocosm approach with short-term acclimation in two contrasting populations (Antofagasta and Calfuco) of the intertidal snail Concholepas concholepas. Our results show that elevated pCO(2) conditions increase standard metabolic rates in both populations of the snail juveniles, likely due to the higher energy cost of homeostasis. juveniles of C concholepas in the Calfuco (southern) population showed a lower increment of metabolic rate in high-pCO(2) environments concordant with a lesser gene expression of a heat shock protein with respect to the Antofagasta (northern) population. Combined these results indicate a negative effect of ocean acidification on whole-organism functioning of C. concholepas. Finally, the significant Population x pCO(2) level interaction in both studied traits indicates that there is variation between populations in response to high-pCO(2) conditions.

AB The expansion of tropical forest into savanna may potentially be a large carbon sink, but little is known about the patterns of carbon sequestration during transitional forest formation. Moreover, it is unclear how nutrient limitation, due to extended exposure to fire-driven nutrient losses, may constrain carbon accumulation. Here, we sampled plots that spanned a woody biomass gradient from savanna to transitional forest in response to differential fire protection in central Brazil. These plots were used to investigate how the process of transitional forest formation affects the size and distribution of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools. This was paired with a detailed analysis of the nitrogen cycle to explore possible connections between carbon accumulation and nitrogen limitation. An analysis of carbon pools in the vegetation, upper soil, and litter shows that the transition from savanna to transitional forest can result in a fourfold increase in total carbon (from 43 to 179 Mg C/ha) with a doubling of carbon stocks in the litter and soil layers. Total nitrogen in the litter and soil layers increased with forest development in both the bulk (+68%) and plant-available (+150%) pools, with the most pronounced changes occurring in the upper layers. However, the analyses of nitrate concentrations, nitrate:ammonium ratios, plant stoichiometry of carbon and nitrogen, and soil and foliar nitrogen isotope ratios suggest that a conservative nitrogen cycle persists throughout forest development, indicating that nitrogen remains in low supply relative to demand. Furthermore, the lack of variation in underlying soil type (>20 cm depth) suggests that the biogeochemical trends across the gradient are driven by vegetation. Our results provide evidence for high carbon sequestration potential with forest encroachment on savanna, but nitrogen limitation may play a large and persistent role in governing carbon sequestration in savannas or other equally fire-disturbed tropical landscapes. In turn, the link between forest development and nitrogen pool recovery creates a framework for evaluating potential positive feedbacks on savanna-forest boundaries.

AB Thirteen decapod crustacean species, eight of which are new, from the mid-Cretaceous (late Albian) limestones of the Koskobilo quarry in northern Spain are described, illustrated, and discussed. They include: Graptocarcinus texanus; Navarrara betsieae gen. nov., sp. nov.; Acareprosopon bouvieri n. comb.; Laeviprosopon hispanicum sp. nov.; L. planum sp. nov.; L. edoi sp. nov.; L. crassum sp. nov.; Viaia robusta; Cretamaja granulata gen. nov., sp. nov.; Koskobilius postangustus gen. nov., sp. nov.; Navarrahomola hispanica; Glytodynomene alsasuensis; and Albenizus minutus gen. nov., sp. nov. Cretamaja and Koskobilius represent the oldest known spider crabs. In total, 36 species are now known from the Koskobilo locality based on 1078 specimens. To discover the magnitude of the diversity of the decapod fauna of Koskobilo, a comprehensive overview of decapod-rich localities and formations from the Cretaceous worldwide was compiled. It appears that Koskobilo is the most diverse decapod fauna from a single locality currently known from the Cretaceous. A rarefaction analysis shows that the maximum number of species is nearly reached. The number of genera, 26, is also unsurpassed for the Cretaceous. Forty-two species are found from localities within the Eguino Formation to which sediments from the Koskobilo quarry are ascribed, which is also unprecedented for a single formation within the Cretaceous. Evidence suggests that the most diverse decapod faunas from the Cretaceous are found in coral-associated limestones. This is consistent with evidence from the Recent, where decapod diversity is high in coral reefs compared to other habitats. This also suggests that the decapod peak diversity in Koskobilo is largely ecological in nature and not caused by a preservational bias. This is one of the most comprehensive studies on Cretaceous decapod diversity so far. Field work in coral-associated strata is expected to yield more decapod-rich faunas. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The ecological characteristics of forest edges have been intensively studied in the Amazon region, but the occurrence and intensity of fires as large-scale edge effects are less well known, as is the role of different types of management in modifying this relationship. We used remote sensing techniques to examine the relationship between forest fragmentation, fire and management across NW Amazonia. Our study was based on forest data for 2005 and on active fire data from the MODerate-resolution imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS), with information on the occurrence and strength of fires based on fire radiative power (FRP) data. We analyzed the fragmentation and fire occurrence and intensity in a 50 x 50 km grid. We also calculated the distance at which edge-related fires occur in the forest interior and outside the forest edge. Forest fragmentation had a significant impact on fire occurrence and fire intensity, supporting the hypothesis that the more fragmented a forest is, the higher the degree of biomass combustion. These results are in agreement with the occurrence of an edge effect on both the occurrence and the intensity of fire. The different types of management in the region influence the occurrence and intensity of fire, whereas fire as a large-scale edge effect occurs independent of the management type. Finally, we suggest that a high connectivity in protected areas and indigenous reserves and also in outside areas should be encouraged to minimize edge-driven fire processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We develop a conceptual framework elucidating the main determinants of the impact of Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) and Payments for Environmental Services (PES) programs. Using a simple multi-agent model and evaluations of existing programs, we show that (1) the share of the population who would meet the program's conditions in the absence of payments is a powerful predictor of program efficiency, and that (2) program efficiency is eroded by selection bias (people who already meet conditions self-select into the programs at higher rates than others). We then discuss possibilities for increasing efficiency and criteria for evaluating and choosing between CCTs/PES or other policy instruments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim To develop and test a simple climate-based ecophysiological model of above-ground biomass an approach that can be applied directly to predicting the effects of climate change on forest carbon stores. Location Humid lowland forests world-wide. Methods We developed a new approach to modelling the aboveground biomass of old-growth forest (AGBmax) based on the influences of temperature on gross primary productivity (GPP) and what we call total maintenance cost (TMC), which includes autotrophic respiration as well as leaf, stem and other plant construction required to maintain biomass. We parameterized the models with measured carbon fluxes and tested them by comparing predicted AGBmax with measured AGB for another 109 old-growth sites. Results Our models explained 57% of the variation in GPP across 95 sites and 79% of the variation in TMC across 17 sites. According to the best-fit models, the ratio of GPP to maintenance cost per unit biomass (MCB) peaks at 16.5 degrees C, indicating that this is the air temperature leading to the highest possible AGBmax when temperatures are constant. Seasonal temperature variation generally reduces predicted AGBmax, and thus maritime temperate climates are predicted to have the highest AGBmax. The shift in temperatures from temperate maritime to tropical climates increases MCB more than GPP, and thus decreases AGBmax. Overall, our model explains exactly 50% of the variation in AGB among humid lowland old-growth forests. Main conclusions Temperature plays an important role in explaining global variation in biomass among humid lowland old-growth forests, a role that can be understood in terms of the dual effects of temperature on GPP and TMC. Our simple model captures these influences, and could be an important tool for predicting the effects of climate change on forest carbon stores.

AB Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is known to be beneficial in biodiversity conservation, but its effects on tree diversity remain unknown. Pattern of tree diversity following disturbance usually varies with spatial scale of sampling (i.e., plot size). We examined the impacts of RIL on species richness and community composition of tree species at different spatial scales, and the scale (plot size) dependency of the two metrics; species richness versus community similarity. One 2-ha and three to four 0.2-ha plots were established in each of primary, RIL, and conventionally logged (CL) forest in Sabah, Malaysia. Species richness (the number of species per unit number of stems) was higher in the RIL than in the CL forest at both scales. The relationship between species richness and logging intensity varied with plot size. Species richness was greater in the RIL than in the primary forest at the 2-ha scale, while it was similar between the two forests at 0.2-ha scale. Similarly, species richness in the CL forest demonstrated a greater value at the 2-ha scale than at the 0.2-ha scale. Greater species richness in the two logged forests at the 2-ha scale is attributable to a greater probability of encountering the species-rich, small patches that are distributed heterogeneously. Community composition of the RIL forest more resembled that of the primary forest than that of the CL forest, regardless of plot size. Accordingly, species richness is a scale-dependent metric, while community similarity is a more robust metric to indicate the response of tree assemblage to anthropogenic disturbance.

AB Hunting and habitat degradation are universal threats to primates across the tropics, thus deciphering the relative impact of threats on population relative abundance is critical to predicting extinction risk and providing conservation recommendations. We studied diurnal primates over a period of nearly 6 years in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania, a site of global importance for primate conservation. We assessed how population relative abundance of five species (of which two are endemic and IUCN-Endangered) differed between two forest blocks that are similar in size and habitat types but contrast strongly in protection level, and how abundance changed during 2004-2009. We also measured habitat and disturbance parameters and, in the unprotected forest, evaluated hunting practices. We found significant differences in primates' abundance between protected and unprotected forests, with the greater contrast being the lower abundance of colobine monkeys (Udzungwa red colobus and Angolan colobus) in the unprotected forest. At this site moreover, colobines declined to near-extinction over the study period. In contrast, two cercopithecines (Sanje mangabey and Sykes' monkey) showed slightly higher abundance in the unprotected forest and did not decline significantly. We argue that escalating hunting in the unprotected forest has specifically impacted the canopy-dwelling colobus monkeys, although habitat degradation may also have reduced their abundance. In contrast, cercopithecines did not seem affected by the current hunting, and their greater ecological adaptability may explain the relatively higher abundance in the unprotected forest. We provide recommendations towards the long-term protection of the area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ecological specialization and resource partitioning are expected to be particularly high in the species-rich communities of tropical vertebrates, yet many species have broader ecological niches than expected. In Neotropical ecosystems, Neotropical leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) are one of the most ecologically and functionally diverse vertebrate clades. Resource partitioning in phyllostomids might be achieved through differences in the ability to find and process food. We selected Micronycteris microtis, a very small (5-7 g) animalivorous phyllostomid, to explore whether broad resource use is associated with specific morphological, behavioral and performance traits within the phyllostomid radiation. We documented processing of natural prey and measured bite force in free-ranging M. microtis and other sympatric phyllostomids. We found that M. microtis had a remarkably broad diet for prey size and hardness. For the first time, we also report the consumption of vertebrates (lizards), which makes M. microtis the smallest carnivorous bat reported to date. Compared to other phyllostomids, M. microtis had the highest bite force for its size and cranial shape and high performance plasticity. Bite force and cranial shape appear to have evolved rapidly in the M. microtis lineage. High performance capacity and high efficiency in finding motionless prey might be key traits that allow M. microtis, and perhaps other species, to successfully co-exist with other gleaning bats.

AB Landscape connectivity is a key factor determining the viability of populations in fragmented landscapes. Predicting 'functional connectivity', namely whether a patch or a landscape functions as connected from the perspective of a focal species, poses various challenges. First, empirical data on the movement behaviour of species is often scarce. Second, animal-landscape interactions are bound to yield complex patterns. Lastly, functional connectivity involves various components that are rarely assessed separately. We introduce the spatially explicit, individual-based model FunCon as means to distinguish between components of functional connectivity and to assess how each of them affects the sensitivity of species and communities to landscape structures. We then present the results of exploratory simulations over six landscapes of different fragmentation levels and across a range of hypothetical bird species that differ in their response to habitat edges. i) Our results demonstrate that estimations of functional connectivity depend not only on the response of species to edges (avoidance versus penetration into the matrix), the movement mode investigated (home range movements versus dispersal), and the way in which the matrix is being crossed (random walk versus gap crossing), but also on the choice of connectivity measure (in this case, the model output examined). ii) We further show a strong effect of the mortality scenario applied, indicating that movement decisions that do not fully match the mortality risks are likely to reduce connectivity and enhance sensitivity to fragmentation. iii) Despite these complexities, some consistent patterns emerged. For instance, the ranking order of landscapes in terms of functional connectivity was mostly consistent across the entire range of hypothetical species, indicating that simple landscape indices can potentially serve as valuable surrogates for functional connectivity. Yet such simplifications must be carefully evaluated in terms of the components of functional connectivity they actually predict.

AB P>1. With habitat fragmentation spreading around the world, there is a pressing need to understand its impacts on local food webs. To date, few studies have examined the effects of landscape context on multiple local communities in a quantitative, spatially realistic setting.
   2. To examine how the isolation of a food web affects its structure, we construct local food webs of specialist herbivores and their natural enemies on 82 individual oaks (Quercus robur) growing in different landscape contexts.
   3. Across this set of webs, we find that communities in isolated habitat patches not only contained fewer species than did well-connected ones, but also differed in species composition.
   4. Surprisingly, the effects observed in terms of species composition were not reflected in the quantitative interaction structure of local food webs: landscape context had no detectable effect on either the interaction evenness, linkage density, connectance, generality or vulnerability of local webs.
   5. We conclude that the quantitative structure of food webs may be stable in the face of habitat fragmentation, despite clear-cut impacts on individual species. This finding offers hope-inspiring news for conservation, but should clearly be verified by empirical studies across both naturally and more recently fragmented systems.

AB 1. Problem statement -Foundation species define and structure ecological systems. In forests around the world, foundation tree species are declining due to overexploitation, pests and pathogens. Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), a foundation tree species in eastern North America, is threatened by an exotic insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). The loss of hemlock is hypothesized to result in dramatic changes in assemblages of associated species with cascading impacts on food webs and fluxes of energy and nutrients. We describe the setting, design and analytical framework of the Harvard Forest Hemlock Removal Experiment (HF-HeRE), a multi-hectare, long-term experiment that overcomes many of the major logistical and analytical challenges of studying system-wide consequences of foundation species loss.
   2. Study design - HF-HeRE is a replicated and blocked Before-After-Control-Impact experiment that includes two hemlock removal treatments: girdling all hemlocks to simulate death by adelgid and logging all hemlocks > 20 cm diameter and other merchantable trees to simulate pre-emptive salvage operations. These treatments are paired with two control treatments: hemlock controls that are beginning to be infested in 2010 by the adelgid and hardwood controls that represent future conditions of most hemlock stands in eastern North America.
   3. Ongoing measurements and monitoring - Ongoing long-term measurements to quantify the magnitude and direction of forest ecosystem change as hemlock declines include: air and soil temperature, light availability, leaf area and canopy closure; changes in species composition and abundance of the soil seed-bank, understorey vegetation, and soil-dwelling invertebrates; dynamics of coarse woody debris; soil nitrogen availability and net nitrogen mineralization; and soil carbon flux. Short-term or one-time-only measurements include initial tree ages, hemlock-decomposing fungi, wood-boring beetles and throughfall chemistry. Additional within-plot, replicated experiments include effects of ants and litter-dwelling microarthoropods on ecosystem functioning, and responses of salamanders to canopy change.
   4. Future directions and collaborations - HF-HeRE is part of an evolving network of retrospective studies, natural experiments, large manipulations and modelling efforts focused on identifying and understanding the role of single foundation species on ecological processes and dynamics. We invite colleagues from around the world who are interested in exploring complementary questions to take advantage of the HF-HeRE research infrastructure.

AB Aim The abundant-centre hypothesis (ACH) is based on the assumption that physiological constraints limit populations at the edges of their distributional range, yet the geographical variation of physiological performance or life-history traits has rarely been examined. Here we examine the applicability of the ACH in a marine system by testing whether physiological predictions are reflected in large-scale variations of life-history traits.
   Location The Chilean coast (18 degrees-42 degrees S), encompassing more than 2500 km along the Pacific coast of South America.
   Methods Five porcelain crab species (Petrolisthes granulosus, Petrolisthes laevigatus, Petrolisthes tuberculatus, Petrolisthes violaceus and Allopetrolisthes angulosus) were sampled on intertidal boulder beaches at 13 sampling sites. For each species and site we evaluated: (1) relative abundance (density), (2) maximum size, (3) size at maturity, (4) sex ratio, (5) proportion of ovigerous females, and (6) presence of recruits. The shape of the spatial distribution of each trait was evaluated statistically against the prediction of four hypothetical models (normal, ramped-south, ramped-north and abundant-edge).
   Results The relative abundance and life-history traits showed different spatial patterns among species. Relative abundance (across sites) was fitted by a normal model in only two species. No model fitted the spatial variation in body size and size at first maturity, which showed a slight but monotonic poleward increase in all species. Sex ratio showed a prominent hump-shaped pattern, with females prevailing in the centre of the ranges and males dominating towards the range boundaries; this pattern was statistically significant in three of the five studied species. The proportion of ovigerous females showed no clear latitudinal trends, and mature individuals were observed across most of the geographical range of the species. However, recruits tended to be absent towards the southern (poleward) boundaries of the distribution.
   Main conclusions The ACH does not apply to all species equally. The link between abundance and life-history traits is complex and variable among the porcelain crab species studied. Overall, the observed patterns were consistent with the idea that equatorward boundaries might be controlled by physiological restrictions mainly affecting adult survival, whereas poleward boundaries might be shaped by limitations in reproductive output and larval survival. Our results underline the importance of incorporating ecological, physiological and life-history studies in future tests of the ACH.

AB Current payment for environmental service (PES) schemes face challenges in the form of evaluation of opportunity costs and ecosystem service delivery, high transaction costs, and difficulties in ensuring conditionality. Even when these conditions are met, PES may be undermined by a lack of inclusivity, leading to societal conflicts over land use We propose a new PES-type approach that we call Landscape Labelling that seeks to overcome these problems by combining PES and product certification principles applied at a landscape scale with local benefits realized at the community level.
   Specifically. we propose that managed rural landscapes delivering valuable ecosystem services should be awarded a 'Landscape Label', that would be used to identify products produced from the landscape A Landscape Label could also represent and indeed publicize ecosystem service delivery as well as cultural and symbolic attributes of the landscape, as defined by local communities. This would provide greater recognition to communities and help to empower them in negotiations with outside agencies Thus a Landscape Label has the potential to improve market recognition, secure premium payments, and gain access to niche markets. The derived benefits can, in turn, secure an incentive for managing the landscape in such a way as to continue to meet the ecosystem Service criteria required for certification. Payments for ecosystem services, under a Landscape Labelling scheme, would be delivered to appropriate community-based organizations for investment in community and social projects that would benefit a far wider range of people than is currently possible in current PES.
   There are various challenges to the successful implementation of this scheme. an important one being the creation of fair and transparent community-based institutions. Other challenges include the risks of freeriders. In proposing a Landscape Label we seek to promote new ideas that have potential to overcome challenges associated with current PES-type schemes, and in discussing their deficiencies we hope to conceptually and practically advance PES-type approaches (C) 2009 Elsevier B V All rights reserved.

AB The interaction between land-use change and the sustainability of hunting is poorly understood but is critical for sustaining hunted vertebrate populations and a protein supply for the rural poor. We investigated sustainability of hunting in an Amazonian landscape mosaic, where a small human population had access to large areas of both primary and secondary forest. Harvestable production of mammals and birds was calculated from density estimates. We compared production with offtake from three villages and used catch-per-unit-effort as an independent measure of prey abundance. Most species were hunted unsustainably in primary forest, leading to local depletion of the largest primates and birds. The estimated sustainable supply of wild meat was higher for primary (39 kg center dot km(-2) center dot yr(-1)) than secondary forest (22 kg center dot km(-2) center dot yr(-1)) because four species were absent and three species at low abundance in secondary forests. Production of three disturbance-tolerant mammal species was 3 times higher in secondary than in primary forest, but hunting led to overexploitation of one species. Our data suggest that an average Amazonian smallholder would require >= 3.1 km(2) of secondary regrowth to ensure a sustainable harvest of forest vertebrates. We conclude that secondary forests can sustainably provide only 2% of the required protein intake of Amazonian smallholders and are unlikely to be sufficient for sustainable hunting in other tropical forest regions.

AB The scale at which seed dispersal operates has many implications for the spatial patterns of plant recruitment and diversity. We investigated the effect of short- (ants) and long-distance (birds) seed dispersal of the fleshy-fruited melastome, Miconia rubiginosa, in the Brazilian savanna. We estimated the contribution of dispersal vectors to the removal of the fruit crop from the canopy (birds), and once seeds have reached the cerrado floor (ants) over two fruiting seasons. Birds (13 species) removed up to 23.7% of the fruit crop from the crown, but dropped a substantial proportion of fruits beneath the parent plant. Birds removed a greater proportion of fruits from trees producing large fruit crops, as predicted by the fruit crop size hypothesis. However, up to 18.9% of the fruit crop fell beneath the parent plant as ripe fruit. Most fallen fruits were removed by ants (seven genera), which are likely to play a relatively important role in terms of the quantity of seeds dispersed, especially for plants producing small fruit crops (a conceptual model is presented). Birds and ants did not influence seed germination, but they differ in terms of the spatial scale of dispersal and deposition patterns. Ants probably play an important role in the local population dynamics of Miconia, whereas birds are responsible for long-distance dispersal associated with the colonization of new patches and metapopulation dynamics. By removing seeds from bird droppings, ants may also reshape at a finer scale the seed rain generated by primary dispersers. Indeed, seedlings and saplings of Miconia are more frequently found around leaf-cutter ant nests than in control areas away from ant nests or around large Miconia trees. The quantitative component of dispersal effectiveness by ants acting as "rescuers" of seeds that fail to be dispersed, or fall under parent trees, is probably more important than currently recognized in other systems.

AB Although several proxies have been proposed to trace the course of environmental and climatological fluctuations, precise paleoclimate records from the tropics, notably from Africa are still sorely lacking today. Stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) in tree rings are an attractive record of climate. In this study, the patterns and climatic signals of delta C-13 ratios were determined on tree rings of deciduous (Acacia senegal, Acacia tortilis, Acacia seyal) and an evergreen (Balanites aegyptiaca) species, from a semi-arid Acacia Woodland in Ethiopia. delta C-13 inter-annual patterns are synchronous among the co-occurring species. A declining trend with time was observed in delta C-13, notably for B. aegyptiaca, which Could be due to anthropogenic increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration and decrease in atmospheric delta C-13. Tree ring delta C-13 values of all the species revealed significant negative correlation with precipitation amount but not with temperature and relative humidity. The PC series of the deciduous species shows a higher correlation (r = -0.70 to -0.78) with precipitation than the evergreen species (r = -0.55). A master delta C-13 series, composed of the average of the three Acacia species, displayed stronger significant correlation (r = -0.82) than any of the individual species delta C-13 series. The weak relationship between temperature and delta C-13 in this study indicates that photosynthetic rate is not a significant factor. Moisture stress, however, may have a direct impact on the stomatal conductance and explain the strong negative relationship between delta C-13 and precipitation. The results demonstrate the potential of delta C-13 in tree rings to reflect physiological responses to environmental changes as a vehicle for paleoclimatic reconstruction, which is important to understand tree response to past and future climate change.

AB We evaluated the effects of forest fragmentation on herbivory on central Amazonian trees. Levels of herbivory were measured on leaves from a total of 1200 saplings from 3 3 7 species. There was a positive and significant effect of forest fragment area on herbivore damage, with plants from continuous forest having twice as much damage as plants in the smallest fragments studied (I ha). Measurements of herbivory rates on two species, however, indicate that the effect can be species-specific. Forest area had a positive and linear effect on rates of herbivory in Henriettella caudata (Melastomataceae), whereas in Protium hebetataum (Burseraceae), rates of herbivory were greater in the 10-ha fragments than in the I-ha fragments and in continuous forest. There is no evidence that the nutritional and defensive characteristics of the leaves of the species we studied changed as a result of forest fragmentation, at least not in a manner consistent with the observed herbivory patterns. Herbivore predation levels, measured with artificial caterpillars, also showed no significant relationship with forest area. Therefore, neither of these top-down and bottom-up forces could explain the observed patterns of herbivory. It is suggested, instead, that forest fragmentation may affect the dispersal of insect herbivores, and reduce their abundances on small forest isolates. Altered patterns of herbivory on tree saplings may have important consequences for forest structure and dynamics.

AB Mature tropical forests at agricultural frontiers are of global conservation concern as the leading edge of global deforestation. In the Ituri Forest of DRC, as in other tropical forest areas, road creation associated with selective logging results in spontaneous human colonization, leading to the clearing of mature forest for agricultural purposes. Following 1-3 years of cultivation, farmlands are left fallow for periods that may exceed 20 years, resulting in extensive secondary forest areas impacted by both selective logging and swidden agriculture. In this study, we assessed forest structure, tree species composition and diversity and the regeneration of timber trees in secondary forest stands (5-10 and similar to 40 years old), selectively logged forest stands, and undisturbed forests at two sites in the Ituri region. Stem density was lower in old secondary forests (similar to 40 years old) than in either young secondary or mature forests. Overall tree diversity did not significantly differ between forest types, but the diversity of trees >= 10 cm dbh was substantially lower in young secondary forest stands than in old secondary or mature forests. The species composition of secondary forests differed from that of mature forests, with the dominant Caesalpinoid legume species of mature forests poorly represented in secondary forests. However, in spite of prior logging, the regeneration of high value timber trees such as African mahoganies (Khaya anthotheca and Entandrophragma spp.) was at least 10 times greater in young secondary forests than in mature forests. We argue that, if properly managed and protected, secondary forests, even those impacted by both selective logging and small-scale shifting agriculture, may have high potential conservation and economic value.

AB in theory, habitat fragmentation alters plant community dynamics by influencing both local (within patch) and regional (among patch) processes. However, the lengthy generation times of plant taxa relative to the short duration of most experiments has precluded studies from assessing the impact of fragmentation at both local and regional scales. Due to their accelerated life cycles, high rates of local extinction, and naturally patchy substrates, epiphyllous bryophyte assemblages are an appropriate plant guild for empirically testing metacommunity-based predictions associated with habitat fragmentation. By examining the local abundance and regional distribution patterns of 67 epiphyllous (leaf-inhabiting) bryophyte species in an experimentally fragmented landscape in Amazonia, we demonstrate that changes in local abundance wrought by habitat fragmentation are best explained by fragment size rather than proximity to forest edge. Furthermore, evidence of a simultaneous inter-specific decline in epiphyll local abundance and regional distribution in small (1- and 10-ha) forest fragments corroborate with metapopulation-based predictions highlighting the importance of immigration in buffering from patch extinction risk (i.e., the rescue effect). Collectively, these results provide indirect evidence that dispersal limitation, rather than compromised habitat quality attributable to edge effects, likely account for species loss from small tropical forest fragments. Whether dispersal limitation is due to increased insularity from regional sources for epiphyll recolonization or rather to lowered within-fragment dispersal potential is unknown; nonetheless, the long-term persistence of these microscopic plant metacommunities depends on the preservation of rain forest reserves of at least 100-ha in size.

AB Urbanization causes the fragmentation of natural habitats into isolated patches surrounded by anthropogenic habitats. Fragment size and the intensity of human disturbance have been shown to affect both composition and diversity of arthropod communities, but most groups have been understudied. We investigated effects of urbanization on ant assemblages (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in and around the Molson Reserve, a preserved maple-beech forest surrounded by residential properties near Montreal, Quebec. We studied how local ant assemblages differed in terms of composition, abundance, and species richness, depending on whether they were situated in the interior forest, in adjacent residential backyards, or at the edge between these two habitats. We also compared an intact forest interior with a younger and moderately disturbed forest ("buffer zone") between the urban matrix and the interior forest. Few differences were detected between the buffer zone and the intact forest interior. Extrapolated estimates of species richness Suggest that it is lowest in the forest interior and highest in urban zones. Community composition, as investigated with ordination analysis, revealed a clear difference between the fauna of urban sites and the fauna of edges and forest interiors, and analyzing the relative abundance of ants showed residential backyards to contain the most ants. Urban assemblages were characterized by several competitively dominant species, including one introduced or "tramp" species. The occurrence of aggressive and dominant species in urban sites and at the edges of the Molson Reserve could potentially interfere with the dispersal and immigration of ground-dwelling arthropods and negatively affect local diversity or community composition in isolated forest reserves in urban centres.

AB The abandonment by humans of marginal and less productive zones signifies an important change in land use in North Mediterranean agroecosystems. Human perturbations have led to a highly diversified landscape, with a mosaic made up of patches of land at different stages of succession, from cultivated fields to closed forest. Our aim here is to characterize ant assemblages and their functional groups in response to these land-use changes. This progressive abandonment results in an initial increase in ant richness and abundance, which can reach high levels if the succession proceeds as far as woodland. In terms of the ant functional groups, this land-use change implies: ( 1) the appearance of Subordinate Camponotini; ( 2) an increase in Generalized Myrmicinae, Cryptics and Cold-climate specialists in terms of ant species richness, overall abundance and, for Generalized Myrmicinae and Cryptics, an increase in abundance percentage; ( 3) a decrease in percentage abundance of Opportunists; ( 4) a progressive decrease in species richness as well as overall and percentage abundance of Hot-climate Specialists throughout the transformation from crops to woodlands; and ( 5) an initial increase of Dominant Dolichoderinae followed by a decrease in ant species richness, overall abundance and percentage abundance. Using the ant functional group approach for the clearly separate stages of the regeneration process is a promising method for comparing responses of ant communities to human land use.

AB 1 The difference in gap size requirements observed for neotropical pioneer species is a classic example of habitat partitioning among tropical tree species. Previous research has shown that the three species Miconia argentea, Cecropia insignis and Trema micrantha differ in the minimum gap size that they occupy as adult plants in semi-deciduous tropical forest in Panama. Here we test whether these differences result from variation in seed germination and seedling establishment requirements, or from differences in susceptibility to herbivores.
   2 We planted seeds of Miconia argentea and Trema micrantha into artificially created small (25 m(2)), medium ( 64 m(2)) and large (225 m(2)) gaps in secondary forest, and transplanted seedlings of all three species into small and large gaps inside and outside mesh cages that excluded invertebrate herbivores.
   3 Miconia seedlings emerged and established successfully across a broad range of gap sizes, and transplanted seedlings grew slowly but survived well in all gap sizes. By contrast, emergence and survival of Trema seedlings occurred only in the large gaps and transplants died in small gaps. Survival of Cecropia seedlings was intermediate between Trema and Miconia in the small gaps and growth was greater than either species in the large gaps.
   4 Herbivore exclosures reduced foliar herbivory on all three species. The median lifespan of Trema seedlings in small gaps was reduced when the seedlings were exposed to herbivores, but survival of the other species was not affected by the exclosure treatment in either gap size. The growth of Miconia seedlings was lower outside exclosures in both gap sizes.
   5 Differences in germination and establishment could generate the contrasting gap size distributions observed between Miconia and Trema, but they are partially offset by measured differences in seed bank density. However, patterns of seedling growth and survival reinforce differences among species at the establishment phase and provide a mechanism for the observed differences in gap size distribution at the sapling stage. 'Cross-overs' in species growth rates result in specialization to different environments and reduce their survival in unfavourable conditions. We found no evidence for a definitive influence of herbivory as a mechanism driving differences in gap size distribution among species.

AB The characteristics of nitrogen acquisition, transport and assimilation were investigated in species of an Atlantic Forest succession over calcareous soil in south-eastern Brazil. Differences in behaviour were observed within the regeneration guilds. Pioneer species showed high leaf nitrogen contents, a high capacity to respond to increased soil nitrogen availability, a high capacity for leaf nitrate assimilation and were characterized by the transport of nitrate + asparagine. At the other end of the succession, late secondary species had low leaf nitrogen contents, little capacity to respond to increased soil nitrogen availability, low leaf nitrate assimilation and were active in the transport of asparagine + arginine. The characteristics of nitrogen nutrition in some early secondary species showed similarities to those of pioneer species whereas others more closely resembled late secondary species. Average leaf delta(15)N values increased along the successional gradient. The results indicate that the nitrogen metabolism characteristics of species may be an additional ecophysiological tool in classifying tropical forest tree species into ecological guilds, and may have implications for regeneration programmes in degraded areas.

ID BIODIVERSITY; FRAGMENTS
AB We investigated the influence of anthropogenic disturbance on the structure of arboreal Formicidae communities in SE Asian lowland forests. Included were a primary forest and three disturbed forests which had been cut for crop planting and abandoned 5, 15, and 40 yr after agricultural use for natural regeneration. Ant communities of at least 10 individuals of one tree species were sampled from each forest type by fogging. Diversity and community structure differed clearly among forest types. During the course of forest regeneration ant communities became more and more similar to those of the primary forest. A surrogate analysis shows that ant communities of the primary forest cannot be distinguished from randomly composed communities. This is in contrast to the theoretical expectations according to which ant communities should be structured by interspecific competition that lead to a large degree of predictability. However, a deterministic pattern of ant communities is found in the disturbed forest. This indicates that human disturbance not only changes the faunistic composition of ant communities but could also change the dynamics of the whole system. The transition from stochastic to deterministic communities might be of general importance for understanding the mechanisms structuring communities in disturbed habitats.

AB We compared the density and spatial distribution of four small mammal species (Microtus ochrogaster, Peromyscus maniculatus, Sigmodon hispidus, and P. leucopus) along with general measures of an old field plant community across two successional phases (1984-1986 and 1994-1996) of an experimental study of fragmentation in eastern Kansas. During the early phase the plant community was characterized by little spatial or temporal variance across patch size, consistent with spatially neutral models of succession. In contrast? there was a strong, species-specific effect of patch size on small mammal species distribution and abundance. The lack of variance in vegetation structure across patch size during the early seres suggests that small mammal distributions were responding in large part to features of the system other than variance in vegetation structure and composition across patch size.
   As succession proceeded, the colonization of the system by woody plant species precipitated a series of patch size effects on plant community composition. Differential habitat selection by small mammals at the patch scale tracked these changes in plant distribution. For example, M. ochrogaster and S. hispidus shifted their distributions away from less fragmented patches toward smaller patches, where retarded plant succession had maintained an earlier sere. P. leucopus successfully colonized and maintained high densities only on large patches, where plant succession had progressed most rapidly toward a woody-species-dominated community.
   Our results highlight the role of landscape structure in long-term community dynamics and indicate that some of the complexity observed in successional systems may result from the structure and composition of the landscape mosaic. In general, our results suggest that to fully understand long-term change within communities, influence of landscape structure on patterns of heterogeneity in both vegetation and consumer dynamics must be understood. Moreover, the long-term and landscape-scale perspectives afforded by our study provide insight into community dynamics that might otherwise be missed.

AB To determine the sources of dispersed seeds I inserted unique tags in fallen Aglaia aff. flavida seeds before dwarf cassowaries (Casuarius bennetti) ate the fruits containing the seeds. Thirty naturally-dispersitd. marked seeds were re-located in cassowary droppings in a 100 ha study area. The distribution of seed dispersal distances did not differ significantly from a normal distribution with a mean dispersal distance of 388 m, SD=196.8. Mean distance of dispersed seeds to nearest mature conspecific tree was 170 m, SD=108.4: dispersed seeds usually landed closer to other conspecifics than their parent. The estimated distribution of all seeds (including many undispersed seeds) was leptokurtic, creating high densities near source trees (>0.035 seeds m(-2) within 100 m of bole) that quickly tapered off (<0.002 seeds m(-2) >100 m from the bole); any density dependent effects are liable to be manifest only near parent trees.
   Cassowary movement patterns and resting behavior caused non-random dispersal of seeds. Seeds were preferentially moved to level sites uphill from their source trees along routes that did not cross steep terrain, Undispersed seeds generally landed downhill from source trees. This population of Aglaia would probably contract downhill into smaller, fragmented populations in the absence of cassowary-mediated dispersal.

TI Fire regime in the Brazilian Savanna: Recent changes, policy and

AB In 2019 Brazil recorded the highest wildland fire occurrence South America has seen for the last 15 years. Added to the Amazon, the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) faces changes in fire regimes. Climatic changes and the recent weakening of environmental law enforcement are factors, but historic and large-scale trends and drivers of fire regimes must be analyzed. We discuss ecological and policy drivers of recent changes in fire regimes in the Cerrado, in order to highlight management strategies. The Cerrado has evolved with natural fires and anthropogenic fires are also common for millennia. In the past 50 years, wildfires tend to be concentrated in the late dry season and to occur every two / three years, causing serious damage in fire-sensitive vegetation. Apart from climatic variations, the drivers of wildfires are deforestation and fire suppression policies. Nearly half of the original vegetation of the Cerrado biome has disappeared largely due to agribusiness expansion. Fire is associated with deforestation in two ways: vegetation conversion to monocultures, and lack of fire management in the remaining native vegetation. Indeed, the attempts to exclude fires from this fire-prone ecosystem disrupted traditional fire management. Fire suppression policies lead to increased wildfire risks due to fuel load and the multiplication of sources of ignition (conflicts, roads). The recent advances in Integrated Fire Management in protected areas in the Cerrado are evident. However, the recent budget cuts by the Brazilian government in environmental management and research undermine the chances of decreasing occurrences of wildfires in this biodiversity hotspot.

AB Understanding vegetation dynamics and its response to climate changes is important for revealing the mechanisms of terrestrial ecosystem behaviour, predicting future vegetation growth, and thus guiding environmental management. The Jing River Basin (JRB) and the Beiluo River Basin (BLRB), two typical ecoenvironmentally vulnerable regions on the Loess Plateau in China, were selected as case study regions. Based on long-term Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets, the time-lag relationships between NDVI and climatic factors (precipitation/temperature) as well as teleconnection factors (large-scale modes of climate variability and solar activity) were revealed. Additionally, ridge regression models were established to quantitatively explore the response of vegetation dynamics to climate change. Results indicate that: (1) NDVI in autumn showed significantly increasing trend (p < 0.01), whereas that in spring and summer was insignificant; (2) there was a time-lag of more than one month between spring/winter NDVI and precipitation/temperature behaviour, and summer NDVI exhibited no lag with temperature but a one month lag with precipitation; (3) regarding the time-lag effects, precipitation was the driving factor of NDVI variations in spring, whereas sunspots dominated NDVI variations in autumn; (4) when time-lagged teleconnection factors were considered, the explanation of the climate effect on the vegetation dynamics in three seasons all relatively increased by > 95%, which indicates that the prediction accuracy of NDVI was significantly improved; (5) in summer, time-lagged climatic and teleconnection factors explained < 20% of NDVI variations, whereas when soil moisture and base flow were considered, the explanation of NDVI changes in the JRB and BLRB relatively increased by 37.4% and 65.1%, respectively. These findings highlight that considering the time-lag effect of climatic and teleconnection factors has important significance for the accurate monitoring of underlying surface dynamics under changing environment.

AB Islands are geographically defined as land masses completely surrounded by water, and island systems have been used as models for many biogeographic, ecological, and evolutionary theories ever since Darwin's pioneering efforts. However, their biological definition is complex. Over the past few decades these theories have been applied to many study systems that only share some geographic features with island systems. These features include spatial fragmentation, limited area, spatial and temporal isolation from adjacent parts of the system, and low connectivity between different parts within the system, to mention just a few. These systems vary in their form, the matrix that surrounds them, the factors defining their borders, the extent of insularity they impose on the different taxa, and their geological similarity to different types of actual islands. Here, I seek to understand whether such island-like systems (ILS) function biologically as true islands. In the first part, I describe the wide diversity of ILS suggested in the literature and the variation in the features that define their insularity. In the second part, I review the extent to which the main theories of island biology are applicable to these systems: species-area and species-isolation relationships, community composition, evolutionary radiations, and the extent of endemism and genetic diversity. In the third and final part, I suggest a new conceptual framework within which to classify and study the biology of ILS, as well as practical future research directions. I conclude that the term 'biological island' is a multi-faceted concept, loosely related to its geographical definition. As ILS are often less isolated than true islands, and their biological patterns are only partly similar to those of true islands (and even this is true only for some ILS) the use of the term 'island' to describe any isolated habitat is therefore inappropriate.

AB A key element missing from many predictive models of the impacts of climate change on intertidal ectotherms is the role of individual behaviour. In this synthesis, using littorinid snails as a case study, we show how thermoregulatory behaviours may buffer changes in environmental temperatures. These behaviours include either a flight response, to escape the most extreme conditions and utilize warmer or cooler environments; or a fight response, where individuals modify their own environments to minimize thermal extremes. A conceptual model, generated from studies of littorinid snails, shows that various flight and fight thermoregulatory behaviours may allow an individual to widen its thermal safety margin (TSM) under warming or cooling environmental conditions and hence increase species' resilience to climate change. Thermoregulatory behaviours may also buffer sublethal fitness impacts associated with thermal stresses. Through this synthesis, we emphasize that future studies need to consider not only animals' physiological limits but also their capacities to buffer the impact of climate change through behavioural responses. Current generalizations, made largely on physiological limits of species, often neglect the buffering effects of behaviour and may, therefore, provide an over-estimation of vulnerability, and consequently poor prediction of the potential impacts of climate change on intertidal ectotherms.

AB Deforestation in Amazon is expected to decrease evapotranspiration (ET) and to increase soil moisture and river discharge under prevailing energy-limited conditions. The magnitude and sign of the response of ET to deforestation depend both on the magnitude and regional patterns of land-cover change (LCC), as well as on climate change and CO2 levels. On the one hand, elevated CO2 decreases leaf-scale transpiration, but this effect could be offset by increased foliar area density. Using three regional LCC scenarios specifically established for the Brazilian and Boli-vian Amazon, we investigate the impacts of climate change and deforestation on the surface hydrology of the Amazon Basin for this century, taking 2009 as a reference. For each LCC scenario, three land surface models (LSMs), LPJmLDGVM, INLAND-DGVM and ORCHIDEE, are forced by bias-corrected climate simulated by three general circulation models (GCMs) of the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4). On average, over the Amazon Basin with no deforestation, the GCM results indicate a temperature increase of 3.3 degrees C by 2100 which drives up the evaporative demand, whereby precipitation increases by 8.5%, with a large uncertainty across GCMs. In the case of no deforestation, we found that ET and runoff increase by 5.0 and 14 %, respectively. However, in south-east Amazonia, precipitation decreases by 10% at the end of the dry season and the three LSMs produce a 6% decrease of ET, which is less than precipitation, so that runoff decreases by 22%. For instance, the minimum river discharge of the Rio Tapajos is reduced by 31% in 2100. To study the additional effect of deforestation, we prescribed to the LSMs three contrasted LCC scenarios, with a forest decline going from 7 to 34% over this century. All three scenarios partly offset the climate-induced increase of ET, and runoff increases over the entire Amazon. In the southeast, however, deforestation amplifies the decrease of ET at the end of dry season, leading to a large increase of runoff (up to + 27% in the extreme deforestation case), offsetting the negative effect of climate change, thus balancing the decrease of low flows in the Rio Tapajos. These projections are associated with large uncertainties, which we attribute separately to the differences in LSMs, GCMs and to the uncertain range of deforestation. At the subcatchment scale, the uncertainty range on ET changes is shown to first depend on GCMs, while the uncertainty of runoff projections is predominantly induced by LSM structural differences. By contrast, we found that the uncertainty in both ET and runoff changes attributable to uncertain future deforestation is low.

AB Forests >80 m tall have the highest biomass, and individual trees in these forests are Earth's largest with deep crowns emerging above neighboring vegetation, but it is unclear to what degree these maxima depend on the emergent trees themselves or a broader-scale forest structure. Here we advance the concept of emergent facilitation, whereby emergent trees benefit co-occurring species. Trees reorganize foliage within crowns to optimize available light and, if long-lived, can reiterate after crown dam,age to become emergent. The height, depth, and spacing of emergent trees in turn allows for abundant light to pass through the canopy, leading to light-use complementarity as well as elevated biomass, leaf area, and species diversity of the forest as a whole. We chose Sequoia sempervirens to develop this concept and installed eleven 1-ha plots in old-growth forests spanning nearly six degrees of latitude in California. Each plot was based off a 316-m-long centerline where biomass and leaf area of all vegetation were quantified. We employed hierarchical measurements and stratified random sampling spanning the full size range of individuals to generate 180 equations for determining biomass and leaf area of all dominant plant species in these forests. Biomass (5190 Mg ha(-1)), leaf area (LAI = 19.4), and aboveground carbon (2600 Mg ha(-1)) are global maxima, occurring in plots with the highest proportion of emergent trees. Decay-resistant Sequoia heartwood contributes the bulk of this mass, ranging from 61.5 to 76.7% of plot totals. Heartwood is a key contributor to the development of trees with emergent crowns, since its durability enables trees to recover leaf area and to re-grow crowns after damage so that they can continue expanding for millennia. By distributing leaf area among fewer trees with deeper crowns, Sequoia maintains very high leaf area itself (LAI up to 14.5) while simultaneously allowing other species to flourish underneath (non-Sequoia LAI up to 8.0). Because Sequoia is not replaced by other species, aboveground biomass, leaf area, and carbon content of these forests are essentially asymptotic over time. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Understanding the mechanisms enabling coevolution in complex mutualistic networks remains a central challenge in evolutionary biology. We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that a tropical plant species has the capacity to discriminate among floral visitors, investing in reproduction differentially across the pollinator community. After we standardized pollen quality in 223 aviary experiments, successful pollination of Heliconia tortuosa (measured as pollen tube abundance) occurred frequently when plants were visited by long-distance traplining hummingbird species with specialized bills ((x) over bar pollen tubes = 1.21 +/- 0.12 SE) but was reduced 5.7 times when visited by straight-billed territorial birds (x pollen tubes = 0.20 +/- 0.074 SE) or insects. Our subsequent experiments revealed that plants use the nectar extraction capacity of tropical hummingbirds, a positive function of bill length, as a cue to turn on reproductively. Furthermore, we show that hummingbirds with long bills and high nectar extraction efficiency engaged in daily movements at broad spatial scales (similar to 1 km), but that territorial species moved only short distances (< 100 m). Such pollinator recognition may therefore affect mate selection and maximize receipt of high-quality pollen from multiple parents. Although a diffuse pollinator network is implied, because all six species of hummingbirds carry pollen of H. tortuosa, only two species with specialized bills contribute meaningfully to its reproduction. We hypothesize that this pollinator filtering behavior constitutes a crucial mechanism facilitating coevolution in multispecies plant-pollinator networks. However, pollinator recognition also greatly reduces the number of realized pollinators, thereby rendering mutualistic networks more vulnerable to environmental change.

AB Reforestation and afforestation often takes place in the form of monocultures. These have increasingly come under criticism due to their greater susceptibility to adverse environmental conditions and pathogens and because of the negative long-term impacts they have on soil fertility. Moreover, reservations have frequently been expressed as to whether monoculture is the only way to maximize biomass productivity. Subtropical forests in China are not only rich in tree species but are also diverse in terms of topography. However, historical clear-cutting and the high demand for wood have meant that considerable areas of these forests have been degraded or lost entirely. In recent years, great efforts have been made in subtropical China to restore and afforest vast areas. Nonetheless, conifer monoculture plantations are still prevalent owing to the lack of data on the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning and the limited knowledge of the growth performance of native broad-leaved tree species in plantations in this region. In this study, we investigated the growth response of individual tree saplings in a large-scale forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment established in a highly heterogeneous environment in subtropical China (BEF-China). The experiment was established during the period November 2008 to April 2009 and incorporates a species pool of 24 tree species across 261 plots (0.067 ha each) and a broad richness gradient with 1-24 species per plot. Annual growth rates of tree height, stem diameter and crown width for 6723 saplings of 24 species in the third year after establishment were used as response variables. We analyzed the effects of initial size, local abiotic site conditions and local neighborhood on growth performance using mixed effects models. Initial size, local topographic (aspect, slope, curvature, elevation) and edaphic variables (total nitrogen, C/N ratio) as well as local neighborhood variables (competition index, Shannon index) were included as fixed effects. Random effects were plot and species identity. The results showed that growth performance of tree saplings was markedly species-specific and strongly affected by initial size and local site conditions. In this early stage of the experiment, local Shannon diversity did not yet explain a significant amount of variation in sapling growth. However, the significant effect of the increasing size of neighboring trees indicated that tree-tree interactions had already occurred. A greater investment in height growth at the expense of diameter growth suggested that light intercept is the priority for tree sapling growth. This study stresses the importance of better understanding the effects of local site conditions on initial growth in mixed-species plantations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Habitat fragmentation is a major driver of species loss. Here we test the hypotheses that high tree diversity in a large deciduous forest enhances bird diversity and nest survival. We further expect that forest edges support higher bird diversity when different habitat types adjoin, whereas nest predation is not higher, because the large forest area mitigates potential edge effects. We studied how edge-centre differences and tree diversity (beech-dominated vs. tree-species rich) affect the bird community and survival rates of ground breeding birds' nests based on an artificial nest predation experiment in the Hainich National Park, Germany. We surveyed birds three times during the breeding season. We selected six forest stands with low tree diversity (i.e. dominated by beech) and six with high tree diversity (i.e. tree-species rich). Each forest stand contained four bird survey plots (plot 1: 0-30 m, plot 2: 60-90 m, plot 3: 120-150 m and plot 4: 180-210 m distant from edge; altogether 48 bird survey plots). Additionally each plot corner contained one artificial ground nest baited with one Blue-breasted Quail egg and one plasticine egg for eight days of exposure in the middle of the breeding season. Bird abundance and diversity were higher in the first 30 m of the forest. Bird diversity, including ground breeding birds, was also enhanced by higher percentages of bushes, which can provide enhanced food supply, perches as well as sheltering. Nest predation showed no edge effect, supporting the idea that small area of forest fragments causes more important negative effects than the edge in large forest remnants. Predation rates were higher in tree-species rich stands compared to beech-dominated stands, probably due to greater diversity and density of mammalian predators. Edge effects shaped the bird community composition and positively affected abundances of tree and shrub breeding birds, but did not affect ground breeders and the nest predation of ground nests. Shrub breeders accumulating in forest edges might, however, suffer more from nest predation in forest fragments. In conclusion, bird diversity and avian egg predation were affected by both forest edges and tree diversity in surprisingly different ways. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The importance of photodegradation in surface litter decomposition has recently been recognized in arid and semi-arid terrestrial ecosystems, yet its importance in decomposing dense litter and the mechanisms through which it acts remain unclear. We investigated how ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure and litter position affected decomposition processes in a California annual grassland. In a split-plot design, we exposed Bromus diandrus litter to two levels of UV radiation (UV pass and UV block) at two aboveground locations (at the top, suspended above the litter layer, and at the bottom of the litter layer) for 1 year. We found that UV radiation increased the litter decay constant by 23% at the top location over 1 year, consistent with the occurrence of photodegradation. Surprisingly, UV radiation also increased the litter decay constant by 30% at the bottom location over 1 year. We speculate that photodegradation indirectly increased microbial decomposition through priming effects. Overall, litter in the top location had a 29% higher decay constant than litter in the bottom location. In terms of litter chemistry, exposure to UV radiation increased loss of hemicellulose by 26%, but not loss of lignin. Litter in the bottom location exhibited greater loss of the cell solubles fraction and greater nitrogen immobilization, but lower loss of hemicellulose than litter in the top location. Our results demonstrate that litter position significantly regulates the contribution of photodegradation to overall decomposition, both through direct (top location) and indirect (bottom location) effects. Therefore, better quantification of both direct and indirect effects of photodegradation can greatly improve understanding of biogeochemical cycling in grasslands.

AB The ecology of forest and savanna trees species will largely determine the structure and dynamics of the forest-savanna boundaries, but little is known about the constraints to leaf trait variation imposed by selective forces and evolutionary history during the process of savanna invasion by forest species. We compared seasonal patterns in leaf traits related to leaf structure, carbon assimilation, water, and nutrient relations in 10 congeneric species pairs, each containing one savanna species and one forest species. All individuals were growing in dystrophic oxisols in a fire-protected savanna of Central Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that forest species would be more constrained by seasonal drought and nutrient-poor soils than their savanna congeners. We also hypothesized that habitat, rather than phylogeny, would explain more of the interspecific variance in leaf traits of the studied species. We found that throughout the year forest trees had higher specific leaf area (SLA) but lower integrated water use efficiency than savanna trees. Forest and savanna species maintained similar values of predawn and midday leaf water potential along the year. Lower values were measured in the dry season. However, this was achieved by a stronger regulation of stomatal conductance and of CO2 assimilation on an area basis (A (area)) in forest trees, particularly toward the end of the dry season. Relative to savanna trees, forest trees maintained similar (P, K, Ca, and Mg) or slightly higher (N) leaf nutrient concentrations. For the majority of traits, more variance was explained by phylogeny, than by habitat of origin, with the exception of SLA, leaf N concentration, and A (area), which were apparently subjected to different selective pressures in the savanna and forest environments. In conclusion, water shortage during extended droughts would be more limiting for forest trees than nutrient-poor soils.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Information regarding the use of beneficial, native Brazilian plants was compiled by European naturalists during the 19th century. The German botanist C.F.P. von Martius was one of the most prominent naturalists and described the use of several Brazilian plants.
   Aim of the study: To present data on Amazonian medicinal plants documented by von Martius in his books.
   Materials and methods: Data on Amazonian medicinal plants were obtained from three books published by von Martius. Traditional information about these plants was translated from Latin and the cited plant species reorganised according to current taxonomic criteria. Correlated pharmacological studies were obtained from different scientific databases.
   Results: A total of 92 native medicinal species from the Amazon were recorded in von Martius' books. These accounts described 117 different medical uses for these plants. Several parts of the plants were used, including many exudates. The principal use of the species recorded was the treatment of dermatological problems, followed by gastro-intestinal, urinary and respiratory disorders. Few species were recorded as purgatives and febrifuges, a result that differs from the observations of other naturalists. The efficacy of the recorded traditional uses has been confirmed for the few species that have been subjected to laboratory studies.
   Conclusion: The data recorded by the German naturalist von Martius represent a rich, unexplored source of information about the traditional uses of Brazilian plants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental indicators can be used to evaluate natural recovery processes. Although several studies have used ant assemblage metrics as environmental indicators, few try to explain the response of these insect assemblages to forest recovery. Thus, we carried out a vertical ant sampling design to verify the sensitivity of ant assemblages from different microhabitats (epigeic, arboreal and hypogeic) to natural forest recovery. We also verified whether changes to the diversity measures (species richness, composition and evenness) of these assemblages could be predictable and explained by changes in the resource quantity and conditions, and structural and resource heterogeneity that also occur along the natural forest recovery gradient. Additionally, we verified the potential of ant species as indicators of forest recovery. We sampled ants in a pasture and seven forest remnants with different recovery times that represent a forest recovery gradient along a chronosequence. Although, the non response of species richness and evenness, species composition changed along the recovery gradient and the dissimilarity between the ant species composition of pasture and forest habitats increased with the age of the forest remnant. This was supported by ant species indicators of pasture and forest areas pointed out by the IndVal test. The variation of ant species composition of the two groups of habitat types (pasture and forest) could be explained by the different responses of open habitat and forest specialist ants to the increase in vegetation cover along the recovery gradient. Therefore, species composition and indicator species by habitat type seems to be the most predictable data for the use of ants in environmental monitoring programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent energy and climate policies, particularly in the developed world, have increased demand for bioenergy(2) as an alternative, which has led to both direct and indirect land-use changes and an array of environmental and socio-economic concerns. A comprehensive understanding of the land-use dynamics of bioenergy crop production is essential for the development of sustainable bioenergy and land-use policies. In this paper, we review the patterns and dynamics of land-use change associated with bioenergy crops (hereafter referred to as 'bioenergy-driven land-use change'). The review focuses on four regions as the most prominent locations in which these patterns and changes occur: Brazil; Indonesia and Malaysia; the United States of America (U.S.A.); and the European Union (EU). The review confirms that bioenergy-driven land-use change has affected and will impact most severely on the 'land- and resource-abundant' developing regions, such as Brazil, where economic development takes priority over sustainable land-use policies, and the enforcement capability is limited. Opportunities for more effective policy are available through the development of international climate change policy (e.g. REDD under the UNFCCC), and certification criteria for sustainable bioenergy products (e.g. EU RED). However, bioenergy produced from no and/or less land-using feedstocks (e.g. wastes and residues), and their associated technologies must be given higher priority to minimise bioenergy-driven land-use change and its negative impacts.

TI Edge effects and their influence on habitat suitability calculations: a
   continuous approach applied to birds of the Atlantic forest
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Atlantic forest; birds; distance gradients; ecotone; edge effect;
   habitat suitability
ID RAIN; RESPONSES
AB 1. The suitability of human-modified habitats for native species and the response of species to habitat edges are two important ecological processes that affect species and communities in fragmented landscapes. However, field studies generally analyse these two processes separately. We extended a recently proposed continuous approach to link these two processes, using empirical data from birds of the Atlantic forest in Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil.
   2. We tested different models for describing the responses of birds (both forest and open-habitat species) to the interior-exterior gradient within different edge types (ecotones). We used two types of data: the first originated from a large data set collected at regional scale using the point-count method and the second originated from a detailed local telemetry study of three bird species.
   3. For both data sets, these models successfully described the responses to edges of the majority of species and assemblages and significantly influenced the calculated habitat suitability in both native and anthropogenic habitats. Edge effects were seen in the majority of species; however, the magnitude of these effects was influenced by the ecotone type. At the assemblage level, more species avoided edges in the ecotone with tree plantations compared with open habitats.
   4. The effect of edges on the calculated habitat suitability was either positive or negative, depending on the function that best described the response of the species to edges and whether they avoided edges or penetrated into the less-preferred habitat. In general, forest species penetrated deeper into tree plantations but moved only short distances into open habitats.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate the impact of edge effects on bird species and communities in fragmented landscapes. Furthermore, the differential penetration capacity of the native forest birds into anthropogenic habitats shows the importance of using a continuous approach to calculate habitat suitability; classic calculation (without considering the distance to the preferred habitat) is likely to bias the calculated suitability and permeability of the hostile matrix and affect our estimations of connectivity.

AB Habitat fragmentation often arises from human-induced alterations to the matrix that reduce or eliminate dispersal between habitat patches. Elimination of dispersal increases local extinction and decreases recolonization. These phenomena were observed in the eastern collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris collaris), which lives in the mid-continental highland region of the Ozarks (Missouri, USA) on glades: habitats of exposed bedrock that form desert-like habitats imbedded in a woodland matrix. With the onset of woodland fire suppression, glade habitats degenerated and the woodland matrix was altered to create a strong barrier to dispersal. By 1980, lizard populations in the Ozarks were rapidly going extinct. In response to this decline, some glades were restored by clearing and burning. Starting in 1984, collared lizard populations were translocated onto these restored habitats. The translocated populations persisted but did not colonize nearby glades or disperse among one another. In 1994 prescribed woodland fires were initiated, which unleashed much dispersal and colonizing behavior. Dispersal was highly nonrandom by both intrinsic variables (age, gender) and extrinsic variables (overall demography, glade population sizes, glade areas, landscape features), resulting in different classes of lizards being dominant in creating demographic cohesiveness among glades, colonizing new glades on a mountain, and colonizing new mountain systems. A dramatic transition was documented from isolated fragments, to a nonequilibrium colonizing metapopulation, and finally to a stable metapopulation. This transition is characterized by the convergence of rates of extinction and recolonization and a major alteration of dispersal probabilities and pattern in going from the nonequilibrium to stable metapopulation states.

AB Subsistence hunting provides a crucial food source for rural populations in tropical forests, but it is often practiced unsustainably. We use the empirical observation that subsistence hunters are central-place foragers to develop three "bio-demographic'' hunting models of increasing complexity and realism for assessing the sustainability of hunting of an indicator species. In all our models, we calculate the spatial pattern of depletion of an indicator species (here, a large-bodied primate) across a landscape. Specifically, we show how to identify the area surrounding a human settlement that is expected to suffer local extinction. Our approach is an improvement over well-known sustainability indices of hunting, which are prone to error and do not provide clear links to policy prescriptions. Our first approach models the long-term effect of a single settlement and (1) can be parameterized with easily obtainable field data (such as settlement maps and knowledge of the major weapon used), (2) is simple enough to be used without requiring technical skill, and (3) reveals the asymptotic relationship between local human density and the level of game depletion. Our second model allows multiple settlements with overlapping hunting zones over large spatial scales. Our third model additionally allows temporal changes in human population size and distribution and source-sink dynamics in game populations. Using transect and hunting data from two Amazonian sites, we show that the models accurately predict the spatial distribution of primate depletion. To make these methods accessible, we provide software-based tools, including a toolbox for ArcGIS, to assist in managing and mapping the spatial extent of hunting. The proposed application of our models is to allow the quantitative assessment of settlement stabilization approaches to managing hunting in Amazonia.

ID PHOSPHATASE-ACTIVITY; RHIZOSPHERE; FRACTIONS; RELEASE
AB Low-molecular-weight organic acids are considered to be effective in the release of inorganic phosphorus (P) but their effectiveness to mobilize organic P is not well understood. The aim of this study was to examine the role of three common organic acids (maleic, oxalic, and citric acids) in mobilizing organic P in forest soils. Soil samples tested in this study were collected from either native or plantation forests in subtropical and tropical Australia with 16-87% of soil total P being in organic form. At a concentration of 10 mM organic acid kg(-1) soil, all three organic acids did not enhance the release of inorganic P as compared with water, whereas the three organic acids displayed different capacities in mobilizing organic P. Citric acid significantly enhanced the solubilization of organic P by 34.7% as compared with water; whereas no significant differences were observed in the mobilization of organic P among maleic acid, oxalic acids, and water. The amount of organic P solubilized by citric acid was not correlated with soil pH but increased with increasing soil organic P as the values were below 200 mg kg.(-1) The possible mechanisms of the effective mobilization of organic P by citric acid were discussed. Our results implied that organic P might play an important role in P nutrition of plants in subtropical and tropical forests due to its substantial proportion in soil P and the effective mobilization by organic acids.

AB Question: Are vines light-demanding species?
   Location: Temperate evergreen rain forest of southern Chile (40 degrees 39'S, 72 degrees 11'W).
   Methods: In 45 plots of 25 m(2) distributed in treefall canopy gaps, secondary forest stands and old-growth forest (15 plots per light environment), all climbing and non-supported vines were counted and identified to species level, and canopy openness was quantified using hemispherical photographs. Vine abundance and diversity (species richness and Simpson's index) were compared in the three light environments and similarity between vine communities was estimated using Jaccard's similarity coefficient. We also determined the relationship between light niche breadth and local dominance at the species level.
   Results: In total there were 2510 vine individuals of 14 species. Canopy openness was significantly different in the three light environments. Species richness, diversity, community composition and density of vines were similar in treefall gaps, secondary and old-growth forest. Of the seven more common vine species, which accounted for 91% of all vines, three had even distribution, two were more abundant in the shaded understorey, and two had higher density in well-lit sites. Local dominance of vine species and niche breadth were not significantly associated.
   Conclusions: Our study in a temperate rain forest questions the widespread notion of vines as pioneer-like species, which may be a consequence of the abundance of some lianas in disturbed sites of tropical forests. Functional arguments are needed to justify a general hypothesis on light requirements of vines, which constitute a vast group of species.

AB Studies of responses of forest vegetation to steadily increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have focussed strongly on the potential of trees to absorb extra carbon; the effects of elevated [CO2] on plant-soil water relations via decreased stomatal conductance and increased ambient temperature have received less attention, but may be significant in the long term at the ecosystem level. CO2 augmentation experiments with young trees demonstrate small increases in aboveground carbon content, but these increases tend to diminish as trees get older. By contrast, several experiments suggest continued decreases in transpiration and increased soil water content under these conditions. In tropical forests, the major cause of increases in aboveground biomass observed in the recent past is not necessarily elevated [CO2]. Undoubtedly, the potential of monitoring trees in forest dynamics plots to deduce CO2-specific alterations in forest structure and standing biomass will unfold in the decades to come. The comprehensive understanding of responses of forest vegetation to elevated [CO2] in the Anthropocene will depend upon the inclusion of detailed measurements of soil water pools and water fluxes through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in future tree CO2 augmentation experiments and forest dynamics plot studies.

   NATURAL INSURANCE; INTEGRATING COSTS; LOCAL PEOPLE; USE PATTERNS
AB This article examines the use of forests in a protected area by nearby agriculturalists in central Vietnam. Research indicates that the majority of rural farmers interviewed who lived near a state designated protected area were receiving both subsistence and cash incomes from forest-based activities, primarily from the collection of forest products. However, much of the collection of forest produce was officially illegal, as it occurred in state protected forests, and interdiction efforts were on the increase. Yet, little attention has been paid in Vietnam to the need for income substitution for households who lose access to forest produce as a result of conservation enforcement, particularly in the case of farmers who live near, but not in, protected areas; their resources use has been 'invisible' due to a lack of attention and research on the topic. This misunderstanding of the importance of forests to rural farmers has the potential to result in households facing adverse welfare and livelihood outcomes as protected areas boundaries are tightened, and local communities face increased opportunity costs due to stricter conservation enforcement. The article concludes that substitution for loss of income due to conservation activities would best be achieved through carefully targeted interventions to specific high-impact and high-dependency households. Additionally, investments in new sources of wage labor and other low capital-input activities, rather than in agriculture, would likely be of most benefit.

   PAYMENTS; DEFORESTATION; PROTECTION
AB Paying landowners to conserve forests is a promising new strategy to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services. However to succeed with this approach, programme managers need reliable monitoring data to make informed payment decisions. This includes withholding payment from landowners who do not meet conservation objectives. The monitoring method used for the Monarch Butterfly Conservation Fund compared aerial photographs and conducted field sampling to identify forest changes. The comparison of aerial photographs showed that 161 hectares of forest were degraded in the central core zone of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve in Mexico between 2001 and 2003. As a result, payment was withheld from one of 13 landowners. Analysis of high resolution (0.6 m) digital aerial photographs did not detect finer scale changes, despite obtaining an average pixel resolution 1000 times greater than Landsat satellite imagery. This suggests that current payment for ecosystem services programmes are underestimating environmental change and overpaying non-compliant participants. In addition, selecting a decision rule to enforce payment conditionality raised new questions about how much ecosystem degradation should be permitted before withholding payment. Sound decisions about withholding payment cannot be developed until the marginal value of ecosystem services is better understood. Until then, payment thresholds can be based on specific policy objectives.

AB 1. In the absence of wind, tree height is limited by elastic instability, which occurs when a tree becomes too spindly to erect itself when bent from the vertical. To assess the extent to which trees approach this limit and characterize species stature in diverse tropical forests, we measured tree dimensions in tall, dense forests at Lambir Hills, National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia and Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia. From these measurements we determined characteristic adult heights and trunk diameters for 91 species.
   2. Across all species, adult height scaled with adult diameter to the 2/3 power, as predicted for a column at its buckling limit. These heights were, on average, 65% of the buckling limit calculated for a cylindrical column with typical wood properties.
   3. At a given diameter, the species of Lambir were 9% taller than those of Pasoh, a pattern related to the greater rainfall and density of trees at Lambir.
   4. On the topographically rugged Lambir plot, large emergent trees were shorter on ridges than in hollows, whereas small, sheltered trees showed no relation between allometry and elevation.
   5. Thus, trees may approach gravitational limits to height in favourable environments for growth where there are large advantages of height for light interception and trees are sheltered from wind.

AB Recent debate about the fate of tropical forests has focused attention on the consequences of forest degradation and Fragmentation for their diversity and composition, and the likely functional consequences of these changes. Existing data suggest that the responses of tropical forest plant and animal communities to habitat change are idiosyncratic, although a few consistent patterns are emerging. In particular, it is apparent that conventional diversity and richness metrics may not adequately represent anthropogenic changes to community structure and organisation. A widespread trend is towards 'biotic homogenisation': while disturbed forests may often have an equal or even a greater number of species than undisturbed forests, these species are typically drawn from a restricted pool; and endemic, restricted-range or habitat-specialist species are most likely to decline or go extinct. Similarly, studies have documented marked changes in the structure of food webs, even where the richness and diversity of component species remains little altered. What are the likely consequences of such changes for the important ecosystem functions performed by biodiversity, Such as pollination and decomposition? Much of the extensive literature on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function is of limited utility for answering this question, because experimental designs do not consider species-specific contributions to ecosystem function, abundance, degree of redundancy, or extinction-proneness; and few Such studies have been carried out under realistic levels of diversity under field conditions, particularly in high-diversity ecosystems such as tropical forests. Furthermore, the focus has almost always been on richness as the explanatory variable, rather than the composition or structural attributes of communities. I briefly review recent papers that have begun to tackle these important issues, and consider how future research might help us understand the functional consequences of realistic changes to species composition and food-web 'biostructure' in tropical forests.

AB To understand how current patterns of habitat loss and fragmentation will ultimately affect ecosystem functioning, we need to match experimental manipulations of community structure with real changes occurring in the landscapes of today. In this study, we examine the consequences of habitat fragmentation on a key function: the decomposition of dung by invertebrates. In a microcosm experiment, we use previous observations of dung beetle assemblage structure in fragmented and intact landscapes to create realistic differences in assemblages of small, dung-dwelling species in the genus Aphodius. We ask whether such differences will affect ecosystem functioning, and how their effects compare to those of removing full functional groups: dung-dwelling Aphodius, tunnelling Geotrupes stercorarius, and/or earthworms. As measured by changes in dung fresh weight, we observe an overriding impact of removing G. stercorarius, with the amount of dung remaining at any one time doubling if the species is excluded. Compared to this major effect, there seem to be less effects of removing Aphodius, ambiguous effects of excluding earthworms, and no detectable effects of relatively minor changes in Aphodius assemblages as induced by current levels of fragmentation. Overall, our results support the general notion that different species contribute highly unevenly to overall ecosystem functioning. Most importantly though, our findings suggest that the functional consequences of habitat loss will depend on taxon-specific responses to landscape modification. Only by addressing these responses may we predict the actual consequences of habitat loss.

AB Tropical deforestation is the major contemporary threat to global biodiversity, because a diminishing extent of tropical forests supports the majority of the Earth's biodiversity. Forest clearing is often spatially concentrated in regions where human land use pressures, either planned or unplanned, increase the likelihood of deforestation. However, it is not a random process, but often moves in waves originating from settled areas. We investigate the spatial dynamics of land cover change in a tropical deforestation hotspot in the Colombian Amazon. We apply a forest cover zoning approach which permitted: calculation of colonization speed; comparative spatial analysis of patterns of deforestation and regeneration; analysis of spatial patterns of mature and recently regenerated forests; and the identification of local-level hotspots experiencing the fastest deforestation or regeneration. The colonization frontline moved at an average of 0.84 km yr(-1) from 1989 to 2002, resulting in the clearing of 3400 ha yr(-1) of forests beyond the 90% forest cover line. The dynamics of forest clearing varied across the colonization front according to the amount of forest in the landscape, but was spatially concentrated in well-defined 'local hotspots' of deforestation and forest regeneration. Behind the deforestation front, the transformed landscape mosaic is composed of cropping and grazing lands interspersed with mature forest fragments and patches of recently regenerated forests. We discuss the implications of the patterns of forest loss and fragmentation for biodiversity conservation within a framework of dynamic conservation planning.

AB Singapore Island suffered one of the highest known deforestation rates in the tropics from the mid-to-late 19th century when over 95% of its native lowland forest was cleared. We compared the current bird community structure and composition among three habitat types, i.e., old (>50 years, 7-935 ha) and young ( less than or equal to 50 years, 29-49 ha) naturally regenerating secondary forests and abandoned wooded plantations (27-102 ha) dominated by exotic species. Forest patch area had the strongest influence on the current species richness. The overall bird richness was not greater in most mature forest patches, but 20 species were only found in the old secondary forests and five of these were found in <50% of these patches. The rapid decrease in the number of forest species in plantations was offset by an increase in the number of open habitat species. Comparisons with current bird communities in nearby mainland forest sites (Peninsular Malaysia) suggest that the forest avifauna of Singapore is depauperate. The preservation of larger mature and maturing forests is therefore required for conserving the extant forest avifauna in Singapore. Connecting isolated patches can also be envisioned to facilitate movements of forest birds that have low densities and restricted distribution. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An understanding of the fundamental causes of the structure of primate communities is important for studies of primate evolutionary history, primate behavioral ecology, and development of conservation strategies. Research into these structuring factors has benefited from new perspectives such as consideration of primate phylogenetic history, metacommunities, and interactions with predators and nonprimate competitors. This review presents the underlying factors of primate community structure within the biogeographic regions of Madagascar, the Neotropics, Africa, and Asia. One of the major differences among these locations likely resulted from the initial primate taxa that colonized each region (a single colonization event in the case of Madagascar and South America, and multiple radiations of higher-level taxa in Africa and Asia). As most primates live in forests, the differences among the forests in these locations, caused by various climatic influences, further influenced speciation and the development of primate communities. Within these habitats, species interactions with different groups of organisms were also instrumental in developing community dynamics. Through an investigation of these fundamental factors, we identify some of the most important effects on primate communities in each region. These findings suggest that low primate richness in Asia may be caused by either the abundance of dipterocarp trees or high levels of monsoon rains. High numbers of frugivores and a lack of folivores in neotropical communities may be associated with competiton with sloths that were already present at the time of initial radiation. Climatic patterns which affect forest structure and productivity in Madagascar may be responsible for high numbers of folivorous lemurs. The identification of these factors are important for the conservation of existing primate communities, and indicate directions for future studies.

AB Edge creation has a pronounced influence on the understory vegetation, but the effects of edges on seedling species recruitment are still poorly understood. In Central Amazonia, 9-19 years after fragmentation, we recorded species richness and net seedling recruitment rate in I ha blocks exposed to none, one, or multiple edges within forest fragments. One-hectare blocks were located in the center (no edge), the edge (one edge), the corners (two edges) of 10 and 100 ha fragments, and in a I ha fragment (four edges). In 1991, we counted all tree seedlings 5-100 cm tall found within permanent 1 m(2) plots located within the I ha blocks. In May 1993, we manually removed all seedlings that were smaller than I in tall from the permanent plots. Six years and five months later (October 1999), all new seedlings recruited into the plots were counted and classified into distinct morphospecies. Species richness of recruited seedlings, scaled by total seedling density, declined from the center to the edge, the corner blocks, and then to the I ha fragment. Overall, the four-edged, I ha fragment had the poorest species richness and the non-edged 100 ha central block the highest. The total number of recruited individuals was 40 percent less than that previously present, with the 100 ha corner having the lowest recruitment. Pairwise comparisons showed that species similarity was related to edge number for the 100 and I ha fragments. Species rank/abundance curves showed that a subset of species was common in all blocks within the fragments, and that the 100 ha center held more rare species than any other I ha block. This study demonstrated that, in a given fragment patch, the number of tree seedling species recruited varied inversely with the number of edges.

AB Many species of neotropical rodents consume and subsequently disperse viable spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Consequently, rodents may be important determinants of both AMF and tree community composition in neotropical forests. We examined the influence of both availability of other food resources and season on the consumption and subsequent dispersal of AMF spores by Proechimys semispinosus (the Central American spiny rat) from seven island populations located in Gatun Lake, Panama over a 13-month period. For each island population, we examined the relationship between monthly spore occurrence in fecal pellets and monthly density of trees and lianas producing ripe fruit. During the last 3 months of this study, five islands were provisioned with extra food, while two islands remained unmanipulated to test experimentally whether spiny rats consumed AMF only as an alternative resource when primary resources (fruit) were scarce. Consumption of AMF was highly seasonal, with spores being most common in fecal samples at the end of the rainy season and least common at the end of the dry season. Cross-correlation analysis and logistic regression analysis indicated that spore occurrence in feces varied synchronously among islands and was related positively to soil moisture and unrelated to natural fruit availability. After inoculation with AMF spores isolated from feces, AMF colonized roots of Paspalum notatum (bahia grass) grown in sterilized soil, and total dry weights of host plants increased, confirming the viability of AMF spores passed by spiny rats. The ubiquity of viable spores from several species of AMF occurring in feces of P. semispinosus implicates this rodent as an important AMF disperser. Furthermore, dispersal of AMF spores by spiny rats was not limited to ephemeral periods of primary resource scarcity, thus suggesting that P. semispinosus may influence tree seedling survival by making spores of their mutualistic fungi available throughout the rainy season, a period critical to the establishment of newly germinated seedlings.

AB Disturbances are common phenomena that occurs in nature and significantly affects the dynamics of vegetation and plant populations. This paper shows that despite considerable progress in the theory of disturbances, for different authors the notion of disturbance has different meanings. The differences follow from an alternative understanding of the term, assumption of the holistic or reductionistic concept of the study or different approaches to equilibrium and non-equilibrium in nature. Different theoretical and methodological assumptions taken when analysing vegetation changes under the effect of disturbances allow relative arbitrariness in the interpretation of results. However, not all biotic interactions and ecological processes taking place in plant communities can be identified as disturbances. The effects of disturbances should be described on the basis of an objective assessment of what is normal for the functioning and stabilisation of a community as well as what disturbs and disrupts this equilibrium. Moreover, assuming the equivalent treatment of ecological systems, the interaction of the disturbing factors should be related to a specific level of life organisation (an individual, population or community), which would permit unambiguous discernment of the disturbance effects and finally generalise its effects on different levels of the hierarchical structure of vegetation.

AB To study the influence of gap structure and bamboo species on the regrowth of montane Atlantic forest, colonization by plants was characterized in 30 treefall gaps (30.3-500.5 m(2)). The study was conducted at Santa Virginia (45 degrees 30' W, 23 degrees 17' S), a 4970-ha reserve of Atlantic montane forest in southeastern Brazil. Area covered by bamboos ranged from 0% to 100% of gap area. Average height of surrounding canopies ranged from 12 to 30 m. As gap are covered by bamboo and average height of surrounding canopies increased, both density and richness of pioneer woody species decreased. Density and richness of shade-tolerant species were negatively influenced by gap area. Low-light-demanding species of Miconia, Leandra and Rapanea accounted for the majority of both pioneer species and individuals sampled, whereas high-light demanding pioneers of Cecropia, Alchornea and Tibouchina were poorly represented. We suggest that in the Atlantic montane forest bamboo species compete for gaps, excluding other light-demanding pioneers. This results in an overall reduction of pioneer species richness in the Atlantic forest.

AB Hermit crabs (Decapoda: Anomura) are typically omnivorous and are common on Caribbean coral reefs. Sponges are sessile, fleshy, and high in protein and energy content, yet hermit crabs do not appear to prey on them. Assays were performed with the Caribbean reef hermit crab Paguristes punticeps to determine whether secondary metabolites or skeletal elements of Caribbean sponges that were incorporated into artificial foods affected feeding. Of 30 sponge species assayed, 26 (87%) yielded organic extracts that deterred feeding by P. punticeps. There was substantial interspecific and intraspecific variability in patterns of chemical deterrence. Sponges of the families Axinellidae, Agelasidae, Aplysinidae, Aplysinellidae, and Thorectidae typically yielded deterrent extracts. Three common sponge species, Mycale laevis, Callyspongia vaginalis, and Niphates erecta, were consistently non-deterrent, while other species, including Spheciospongia othella, Chondrilla nucula, Callyspongia plicifera, Niphates digitalis, and Xestospongia muta, were variably deterrent. These results are in general agreement with those of a previous survey of Caribbean sponge chemical defenses using the common reef fish Thalassoma bifasciatum. However, some results differed: Geodia neptuni and Iotrochota birotulata were consistently palatable to T. bifasciatum, but were deterrent to P. punticeps. Several species that were consistently deterrent to T. bifasciatum were variably deterrent to P, punticeps, including Aplysina cauliformis, Aplysina fulva, Ircinia strobilina, Amphimedon compressa, and Mycale laxissima. Neither spicules (from Agelas clathrodes, Ectyoplasia ferox, and Xestospongia muta) nor spiculated spongin skeleton (from A. clathrodes and X. mute) deterred feeding by P. punticeps. Spicules and spiculated spongin were similarly non-deterrent to the fish T. bifasciatum in a previous survey. The results of this study further suggest that chemical defenses are important in the ecology of Caribbean sponges, while skeletal components do not serve an antipredatory function.

AB In Kerala, based on management systems, sacred groves can be categorised into three groups namely those managed by individual families, by groups of families and by the statutory agencies for temple management (Devaswom Board). Ollur Kavu, S.N. Puram Kavu and Iringole Kavu which represent above mentioned management systems, respectively, were studied far their tree species composition and vegetation structure. The study was also designed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of present management systems and role of different stakeholder groups in conserving the sacred groves. Of the three sacred groves, the one managed by individual family (Ollur Kavu) is highly disturbed as indicated by low stem density of mature trees (367 ha(-1)) and poor regeneration potential with the ratio between mature trees and saplings is 1:0.4. In order to quantify the level of disturbance in these sacred groves, Ramakrishnan index of stand quality (RISQ) was calculated. The values obtained for all the three tree layers (i.e., mature trees, saplings and seedlings) in single family managed sacred grove (Ollur Kavu) was between 2.265 and 2.731, an indicator of the dominance of light demanding species in the population, suggested that the grove is highly disturbed one. Whereas, other two sacred groves are less disturbed as indicated by lower 'RISQ' values (between 1.319 and 1.648). Iringole Kavu and S.N. Puram Kavu were compared with some other evergreen forests of the Western Ghats of India for the parameters like stem density, basal area and species diversity of trees (gbh greater than or equal to 10.1 cm). Values obtained for these parameters in the two sacred groves are within the range obtained for other forests. Stakeholder importance value index (SIVI) was calculated based on the attributes like the proximity of the stakeholder to the sacred grove, contribution of stakeholders in managing the sacred grove, benefits being enjoyed by the stakeholder due to involvement with sacred grove and attitude of the stakeholder group towards the conservation and management of sacred grove. This indicated that local people, temple trust and/ or sacred grove owners are the major stakeholders, while in general some other stakeholder groups such as youth clubs, schools, forest department, municipality and local Panchayat with lower SM are comparatively neutral in conserving and managing the groves. Some of the major strategies to be adopted are self-imposed complete ban on the removal of biomass for the revitalisation of ecosystem, creation of awareness among local people and all stakeholder groups, identification of the type of contribution a stakeholder group can offer in managing the sacred grove and encouragement of all stakeholders to participate without either directly or indirectly adversely affecting the ecosystem as well as the wisdom and interest of the major stakeholder groups.

AB Little is known about the forces that determine the assembly of diverse bacterial communities inhabiting drinking water treatment filters and how this affects drinking water quality. Two contrasting ecological theories can help to understand how natural microbial communities assemble; niche theory and neutral theory, where environmental deterministic factors or stochastic factors predominate respectively. This study investigates the development of the microbial community on two common contrasting filter materials (quartz sand and granular activated carbon-GAC), to elucidate the main factors governing their assembly, through the evaluation of environmental (i.e. filter medium type) and stochastic forces (random deaths, births and immigration). Laboratory-scale filter columns were used to mimic a rapid gravity filter; the microbiome of the filter materials, and of the filter influent and effluent, was characterised using next generation 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and flow-cytometry. Chemical parameters (i.e. dissolved organic carbon, trihalomethanes formation) were also monitored to assess the final effluent quality. The filter communities seemed to be strongly assembled by selection rather than neutral processes, with only 28% of those OTUs shared with the source water detected on the filter medium following predictions using a neutral community model. GAC hosted a phylogenetically more diverse community than sand. The two filter media communities seeded the effluent water, triggering differences in both water quality and community composition of the effluents. Overall, GAC proved to be better than sand in controlling microbial growth, by promoting higher bacterial decay rates and hosting less bacterial cells, and showed better performance for putative pathogen control by leaking less Legionella cells into the effluent water.

AB Ecosystems worldwide have a long history of use and management by indigenous cultures. However, environmental degradation can reduce the availability of culturally important resources. Ecological restoration aims to repair damage to ecosystems caused by human activity, but it is unclear how often restoration projects incorporate the return of harvesting or traditional life patterns for indigenous communities. We examined the incorporation of cultural use of natural resources into ecological restoration in the context of a culturally important but protected New Zealand bird; among award-winning restoration projects in Australasia and worldwide; and in the peer-reviewed restoration ecology literature. Among New Zealand's culturally important bird species, differences in threat status and availability for hunting were large. These differences indicate the values of a colonizing culture can inhibit harvesting by indigenous people. In Australasia among award-winning ecological restoration projects, <17% involved human use of restored areas beyond aesthetic or recreational use, despite many projects encouraging community participation. Globally, restoration goals differed among regions. For example, in North America, projects were primarily conservation oriented, whereas in Asia and Africa projects frequently focused on restoring cultural harvesting. From 1995 to 2014, the restoration ecology literature contained few references to cultural values or use. We argue that restoration practitioners are missing a vital component for reassembling functional ecosystems. Inclusion of sustainably harvestable areas within restored landscapes may allow for the continuation of traditional practices that shaped ecosystems for millennia, and also aid project success by ensuring community support.

AB Although the Amazon rainforest houses much of Earth's biodiversity and plays a major role in the global carbon budget, estimates of tree biodiversity originate from fewer than 1,000 forest inventory plots, and estimates of carbon dynamics are derived from fewer than 200 recensus plots. It is well documented that the pre-European inhabitants of Amazonia actively transformed and modified the forest in many regions before their population collapse around 1491 AD; however, the impacts of these ancient disturbances remain entirely unaccounted for in the many highly influential studies using Amazonian forest plots. Here we examine whether Amazonian forest inventory plot locations are spatially biased toward areas with high probability of ancient human impacts. Our analyses reveal that forest inventory plots, and especially forest recensus plots, in all regions of Amazonia are located disproportionately near archaeological evidence and in areas likely to have ancient human impacts. Furthermore, regions of the Amazon that are relatively oversampled with inventory plots also contain the highest values of predicted ancient human impacts. Given the long lifespan of Amazonian trees, many forest inventory and recensus sites may still be recovering from past disturbances, potentially skewing our interpretations of forest dynamics and our understanding of how these forests are responding to global change. Empirical data on the human history of forest inventory sites are crucial for determining how past disturbances affect modern patterns of forest composition and carbon flux in Amazonian forests.

AB Among approaches to establish the importance of niche differentiation for species coexistence, the use of functional traits is attractive for its potential to suggest specific coexistence mechanisms. Recent studies have looked for trait patterns reflective of niche differentiation, building on a line of research with a deep but somewhat neglected history. We review the field from its foundation in limiting similarity theory in the 1960s to its resurgence in 2000s, and find the theory of trait patterning still in a stage of development. Elements still to be accounted for include environmental fluctuations, multidimensional niche space, transient dynamics, immigration, intraspecific variation, evolution and spatial scales. Recent empirical methods are better than early approaches, but still focus on patterning arising in simplistic models, and should rigorously link niche space with trait space, use informative null models, and adopt new metrics of pattern as theory develops. Because tests based on overly simplistic expectations of trait pattern are of little value, we argue that progress in the field requires theory development, which should entail exploring patterns across a set of conceptual and system-specific models of competition along trait axes.
   Synthesis Traits relate to ecological performance and are easy to measure. Trait patterns can thus be a practical tool for inferring community assembly processes, and have been extensively used for this purpose. Classical trait patterning theory dates back to the 1960s, and despite heavy criticism still persists in empirical studies. Here we highlight steps needed for traits to realize their potential. These include firmly linking them to niche axes, and updating pattern expectations to consider recent results from models of niche dynamics, such as the emergence of species clusters. Further theory development should reveal whether there is a common traits-based signature across different niche mechanisms.

AB Grasses using the C-4 photosynthetic pathway dominate frequently burned savannas, where the pathway is hypothesized to be adaptive. However, independent C-4 lineages also sort among different fire environments. Adaptations to fire may thus depend on evolutionary history, which could be as important as the possession of the C-4 photosynthetic pathway for life in these environments. Here, using a comparative pot experiment and controlled burn, we examined C-3 and C-4 grasses belonging to four lineages from the same regional flora, and asked the following questions: Do lineages differ in their responses to fire, are responses consistent between photosynthetic types, and are responses related to fire frequency in natural habitats? We found that in the C-4 Andropogoneae lineage, frost killed a large proportion of aboveground biomass and produced a large dry fuel load, which meant that only a small fraction of the living tissue was lost in the fire. C-3 species from the Paniceae and Danthonioideae lineages generated smaller fuel loads and lost more living biomass, while species from the C-4 lineage Aristida generated the smallest fuel loads and lost the most living tissue. Regrowth after the fire was more rapid and complete in the C-4 Andropogoneae and C-3 Paniceae, but incomplete and slower in the C-3 Danthonioideae and C-4 Aristida. Rapid recovery was associated with high photosynthetic rates, high specific leaf area, delayed flowering, and frequent fires in natural habitats. Results demonstrated that phylogenetic lineage was more important than photosynthetic type in determining the fire response of these grasses and that fire responses were related to the frequency that natural habitats burned.

AB Over the last decades, hundreds of thousands of families have settled in the Brazilian Amazon within the framework of the Agrarian Reform Program (ARP). The rationale behind the program is to enable settlers to earn their living by small-scale farming and producing an agricultural surplus for the market. This paper aims to analyze the settlers' livelihood strategies under the framework of the ARP and its objectives. The paper considers more than just land use shares. Income composition, capital (human, physical, natural, social, and financial), mediating process, and context are also included, and these reveal three groups of livelihood strategies. Most of the settlers have achieved the ARP goals, mainly by deploying livestock strategies, particularly milk production. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding how abiotic factors influence the spatial distribution of genetic variation provides insight into microevolutionary processes. The intertidal seascape is characterized by highly heterogeneous habitats which probably influence the partitioning of genetic variation at very small scales. The effects of tidal height on genetic variation in both the haploid (gametophytes) and diploid (tetrasporophytes) stages of the red alga Chondrus crispus were studied. Fronds were sampled every 25cm within a 5mx5m grid and along a 90-m transect at two shore heights (high and low) in one intertidal site in France. The multilocus genotype of 799 fronds was determined (Nhaploid=586; Ndiploid=213) using eight microsatellite loci to test the following hypotheses: (i) high and low shore fronds belong to genetically differentiated populations, (ii) gene flow is restricted within the high shore habitat due to tidal-influenced isolation and (iii) significant FIS values are driven by life history characteristics. Pairwise FST estimates between high and low shore levels supported the hypothesis that high and low shore fronds were genetically differentiated. The high shore was characterized by the occurrence of within-shore genetic differentiation, reduced genetic diversity and increased levels of intergametophytic selfing, suggesting it is a marginal environment. These results suggest at fine scales within the intertidal seascape the same mechanisms as those over the species' distributional range are at work with core and marginal population dynamics.

   WOODY-PLANTS; RESPONSES; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; REPRODUCTION; DEFOLIATION; LEAF
AB Modern concepts of plant tolerance to herbivory are primarily based on studies of short-term severe damage, whereas the effects of minor chronic damage to long-lived woody plants, corresponding to background herbivory (215% annual loss of foliar biomass in boreal and temperate forests), remain poorly understood. In our experiment, the annual removal of 2, 4, 8 and 16% of the leaf area from naturally growing mountain birch Betula pubescens subsp. czerepanovii saplings during a seven-year period resulted in a pronounced reduction of plant vertical growth (30, 34, 45 and 78%, respectively). Leaf size decreased first (already after one year of the 16% treatment), resulting in the reduction of the total leaf area. This effect was followed by a considerable decrease in the length of long shoots in all treatments. Leaf number on the plant was maintained for a longer time, being reduced by the end of the experiment in 16% treatment only; no changes in specific leaf area or chlorophyll fluorescence were observed in either of the treatments. This pattern may indicate that the plant reallocates resources from the growth of the woody parts to the maintenance of the photosynthetic area, and can be seen as a strategy of tolerance to minor herbivory, whereas compensatory responses typical of severe herbivory (increased photosynthesis rates and shoot regrowth) have not been detected. The predicted 25% increase in background herbivory due to climate warming can potentially produce previously unrecognised negative impacts on tree growth. We conclude that in the long term, background herbivory is likely to impose stronger effects on the growth of woody plants than short-term devastating outbreaks of defoliators, thus contributing more to the development of plant evolutionary adaptations to herbivory than severe but episodic bouts of damage.

AB Fires have been burning plants since the early Devonian and were common in the Mesozoic, before angiosperms became prominent. Fires were common in the Cretaceous, when angiosperms first spread to cover significant areas of the world. We suggest that this spread was facilitated by intrinsic angiosperm properties that altered fire regimes in two fundamental ways. The first was to promote more frequent fires than the slower-growing gymnosperms that they replaced. The high productivity of angiosperms would have fueled more frequent fires, while reproductive innovations allowed for more rapid recovery, particularly in upland areas too dry for ferns. The evolution of flammable grasses is the latest expression of angiosperm innovation, generating even more frequent fires capable of carving into forests, particularly after the spread of C-4 grasses from; similar to 8 Ma. The second major impact of angiosperms on fire was the development of forests. Closed broad-leaved forests fundamentally changed fire regimes by producing a vegetation structure that intrinsically excludes fires. No conifer analogues for fire-excluding forests seem to exist today or to have existed in the evolutionary past. Both fire-promoting and fire-excluding ecosystems are a product of angiosperm innovations. While these novel ecosystems may have caused the extinction of several ancient lineages, ferns and conifers still persist within them. One conifer lineage, the genus Pinus, has shown remarkable adaptability to highly flammable ecosystems, including frequently burned C-4 grasslands.

AB According to the global latitudinal diversity gradient, a decrease in animal and plant species richness exists from the tropics towards higher latitudes. The aim of this study was to describe the latitudinal distribution patterns of Chilean continental flora and delineate biogeographic regions along a 4270-km northsouth gradient. We reviewed plant lists for each of the 39 parallels of continental Chile to build a database of the geographical distribution of vascular plant species comprising 184 families, 957 genera and 3787 species, which corresponded to 100%, 94.9% and 74.2% of the richness previously defined for Chile, respectively. Using this latitudinal presenceabsence species matrix, we identified areas with high plant richness and endemism and performed a Cluster analysis using Jaccard index to delineate biogeographic regions. This study found that richness at family, genus and species levels follow a unimodal 4270-km latitudinal distribution curve, with a concentration of richness in central Chile (3142 degrees S). The 37th parallel south (central Chile) presented the highest richness for all taxonomic levels and in specific zones the endemism (2237 degrees S) was especially high. This unimodal pattern contrasts the global latitudinal diversity gradient shown by other studies in the Northern hemisphere. Seven floristic regions were identified in this latitudinal gradient: tropical (1822 degrees S), north Mediterranean (2328 degrees S), central Mediterranean (2932 degrees S), south Mediterranean (3337 degrees S), north temperate (3842 degrees S), south temperate (4352 degrees S) and Austral (5356 degrees S). This regionalization coincides with previous bioclimatic classifications and illustrates the high heterogeneity of the biodiversity in Chile and the need for a reconsideration of governmental conservation strategies to protect this diversity throughout Chile.

AB A key driver of rain forest degradation is rampant commercial logging. Reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques dramatically reduce residual damage to vegetation and soils, and they enhance the long-term economic viability of timber operations when compared to conventionally managed logging enterprises. Consequently, the application of RIL is increasing across the tropics, yet our knowledge of the potential for RIL also to reduce the negative impacts of logging on biodiversity is minimal. We compare the impacts of RIL on birds, leaf-litter ants, and dung beetles during a second logging rotation in Sabah, Borneo, with the impacts of conventional logging (CL) as well as with primary (unlogged) forest. Our study took place 1-8 years after the cessation of logging. The species richness and composition of RIL vs. CL forests were very similar for each taxonomic group. Both RIL and CL differed significantly from unlogged forests in terms of bird and ant species composition (although both retained a large number of the species found in unlogged forests), whereas the composition of dung beetle communities did not differ significantly among forest types. Our results show little difference in biodiversity between RIL and CL over the short term. However, biodiversity, benefits from RIL may accrue over longer time periods after the cessation of logging. We highlight a severe lack of studies investigating this possibility. Moreover, if RI L increases the economic value of selectively logged forests (e.g., via REDD+, a United Nations program: Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries), it could help prevent them from being converted to agricultural plantations, which results in a tremendous loss of biodiversity.

AB 1. Recent observations indicate that climatic change is altering biodiversity, and models suggest that the consequences of climate change will differ across latitude. However, long-term experimental field manipulations that directly test the predictions about organisms responses to climate change across latitude are lacking. Such experiments could provide a more mechanistic understanding of the consequences of climate change on ecological communities and subsequent changes in ecosystem processes, facilitating better predictions of the effects of future climate change.
   2. This field experiment uses octagonal, 5-m-diameter (c. 22 m 3) open-top chambers to simulate warming at northern (Harvard Forest, Massachusetts) and southern (Duke Forest, North Carolina) hardwood forest sites to determine the effects of warming on ant and other arthropod populations and communities near the edges of their ranges. Each site has 12 plots containing open-top chambers that manipulate air temperature incrementally from ambient to 6 degrees C above ambient. Because the focus of this study is on mobile, litter-and soil-dwelling arthropods, standard methods for warming chambers (e. g. soil-warming cables or infrared heaters applied to relatively small areas) were inappropriate and new technological approaches using hydronic heating and forced air movement were developed.
   3. We monitor population dynamics, species composition, phenology and behaviour of ants and other arthropods occupying these experimental chambers. Microclimatic measurements in each chamber include the following: air temperature (three), soil temperatures (two each in organic and mineral soil), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), relative humidity and soil moisture (one each). In two chambers, we are also measuring soil heat flux, associated soil temperatures at 2 and 6 cm and volumetric water content. To assess the composition, phenology and abundance of arthropod communities within the experiment, we use monthly pitfall trapping and annual Winkler sampling. We also census artificial and natural ant nests to monitor changes in ant colony size and productivity across the temperature treatments.
   4. This experiment is a long-term ecological study that provides opportunities for collaborations across a broad spectrum of ecologists, including those studying biogeochemical, microbial and plant responses to warming. Future studies also may include implementation of multifactorial climate manipulations, examination of interactions across trophic levels and quantification of changes in ecosystem processes.

AB We investigated responses of growth, leaf gas exchange, carbon-isotope discrimination, and whole-plant water-use efficiency (W-P) to elevated CO2 concentration ([CO2]) in seedlings of five leguminous and five nonleguminous tropical tree species. Plants were grown at CO2 partial pressures of 40 and 70 Pa. As a group, legumes did not differ from nonlegumes in growth response to elevated [CO2]. The mean ratio of final plant dry mass at elevated to ambient [CO2] (M-E/M-A) was 1.32 and 1.24 for legumes and nonlegumes, respectively. However, there was large variation in M-E/M-A among legume species (0.92-2.35), whereas nonlegumes varied much less (1.21-1.29). Variation among legume species in M-E/M-A was closely correlated with their capacity for nodule formation, as expressed by nodule mass ratio, the dry mass of nodules for a given plant dry mass. W-P increased markedly in response to elevated [CO2] in all species. The ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 partial pressures during photosynthesis remained approximately constant at ambient and elevated [CO2], as did carbon isotope discrimination, suggesting that W-P should increase proportionally for a given increase in atmospheric [CO2]. These results suggest that tree legumes with a strong capacity for nodule formation could have a competitive advantage in tropical forests as atmospheric [CO2] rises and that the water-use efficiency of tropical tree species will increase under elevated [CO2].

AB Plant growth responses to resources may be an important mechanism that influences species' distributions, coexistence, and community structure. Irradiance is considered the most important resource for seedling growth in the understory of wet tropical forests, but multiple soil nutrients and species have yet to be examined simultaneously with irradiance under field conditions. To identify potentially limiting resources, we modeled tree seedling growth as a function of irradiance and soil nutrients across five sites, spanning a soil fertility gradient in old-growth, wet tropical forests at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We measured an array of soil nutrients including total nitrogen (total N), inorganic N (nitrate [NO(3)(-)] and ammonium [NH(4)(+)]), phosphate (PO(4)(-)), and sum of base cations (SBC; potassium, magnesium, and calcium). Shade in the forest understory did not preclude seedling growth correlations with soil nutrients. Irradiance was a significant predictor of growth in 52% of the species, inorganic N in 54% (NO(3)(-) in 32%; NH(4)(+) in 34%), total N in 47%, SBC in 39%, and PO(4)(-) in 29%. Overall, growth was correlated with both irradiance and soil nutrients in 45% of species and with soil nutrients only in an additional 48%; rarely was irradiance alone correlated with growth. Contrary to expectations, the magnitudes of growth effects, assessed as the maximum growth response to significant resources for each species, were similar for irradiance and most soil nutrients. Among species whose growth correlated with soil nutrients, the rank importance of nutrient effects was SBC, followed by N (total N, NO(3)(-), and/or NH(4)(+)) and PO(4)(-). Species' growth responsiveness (i.e., magnitudes of effect) to irradiance and soil nutrients was negatively correlated with species' shade tolerance (survival under 1% full sun). In this broad survey of species and resources, the nearly ubiquitous effects of soil nutrients on seedling growth challenge the idea that soil nutrients are less important than irradiance in the light-limited understory of wet tropical forests.

AB We investigated forest canopy gaps in the mixed beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), silver fir (Abies alba Miller), and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) old-growth forest of Lom in the Dinaric Mountains of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Gap size, age, gap fraction, gapmaker characteristics and the structure and composition of gapfillers were documented to investigate gap dynamics. The percentages of forest area in canopy and expanded gaps were 19% and 41%, respectively. The median canopy gap size was 77 m(2), and ranged from 11 to 708 m(2). Although there were many single tree-fall gaps, the majority had multiple gapmakers that were often in different stages of decay, suggesting gap expansion is important at the study site. Of the gapmakers recorded, 14% were uprooted sterns, 60% snapped stems, and 26% were standing dead trees. Dendroecological analysis suggests that gap formation varied in time. The density of gapfillers was not correlated to gap size, and the species composition of gapfillers varied between seedling, sapling, and tree life stages. The results suggest that gaps are mainly formed by endogenous senescence of single canopy trees. Exogenous disturbance agents, most likely related to wind and snow, act mainly as secondary agents in breaking weakened trees and in expanding previously established gaps. Although the findings are partially consistent with other studies of gap disturbance processes in similar old-growth forests in central Europe, the observed gap dynamic places the Lom core area at the end of a gradient that ranges from forests controlled by very small-scale processes to those where large, stand replacing disturbances predominate.

AB Patterns of carbon retention and distribution across human-modified landscapes have been poorly investigated. In this paper carbon distribution across three forest habitats of a fragmented Atlantic forest landscape in northeast Brazil is examined. Data on tree assemblages (DBH >= 10 cm) inhabiting forest interior stands, forest edges and fragments (2.05-365 ha) were obtained via information from 59 0.1-ha plots (a total of 4,845 stems and 198 tree species), and it was further incorporated in four allometric equations for estimation of above-ground biomass and carbon. Stocks of carbon were highly variable within habitats of Serra Grande, but forest interior plots retained almost three times more carbon (202.8 +/- 23.7 TonC/ha) than edge and fragment plots, while these edge-affected habitats exhibited similar scores. Moreover, emergent tree species accounted for the majority of the carbon retained (59.13%) in interior plots with understorey species playing a minor role. However, carbon retained by emergent species decreased by a half across forest edges and forest fragment since large stems (> 70 cm DBH) and very tall trees (> 31 m height) were very rare in these habitats. Finally, a forest cover mapping revealed the occurrence of 213.19 km(2) of forest interior habitat in the whole Atlantic forest of northeast Brazil. This figure means that only 8% of total remaining forest habitat has a full potential for carbon storage, with the other 92% (edge-affected habitats) storing just a half of that. Our results suggest that habitat fragmentation and the consequent establishment of edge-affected habitats (forest edges and fragments) drastically limit forest capacity for carbon storage across human-modified landscapes since the loss of carbon due to reduced abundance of large trees is not compensated by either canopy or understorey species.

AB The role of fire in the maintenance of oak-dominated ecosystems is widely recognized. Fire exclusion results in structural and compositional shifts that alter fuelbed composition and structure, together influencing fire behavior and effects. To clarify the influence of overstory structure on fuels and fire intensity in oak woodlands and savannas, we examined fuelbeds across a gradient from open grassland to Douglas-fir- (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) invaded Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana Douglas ex Hook.) woodland in the Bald Hills of Redwood National Park, California, USA. Herbaceous mass decreased markedly from a high in grasslands (3.38 Mg ha(-1)) to a low in invaded woodlands (0.03 Mg ha(-1)), whereas leaf litter and woody fuel mass increased substantially along this gradient. Mean fire temperatures at 30 cm height ranged from 74.7 degrees C in invaded woodland up to 207.9 degrees C in grassland. Highly flammable grassland and savanna communities maintain heavy herbaceous mass, but low woody mass, favoring quickspreading, relatively high-intensity fires. The encroachment of Douglas-fir into grasslands and oak-dominated communities dampens flammability through changes in fuelbed composition and structure (e.g., the replacement of herbaceous fuels with woody fuels), underscoring the necessity for ecological restoration efforts that focus on fuelbed structure in addition to other common restoration goals.

AB Hermit crabs (superfamily Paguroidea), by their typical nature as inhabitants of mobile, protective domiciles, are a unique source for studying symbiotic relationships. A great variety of symbionts attach, bore into or live free in the lumen of shells harboring hermit crabs, and hermit crabs themselves as hosts for a variety of parasites and potential parasites are the subject of this review. Approximately 130-140 species of the >850 known hermit crab species are parasitized by 149 species in 9 phyla, and 27 species are hosts for 17 potential parasites in 5 phyla. Among the confirmed parasites, 30 species of parasitic barnacles (Rhizocephala) and 83 species of parasitic Isopoda are known. Species in other groups of parasites are few in number: Apicomplexa 2, Dinoflagellata 1, Microsporida 2, Ascomycota 1, Platyhelminthes 8, Acanthocephala 2, Nematoda 3, and Nematomorpha 2. Fifteen species of ectosymbiotic mites are obligate associates, but little is known of their possible parasitic tendencies. In terms of trophic strategies, the rhizocephalans, nematomorphans and two flatworm species are complete parasitic castrators and the parasitic isopods are partial parasitic castrators. The rest of the species are trophically transmitted parasites (Apicomplexa, Platyhelminthes, Acanthocephala and Nematoda) or are classified as pathogens (Apicomplexa, Dinoflagellata, Microsporida, and Ascomycota). Limited information shows that hermit crabs are first or second intermediate hosts for coccidians, cestodes, trematodes, acanthocephalans and nematodes. The importance of hermit crabs as definitive and intermediate hosts is greatly underestimated due to insufficient worldwide sampling for parasites. The ten most well-studied hermit crab host species are from European waters, the western Atlantic and the eastern Pacific. In contrast, the lower parasite diversity of the Indo-West Pacific region is presumably due to limited sampling. Hermit crabs are also known to host at least 17 species of obligate, intimate associates (not presently considered parasites), but further analyses are required to more fully clarify their symbiotic relationships. Among these potential parasites are four mesomycetozoans that are found in the digestive tract of hosts and four apostome ciliates whose reproduction is synchronized with the host's molting. Symbiotic nemerteans and octolasmid barnacles that are common associates of decapods have, surprisingly, yet to be discovered associated with hermit crabs. In total, at least ten species of hyperparasites are found infesting primary associates (mostly rhizocephalans and bopyrids) of hermit crabs. Hyperparasitism involves: 1) rhizocephalans as hosts for one described species of amoeba and four species of cryptoniscid isopods, 2) bopyrid isopods as hosts for three described species of cabiropid isopods and one rhizocephalan (Akentrogonida), and 3) a burrowing barnacle (Trypetesidae) as host for one species of hemioniscid isopod. The biology and life histories of most hermit crab parasites, with the exception of rhizocephalans and some isopods, are poorly known and the role of crabs as intermediate hosts is especially in need of study. The information presented herein on geographical distribution of host species, the prevalence of their parasites, and known host-parasite relationships should be useful for developing models that will elicit a greater understanding of hermit crab parasitism.
   Such information, along with morphological and molecular analyses might lead to a better understanding of the evolution of anomurans and decapod as a whole. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Whether plant distributions are governed more by neutral-based distance effects or niche-based environmental responses remains elusive. A lack of habitat matching, where species distributions do not correspond to environmental variability, suggests neutrality but can also be explained by niche models through the interactions of dispersal limitation, spatial autocorrelation of the environment, species interactions, and spatial scale. We untangle these effects in a field study with multiscale statistical analyses. We demonstrate that despite significant niche-based environmental responses by a savanna plant, we still see weak habitat matching, with the mechanisms responsible differing by spatial scale. At the coarse scale (100-200 m), dispersal limitation restricted the occupation of optimal habitat. At the fine scale (<30 m), dispersal was not limiting, but a lack of autocorrelation of environmental variables prevented the aggregation of reproductively active plants in optimal microsites. Species associations were largely unimportant at all scales. Extending our analysis to the entire community revealed similar scale-dependent limitations of distance and the environment, indicating weak habitat matching for all species. This work supports predictions that environmental specializations do not necessarily produce deterministic distributions in plant communities. It also provides a mechanistic explanation for why co-occurring plant species can have largely undifferentiated distributions.

AB Tam Dao National Park (TDNP) is a remaining primary forest that supports some of the highest levels of biodiversity in Vietnam. Forest conversion due to illegal logging and agricultural expansion is a major problem that is hampering biodiversity conservation efforts in the TDNP region. Yet, areas vulnerable to forest conversion are unknown. In this paper, we predicted areas vulnerable to forest changes in the TDNP region using multi-temporal remote sensing data and a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) with a Markov chain model (MLPNN-M). The MLPNN-M model predicted increasing pressure in the remaining primary forest within the park as well as on the secondary forest in the surrounding areas. The primary forest is predicted to decrease from 18.03% in 2007 to 15.10% in 2014 and 12.66% in 2021. Our results can be used to prioritize locations for future biodiversity conservation and forest management efforts. The combined use of remote sensing and spatial modeling techniques provides an effective tool for monitoring the remaining forests in the TDNP region.

AB P>1. As central place foragers, ants accumulate organic debris near their nests. Consequently, soil nutrient stocks are often enriched near the nest site. We investigated the hypothesis that plant-derived food sources, such as extrafloral nectar (EFN), can encourage soil-dwelling ant colonies to nest near the plant, thereby inadvertently providing the plant with an additional source of mineral nutrients. The study focused on a population of Acacia constricta, a North American shrub bearing EFNs.
   2. Several lines of evidence supported the notion that food rewards drew ant nests close to A. constricta plants. Firstly, ant species that visit EFNs nested significantly closer to A. constricta plants than would be expected by chance, whereas this was not the case for two ant species that do not visit EFNs. Secondly, A. constricta plants with an ant nest occurring naturally underneath the canopy had greater foliar volume, more EFNs per leaf and more EFNs per cm of leaf rachis than plants lacking an ant nest under the canopy. Thirdly, experimental supplementation of the nectar resources on acacias led to the establishment of significantly more new nests near the plant, relative to controls. However, nectar supplementation did not affect acacia seed production within the year of the study.
   3. Soil from the nests of three, EFN-visiting ant species contained higher average stocks of most mineral nutrients than nearby soils outside the influence of the nest.
   4. To test whether A. constricta can assimilate the nutrients in ant nests, we fed 15N-labelled food to Dorymyrmex sp. (smithi complex) workers nesting near acacias. Twenty-four days later, the leaves of acacias with an experimentally fed ant colony under the canopy contained significantly higher 15N and %N than acacias without a nest under the canopy, indicating that acacias assimilated and benefited from nutrients derived from ants.
   5.Synthesis. The results indicate that nectar resources can attract the nests of some ant species, and that plants may benefit from access to soil nutrients derived from ant nests. Our data support the hypothesis that EFNs may confer nutritive, as well as protective, benefits.

AB The mechanisms underlying biological invasions are still not well elucidated. In this study, ecophysiological traits of invasive Eupatorium adenophorum and native E. japonicum were compared at 10 irradiances in field. I hypothesized that the invader may allocate a higher fraction of leaf nitrogen (N) to photosynthesis and have higher light-saturated photosynthetic rate (P-max) and specific leaf area (SLA) than E. japonicum. The invader had a significantly higher ability to acclimate to high irradiance than E. japonicum, while it showed a similar shade-tolerant ability. The invader indeed allocated a higher fraction of leaf N to photosynthesis than E. japonicum, which, with its high leaf N content (N-A), resulted in a higher N content in photosynthesis (N-P), contributing to its higher biochemical capacity for photosynthesis and P-max. However, the invader had a significantly lower SLA than E. japonicum, contributing to its higher P-max but increasing its area-based leaf construction cost. The abilities to acclimate to a wider range of irradiance and to allocate a higher fraction of leaf N to photosynthesis, and the higher P-max, N-A, N-P and leaf area ratio may contribute to the invasion of the invader. High SLA is not always necessary for invasive species.

AB Edge effects are suggested to have great impact on the persistence of species in fragmented landscapes. We tested edge avoidance by forest understory passerines in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest and also compared their mobility and movement patterns in contiguous and fragmented landscapes to assess whether movements would increase in the fragmented landscape. Between 2003 and 2005, 96 Chiroxiphia caudata, 38 Pyriglena leucoptera and 27 Sclerurus scansor were radio-tracked. The most strictly forest species C. caudata and S scansor avoided forest edges while P leucoptera showed affinities for the edge Both sensitive species showed larger mean step length and maximal observed daily distance in the fragmented forest versus the unfragmented forest. P. leucoptera did not show any significant difference. There were no significant differences in proportional daily home range use for any of the three species. Our results suggested that fragmentation and the consequent increase in edge areas do influence movement behavior of sensitive forest understory birds that avoided the use of edges and increased the speed and distance they covered daily. For the most restricted forest species, it would be advisable to protect larger patches of forest instead of many small or medium fragments connected by narrow corridors. However, by comparing our data with that obtained earlier, we concluded that movement behavior of resident birds differs from that of dispersing birds and might not allow to infer functional connectivity or landscape-scale sensitivity to fragmentation; a fact that should be taken into consideration when suggesting conservation strategies.

AB In recent years Harmonia axyridis (Pallas, 1773) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) has become a very popular insect among biological control practitioners and scientists, not only for its potential to be an efficient biological control agent but also because it is considered invasive. Individuals of this species were deliberately introduced into several countries for biological control of different arthropods pests. However the predator itself became an invasive species, affecting the dynamics and composition of several guilds through direct or indirect interactions with established species, including intraguild predation. In this paper we discuss the reasons why the species has a high invasiveness and what are the limits to invasion by this species. It is not clear if the invasiveness of the beetle is linked to its biological, ecological and behavioural abilities, or to other factors such as invasibility and interactions between the invaders, the noninvaders, and the habitat, which may in part explain the reasons of its success and help us to answer the question "what will stop the invader?" We also discuss the reason for the absence of the predator in the Azores islands. Despite the intentional introduction of H. axyridis in the Azores and the high number of individuals released, there are no records of this species in the wild, despite recent extensive sampling effort. In this paper we discuss the reasons for the apparent failure or the delay in establishment of the predator. One factor which may hamper the establishment of H. axyridis in some of the Azores islands is the absence of winter environmental conditions, mainly the temperature which is seldom lower than 12 degrees C, essential for the induction of diapause. The lack of success in the establishment could be also related to functional diversity saturation, that is species saturation and competitive exclusion of H. axyridis by other previously established species may be operating.

AB Question: Is soil hydrology an important niche-based driver of biodiversity in tropical forests? More specifically, we asked whether seasonal dynamics in soil water regime contributed to vegetation partitioning into distinct forest types.
   Location: Tropical rain forest in northwestern Mato Grosso, Brazil.
   Methods: We investigated the distribution of trees and lianas >= 1 cm DBH in ten transects that crossed distinct hydrological transitions. Soil water content and depth to water table were measured regularly over a 13-month period.
   Results: A detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of 20 dominant species and structural attributes in 10 x 10 m subplots segregated three major forest types: (1) high-statured upland forest with intermediate stem density, (2) medium-statured forest dominated by palms, and (3) low-statured campinarana forest with high stem density. During the rainy season and transition into the dry season, distinct characteristics of the soil water regime (i.e. hydro-indicators) were closely associated with each vegetation community. Stand structural attributes and hydro-indicators were statistically different among forest types.
   Conclusions: Some upland species appeared intolerant of anaerobic conditions as they were not present in palm and campinarana sites, which experienced prolonged periods of saturation at the soil surface. A shallow impermeable layer restricted rooting depth in the campinarana community, which could heighten drought stress during the dry season. The only vegetation able to persist in campinarana sites were short-statured trees that appear to be well-adapted to the dual extremes of inundation and drought.

AB In the Hong Kong rocky intertidal, the demography of the acorn barnacle Tetraclita japonica is largely determined by regular, intense mortality events in the summer and subsequent pulses of recruitment in late summer. During 2 consecutive summers from 2000 to 2001, 34 to 52 and 98 to 99% of T japonica were killed on the mid- and high shore, respectively, with younger cohorts suffering higher mortality in the mid-shore. Recruitment of T japonica occurs in late summer; as a result, the population in the high shore consists of a single cohort of new recruits, while the mid-shore supports 2 cohorts (new recruits and adult survivors). To investigate how thermal stress affects acorn barnacle populations, air and rock temperatures and sub-lethal physiological measures (body temperature, sinus pulsation rate and haemolymph osmolality) of T japonica were taken on the mid- and high shore during daytime, low spring tides in June-July 2001. Mean body temperature increased gradually after emersion, reaching a maximum of similar to 48 degrees C at noon, 6 to 8 degrees C higher than the adjacent rock surface. T japonica entered a heat-induced coma when body temperatures reached 45 degrees C. Osmolality of the haemolymph and sinus pulsation rate increased with body temperature as a result of water loss and possibly altered haemolymph pressure; both were greater in high than in mid-shore individuals, with barnacles on horizontal surfaces being hotter than those on vertical surfaces. Body temperature and sinus pulsation rate differed between shore levels, but were similar at spatial scales of 1 to 20 m at the same tidal height. Haemolymph osmolality, however, varied over this distance, probably due to individual variation in the amount of mantle water trapped before emersion and possible micro-habitat differences. Heat and desiccation stress, therefore, play an important role in determining the life history of T japonica by limiting their distribution and abundance and influencing the demography of the population at different spatial scales.

AB Ecologists have proposed that tree species may coexist by specialising on light environments associated with gaps of different sizes. Remarkably few community-level studies, however, have actually examined juvenile tree distributions along light availability gradients. Here we describe distributions of juvenile trees in relation to canopy openness in a temperate rainforest, and test the hypothesis that competitive sorting causes coexisting species to overlap less in light environment occupancy than would be expected by chance. Average overlap of species' interquartile ranges on the canopy openness gradient was tested against a bounded domain null model of community structure which used range-size criteria to constrain random placement of species optima. Microsite availability was strongly skewed towards low light, with 43% of microsites occurring at < 5% canopy openness. We therefore transformed canopy openness values to ranks, so that equal intervals on the transformed gradient represented equal areas of microsite availability. We then calculated the interquartile range (25-75%) of sample ranks occupied by juveniles of each species. About half the assemblage was non-randomly distributed in relation to canopy openness, providing evidence of niche expression. Average overlap of species' interquartile ranges did not depart significantly from that predicted by the bounded null model, indicating that community structure in relation to canopy openness was mainly explained by a mid-domain effect. As predicted by the null model, species' interquartile range mid-points were concentrated in the centre of the rank-transformed gradient, and species richness (overlap of interquartile ranges) peaked close to the median light environment. Most species therefore had intermediate light requirements. The apparent lack of constraints on pairwise overlap suggest that differences in light use are not a prerequisite for tree species coexistence. As far as we are aware, this is the first study to identify a mid-domain effect on a resource availability axis.

AB We examined the distribution of tree species across five habitats in 69 small plots within a single watershed of the Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (GPNP). The spatially complex distribution and close proximity of habitats provided an opportunity to test habitat specificity of tree species across strong environmental gradients, in a situation where dispersal into 'inappropriate' habitat should not be a rare event. Habitat had a weak influence on community structure, although species diversity was lower in the alluvium and peat habitats. Association tests based on two randomization models (spatially independent and explicit) were used to examine habitat distribution of 55 'common' and 142 'frequent' taxa. The general patterns were similar in the two models but the interpretation of specific patterns depended greatly on assumptions about dispersal ability. A majority (67%) of the common species was significantly associated with a single habitat, while few were restricted to one habitat. A small proportion (16%) of the species appear to be habitat generalists. The peat habitat had the most profound effect on species distribution. Overall, a large amount of variation was found in the degree of habitat specificity, even within speciose groups. No obvious evolutionary or ecological correlates with degree of habitat specificity were found. These results suggest that a mixture of stochastic and deterministic processes determine species distribution even across strong environmental gradients.

AB The nature of pathogen transport mechanisms strongly determines the spatial pattern of disease and, through this, the dynamics and persistence of epidemics in plant populations. Up to recently, the range of possible mechanisms or interactions assumed by epidemic models has been limited: either independent of the location of individuals (mean-field models) or restricted to local contacts (between nearest neighbours or decaying exponenially with distance). Real dispersal processes are likely to lie between these two extremes, and many are well described by long-tailed contact kernels such as power laws. We investigate the effect of different spatial dispersal mechanisms on the spatio-temporal spread of disease epidemics by simulating a stochastic Susceptible-infective model motivated by previous data analyses. Both long-term stationary behaviour (in the presence of a control or recovery process) and transient behaviour (which varies widely within and between epidemics) are examined. We demonstrate the relationship between epidemic size and disease pattern (characterized by spatial autocorrelation), and its dependence on dispersal and infectivity parameters. Special attention is given to boundary effects, which can decrease disease levels significantly relative to standard, periodic geometries in cases of long-distance dispersal. We propose and test a definition of transient duration which captures the dependence of transients on dispersal mechanisms. We outline an analytical approach that represents the behaviour of the spatially-explicit model, and use it to prove that the epidemic size is predicted exactly by the mean-field model (in the limit of an infinite system) when dispersal is sufficiently long ranged (i.e. when the power-law exponent a less than or equal to 2).

AB 1 Plants often suffer substantial loss of seeds to consumers. However, because the seed-to-seedling transition is frequently ignored, quantitative estimates of the effects of seed consumers on plant population dynamics are rare.
   2 We examined how post-dispersal seed predation by rodents affected seedling emergence and subsequent adult plant abundance of bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), a large N-fixing shrub common to coastal dunes in California. We monitored patterns of seedling emergence and survival over 3 years for seeds sown into exclosed and control plots.
   3 We sowed additional cohorts of seeds in the second and third years and compared interannual variation in emergence patterns.
   4 Rodent exclusion substantially reduced seedling emergence, with an average of 109 seedlings emerging over 3 years from 476 seeds sown in rodent exclusion plots vs. 26 from control plots. The intensity of granivory, however, varied between years, with rodent exclusion increasing emergence from seeds sown in year one, but not in year two.
   5 Winter seedling mortality, due to cutworm herbivory, was similarly high in rodent-free and control plots, and its net impact was to reduce the difference in seedling abundance. Thus. by mid-summer in each of the three years, there were only marginally more seedlings in rodent-excluded vs. control plots.
   6 The cumulative effect of protecting seeds, was, however, large. After 3 years, an average of four adult lupines were established in rodent-free plots, whereas only 0.5 were found in control plots and lupine biomass was more than 5-fold higher in exclusion plots.
   7 Taken together, the results indicate that rodents play a critical role by limiting the abundance and biomass of a large N-fixing shrub in dunes.

Seasonally inundated forest was compared with upland (tierra firme) forest. The study focused on plant species in the canopy. The pollination spectra show that in both forests most canopy trees and lianas are pollinated by small bees, large bees, butterflies or by small, relatively unspecialized insects. In the upland forest small bees are the most important pollinators (32% of all species of trees and lianas are pollinated by them), whereas large bees are predominant in the floodplain (22%). Other pollinators, like hummingbirds, bats, moths, and beetles are less common (< 10%), but always somewhat more important in the flood plain than in the upland forest. Bees are the most common pollinators of epiphytes. In the flood plain forest, flies are also important as epiphyte pollinators (19%), whereas in the upland forest hummingbirds pollinate more epiphytes. The phenological patterns are quite similar in both the upland and the flood plain. We found a peak in flowering in the transition period between the wet and the dry season. Flowering activity was lowest during the wet season. Differentiation in sexual systems was correlated with life form. Dioecy and monoecy were found mostly among tree species. Most species of all life forms though were hermaphroditic. No difference with respect to the relative importance of sexual systems was found between the two forest types.

AB The influence of topographic heterogeneity (boulders of different sizes: 0.75, 1.5, 2.25 m) on intertidal soft-bottom community characteristics [diversity(H') richness, and biomass] was examined in the St, Lawrence Estuary, Canada, The macrofauna, sediment characteristics, and flow regime in the zones surrounding boulders were examined in 6 orientations (directions) and at 3 distances from boulders. Flow around boulders and control sites (no boulders) was estimated by the rate of plaster dissolution of standard plaster cylinders. Control sites (no boulders) showed the highest species diversity (H'(a): based on density) and richness. These parameters decreased significantly with boulder size and increased significantly with distance from boulders. For both small and large boulder sizes, highest and lowest diversities were generally observed in opposite orientations. Overall, biomass was not influenced by boulder size. Plaster dissolution explained more variability in diversity, richness and biomass (up to 35, 30 and 25 %, respectively) than did sediment characteristics (8, 6 and 27 %, respectively). Species dominance was strong and probably explained the relative constancy of diversity among treatments.

TI Deciphering functional redundancy in the human microbiome

AB Although the taxonomic composition of the human microbiome varies tremendously across individuals, its gene composition or functional capacity is highly conserved - implying an ecological property known as functional redundancy. Such functional redundancy has been hypothesized to underlie the stability and resilience of the human microbiome, but this hypothesis has never been quantitatively tested. The origin of functional redundancy is still elusive. Here, we investigate the basis for functional redundancy in the human microbiome by analyzing its genomic content network - a bipartite graph that links microbes to the genes in their genomes. We find that this network exhibits several topological features that favor high functional redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a simple genome evolution model to generate genomic content network, finding that moderate selection pressure and high horizontal gene transfer rate are necessary to generate genomic content networks with key topological features that favor high functional redundancy. Finally, we analyze data from two published studies of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), finding that high functional redundancy of the recipient's pre-FMT microbiota raises barriers to donor microbiota engraftment. This work elucidates the potential ecological and evolutionary processes that create and maintain functional redundancy in the human microbiome and contribute to its resilience. Here, the authors develop a genome evolution model to investigate the origin of functional redundancy in the human microbiome by analyzing its genomic content network and illustrate potential ecological and evolutionary processes that may contribute to its resilience.

AB Ecological theory predicts that the high local diversity observed in tropical forests is maintained by negative density-dependent interactions within and between closely related plant species. By using long-term data on tree growth and survival for coexisting Inga (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) congeners, we tested two mechanisms thought to underlie negative density dependence (NDD): competition for resources and attack by herbivores. We quantified the similarity of neighbors in terms of key ecological traits that mediate these interactions, as well as the similarity of herbivore communities. We show that phytochemical similarity and shared herbivore communities are associated with decreased growth and survival at the sapling stage, a key bottleneck in the life cycle of tropical trees. None of the traits associated with resource acquisition affect plant performance, indicating that competition between neighbors may not shape local tree diversity. These results suggest that herbivore pressure is the primary mechanism driving NDD at the sapling stage.

AB Grazing systems dynamics are driven by a complex combination of socio-economic, political and environmental contexts. Although the drivers and dynamics can be highly location-specific, we focus on describing global trends as well as trends by agro-ecological, socio-economic and political contexts. Global grasslands have expanded in area over the last decades. A decreasing trend has however been observed since the 21st century. Grazing systems' management has also intensified. While these dynamics can have socio-economic and environmental benefits, they have often led to unsustainable systems, exemplified by deforestation and land degradation. Opportunities for land expansion without damaging forests and natural ecosystems are increasingly limited around the world and future increases in grazing systems production will need to mainly come from increases in productivity per animal and per unit area. We highlight some priority research areas and issues for policy makers to consider to help the movement towards more sustainable systems.

AB Although specialized interactions, including those involving plants and their pollinators, are often invoked to explain high species diversity, they are rarely explored at macroevolutionary scales. We investigate the dynamic evolution of hummingbird and bat pollination syndromes in the centropogonid clade (Lobelioideae: Campanulaceae), an Andean-centered group of approximate to 550 angiosperm species. We demonstrate that flowers hypothesized to be adapted to different pollinators based on flower color fall into distinct regions of morphospace, and this is validated by morphology of species with known pollinators. This supports the existence of pollination syndromes in the centropogonids, an idea corroborated by ecological studies. We further demonstrate that hummingbird pollination is ancestral, and that bat pollination has evolved approximate to 13 times independently, with approximate to 11 reversals. This convergence is associated with correlated evolution of floral traits within selective regimes corresponding to pollination syndrome. Collectively, our results suggest that floral morphological diversity is extremely labile, likely resulting from selection imposed by pollinators. Finally, even though this clade's rapid diversification is partially attributed to their association with vertebrate pollinators, we detect no difference in diversification rates between hummingbird- and bat-pollinated lineages. Our study demonstrates the utility of pollination syndromes as a proxy for ecological relationships in macroevolutionary studies of certain species-rich clades.

AB Tropical forests have long been thought to be in stable state, but recent insights indicate that global change is leading to shifts in forest dynamics and species composition. These shifts may be driven by environmental changes such as increased resource availability, increased drought stress, and/or recovery from past disturbances. The relative importance of these drivers can be inferred from analyzing changes in trait values of tree communities. Here, we evaluate a decade of change in species and trait composition across five old-growth Neotropical forests in Bolivia, Brazil, Guyana, and Costa Rica that cover large gradients in rainfall and soil fertility. To identify the drivers of compositional change, we used data from 29 permanent sample plots and measurements of 15 leaf, stem, and whole-plant traits that are important for plant performance and should respond to global change drivers. We found that forests differ strongly in their community-mean trait values, resulting from differences in soil fertility and annual rainfall seasonality. The abundance of deciduous species with high specific leaf area increases from wet to dry forests. The community-mean wood density is high in the driest forests to protect xylem vessels against drought cavitation, and is high in nutrient-poor forests to increase wood longevity and enhance nutrient residence time in the plant. Interestingly, the species composition changed over time in three of the forests, and the community-mean wood density increased and the specific leaf area decreased in all forests, indicating that these forests are changing toward later successional stages dominated by slow-growing, shade-tolerant species. We did not see changes in other traits that could reflect responses to increased drought stress, such as increased drought deciduousness or decreased maximum adult size, or that could reflect increased resource availability (CO2, rainfall, or nitrogen). Changes in species and trait composition in these forests are therefore most likely caused by recovery from past disturbances. These compositional changes may also lead to shifts in ecosystem processes, such as a lower carbon sequestration and "slower" forest dynamics.

AB Arguably the majority of species on Earth utilise tropical rainforest canopies, and much progress has been made in describing arboreal assemblages, especially for arthropods. The most commonly described patterns for tropical rainforest insect communities are host specificity, spatial specialisation (predominantly vertical stratification), and temporal changes in abundance (seasonality and circadian rhythms). Here I review the recurrent results with respect to each of these patterns and discuss the evolutionary selective forces that have generated them in an attempt to unite these patterns in a holistic evolutionary framework. I propose that species can be quantified along a generalist-specialist scale not only with respect to host specificity, but also other spatial and temporal distribution patterns, where specialisation is a function of the extent of activity across space and time for particular species. When all of these distribution patterns are viewed through the paradigm of specialisation, hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the evolution of host specificity can also be applied to explain the generation and maintenance of other spatial and temporal distribution patterns. The main driver for most spatial and temporal distribution patterns is resource availability. Generally, the distribution of insects follows that of the resources they exploit, which are spatially stratified and vary temporally in availability. Physiological adaptations are primarily important for host specificity, where nutritional and chemical variation among host plants in particular, but also certain prey species and fungi, influence host range. Physiological tolerances of abiotic conditions are also important for explaining the spatial and temporal distributions of some insect species, especially in drier forest environments where desiccation is an ever-present threat. However, it is likely that for most species in moist tropical rainforests, abiotic conditions are valuable indicators of resource availability, rather than physiologically limiting factors. Overall, each distribution pattern is influenced by the same evolutionary forces, but at differing intensities. Consequently, each pattern is linked and not mutually exclusive of the other distribution patterns. Most studies have examined each of these patterns in isolation. Future work should focus on examining the evolutionary drivers of these patterns in concert. Only then can the relative strength of resource availability and distribution, host defensive phenotypes, and biotic and abiotic interactions on insect distribution patterns be determined.

AB 1. According to the pyrodiversity paradigm, a wide range of fire regimes is required to maintain biodiversity in fire-prone landscapes. However, the requisite level of pyrodiversity has seldom been tested and may actually be very low.
   2. Here, we examine the sensitivity of tropical savanna ants to variation in fire regimes using results from a long-term fire experiment near Darwin, Australia. Six experimental fire regimes, with varying fire frequency and seasonality, have been applied to 18 one-ha plots in three replicated blocks since 2004, with ants sampled prior to experimental burning and then annually after up to 2009. Our primary focus is on the extent to which different patterns of ant richness and composition are associated with each of the six treatment regimes, or whether there is such high overlap that differences only become apparent when experimental treatments are grouped to provide strongly contrasting fire regimes.
   3. When treating each of the six fire treatments separately, we were unable to detect a significant influence of fire on any ant community response variable. We were only able to detect significant ant responses when we grouped the experimental treatments into two contrasting fire frequency classes, low (burnt at most once over the 5 years) vs. high (burnt every 1 or 2 years). Even then, these responses were only evident after 3 years of fire treatment.
   4. Our findings demonstrate that ant communities have very high resilience in relation to fire, with differences evident only between strongly contrasting regimes. Such resilience appears to be characteristic of savanna ants throughout the world.
   5. Synthesis and applications. A large range of finely tuned fire regimes is unlikely to promote regional ant diversity. Rather, only very limited pyrodiversity (a combination of frequently and infrequently burnt areas) would appear to be sufficient for maintaining diversity at a landscape scale. It is important that fire management for biodiversity conservation focuses on the demonstrated requirements of target species, rather than be based on an assumption that 'pyrodiversity begets biodiversity'.

AB Canopy gaps created by wind-throw events, or blowdowns, create a complex mosaic of forest patches varying in disturbance intensity and recovery in the Central Amazon. Using field and remote sensing data, we investigated the shortterm (four-year) effects of large (>2000 m(2)) blowdown gaps created during a single storm event in January 2005 near Manaus, Brazil, to study (i) how forest structure and composition vary with disturbance gradients and (ii) whether tree diversity is promoted by niche differentiation related to wind-throw events at the landscape scale. In the forest area affected by the blowdown, tree mortality ranged from 0 to 70%, and was highest on plateaus and slopes. Less impacted areas in the region affected by the blowdown had overlapping characteristics with a nearby unaffected forest in tree density (583 +/- 46 trees ha(-1)) (mean +/- 699% Confidence Interval) and basal area (26.7 +/- 2.4 m(2) ha(-1)). Highly impacted areas had tree density and basal area as low as 120 trees ha(-1) and 14.9 m 2 ha(-1), respectively. In general, these structural measures correlated negatively with an index of tree mortality intensity derived from satellite imagery. Four years after the blowdown event, differences in size-distribution, fraction of resprouters, floristic composition and species diversity still correlated with disturbance measures such as tree mortality and gap size. Our results suggest that the gradients of wind disturbance intensity encompassed in large blowdown gaps (>2000 m(2)) promote tree diversity. Specialists for particular disturbance intensities existed along the entire gradient. The existence of species or genera taking an intermediate position between undisturbed and gap specialists led to a peak of rarefied richness and diversity at intermediate disturbance levels. A diverse set of species differing widely in requirements and recruitment strategies forms the initial post-disturbance cohort, thus lending a high resilience towards wind disturbances at the community level.

AB A standardized rapid inventory method providing information on both tree species diversity and aboveground carbon stocks in tropical forests will be an important tool for evaluating efforts to conserve biodiversity and to estimate the carbon emissions that result from deforestation and degradation (REDD). Herein, we contrast five common plot methods differing in shape, size, and effort requirements to estimate tree diversity and aboveground tree biomass (AGB). We simulated the methods across six Neotropical forest sites that represent a broad gradient in forest structure, tree species richness, and floristic composition, and we assessed the relative performance of methods by evaluating the bias and precision of their estimates of AGB and tree diversity. For a given sample of forest area, a several small' (<1ha) sampling strategy led to a smaller coefficient of variation (CV) in the estimate of AGB than a few large' one. The effort (person-days) required to achieve an accurate AGB estimate (<10% CV), however, was greater for the smallest plots (0.1ha) than for a compromise approach using 0.5ha modified Gentry plots, which proved to be the most efficient method to estimate AGB across all forest types. Gentry plots were also the most efficient at providing accurate estimates of tree diversity (<10% CV of Hill number). We recommend the use of the 0.5ha modified Gentry plot method in future rapid inventories, and we discuss a set of criteria that should inform any choice of inventory method.

AB Individual performance is a function of an individual's traits and its environment. This function, known as an environmental filter, varies in space and affects community composition. However, filters are poorly characterized because dispersal patterns can obscure environmental effects, and few studies utilize longitudinal data linking individual performance to environment. We model the effects of environmental filters on demographic rates of nearly all tree species (99) in a 25-ha subtropical rain forest plot. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian model of environmental filtering, drawing inspiration from classic studies of intraspecific natural selection. We characterize the specific environmental gradients and trait axes most important in filtering of demographic rates across species. We found that stronger filtering along a given trait axis corresponded to less spatial variation in the value of favoured traits. Environmental gradients associated with filtering were different for growth versus survivorship. Species maximum height was under the strongest filtering for growth, with shorter species favoured on convex ridges. Shorter stature species may be favoured on ridges because trees on ridges experience higher wind damage and lower soil moisture. Wood density filtering had the strongest effects on survival. Steep slopes and high available P in the soil favoured species with low-density wood. Such sites may be favourable for fast-growing species that exploit resource-rich environments. Synthesis: We characterized trait-mediated environmental filters that may underlie spatial niche differentiation and life-history trade-offs, which can promote species coexistence. Filtering along trait axes with the strongest effects on local community composition, that is, traits with the strongest filtering, may necessarily have a weaker potential to promote species coexistence across the plot. The weak spatial variation in filters with strong effects on demography may result from long-term processes affecting the species pool that favour habitat generalist strategies.

AB Fire is becoming a common phenomenon in Amazonian forest, modifying the structure and composition of natural assemblages. In particular, fire is known to affect patterns of bird diversity in tropical forests, but we have little understanding of the consequences of this for the functional diversity of bird assemblages. For example, frequent fires could act as an environmental filter selecting species with similar traits and, thus, producing a functional clustering pattern. Here, we used body mass, and dietary and foraging traits to calculate the functional structure of understorey bird assemblages in Amazonian forests analysed 3 years after they had passed under three disturbance levels within the 19971998 El-Nino period: unburned, burned once and burned twice. First, we tested whether observed levels of functional diversity were different among these forests and also from what one would expect by chance. Then, we investigated if habitat structure was able to predict changes in the functional structure of the studied bird assemblages. In general, there was no evidence of fire reducing functional diversity nor selecting species functionally more similar than expected by chance. Therefore, bird functional diversity was not different from random in unburned and burned forests. This provides some evidence in favour of high functional redundancy of bird species in the tropics, but also indicates that neutral theories of biodiversity, where processes such as dispersal and survival are more important than biological traits to community assembly, may apply to the assemblages studied. Also, we showed that bird assemblages from forests disturbed by wildfires have the tendency to be functionally overdispersed whereas assemblages from pristine forests tend to be functionally clustered. Thus, environmental structure, in part driven by forest responses to fire, is more important than simple categorical definitions of burn frequency for explaining trait-based assembly rules of understorey birds in the Amazon forest.

AB 1. The JanzenConnell hypothesis provides explanations for species coexistence and predicts that recruitment of tree juveniles is reduced by host-specific enemies, particularly soil biota. Previous studies, however, have not fully addressed the aspect of host specificity. Using a legume tree (Ormosia glaberrima) in a subtropical monsoon forest as a model, we experimentally investigated the mechanisms underlying a JanzenConnell effect. 2. A negative plantsoil feedback was identified by a field census and confirmed by planting surface-sterilized seeds at different densities around focal trees. Fungicides were applied to test whether the effects were caused by fungi. In a growth-room inoculation experiment, effects of collected soil samples on seedling survival were examined and compared to soil samples treated with fungicides. Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequence of the 28S ribosomal RNA gene was used for pathogen identification. The fungus causing seedling mortality was isolated and characterized by ITS rDNA sequencing and inoculation experiments. 3. A JanzenConnell effect was identified at a field site, in which O. glaberrima was a locally common species. In situ treatments with fungicides and a corresponding growth-room simulation experiment showed that seedling survival depended on the distance to focal adult trees and that a fungal pathogen attacked seeds and seedlings. No negative plantsoil feedback was observed at another field site with a single O. glaberrima tree, indicating a locally rare species advantage. 4. The disease-inducing fungus was identified as Fusarium oxysporum. Inoculation experiments showed that the isolated fungus was pathogenic on O. glaberrima seedlings, but non-pathogenic on seedlings from other tree species co-occurring with O. glaberrima. Moreover, susceptibility of O. glaberrima depended on seed provenance (likely genotype). 5. Synthesis. We demonstrate that an observed negative plantsoil feedback on a locally common legume tree is caused by a host-specific pathogen. Our data fully support the criteria of spatially unequal pathogen distribution and host specificity proposed in the JanzenConnell model. Taken the interaction between O. glaberrima and F. oxysporum as a paradigm, we suggest that host-specific pathogens, locally accumulated around parent trees, are important determinants of tree community structure.

AB Land-bridge islands formed by dam construction are considered to be "experimental" systems for studying the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation, offering many distinct advantages over terrestrial fragments. The Thousand Island Lake in Southeast China is one such land-bridge system with more than 1000 islands. Based on a field survey of vascular plant richness on 154 land-bridge islands during 2007-2008, we examined the effects of island and landscape attributes on plant species richness and patterns of species nestedness. We also examined the different responses of plant functional groups (classified according to growth form and shade tolerance) to fragmentation. We found that island area explained the greatest amount of variation in plant species richness. Island area and shape index positively affected species diversity and the degree of nestedness exhibited by plant communities while the perimeter to area ratio of the islands had a negative effect. Shade-tolerant plants were the most sensitive species group to habitat fragmentation. Isolation negatively affected the degree of nestedness in herb and shade-intolerant plants including species with various dispersal abilities in the fragmented landscape. Based on these results, we concluded that the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on overall species richness depended mostly on the degree of habitat loss, but patterns of nestedness were generated from different ecological mechanisms due to species-specific responses to different characteristics of habitat patches.

AB 1. There is growing interest in the potential of payments for ecosystem services (PES) to encourage land managers to protect and enhance the environment. However, questions remain about how PES agreements should be designed. There is a division between schemes that structure payments by action or by results, with most biodiversity PES schemes, including European agri-environment schemes, paying by action; for example incentivising land managers to carry out actions believed to increase biodiversity. Payment by results is a common incentive structure in the private sector (e.g. labourers doing piece work or no-win no-fee lawyers) but rarer in PES.
   2. Using a theoretical modelling approach, we investigate the conditions under which each way of structuring payments may be more cost-effective in a biodiversity PES.
   3. Payment by action is favoured where there is a clear action that can be specified at an appropriate level and to which biodiversity is sensitive. We found that payment by results is favoured in degraded landscapes as incentives are created for managers to use their private knowledge and join the scheme only if they can produce the biodiversity services targeted by the scheme. Payment by results is also favoured where biodiversity is less sensitive to conservation action and when it is difficult for a central agency to determine an appropriate level of conservation action. This is because payment by results allows individual managers to optimise their level of action.
   4. The relative cost of monitoring action (compliance with an agreement to manage in a certain way) versus results (the presence of biodiversity) has a substantial effect on which payment structure is more efficient only when the central agency can accurately set an appropriate level of action. We illustrate these principles with examples based on agri-environment schemes.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Payment by results deserves more attention from those designing biodiversity PES (be they agri-environment schemes in agricultural landscapes or direct payment schemes in more intact ecosystems). This paper provides a formal framework to help policy makers identify the conditions under which payment by results or payment by action is most likely to yield cost-effective biodiversity conservation.

AB Tree mortality is an important process determining forest dynamics. However, in species-rich tropical forests it is largely unknown, how species differ in their response of mortality to resource availability and individual condition. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the impact of light availability, tree size and past growth on mortality of 284 woody species in a 50-ha long-term forest census plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Light reaching each individual tree was estimated from yearly vertical censuses of vegetation density. Across the community, 78% of the species showed increasing mortality with increasing light. Considering species individually, just 29 species showed a significant response to light, all with increasing mortality at high light. Past growth had a significant impact on all but three species, with higher growth leading to lower mortality. For the majority of species, mortality decreased sharply with diameter in saplings, then levelled off or increased slightly towards the maximum diameter of the species. Diameter had the biggest impact on mortality, followed by past growth and finally light availability. Our results challenge many previous reports of higher mortality in shade, and we suggest that it is crucial to control for size effects when assessing the impact of environmental conditions on mortality.

AB Fire in the forested tropics has profound environmental, economic, and social impacts at multiple geographical scales. Causes of tropical fires are widely documented, although research contributions are from many disciplines, and each tends to focus on specific facets of a research problem, which might limit understanding of fire as a complex social-ecological system. We conducted a systematic review to (1) examine geographic and methodological focus in tropical fire research; (2) identify which types of landholders are the focus of the research effort; (3) test for a research method effect on the variables, e. g., socio-political, economic, and climatic, identified as causes of and proposed management solutions to tropical fire; and (4) examine relationships between causal factors and proposed solutions. Results from 51 studies show distinct geographic and methodological tendencies in the literature. Few studies explicitly identify landholder types, and no social studies focused on large-landholders. Multiple drivers and potential solutions to preventing fire are identified and the research approach adopted had the strongest influence on the socioeconomic, direct fire management and landscape characteristics variables. There was an overall mismatch between identified cause and proposed management solution. These findings indicate that mixed method approaches are imperative to understanding the coupled human-nature system of fire and to improve rural development and management strategies to curtail tropical fire spread.

AB The field of biodiversity conservation increasingly recognizes the need for empirical evaluations of conservation interventions. While the amount of money invested into conservation and the number of protected areas across the globe have been increasing in the past few decades, few well-designed empirical studies try to show what could have happened in the absence of the conservation efforts. In this paper, we propose an empirical method to evaluate such conservation intervention. We integrate a cellular automata-Markov modeling approach and a counterfactual approach showing what may have happened in the absence of a certain conservation intervention. We test this method in a human-dominated tropical landscape in Central India; however, our method is transferable to any other socio-ecological setting. The study area is located in the tropical forests of Central India and has witnessed several management strategies since its declaration as a protected area in the mid-1970s. However, landscape practitioners have identified the revised forest policy of 1988 to play a vital role in this landscape. We chose this particular forest policy as the conservation intervention in our study and tested our method using this landscape as a template. We used remote sensing and GIS techniques to analyze multi-sensor satellite data from the last 30 years to monitor forest transitions and compare them with the counterfactual scenario. Our findings not only shed light on the importance of national-level policies in governing forest dynamics, but also established our proposed method as an effective tool for empirical evaluation of conservation intervention, particularly in developing countries.

AB Even though social network analysis provides an important tool to characterize and compare societies, no studies have used its analytical applications to characterize patterns of sociality in bats. Here I use social network analysis to characterize and compare patterns of sociality between three populations of the leaf-roosting bat Thyroptera tricolor. Sites differed in the density of furled leaves used by T. tricolor for roosting. Finca had more leaves per hectare (77), followed by Urena (58), and Esquinas (7). The time period over which the probability of association is halved based on fitted models was 1,086 days for Finca, 714 days for Urena, and 303 days for Esquinas. Finca and Urena had very similar network topologies, with several small clusters, high-clustering coefficients, short path lengths, low node betweenness, and high network robustness. Social networks at Esquinas were composed of one large cluster and several small isolated ones. Esquinas also had high-clustering coefficients, but path length and node betweenness were high. Network resilience was lower in Esquinas compared to Finca and Urena. These results show that, unlike many other forest-dwelling bats that switch roosts regularly, T. tricolor does not exhibit a typical fission-fusion social system, and that resource availability seems to affect social networks in this bat. In addition, this study highlights the importance of emigrating individuals in maintaining social cohesion, establishing network connectedness, and determining network robustness.

AB Question
   What are the relative roles of tree growth, mortality and recruitment in variations of above-ground biomass in tropical forests?
   Location
   Paracou, French Guiana.
   Methods
   We quantified the contribution of growth, recruitment and mortality to total biomass of stands (trees DBH >= 10 cm) in six 6.25-ha permanent plots over 16 yr. Live biomass stocks and fluxes were computed for four separate size classes.
   Results
   All plots showed increasing biomass stocks over the study period, with an average value of +0.9 Mg ha-1 yr-1. Plots aggrading biomass were characterized by either minor biomass losses due to mortality or substantial increases in the biomass of large trees (DBH >= 60 cm).
   Conclusions
   Within the study period, the rarity of mortality events could not counter-balance the slow permanent increase in biomass, resulting in an apparent increase in biomass. Accounting for such rare events results in no net change in biomass balance.

AB Many related species share the same environment and utilize similar resources. This is surprising because based on the principle of competitive exclusion one would predict that the superior competitor would drive the other species to extinction; coexistence is only predicted if interspecific competition is weaker than intraspecific competition. Interspecific competition is frequently reduced by differential resource use, resulting in habitat segregation. In this paper, we use the closely related collared and pied flycatcher to assess the potential of habitat differences to affect interspecific competition through a different mechanism, namely by generating temporal differences in availability of similar food resources between the two species. We found that the tree species composition of the breeding territories of the two species differed, mainly by a higher abundance of coniferous species around nest-boxes occupied by pied flycatchers. The temporal availability of caterpillars was measured using frass traps under four deciduous and two coniferous tree species. Deciduous tree species showed an early and narrow peak in abundance, which contrasted with the steady increase in caterpillar abundance in the coniferous tree species through the season. We subsequently calculated the predicted total caterpillar biomass available in each flycatcher territory. This differed between the species, with biomass decreasing more slowly in pied flycatcher territories. Caterpillar biomass is strongly correlated with the reproductive success of collared flycatchers, but much less so with pied flycatchers. However, caterpillar availability can only partly explain the differences in seasonal decline of reproductive success between the two species; we discuss additional factors that may contribute to this species difference. Overall, our results are consistent with the suggestion that minor habitat differences between these two species may contribute to promoting their coexistence.

AB Neutral models of community dynamics are a powerful tool for ecological research, but their applications are currently limited to unrealistically simple types of dynamics and ignore much of the complexity that characterize natural ecosystems. Here, we present a new analytical framework for neutral models that unifies existing models of neutral communities and extends the applicability of existing models to a much wider spectrum of ecological phenomena. The new framework extends the concept of neutrality to fitness equivalence and in spite of its simplicity explains a wide spectrum of empirical patterns of species diversity including positive, negative and unimodal productivity-diversity relationships; gradual and highly delayed declines in species diversity with habitat loss; and positive and negative responses of species diversity to habitat heterogeneity. Surprisingly, the abundance distribution in all of these cases is given by the dispersal limited multinomial (DLM), the abundance distribution in Hubbell's zero-sum model, showing DLM's robustness and demonstrating that it cannot be used to infer the underlying community dynamics. These results support the hypothesis that ecological communities are regulated by a limited set of fundamental mechanisms much simpler than could be expected from their immense complexity.

AB A variety of human-induced disturbances such as forest fragmentation and recovery after deforestation for pasture or agricultural activities have resulted in a complex landscape mosaic in the Una region of northeastern Brazil. Using a set of vegetation descriptors, we investigated the main structural changes observed in forest categories that comprise the major components of the regional landscape and searched for potential key descriptors that could be used to discriminate among different forest categories. We assessed the forest structure of five habitat categories defined as (I) interiors and (2) edges of large fragments of old-growth forest (>1000 ha), (3) interiors and (4) edges of small forest fragments (<100 ha), and (5) early secondary forests. Forest descriptors used here were: frequency of herbaceous lianas and woody climbers, number of standing dead trees, number of fallen trunks, litter depth, number of pioneer plants (early secondary and shade-intolerant species), vertical foliage stratification profile and distribution Of trees in different diameter classes. Edges and interiors of forest fragments were significantly different only in the number of standing dead trees. Secondary forests and edges of fragments showed differences in litter depth, fallen trunks and number of pioneer trees, and secondary forests were significantly different from fragment interiors in the number of standing dead trees and the number of pioneer trees. Horizontal and vertical structure evaluated via ordination analysis showed that fragment interiors, compared to secondary forests, were characterized by a greater number of medium (25-35 cm) and large (35-50 cm) trees and smaller numbers of thin trees (5-10 cm). There was great heterogeneity at the edges of small and large fragments, as these sites were distributed along almost the entire gradient. Most interiors of large and small fragments presented higher values of foliage densities at higher strata ( 15-20 m and at 20-25 m height), and lower densities at 1-5 m. All secondary forests and some fragment edge sites showed an opposite tendency. A discriminant function highlighted differences among forest categories, with transects of large fragment interiors and secondary forests representing two extremes along a disturbance gradient determined by foliage structure (densities at 15-20 m and 20-25 m), with the edges of both large and small fragments and the interiors of small fragments scattered across the gradient. The major underlying processes determining patterns of forest disturbance in the study region are discussed, highlighting the importance of forest fragments, independently of its size, as forests recovery after clear cut show a greatly distinct structure, with profound implications on fauna movements.

AB We analyzed the most extensive data set of tree inventory plots spread over the complete Amazon basin and Guiana shield. We aimed to separate the regional and local tree alpha-diversity to investigate the drivers of diversity at the relevant scale. Our results are consistent with the partitioning of total tree alpha-diversity into regional and local components, which are controlled by evolutionary- and ecological processes, respectively. Regional diversity is correlated with palaeo-climatic stability (31%), and long-term large-scale ecosystem dynamics (14%), as represented by the age of the geological formation. Both mechanisms contribute to high diversity in the central to western Amazon. Actual rainfall seasonality is correlated with regional tree diversity to a certain extent (19%), but we argue that this is of little consequence for the evolutionary drivers of the regional species pool. Frequency of disturbance is the main process driving local diversity, although its explanatory power is relatively small (17%).

AB Fuelwood extracted from natural forests serves as a principal energy source in rural regions of many tropical countries. Although fuelwood extraction (even low intensities) might strongly impact the structure and species composition of natural forests, long-term studies remain scarce. Here, we estimate the potential long-term impacts (over several hundred years) of such repeated harvesting of single trees on tropical montane cloud forest in central Veracruz, Mexico, by applying a process-based forest growth model. We simulate a wide range of possible harvesting scenarios differing in wood volume harvested and preferred tree species and sizes, and use a set of indicators to compare their impacts on forest size structure and community composition. Results showed that the overall impact on forest structure and community composition increased linearly with the amount of harvested wood volume. Even at low levels of harvesting, forest size structure became more homogeneous in the long term because large old trees disappeared from the forest, but these changes might take decades or even centuries. Although recruitment of harvested species benefited from harvesting, species composition shifted to tree species that are not used for fuelwood. Our results demonstrate that fuelwood extraction can have marked long-term impacts on tropical montane cloud forests. The results also offer the possibility to support the design of management strategies for the natural species-rich forests that achieve a balance between economic needs and ecological goals of the stakeholders.

AB Cerradomy's is a monophyletic genus that includes four known species, Cerradomys subflavus, C maracajuensis, C. marinhus, and C. scotti, distributed throughout the open vegetation belt across South America, from northeastern Brazil to southeastern Bolivia, and from eastern to northwestern Paraguay. We revised the status of the species currently assigned to this genus by analyzing skins, skulls, karyotypes, and cytochrome b DNA sequences. We also described two novel species, one distributed in the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais, Bahia, and Sergipe, and the other in the states of Paraiba, Pernambuco, Piaui, Ceara, and Maranhao. Molecular analysis suggested the following phylogenetics arrangement: (((C. subflavus-C. sp.n.2) C. sp.n.1) C scotti)(C. marinhus-C. maracajuensis)). Apparently, both novel species inhabit the Caatinga domain and penetrated the coastal Atlantic rainforest, differing from the remaining congeneric species that are typical open-area inhabitants.

AB Disturbance of competitive-dominant plant and algae canopies often lead to increased diversity of the assemblage. Kelp forests, particularly those of temperate Western Australia, are habitats with high alpha diversity. This study investigated the roles of broad-scale canopy loss and local scale reef topography on structuring the kelp-dominated macroalgal forests in Western Australia. Eighteen 314 m(2) circular areas were cleared of their Ecklonia radiata canopy and eighteen controls were established across three locations. The patterns of macroalgal recolonisation in replicate clearances were observed over a 34 month period. Macroalgal species richness initially increased after canopy removal with a turf of filamentous and foliose macroalgae dominating cleared areas for up to seven months. A dense Sargassum canopy dominated cleared areas from 11 to 22 months. By 34 months, partial recovery of the kelp canopy into cleared areas had occurred. Some cleared areas did not follow this trajectory but remained dominated by turfing, foliose and filamentous algae. As kelp canopies developed, the initial high species diversity declined but still remained elevated relative to undisturbed controls, even after 34 months. More complex reef topography was associated with greater variability in the algal assemblage between replicate quadrats suggesting colonising algae had a greater choice of microhabitats available to them on topographically complex reefs. Shading by canopies of either Sargassum spp. and E. radiata are proposed to highly influence the abundance of algae through competitive exclusion that is relaxed by disturbance of the canopy. Disturbance of the canopy in E. radiata kelp forests created a mosaic of different patch types (turf, Sargassum-dominated, kelp-dominated). These patch types were both transient and stable over the 34 months of this study, and are a potential contemporary process that maintains high species diversity in temperate kelp-dominated reefs.

AB 1 In forest communities, species coexistence can be favoured by disturbance-related variations in light regime coupled with rank reversal in species performance. The objective of this study was to determine if a major canopy disturbance, resulting from an ice storm, would favour the coexistence of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and beech (Fagus grandifolia) in an old-growth forest located near the northern limit of the species' range.
   2 The growth, density and frequency of occurrence of understorey stems were evaluated 7 years after the ice storm and compared with pre-disturbance values to determine if sugar maple, a slightly less shade-tolerant species, would be favoured over beech.
   3 Although height and radial growth increased three- to five-fold, and > 70% of the 5-10 cm d.b.h. stems showed a release, sugar maple did not benefit more from the opening of the canopy than beech.
   4 The inability of sugar maple to outgrow beech might be related to the high proportion of beech root sprouts at our site, suggesting that the potential for the disturbance-mediated mechanism to slow the competitive exclusion of maple might decrease as the importance of vegetative reproduction increases in beech.
   5 Prior to the disturbance, sugar maple was more abundant and occurred in a larger proportion of the plots among small size classes, while beech dominated in the larger size classes. Although some increases in the density of both species were detected after the disturbance, the general trends of relative abundance and distribution of the species were not modified significantly.
   6 Our results do not indicate that a single canopy disturbance such as the major 1998 ice storm significantly favoured sugar maple over beech. When a disturbance opens the canopy, competition for light in gaps may tend to maintain or reinforce a pre-existing hierarchy instead of reversing it, especially when interspecific differences in post-disturbance growth are small or absent, as in this study.
   7 This study shows that the dynamics of sugar maple - beech communities are more complex than previously envisaged and that revised models should incorporate additional factors (e.g. vegetative reproduction) that might also play an important role in regulating community dynamics.

AB It is critical to understand the responses of tropical tree species to ongoing anthropogenic disturbances. Given the longevity of large trees and the scarcity of appropriately long-term demographic data, standing size distributions are a potential tool for predicting species' responses to disturbances and resultant changes in population structure. Here we test the utility of several different measures of size distribution for predicting subsequent population changes at the intraspecific level using demographic records from two subsampled 50-ha tree plots in Malaysia (Pasoh and Lambir). Most measures of size distribution failed to successfully predict population change better than random; however, the 'coefficient of skewness' (a measure of the relative proportion of small vs. large stems in a population) was able to correctly predict the direction of population change for approximately three-quarters of species at both sites. At Pasoh, the magnitude of this relationship decreased with adult stature and rate of turnover, but was unrelated to sapling growth rates at either site. Finally, using data for species common at both forests, we found that size distributions were generally uninformative of subsequent differences in population change between sites (only median dbh correctly predicted the direction of change for more species than random). Based on these results we conclude that some measures of intraspecific differences in size distribution are potentially informative of population trends within forests but have limited utility across broader spatial scales.

AB Both niche and neutral theories have been suggested as potential frameworks for modelling biodiversity. Niche models assume that biological traits represent evolutionary adaptations and define individuals in terms of functional trade-offs. Neutral models assume that all individuals at a single trophic level are functionally equivalent on a per capita basis with respect to their birth, death, dispersal and speciation. The opinion of many researchers is that neutral and niche processes operate simultaneously to generate diversity without knowing how the unification of both models can be achieved. Recently, several theoretical papers have reported evidence on the evolutionary emergence of niche structures shaping the emergence of groups of similar species. In this way, an Emergent Group is defined as a set of species that have a similar functional niche owing to a convergent ecological strategy. Central to the Emergent Group concept are the assumptions of functional equivalence within and of functional divergence between Emergent Groups. Within an Emergent Group, species richness is subject to a zero-sum rule set by the balance between the rate of individual loss and of immigration. Between Emergent Groups, tradeoffs such as seed size/seedling competitivity, investment in reproductive system/investment in vegetative systems or competitive ability/predator invulnerability are cornerstones of the evolutionary divergence. Delineating Emergent Groups amounts to reaching a compromise between maximizing niche differentiation (i.e. maximizing differences in functional tradeoffs) between Emergent Groups and maximizing neutrality within Emergent Groups. Up to now, the Emergent Group concept has been mostly proposed by theoretical scientists but it should be tested by empirical ecologists. The way in which niche and neutral models could be combined provides a profitable opportunity for theoretical and empirical scientists to collaborate fruitfully.

AB Aim: Tropical savanna ecosystems are uniquely characterized by the co-dominance of both trees and grasses. An operational understanding of the ecological processes involved in maintaining this condition is essential for understanding both the functioning of savanna systems as well as their potential response to environmental change. A simple model is presented to explore the potential for a demographic mechanism of long-term tree persistence and temporal physiognomic stability in the Brazilian cerrado.
   Location: The model is developed based on data from the humid cerrado of Brazil.
   Methods: In contrast to many existing models of tree-grass dynamics a model is presented which is based on data from the humid cerrado of Brazil, which is both qualitatively and quantitatively different from many of the more arid savannas of the palaeotropics. The model focuses on the dynamics of a synthetic tree population, with particular attention given to reproduction, seedling establishment and fire effects; with separate sub-models for grass production, fire and rainfall.
   Results: The model successfully predicts coexistence across the full range of observed vegetation physiognomies, but only under limited conditions. Under coexistence conditions, the dynamics of the tree population are characterized by long periods of gradual decline, punctuated by occasional bursts of growth. However, in agreement with earlier studies, the model consistently over-predicts domination by the tree component. Fire is identified as an overriding factor in determining model behaviour, and the response of reproduction and sapling recruitment to variance in the frequency of fire ignition is identified to be of potential importance in the functioning of the Brazilian cerrado. The key dynamics of the model which promote tree-grass coexistence are consistent with a number of established determinants of ecological resilience in savanna systems.
   Main conclusions: The model identifies the importance of the effective exploitation of rare opportunities for favourable recruitment (e.g. exclusion from fire) by the tree population, in promoting coexistence within a predominantly adverse environment. Support is provided for an alternative demographic mechanism of tree-grass coexistence in the cerrado (the storage effect), which is not based on the limiting assumption of niche partitioning through differences in rooting depth. The results are consistent with those presented by recent modelling work based on the more arid savannas of southern Africa. The model presented here differs in the emphasis given to particular environmental and life-history attributes which are critical in determining the tree-grass balance, but provides further general support for the potential role of demographic mechanisms (such as the storage effect) in determining the structure of tropical savannas. Despite having clear limitations, models can serve as valuable heuristic tools to aid the integration and exploration of existing data sets as well as our present understanding of key ecological processes.

AB We studied physiognomy-specific (i.e., gaps vs. understory) responses of birds to low harvest (18.7 m(3)/ha), reduced-impact logging by comparing 3500 mist net captures in control and cut blocks of an Amazonian terra firme forest in Brazil at 20-42 mo postharvest. Species richness did not differ significantly between control (92 species) and cut (85) forest based on rarefaction to 1200 captures. Fifty-six percent of all species were shared between control and cut forest, compared to the 64 percent shared between control blocks. Higher captures of nectarivores and frugivores in cut forest likely occurred as a consequence of postharvest resource blooms. Higher captures of some insectivores in cut as compared to control forest were unexpected, attributable to increased wandering or shifts from association with midstory to understory as a consequence of habitat alteration. Logging influenced capture rates for 21 species, either consistently, or via positive interaction with physiognomy or time (13 species higher in cut forest and 8 species higher in control forest). Cut understory sites had lower diversity (H') and scaled dominance than understory and gap sites in control forest. Temporal changes in captures may have resulted from successional dynamics in cut forest: two guilds and three species increased in abundance. Increases in abundances of guilds and particular species were more prevalent in control than in cut forest, suggesting that logging displaced birds to control forest. In general, the effects of logging were relatively minor; low harvest rates and reduced-impact methods may help to retain aspects of avian biodiversity in Amazon forest understories.

AB Edge effects alter biotic interactions and forest regeneration. We investigated whether edge creation affected the seedling community and its interactions with herbivores and leaf-fungal pathogens. In forest edges and interior sites in Chiapas Mexico, we counted all woody seedlings and species (10-100 cm tall) present in 1-m(2) plots, measured their size (height and leaf number), and examined them for the occurrence of herbivory and pathogen damage. We investigated relationships between levels of damage and size, species richness and density. Species composition and biotic damage varied greatly among sites and habitats (edge vs interior). Late-successional species dominated the community, but richness was lower in interior sites and species similarity was greater among edges than among interiors. Nearly all species (95%) present at edges and interiors showed herbivory damage, whereas 76 percent of the species in edge plots and 68 percent in interior plots showed pathogen damage. Although leaf area damaged by herbivores was similar between habitats (average 9.2%), pathogen damage was three times greater in edge plots (1.85%) than in interior plots (0.57%). Size was positively related to biotic damage at both habitats. Relationships between herbivory and pathogen damage and between pathogen damage and leaf number were significant only for edges. Biotic damage was not related to density or species richness. Overall, plant community structure was similar between habitats, but biotic damage was enhanced at edges. Thus, disease spread at edges may arise as a threat to tropical rain forest vegetation.

AB Land-use change creates mosaics of habitats of different successional stages landscapes. Knowledge about successional changes in species richness and community composition is essential for understanding biodiversity change in landscapes. Here we report about the community dynamics associated with the colonization of temperate grassland by ants. The study was carried out in tow-intensity farming systems in Central Hesse, Germany, where the area covered by managed grasslands has continuously increased over the last decades. The simultaneous availability of grassland sites of different age allowed us to apply the 'space-for-time substitution' approach as a surrogate for a long-term study on ant succession. Our study on the community dynamics associated with the colonization of temperate grassland by ants did not reveal any drastic changes in species richness or composition in time. We nevertheless found clear differences between different phases of ant succession. Our data indicate a community driven by factors such as resistance to anthropogenic disturbance and opportunistic colonization during the initial period of ant succession. Ant composition was highly variable during early successional phases due to the strong site-specific differences in the distribution and abundance of pioneering species. Later successional phases, in contrast, showed much less variation in species composition, providing strong evidence for a rather predictable ant community in mature grasslands in this region. We found a change from ground nesting species that predominantly forage above-ground to the increasing abundance of the hypogaeic Lasius flavus foraging mainly below-ground. This change marks an alteration of the functional structure of the ant community. (c) 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All. rights reserved.

AB To determine the influence of the proximity of a forest edge on seed bank composition and diversity, we performed a seed bank sampling at ancient deciduous forests bordering intensive arable fields. Also vegetation patterns were taken into account. We hypothised that forest edges may facilitate the entrance of diaspores of invasive species into the forest and the successive incorporation of these species in the forest seed bank. We noticed a substantial influence of the proximity of an edge on seed bank composition at as well the forested side of the edge as the field side. The forest edge zone was limited to 3 m into the forest and the field edge zone extended 3 m into the field. The seed bank samples of field and forest edge are characterised by a higher species diversity and seed density and a higher similarity between seed bank and vegetation, compared to field or forest samples. The forest edges contains fewer pioneer species in comparison with the forest interior and more competitive species and species of edges and clearings compared with field and forest samples. The seed longevity index increases towards the forest interior. We can conclude from our data that the forest and edge seed bank are composed by both seeds from recent dispersal processes and local seed set and by seeds originating from past vegetation on the site. Near the edge, actual seed input seems of primal importance. Further towards the forest interior seed input decreases and long-living seeds of past vegetation become more important. Ancient forest edges thus act as a barrier for seeds of species of the surrounding arable field.

AB Artisanal marine invertebrate fisheries of sandy shores are amongst the poorest understood systems regarding connections between the structure and dynamics of harvested resources, a complex fishing process that involves recreational and commercial users and a management subsystem influenced by cultural, social and political factors. For thin reason, this paper addresses: (1) the temporal extractive phases through which benthic invertebrate stocks of sandy shores have gone through time, the confronted socio-economic scenarios and the relevance of different operational management measures and strategic institutional structures, and (2) critical ecological aspects of the life cycle that must be considered in assessment and management because of their strong incidence in the dynamics of the fishing process. Concerning (1): most sandy beach stocks around the-world are fully exploited, overexploited or depleted. Open access regimes and the fact that ocean beaches are open and extended systems readily accessible to unauthorized fishers or recreational harvesters, are important causes of management failure. Preferred operational management measures to revert such situation must consider spatially explicit management strategies such as reproductive refugia, rotation and closure of grounds, experimental management with spatial controls, habitat-dependent enhancement through natural restocking and seeding, and a combination of the above and other measures (e.g., size limits) through management redundancy. The high information, enforcement and policing costs of management regulations-stress the importance of fisher participation in its planning, formulation and surveillance, through formal co-management as the desired institutional arrangement. In this context, I discuss study cases in which co-management and experimental approaches were applied on a different extent and with diverse modus operandi, and how these procedures determined a gain in scientific information. Concerning (2): (a) Sandy beach populations are highly spatially structured stocks, which determine an also aggregated allocation of fishing effort. This aggregated nature of sandy beach stocks and harvesting behaviour calls for implementing spatially-explicit management strategies to properly evaluate the trade-off between alternative harvest tactics. (b) Most resources constitute metapopulations with planktonic larvae and a benthic adult phase. High and variable mortality during them dispersive planktonic phase makes prediction of recruitment to the benthic life highly uncertain. Different management strategies could be set up depending on the pattern of connectance between metapopulation components and the extent-of aggregation and persistence of the spatial structure in adults. (c) Longterm, large-scale field experiments suggest that large fluctuations in sandy beach populations are the result of intertwined forces of exogenous, environmental, density-dependent and human-induced factors operating together at different spatial and temporal scales. (d) Harvesting produces incidental mortality in exploited and unexploited population fractions and also in unharvested sympatric species, by means of direct (shell damage) and indirect (sediment disturbance) agents. (e) Short and long-term climatic events, accumulation of toxins resulting from algal blooms and viral diseased produce massive mortalities that must be addressed throughout the entire range. of distribution of species.
   The identification of meaningful spatial and temporal scales of variability in population regulation mechansms and processes, and also in the dynamic nature of the fishing process, are relevant for assessment and-management. Throughout the paper I stress some future research directions directed to improve the management status of sandy beach fisheries around the world.

AB Natural regeneration of forest trees is negatively affected by dense ground cover of brambles (Rubus fruticosus agg.) in montane forests in southwestern Germany. Seed predation by rodents is one potential factor which may reduce establishment of tree seedlings in these sites. In winter and early spring seed predation of two conifers (Abies alba Mill., Picea abies (L.) H. Karsten) was studied in bramble patches and in adjacent cleared plots (6 m x 6 m, respectively) in two montane Abies-Picea stands. Losses of seeds from experimental dishes were higher under bramble vegetation than in the cleared plots in both forest stands in winter. Seed predation was consistently lower for Abies than for Picea. The results were similar in early spring. Predation was reduced after adding conifer Litter into the dishes. Rodents were responsible for the seed losses, and rodent abundance was lower in the experimental clearings. The results are discussed with respect to natural succession on clearings and its practical relevance in forestry, i.e. clear-cutting of bramble patches as a measure to reduce seed predation by rodents.

AB Seed dispersal of Guarea glabra and G. kunthiana (Meliaceae) in Monteverde, Costa Rica was studied to determine how seed predation and secondary dispersal affect the distribution of seeds available for recruitment. The arillate seeds are consumed mainly by birds that regurgitate or defecate the seeds intact. After dispersal, 45.6% of G. glabra and 26.6% of G. kunthiana seeds were buried 1-3 cm in the soil, presumably by scatterhoarding rodents such as agoutis (Dasyprocta punctata). G. glabra seeds that were not cached were eaten mostly by beetles, and 33.7% of the seeds remained cached after 12 wk. The cached G, glabra seeds did not germinate, however, perhaps as a result of experimental procedures used to mark the seeds. In greenhouse experiments, G. glabra seeds buried to mimic scatterhoarding had higher germination success than seeds on the soil surface. G. kunthiana seeds not cached were eaten by peccaries (Tayassu tajacu) and other seed predators (60%) or were inviable (10%). Only nine (7.5%) viable G. kunthiana seeds remained in caches after 12 wk. Secondary dispersal resulted in a rearrangement of the seed shadow. G. glabra seeds were moved to sites with less leaf litter and lower vegetation density, while G. kunthiana seeds were moved farther from conspecific trees and closer to fallen logs during secondary dispersal. Considering the high rates of seed predation in the field for both species, the germination advantages for G. glabra in the greenhouse, and the shifts in microhabitat during scatterhoarding, it is likely that secondary dispersal by scatterhoarding rodents is an important stage in Guarea recruitment.

AB Mammals represent the largest-bodied elements of the world's surviving megafauna and provide several key ecosystems services, yet their populations are often under steep decline throughout the tropics. Anthropogenic defaunation is one the most important contemporary threats to modern mammal faunas. Although the Atlantic Forest biome of South America shows several clear signs of defaunation, the extent to which this biome has lost its mammal fauna remains poorly understood. Here, we collate and analyze a comprehensive body of secondary data to quantitatively assess the spatial patterns of defaunation of all medium-to large-bodied Atlantic Forest mammals which were then classed by morpho-ecological traits. We used a Defaunation Index, which was scaled-up to the entire biome using kriging interpolation, to examine the integrity of site-specific mammal faunas. We further use environmental and socioeconomic predictors to explain the drivers of defaunation. Our results show high levels of defaunation (>0.5) for most of the Atlantic Forest. Apex predators, other carnivores, large-bodied mammals and large herbivores were among the most defaunated functional groups. Remaining native vegetation cover, forest fragment size, and the largest neighboring forest remnant were the main negative predictors of defaunation. We conclude that medium-to large-bodied Atlantic Forest mammals are under high levels of threat due to historical population losses that continue today. A conservation action plan thus becomes imperative to prevent this biome from becoming an even "emptier forest", severely compromising patterns of diversity, ecological processes and ecosystem functioning.

AB 1. How species respond to temperature change depends in large part on their physiology. Physiological traits, such as critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin), provide estimates of thermal performance but may not capture the full impacts of temperature on fitness. Rather, thermal performance likely depends on a combination of traitsincluding thermal limitsthat vary among species.
   2. Here, we examine how thermal limits correlate with the main components that influence fitness in ants. First, we compare how temperature affected colony survival and growth in two ant species that differ in their responses to warming in the fieldAphaenogaster rudis (heat-intolerant) and Temnothorax curvispinosus (heat-tolerant). We then extended our study to compare CTmax, thermal requirements of brood and yearly activity season among a broader set of ant species.
   3. While thermal limits were higher for workers of T.curvispinosus than A.rudis, T.curvispinosus colonies also required higher temperatures for survival and colony growth. This pattern generalized across 17 ant species, such that species whose foragers had a high CTmax also required higher temperatures for brood development. Finally, species whose foragers had a high CTmax had relatively short activity seasons compared with less heat-tolerant species.
   4. The relationships between CTmax, thermal requirements of brood and seasonal activity suggest two main strategies for growth and development in changing thermal environments: one where ants forage at higher temperatures over a short activity season and another where ants forage at lower temperatures for an extended activity season. Where species fall on this spectrum may influence a broad range of life-history characteristics and aid in explaining the current distributions of ants as well as their responses to future climate change.

AB Extensive 1970-2010 deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has generated a similar to 1.5 Mha fragmented region known as the 'arc of deforestation'. Farmers and cattle ranchers throughout Brazil are legally required to set-aside riparian forest strips within their landholdings, but recent legislative changes have relaxed the minimum mandatory conditions of these riparian forests. In this context, we assessed the functional role of riparian forest remnants as landscape connectors for medium to large-bodied terrestrial mammals in a vast fragmented landscape of southern Amazonia. We selected 38 riparian forest strips and five riparian sites within continuous forest, installed four to five camera-traps along each riparian zone (199 camera-trap stations), and sampled the terrestrial mammal assemblage for 60 days per station during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014. We compared mammal use of riparian forests within both continuous and highly fragmented forests, and examined the effects of corridor width, corridor habitat structure, and landscape context on mammal species richness, composition, and functional diversity, all of which were higher in continuous forests than in riparian remnants. Functional diversity differences between corridor type was trait-independent and mediated by differences in species richness. Forest habitat degradation was associated with overall lower species richness, whereas forest specialists were more species-rich in increasingly wider corridors. Compositional shifts indicate that deforestation and forest degradation favours matrix-tolerant species with lower levels of forest habitat specificity. We show the potential landscape connectivity role for forest mammals of riparian Corridors, whose width and forest degradation status are key predictors of community-wide responses. We provide evidence on the importance of these relict riparian strips to forest vertebrates, strengthening the scientific arguments that help justify the recently embattled legal requirements to maintain effective riparian corridors in Brazil.

AB Nutrients have been hypothesized to influence the distribution of the savanna biome through two possible mechanisms. Low nutrient availability may restrict growth rates of trees, thereby allowing for intermittent fires to maintain low tree cover; alternatively, nutrient deficiency may even place an absolute constraint on the ability of forests to form, independent of fire. However, we have little understanding of the scales at which nutrient limitation operates, what nutrients are limiting, and the mechanisms that influence how nutrient limitation regulates savanna-forest transitions. Here, I review literature, synthesize existing data, and present a simple calculation of nutrient demand to evaluate how nutrient limitation may regulate the distribution of the savanna biome. The literature primarily supports the hypothesis that nutrients may interact dynamically with fire to restrict the transition of savanna into forest. A compilation of indirect metrics of nutrient limitation suggest that nitrogen and phosphorus are both in short supply and may limit plants. Nutrient demand calculations provided a number of insights. First, trees required high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus supply relative to empirically determined inputs. Second, nutrient demand increased as landscapes approached the transition point between savanna and forest. Third, the potential for fire-driven nutrient losses remained high throughout transitions, which may exaggerate limitation and could be a key feedback stabilizing the savanna biome. Fourth, nutrient limitation varied between functional groups, with fast-growing forest species having substantially greater nutrient demand and a higher susceptibility to fire-driven nutrient losses. Finally, African savanna trees required substantially larger amounts of nutrients supplied at greater rates, although this varied across plant functional groups. In summary, the ability of nutrients to control transitions emerges at individual and landscape scales, and is regulated through different mechanisms based on spatial (differences in underlying geology), temporal (stage in biome transition) and biological (species traits and community composition) variability.

AB This study uses 2010-2011 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to estimate total forested area in Haiti. The thematic map was generated using radiometric normalization of digital numbers by a modified normalization method utilizing pseudo-invariant polygons (PIPs), followed by supervised classification of the mosaicked image using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations Land Cover Classification System. Classification results were compared to other sources of land-cover data produced for similar years, with an emphasis on the statistics presented by the FAO. Three global land cover datasets (GLC2000, Globcover, 2009, and MODIS MCD12Q1), and a national-scale dataset (a land cover analysis by Haitian National Centre for Geospatial Information (CNIGS)) were reclassified and compared. According to our classification, approximately 32.3% of Haiti's total land area was tree covered in 2010-2011. This result was confirmed using an error-adjusted area estimator, which predicted a tree covered area of 32.4%. Standardization to the FAO's forest cover class definition reduces the amount of tree cover of our supervised classification to 29.4%. This result was greater than the reported FAO value of 4% and the value for the recoded GLC2000 dataset of 7.0%, but is comparable to values for three other recoded datasets: MCD12Q1 (21.1%), Globcover (2009) (26.9%), and CNIGS (19.5%). We propose that at coarse resolutions, the segmented and patchy nature of Haiti's forests resulted in a systematic underestimation of the extent of forest cover. It appears the best explanation for the significant difference between our results, FAO statistics, and compared datasets is the accuracy of the data sources and the resolution of the imagery used for land cover analyses. Analysis of recoded global datasets and results from this study suggest a strong linear relationship (R-2 = 0.996 for tree cover) between spatial resolution and land cover estimates.(c) 2014 The Authors.

AB This paper provides a comparative analysis of land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes among three study areas with different biophysical environments in the Brazilian Amazon at multiple scales, from per-pixel, polygon, census sector, to study area. Landsat images acquired during the years of 1990/1991, 1999/2000, and 2008/2010 were used to examine LULC change trajectories with the post-classification comparison approach. A classification system composed of six classes - forest, savanna, other vegetation (secondary succession and plantations), agro-pasture, impervious surface, and water - was designed for this study. A hierarchical-based classification method was used to classify Landsat images into thematic maps. This research shows different spatiotemporal change patterns, composition, and rates among the three study areas and indicates the importance of analysing LULC change at multiple scales. The LULC change analysis over time for entire study areas provides an overall picture of change trends, but detailed change trajectories and their spatial distributions can be better examined at a per-pixel scale. The LULC change at the polygon scale provides the information of the changes in patch sizes over time, while the LULC change at census sector scale gives new insights on how human-induced activities (e.g. urban expansion, roads, and land-use history) affect LULC change patterns and rates. This research indicates the necessity to implement change detection at multiple scales for better understanding the mechanisms of LULC change patterns and rates.

AB Tropical rain forests on deeply weathered soils are increasingly thought to be limited by phosphorus (P), where plants and associated organisms would demonstrate adaptations to efficiently recycle P using acid phosphatase from organic matter. The activities of soil and root acid phosphatase were investigated in nine tropical rain forests that demonstrated a 20-fold difference in the soil organic P pool on Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo.
   Acid phosphatase activity was measured at pH6.0 using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate.
   The specific phosphatase activity of tree roots on a soil-surface-area basis was significantly positively related with P-use efficiency of above-ground productivity, suggesting a physiological linkage between above and below-ground systems in the adaptation to P deficiency. The phosphatase activities of soils and roots were significantly negatively correlated with the pool size of soil organic P fractions, suggesting that demand for P determines phosphatase activities.
   It is suggested that tree roots and soil microbes develop more active phosphatases in response to the chronic shortage of soil P, which forms the basis for an important functional role for the efficient acquisition of P from soil organic matter.

AB Once again, the international community focuses on the preservation of Amazonian forests, in particular through a bundle of initiatives grouped under the term of REDD+. Initially focusing on reducing carbon emissions, the REDD+ process became increasingly linked with developmental goals that represent the primary interest of all Amazon countries. In consequence, REDD+ can be seen as another attempt to achieve the twin goals of environmental protection and rural development, and consequently, relies on the strategies and tools of past efforts. Against this background, we explore past experiences with key strategies for environmental protection and poverty alleviation in the Amazon to critically reflect about the potential of REDD+ to contribute to sustainable local development in the region. The analysis demonstrates that initiatives that pursued environmental goals mostly led to more restrictions and bureaucratic barriers to local forest users, while the prevailing approaches to promote rural dwellers showed ambivalent environmental outcomes. Reasons for these unsatisfactory results include the sectoral alignment of the measures and the poor coordination and lack of coherence with decisive policy areas. Most critically, the environmental and social initiatives themselves rely on the classic development approach widely disregarding smallholders' capacities to contribute to local development. The manifold pilot activities emerging under the new REDD+ framework tend to repeat these shortcomings, thereby further accelerating the replacement of local socio-productive schemes with unsustainable land uses. In view of the growing consensus about the ecological incompatibility, social limitations and economic risks of classic development, an alternative vision of development is needed, which more consciously takes into account the immense social and environmental potential of the region. Considering that REDD+ is still at the start, there might be possibilities to re-adjust the framework and thereby turn it into a real contribution to the sustainable development of rural Amazon.

AB Tropical deforestation continues to cause population declines and local extinctions in centers of avian diversity and endemism. Although local species extinctions stem from reductions in demographic rates, little is known about how habitat fragmentation influences survival of tropical bird populations or the relative importance of survival and fecundity in ultimately shaping communities. We analyzed 22 years of mark-recapture data to assess how fragmentation influenced apparent survival, recruitment, and realized population growth rate within 22 forest understory bird species in the Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. This represents the first such effort, in either tropical or temperate systems, to characterize the effect of deforestation on avian survival across such a broad suite of species. Long-term demographic analysis of this suite of species experiencing the same fragmented environment revealed considerable variability in species' responses to fragmentation, in addition to general patterns that emerged from comparison among species. Across the understory bird community as a whole, we found significantly lower apparent survival and realized population growth rate in small fragments relative to large, demonstrating fragmentation effects to demographic rates long after habitat loss. Demographic rates were depressed across five feeding guilds, suggesting that fragmentation sensitivity was not limited to insectivores. Seniority analyses, together with a positive effect of fragmentation on recruitment, indicated that depressed apparent survival was the primary driver of population declines and observed extinctions. We also found a landscape effect, with lower vital rates in one mountain range relative to another, suggesting that fragmentation effects may add to other large-scale drivers of population decline. Overall, realized population growth rate (lambda) estimates were < 1 for most species, suggesting that future population persistence, even within large forest fragments, is uncertain in this biodiversity hotspot.

AB The Guild Decomposition Model (GDM) hypothesized that temporal shifts in microbial "guilds," each with distinct substrate preferences, drive decomposition dynamics and regulate soil carbon (C) losses and sequestration. To test this hypothesis, we established a laboratory incubation of Acer saccharum litter and monitored respiration, microbial biomass and enzyme activities, inorganic nutrients and shifts in functional groups of decomposers using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Biomass and respiration peaked within the first 2 d of incubation, and the Gram negative PLFA biomarker 18:1 omega 7c predominated during the first 5 d. Hydrolytic enzyme activities and two fungal biomarkers (18:2 omega 6,9c and 18:3 omega 6c) increased by 25 d and lignolytic enzyme activity was detected at 68 d. Our results suggest that decomposers preferentially use labile substrates and that shifts in decomposer groups occur in response to changes in available substrates, which supports the GDM.

AB Several experiments were conducted with tropical tree and liana seedlings in which transpiration ratio and leaf phosphorus to carbon ratio (P:C) were measured. Transpiration ratio was expressed as kg H(2)O transpired g(-1) C incorporated into plant biomass, and leaf P:C as mg P g(-1) C. Leaf P:C was positively correlated with transpiration ratio across 19 species for plants grown under similar conditions (R(2) = 0.35, P < 0.01, n = 19). For five species in the dataset, multiple treatments were imposed to cause intra-specific variation in transpiration ratio. Within four of these five species, leaf P:C correlated positively with transpiration ratio. The slope and strength of the correlation varied among species. In one experiment, whole-plant P:C was measured in addition to leaf P:C. Patterns of correlation between whole-plant P:C and transpiration ratio were similar to those between leaf P:C and transpiration ratio. Together, these observations suggest that transpiration can influence the rate of P uptake from soil in tropical tree and liana seedlings. We suggest that this occurs through transport of inorganic phosphate and organic P compounds to root surfaces by transpiration-induced mass flow of the soil solution. The positive correlation between leaf P:C and transpiration ratio suggests that leaf P:C could decline in tropical forests as atmospheric CO(2) concentration rises, due to decreasing transpiration ratios.

AB Niche differentiation with respect to habitat has been hypothesized to shape patterns of diversity and species distributions in plant communities. African forests have been reported to be relatively less diverse compared to highly diversed regions of the Amazonian or Southeast Asian forests, and might be expected to have less niche differentiation. We examined patterns of structural and floristic differences among five topographically defined habitats for 494 species with stems a parts per thousand yen1 cm dbh in a 50-ha plot in Korup National Park, Cameroon. In addition, we tested for species-habitat associations for 272 species (with more than 50 individuals in the plot) using Torus translation randomization tests. Tree density and basal area were lowest in areas with negative convexity, which contained streams or were inundated during rainy periods and highest in moist well-drained habitats. Species composition and diversity varied along the topographical gradient from low flat to ridge top habitats. The low depression and low flat habitats were characterized by high diversity and similar species composition, relative to slopes, high gullies and ridge tops. Sixty-three percent of the species evaluated showed significant positive associations with at least one of the five habitat types. The majority of associations were with low depressions (75 species) and the fewest with ridge tops (8 species). The large number of species-habitat associations and the pronounced contrast between low (valley) and elevated (ridgetop) habitats in the Korup plot shows that niche differentiation with respect to edaphic variables (e.g., soil moisture, nutrients) contributes to local scale tree species distributions and to the maintenance of diversity in African forests.

TI Deforestation and the Social Impacts of Soy for Biodiesel: Perspectives

SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY

ID BIOFUELS; FOREST; EXPANSION; DYNAMICS; LAND
AB Cultivation of soy for human and animal food has been growing rapidly in Brazil in the last thirty years, and the recent emergence of a biodiesel market in Brazil has stimulated this further. Soy occupies large parts of the Cerrado biome and has now reached the Amazon, and concerns have been raised about both the environmental and social impacts of this. This study combined data from literature with interview surveys in three areas in the soy belt: Sorriso, in the Cerrado; Guaranta do Norte and Alta Floresta, in the transitional zone between the Cerrado and the Amazon biome, and Santarem, which is fully in the Amazon biome, to understand these impacts from the perspective of the soy farmers, the other farmers, and the laborers. From the literature it is clear that at least 80% of the direct deforestation is due to clearance for cattle rearing, and we estimate that 13-18% is due to soy, although less than 6% can be attributed to biodiesel, since most soy is used for other products. In the Amazon biome, the Forest Law, the Soy Moratorium, improved monitoring and the general unsuitability of the land have combined to keep soy cultivation at a low level so far despite the construction of a port at Santarem, which makes this area much more accessible. In the site in the transition area little soybean is cultivated due to unsuitable configuration of land and to transportation costs. In the Cerrado, however, soy has proved itself to be a viable alternative to timber, as well as replacing grazing, which is most likely causing indirect deforestation elsewhere, although this effect could not be measured in this study. More than half of the soy farmers interviewed claimed to have converted grazing land as opposed to forest, although grazing land often contains some secondary forest as well as grassland. In the transition areas, the expectation of farmers is that when transport costs fall due to road improvements, soy will be cultivated in an integrated rotation system on grazing land, improving degraded pastures. Soy farmers, laborers and non-soy farmers all have a positive view of the social impacts of soy, borne out by the fact that average incomes in Sorriso, where there has been an enormous increase in soy production over the last 20 years, are 4.6 times higher than those in Guaranta do Norte, which is still dominated by cattle rearing. The PNPB program, which aims for social inclusion of small family farmers in the production of biofuel feedstock, has succeeded in forcing large soy purchasing companies to assist essentially uneconomic farms and has enabled some small farmers in agrarian reform settlements to profit. However, we found evidence of plots changing hands and being consolidated by farmers with greater skills and capital, resulting in incipient class formation. Moreover, the companies are selective in their choice of agrarian settlement, and were not operating in those in which land holdings are very small or where the terrain is too broken up for large-scale mechanization.

AB Habitat complexity is a fundamental driver of ecosystem structure and function. Rocky intertidal shores are the classic model system for investigating theoretical and mechanistic models of habitat complexity, because the structural topography is largely biologically independent and stable over time. In the present study, we investigate how static (topographic complexity and heterogeneity) and dynamic (temperature landscape) components of habitat structure influence the abundance and body-size distribution of in vertebrates on a rocky shore. Using a novel approach that included high-resolution 3D fractal surface and temperature measurements, we show that topographic complexity, temperature landscape and habitat heterogeneity had largely independent effects on species abundance and body size. Invertebrate abundance was associated with temperature landscape in 7 of 11 species, while variation in body-size was mostly driven by fractal topography in 7 of 10 species. Overall, the body size-abundance relationship was not influenced by habitat structure, indicating that the effects of habitat structure on body size and abundance were largely independent. The results illustrate the value of combining measures of static and dynamic habitat structure to explain and predict biological patterns on rocky shores.

   DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; GROWTH
AB Based on eight years of annual censuses in secondary forests in central Amazonia, we compared successional dynamics in areas presenting alternative states due to different land use histories. Sites that had been clearcut without subsequent use are dominated by the pioneer genus Cecropia, but their understory is characterized by a diverse species assemblage. In contrast, areas clearcut and then used for pasture are dominated by the genus Vismia, forming nearly monogeneric stands. We evaluated whether such patterns were the outcome of differences in community compensatory trends, leading to a dynamic system of sequential replacement of species in Cecropia stands, and to a persistent stage of succession in Vismia stands. Floristic turnover in Cecropia stands showed strong and consistent negative frequency dependence. In contrast, Vismia stands exhibited little or no frequency dependence, likely due to local competitive interactions or priority effects. In these stands, species of the genera Vismia and Bellucia remained dominant throughout the monitoring period, whereas species initially of low abundance and frequency remained so. Differences in recruitment were the major driver of these alternative states. As species colonization proceeds, we expect dominance in the Vismia stands to diminish, albeit slowly. Our approach proved to be a useful tool for comparing species turnover in systems presenting alternative states.

AB This study was designed to explicitly formulate the effect of census interval and plot size on the variability of descriptors of tropical forest structure (stand density, basal area, aboveground biomass [AGB]) and dynamic (tree growth, mortality and recruitment rates, biomass fluxes). A unique dataset from a broad plot network (37.5 ha) surveyed every 2 yr over a 16-yr period was used to develop and parameterize a new statistical model predicting the coefficients of variation for each forest descriptor. More than 90 percent of the inherent variability of these coefficients was predicted using a simple model including plot size and census interval in a Bayesian modeling framework. All descriptors of forest structure varied by <10 percent for plot sizes 42 ha. Among the descriptors of forest dynamics, AGB loss was the most variable. The number of 6.25 ha plots required to estimate its mean, over a 16-yr period, within a 20 percent error of the mean remains above four. This contrasts with a relative constant flux of biomass entering the plot through tree growth and tree recruitment. Tree growth was remarkably well estimated with <15 percent variability for a 2-yr census in a plot of 2 ha. This study provides an easy method to assess dataset limitations in efforts to estimate descriptors of forest structure and dynamic, which is of primary importance to decipher any clear consequences of global change in tropical forests.

ID RESPONSES; FRAGMENTATION; LANDSCAPES; MODEL; AREA
AB For decades, researchers have categorized species as "edge-loving" or "edge-avoiding", but recent studies that show inconsistencies in responses have called these labels into question and led to a sense that edge effects are idiosyncratic and difficult to understand. We suggest that species would be better categorized according to their sensitivity to edges, not the direction of observed responses because no species should be expected to show the same response to all edge types. Measures of edge sensitivity will apply widely across taxa and landscapes and allow metrics that are broadly comparable, making generalities easier to discern. Finally, while the direction of observed edge responses remains a critical (but largely understood) dynamic, most reported edge responses are neutral, so discovering when species are least likely to respond to edges will increase our understanding of edge ecology and associated fragmentation effects. We offer a case study that measures edge sensitivity of 15 butterfly species at 12 edge types. We found that sensitivity is weakly related to vulnerability to predation, but more importantly we show how our results generate new predictions about edge sensitivity that can be explored in future studies.

AB Consistent with the challenges of sustainability science, land architecture offers a comprehensive approach to land system dynamics useful for numerous types of assessments, ranging from the vulnerability of coupled human-environment systems to forest transitions. With antecedents in several research communities, land architecture addresses the tradeoffs within and between the human and environmental subsystems of land systems in terms of the kind, magnitude, and pattern of land uses and covers. This approach is especially cogent for changes in tropical forests. given the broad-ranging forces acting on them and the equally broad-ranging consequences of their loss. The rudiments of the land architecture approach are illustrated for changes in seasonal tropical forests in the southern Yucatan of Mexico, the pivot of which is the Calakmul biosphere reserve. Simplifying the dynamics involved, the region-wide land architecture is the collective design of stakeholders with different land-use goals that favor tradeoffs in subsystem outcomes serving better either the reserve and related programs or the smallholder farmers that populate the region. A major tradeoff involves forest cover per se, which holds implications for forest transition theory. Evidence for an incipient transition involves the scale of analysis taken. The dynamics involved hold too much uncertainty to forecast a permanent transition to more forest cover and imply that more complex but robust versions of the theory are required.

   BEHAVIOR; SIZE
AB Habitat fragmentation and disturbance are known to impact animals and plants in different ways, depending on species' characteristics and the type and scale of habitat modification involved. In contrast, direct or indirect ramifications on mutualistic relationships between plants and animals are less clear, possibly because general patterns are confounded by the diffuse nature of many of these interactions. Here, we examine how fragment size and/or severe disturbance of a Kenyan mountain cloud forest affects the frugivore community and seed removal of a large-seeded, bird-dispersed tree of the forest interior, for three consecutive years. Forest deterioration reduced avian visitation and seed removal rates independent of fragment size, consistently so despite strong temporal variation in fruit production over the three-year study. In disturbed forest fragments, seed removal rates were on average 3.5 times lower than in more intact ones. Strong differences in both visitation and seed removal rates were largely attributable to shifts in frugivore assemblages, characterized by loss or reduced abundance of the most effective seed dispersers, most of which were forest specialists. Although some disturbed fragments benefited from visits of non-forest dependent seed dispersers, such 'resilience' was not predictable or reliable in time or space. We conclude that disruption of seed disperser-seed interactions in highly fragmented and disturbed tropical forests may be persistent in time when resiliency is inadequate, possibly posing long-term effects on tree communities.

AB Information on the timing and dynamics of tree ring formation is essential to assess the seasonal behavior of secondary wood growth and its associated environmental influences. Araucaria angustifolia is a dominant species in highland pluvial ecosystems of southeastern South America. Previous investigations indicated that their growth rings are formed annually, but no information exists about the timing of growth ring formation and the environmental triggers influencing cambium activity. In this paper we examine inter- and intra-annual cambial activity in A. angustifolia, through anatomical and dendrochronological evidence at two study sites, and model the relationships between regional climate variation and intra-annual tree ring formation. The results confirm the annual growth ring formation in A. angustifolia and indicate that its growth season extends from October to April. Day length and temperature were the main environmental factors influencing the seasonal cambium activity. Our results evidence the dendrochronological potential of A. angustifolia for ecological and climatological studies in southeastern South America.

AB Throughout the world, many native species inhabit agricultural landscapes. While natural habitats will form the cornerstone of conservation efforts in production-oriented environments, the success of these efforts will be enhanced by a greater understanding of the potential contribution of the increasingly modified countryside ('matrix') elements in these landscapes. Here, we investigate the relative occurrence of birds in some landscape elements (i.e. land-uses, vegetation types) common to agricultural environments around the world. Twenty-seven study mosaics (1 km x 1 km in size), selected to incorporate variation in the cover of native vegetation and the richness of different landscape elements, were sampled in Gippsland, south-eastern Australia. Birds were surveyed in five main types of elements: native vegetation, linear vegetation, plantation, scattered trees and pasture. The greatest number of species was recorded in native vegetation, the most important element for the majority of birds in Australian agricultural landscapes. Nevertheless, most countryside elements had value for many species; particularly structurally complex elements. Ordination analyses (based on presence/absence data for 81 species) showed that the composition of bird communities differed between elements. The number of mosaics in which 'all species' and 'woodland species' were recorded was positively related to the breadth of elements they used; thus species using a greater number of elements occurred more frequently in the study region. Correlation analyses identified that the richness of woodland species (those of increased conservation concern in Australia) in different elements was influenced by features of the mosaic in which they occurred. Notably, the richness of woodland bird species recorded in scattered trees and pasture increased with local native vegetation cover. Key implications for conservation in Australian agricultural environments include: (1) native vegetation is vital for the persistence of birds in these landscapes, and thus is the primary element on which conservation efforts in agricultural landscapes depend; (2) countryside elements can enhance the conservation value of agricultural landscapes by (a) increasing structural complexity in largely cleared areas and (b) increasing the heterogeneity of the entire landscape; and (3) patches of different elements cannot be managed in isolation from their surroundings, as landscape properties affect the richness of bird assemblages in different elements.

AB Secondary forests are becoming an increasingly important tropical landscape component with the potential to provide environmental services such as soil carbon storage. Substantial losses of soil carbon can occur with tropical forest conversion to pasture, but stocks can sometimes be restored with the development of secondary forest. Few studies have taken advantage of shifts in vegetation from C-4 to C-3 communities to determine soil carbon turnover following secondary forest development on pasture. Because trees quickly colonize abandoned pastures in northeastern Costa Rica, we expected to find evidence of increased soil carbon storage and gradual soil carbon turnover following pasture abandonment. Three early successional and nine late successional secondary sites ranging in age from 2.6 to 33 years, as well as four pastures were used in this study. At each site, mineral soil samples up to 30 cm depth were collected from three plots to determine bulk density, percent soil carbon, and stable carbon isotope values (delta C-13). The delta C-13 of soil respired CO2 was also determined at each site. Contrary to expectations, soil carbon storage did not increase with secondary forest age and was unrelated to increases in aboveground carbon storage. However, pastures stored 19% more carbon than early and late successional sites in the top 10 cm of mineral soil, and successional sites stored 14-18% more carbon than pastures between 10 and 30 cm. delta C-13 data indicated that most pasture-derived soil carbon in the top 30 cm of soil turned over within 10 years of pasture abandonment and subsequent colonization by trees. Overall, these data indicate that total soil carbon storage remains relatively unchanged following land use transitions from pasture to secondary forest. This is likely due to the presence of large passive pools of mineral-stabilized soil carbon in this region of Costa Rica. The contribution of these forests to increased carbon storage on the landscape is primarily confined to aboveground carbon stocks, though other environmental services may be derived from these forests. In the context of global carbon accounting, it appears that future carbon credits may be best applied to aboveground carbon storage in secondary forests regrowing on soils with large mineral-stabilized soil carbon pools.

AB The paradigm that tropical trees with farther seed dispersal experience lower offspring mortality is currently based on within-species studies documenting higher survival of offspring located farther from conspecific adults and/or closer to light gaps. We determined whether the paradigm also holds among species by comparing spatial patterns of offspring mortality among three sympatric Neotropical rainforest tree species with the same seed dispersers but with different dispersal abilities. First, we assessed spatially non-random mortality for each species by measuring spatial shifts of the population recruitment curve (PRC) with respect to conspecific adults and light gaps across three early life stages: dispersed seeds, young seedlings and old seedlings. Then, we determined whether PRC shifts were greater for the species with short dispersal distances than for the species with greater dispersal distances. We found that the PRC shifted away from conspecific adults consistently across life stages, but we found no consistent PRC shifts towards gaps, suggesting that mortality was related more to the proximity of conspecifics than to absence of light gaps. PRC shifts away from adults were greatest in the species with the lowest dispersal ability, supporting the paradigm. Differential PRC shifts caused the spatial distribution of offspring to become almost independent with respect to adult trees and gaps in all three species, despite large differences in seed dispersal distance among these species. Our results provide direct empirical support for the paradigm that among tropical trees, species with farther seed dispersal are less impacted by spatially non-random mortality than are similar species with shorter dispersal distances. Thus, greater dispersal effectiveness merits extra investments of trees in seed dispersal ability, even at the cost of fecundity.

AB Fruiting trees in degraded areas are attractive for frugivorous birds and may become centers of regeneration. However, a number of tree species in degraded areas are exotic species. Thus, the question arises whether these exotic species can also act as foci for forest regeneration. In the farmland adjacent to Kakamega Forest, Kenya, we investigated the frugivore assemblage in, and seed rain and seedling establishment under, 29 fruiting exotic guava trees (Psidium guajava) at different distances to the forest. The results show that 40 frugivorous bird species visited guava trees. All of the seed and 82 percent of the seedling species found under the treecrowns were animal dispersed, 58 and 57 percent of them late-successional species, respectively. Path analysis revealed that the abundance of frugivorous birds, seeds, and seedlings did not decrease up to a distance of 2 km from the forest. Surprisingly, the abundance of frugivorous shrubland birds, animal-dispersed seeds, and late-successional seeds showed an increase with increasing distance from forest. Even though they are exotics, fruiting guava trees may have a positive effect on forest regeneration and might prove valuable for management plans concerning forest restoration.

AB The distribution and spatial pattern of plants in tropical forests have important implications for how species interact with each other and their environments. In this article we use a large-scale permanent census plot to address if the coexistence of 16 co-occurring species of Myristicaceae is aided by topographic and light gradient niche partitioning. We used a second order spatial pattern analysis based on Ripley's K function to describe species' distributions and associations among species, and a torus translation procedure to test for associations with three topographically defined habitats. A majority of species displayed spatial aggregation and over half had one or more significant habitat associations. Four species were associated with the ridge habitat, four species with slope habitat, and two with valley habitat. Seven other species showed no habitat association. Within each habitat group, species exhibited a variety of distributions in relation to light availability. However, habitat associations were largely unexplained by differential rates of mortality, growth or recruitment over a 5-year interval. We conclude that although in principle partitioning of the topographic and light environments may double or treble the number of species able to coexist, there is no evidence that partitioning of physical habitats can explain the coexistence of all 16 of these closely related species.

AB In this paper, we tested four hypotheses relative to edge and shape effects on ant communities: (i) forest edges have lower species richness than the remnant core; (ii) species richness increases with distance from the edge; (iii) irregularly shaped remnants have lower species richness than more regular remnants; (iv) there is a higher similarity of species composition between edge and core in irregular than in regular remnants. We sampled litter ant communities on the edge and core of ten remnants, in Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Species richness was larger at the forest core than at the edges, although did not increase with distance from the edge. Species richness did not vary with shape complexity. The similarity of species composition between edge and core showed a decreasing trend with remnant area, and did not vary with shape complexity. The observed differences of species richness between forest core and edge may be due to higher harshness of edges, caused by environmental changes. The absence of relationship between species richness and distance from the edge might indicate the range of edge effects, which would be smaller than the smallest distance of core sampled. Therefore, edges would affect litter-dwelling ant species richness in a distance smaller than 50 m. The observation of species composition allowed us to notice an effect of fragmentation that would not be noticed if we were considering only species richness. Edge may serve as step to generalist species, which may use it to colonise forest remnants. Furthermore, small remnants are more colonisation-prone by such species, and have a more homogeneous species composition than large remnants.

AB There is increasing interest among ecologists about how the type of matrix surrounding a habitat patch influences the organisms living in that patch. This question is virtually unstudied in marine systems. In this paper I show that the mobile faunal assemblage in seagrass patches does depend on the surrounding matrix. Faunal assemblages in patches of Posidonia surrounded by sand are different than in those surrounded by Heterozostera, another seagrass, having more than double the abundance of both amphipods and polychaetes. However, the differences are not simply due to spillover from the matrix habitat, but rather are an emergent property of the patch context that cannot be predicted. Posidonia surrounded by sand actually has an assemblage that is intermediate between Heterozostera and Posidonia surrounded by Heterozostera. Differences in habitat structure do not account for this pattern, as seagrass biomass did not vary, and the same result was found in artificial seagrass. The faunal assemblage did not vary depending on the location within the patch (edge or centre) for Heterozostera, Posidonia or artificial seagrass. Patch size, however, did have an effect for Heterozostera, with smaller patches having 2-3 times as many isopods per sample as large, but less than half the number of some amphipod families. These results suggest that the landscape context is as important in marine systems as it is known to be in terrestrial systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   MECHANISMS
AB Studies in Southern Hemisphere temperate forests,have yielded a general model of how the successional status of shade-intolerant Nothofagus is related to site conditions and disturbance. According to model predictions, regeneration of most Nothofagus species is dependent on coarse-scale disturbance at favorable sites where shade-tolerant rain forest species co-occur. In contrast, at suboptimal sites where tree species richness is low, regeneration is not dependent on coarse-scale disturbance. We used variation in forest composition and structure as well as disturbance patterns in the forests of Puyehue National Park, Chile, to test several predictions from this general model. The study area presents a complex mosaic of disturbance patterns, including the effects of the strong 1960 earthquake as well as fire and wind disturbance. We reconstructed stand development on sites affected by these disturbances, and compared these patterns with the structure of old-growth forests along an elevation gradient from species-rich montane rain forest to monotypic subalpine Nothofagus forests.
   Tree age data indicate that both the Nothofagus and many of the rain forest tree species are long-lived, often reaching ages greater than 600 years. Regeneration of Nothofagus was abundant in stands recently disturbed by landslides, fire, or blowdown across the entire elevation gradient, and Nothofagus also regenerated in old-growth high-elevation forests. In contrast, regeneration of Nothofagus was scarce or absent in undisturbed stands and at lower elevation. In comparison with the rain forest species, Nothofagus species are more tolerant of the unfavorable site conditions associated with increasing elevation. Thus, there is a gradient of decreasing interspecific tree competition with increasing elevation, so that the dependence of regeneration of Nothofagus on coarse-scale disturbance is much less at higher elevation. This study confirms that changes in forest composition may be explained by simple processes occurring in accordance with the main predictions of the general model of Nothofagus forest dynamics: At low elevations, coarse-scale disturbance is required for Nothofagus regeneration; at higher elevations under decreasing competition the regeneration of Nothofagus is less dependent on coarse-scale disturbance. Thus, for the Puyehue landscape, patterns of forest structure and disturbance history are congruent with the major features of the general model of Nothofagus dynamics.

AB Aim To explore rates of rain forest expansion and associated ecological correlates in Eucalyptus-dominated woodland savanna vegetation in north-eastern Australia, over the period 1943-91.
   Location Iron Range National Park and environs, north-east Queensland, Australia. This remote region supports probably the largest extent of lowland (< 300 m) rain forest extant in Australia. Rainfall (c. 1700 mm p.a.) occurs mostly between November and June, with some rain typically occurring even in the driest months July-October.
   Methods Interpretation of change in lowland rain forest vegetation cover was undertaken for a 140 km(2) area comprising complex vegetation, geology and physiography using available air photos (1943, 1970 and 1991). A GIS database was assembled comprising rain forest extent for the three time periods, geology, elevation, slope, aspect, proximity to streams and roads. Using standard GIS procedures, a sample of 6996 10 x 10 m cells (0.5% of study area) was selected randomly and attributed for vegetation structure (rain forest and non-rain forest), and landscape features. Associations of rain forest expansion with landscape features were examined with logistic regression using the subset of cells that had changed from other vegetation types to rain forest, and remained rain forest over the assessment period, and comparing them with cells that showed no change from their original, non-rain forest condition.
   Results Rain forest in the air photo study area increased from 45 km(2) in 1943 to 78.1 km(2) by 1970, and to 82.6 km(2) by 1991. Rainfall (and atmospheric CO2 concentration) was markedly lower in the first assessment period (1943-70). Modelled rates of rain forest invasion differed predominantly with respect to substrate type, occurring faster on substrates possessing better moisture retention properties, and across all elevation classes. Greatest expansion, at least in the first assessment period, occurred on the most inherently infertile substrates. Expansion was little constrained by slope, aspect and proximity to streams and roads. On schist substrates, probability of invasion remained high (> 60%) over distances up to 1500 m from mature rain forest margins; on less favourable substrates (diorite, granites), probability of expansion was negligible at sites more than 400 m from mature margins.
   Main conclusions (i) Rain forest expansion was associated primarily with release from burning pressure from c. the 1920s, following major disruption of customary Aboriginal lifestyles including hunting and burning practices. (ii) Decadal-scale expansion of rain forest at Iron Range supports extensive observations from the palaeoecological literature concerning rapid rain forest invasion under conducive environmental conditions. (iii) The generality of these substrate-mediated observations requires further testing, especially given that landscape-scale rain forest invasion of sclerophyll-dominated communities is reported from other regions of north-eastern Australia.

AB We used a carbon-based food web model to investigate the effects of oyster cultivation on the ecosystem of an intertidal mudflat. A previously published food web model of a mudflat in Marennes-Oleron Bay, France, was updated with revised parameters, and a realistic surface area and density of existing oyster cultures on the mudflat. We developed 2 hypothetical scenarios to estimate the impact of oyster cultivation on the food web structure of the ecosystem: one with no oysters, the other with a doubled area devoted to cultivated oysters in the bay. Oysters are direct trophic competitors of other filter feeders, and their presence modifies benthic-pelagic coupling by forcing a shift from pelagic consumers to benthic consumers. Increasing the surface area of cultivated oysters caused secondary production to increase, providing food for top predators (in particular juvenile nekton), reinforcing the nursery role of the mudflat in the ecosystem, and altering the species composition available to the top predators.

AB A century of annual burning of the understory of otherwise fire-free deciduous tropical forest in central India has favored seven tree species that produce sprouts or suckers from root buds (root-sprouters) over 37 species that produce sprouts basally from root crowns (root-crown resprouters). Experiments over two years demonstrated that low-intensity ground fires killed seedlings (<1 year old), resulting in a 30% decrease in seedling diversity in burned relative to unburned plots. Overall fire-related mortality of seedlings was 74% for 17 root-crown resprouters, compared, to 63% for six root-sprouters. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed that the number of juvenile (>1 year old) stems of root-sprouters increased in burned study plots but decreased in plots protected from fire. Annual burning by people favors species that repair damage by root sprouts. Root-sprouting offers a means of occupying new ground with clonal ramets away from the original parental base. Over time, forests may become dominated by clonal root-sprouters, in contrast to historical accounts of forest dominated by root-crown resprouters that do not spread by clonal growth. If this process continues in the Mendha Forest in India, >80% of its tree diversity could be lost within 100-200 years.

AB In bird migration systems, the question of coexistence and competition of migrants with residents in the nonbreeding season and their role in shaping the evolution of present avian communities is much debated. However, conclusions are often drawn in a speculative way. In the Palearctic-African bird migration system, many studies have addressed the question of coexistence of Palearctic breeding birds with Afrotropical species in the former's wintering grounds. These studies have led to some generalizations concerning habitat selection and foraging ecology about the traits that might enable migrants to coexist with residents. Migrants were therefore assumed to forage in more open habitats, in more peripheral parts of the vegetation and with a higher foraging speed than residents. Furthermore, they were also assumed to be more flexible in foraging behavior by using a wider range of foraging tactics, but some studies revealed contradicting results. We studied the ecology of Palearctic migrants in Comoe National Park, Ivory Coast, West Africa, during three successive winters to explore the factors of niche partitioning between migrants and residents and to test the hypothesis of whether there are common behavioral traits in migrants. Therefore, we compared the ecology of two Palearctic breeding species: pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, and willow warbler, Phylloscopus trochilus, with resident members of the respective guilds. With respect to use of microhabitat, foraging speed, and intake rates, we could not confirm the above-mentioned generalizations, showing that care has to be taken into account when drawing conclusions from few studies for a whole migration system on a huge continent. However, both migrating species were more flexible in foraging behavior than were their Afrotropical counterparts. As there are hints that this is also the case when migrants are compared with residents on their breeding grounds, we suggest that this flexibility enables migrants to partition resources with residents and, therefore, coexist with Afrotropical species. We discuss, however, whether this flexibility is an adaptation to migratory behavior or a prerequisite for the evolution of migration. The role that competition plays in present communities cannot be solved with a few observational studies because of the following problems. First, it is difficult to detect competition in the field. Second, there are constraints of performing field experiments that have not previously been performed in Africa, and third, there are several possible hypothetical scenarios about the role of competition in shaping present communities, including factors that might have been important in the past and are therefore impossible to detect at present.

AB Seed dispersal ecology of Bactris acanthocarpa Mart. (Arecaceae), an Atlantic forest understory palm, was investigated during two years as an attempt to test the following predictions: (i) seeds of Bactris are dispersed by mammals and large-gaped birds; (ii) Bactris benefits from seed dispersal in terms of seed predation avoidance, improvement of seed germination and seedling survival; and (iii) spatial distribution of adults is related to patterns of seed dispersal. The study was conducted at Dois Irmaos Reserve, a 387.4-ha reserve of Atlantic forest in northeastern Brazil (8 degrees S-35 degrees W). Black-rumped agoutis (Dasyprocta prymnolopha) and Guianan squirrels (Sciurus aestuans) were identified as the seed dispersers/predators, moving seeds short distances (< 4 m from parents) and at low rates (0.04-0.05 diaspore/palm/day). Pyrene burial prevented seed predation by vertebrates and reduced by half seed infestation by Scolytidae beetles. Only buried pyrenes germinated. Pyrene predation was not correlated with distance from conspecific adults. In contrast, early seedling mortality was higher near conspecific adults. Most adults (64%) had their nearest conspecific adult neighbour > 4 m away in contrast to 96% of seedlings that occurred concentrated within 4 m from adults (77% under the palm crowns). Here, we present evidence that spatial distribution of B. acanthocarpa is partly due to low rates of seed removal, short-distance seed dispersal by agoutis and squirrels, and early seedling mortality associated with presence of seedlings under palm crowns.

AB Biogeographical explanations for the extant and paleo disjoint geographical distribution in the southern hemisphere of five species of nearshore marine benthic invertebrates: Gaimardia trapesina, Ostrea chilensis, Pyura stolonifera taxonomic complex, Aulacomya ater and Concholepas concholepas, showing distinctive reproductive strategies and early life history characteristics are reviewed and analyzed. Through the use of published and new information we contrasted the following hypotheses: a) vicariance-historical process, b) epiplanktonic larval dispersal, c) juvenile/adult dispersal through rafting and d) planned or accidental anthropogenic dispersal mechanisms. The juvenile/adult transoceanic dispersal hypothesis by rafting was the only one impossible to be rejected for the species analyzed. The implication and future direction for research in this area are discussed.

AB Following the 1995 mast year, we conducted detailed seedling demography surveys to characterize some ecological factors affecting germination and early establishment in understory balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) seedling banks and verify if recruitment from a cohort can potentially renew the balsam fir seedling bank. Twenty-five seed traps paired with 32 demography subplots were located in each of four permanent plots and regularly monitored over a 2-year period. Spatial patterns of newly emerged seedlings generally corresponded to those found for seed dispersal. However, at the end of the monitoring period, the spatial pattern of surviving seedlings was independent of the seed dispersal pattern. Seedbed types and understory light environments were the main factors explaining seedling mortality. Sphagnum mosses and decaying wood were the most favorable seedbeds for early establishment. The 0- to 25-cm seedling populations grew in size because of the addition of new recruits. If, in the years to come, mortality rates of the 1995 cohorts were similar to those of already established 0- to 25-cm seedlings, mast years of seed production, at least during endemic periods, would be crucial for recruitment and renewal of balsam fir seedling banks.

AB We studied the time and energy allocations related to territorial behavior in male Blue-throated Hummingbirds (Lampornis clemenciae; about 8.3 g) under conditions of unlimited and restricted food availability. When food was unlimited, territorial males avoided inter-specific aggression, chasing only 11% of the inter-specific intruders (Black-chinned Hummingbirds, Archilochus alexandri; about 3.5 g). Thus, when food was unlimited, inter-specific intruders were able to forage efficiently, meeting their estimated daily energy requirement with ease (27 kJ/day). Conversely, 81% of intra-specific intruders were chased, and intra-specific intruders were able to feed at territorial feeders only when the territorial male was away. Chases of intra-specific intruders were longer and appeared to be more intense than chases of inter-specific intruders. When food was restricted territorial activity, including the total number of chases engaged in by the territory owner, was significantly reduced, although the basic characteristics of territorial behavior (e.g., chases and displays) did not change. Territory owners chased a higher proportion of inter-specific intruders when food was restricted (48%), suggesting an increase in inter-specific competition. A high proportion of intra-specific competitors continued to be chased (80%), although the total number of intra-specific intruders was lower. We believe that variations in the cost of territoriality are dependent primarily on the level of intra-specific competition. This is supported by the fact that when food was restricted to an amount that could support a maximum of 1.4 L. clemenciae (based on doubly labeled water measurements of field metabolic rate in a previous study), energy intake by the territory owner decreased from 114 kJ/day to 64 kJ/day, with the primary difference being number of intra-specific chases. These data also suggest that the exclusion of other hummingbird species might be based strictly on the amount of available food (energy). When food is restricted, inter-specific competition is more costly to the territory owner causing the exclusion of a higher proportion of inter-specific intruders. The high proportion of intra-specific intruders that are chased in either experimental condition suggests that territorial behavior in L. clemenciae might have functions other than resource protection per se, such as social functions related to their mating system.

We briefly outline the environmental history of the Quaternary, discuss the spatial and temporal resolution of the paleoecological evidence for biotic change, and summarize data relevant to such current issues as the nature of the biotic community, the role of disturbance, stability versus rapid change, evolutionary theory, explanations of species diversity, and refugia theory. Finally, we offer examples of the utility of paleoecological techniques for ecologists and environmental scientists.

AB 1. Epimicrobial communities on seaweed surfaces usually contain not only potentially pathogenic but also potentially beneficial micro-organisms. Capacity of terrestrial plants for chemically mediated recruitment, that is, "gardening" of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere was recently demonstrated. Empirical evidence directly linking such chemical "gardening" with the beneficial role of gardened microbes in terrestrial plants is rare and largely missing for aquatic macrophytes.
   2. Here, we demonstrate that our model invasive seaweed holobiont Agarophyton vermiculophyllum possesses beneficial microbiota on its surface that provide protection from bacterial pathogens. Metabolites from the algal holobiont's surface reduced settlement of opportunistic pathogens but attracted protective epibacterial settlement.
   3. We tested 58 different bacterial species (isolated from the surface of A. vermiculophyllum) individually in tip bleaching assays. Kordia algicida was identified as a "significant pathogen" inducing a bleaching disease. In addition, nine other species significantly reduced the risk of algal bleaching and were thus "significantly protective". Additionally, two "potential pathogens" and 10 "potential protectors" were identified. When 19 significant and potential protectors and 3 significant and potential pathogens were tested together, the protective strains fully prevented bleaching, suggesting that a component of A. vermiculophyllum's epimicrobiome provides an associational defence against pathogens. Chemically mediated selective recruitment of microbes was demonstrated in bioassays, where A. vermiculophyllum surface metabolites attracted the settlement of protective strains, but reduced settlement of pathogens.
   4. Synthesis. The capacity of an aquatic macrophyte to chemically "garden" protective micro-organisms to the benefit of strengthened disease resistance is demonstrated for the first time. Such a role of surface chemistry in "gardening" of microbes as found in the current study could also be applicable to other host plant-microbe interactions. Our results may open new avenues towards manipulation of the surface microbiome of seaweeds via chemical "gardening," enhancing sustainable production of healthy seaweeds.

We use time-series satellite images to quantify annual forest area, loss and gain in the Brazilian Amazon during 2000-2017. We find that forest area was -15% higher than the estimate by the official Brazilian forest dataset (PRODES), but annual forest-loss rates were twice the PRODES estimates (-0.027 x 10(6) km(2) yr(-1) during 2001-2016). Forest-loss rates increased again after 2013. The El Nino and drought year (2015/2016) drove large forest area loss. The cumulative forest-loss area within the protected areas (which include -50% of forests in the region) was -11% of the total forest-loss area, which highlights the roles of protected areas in forest conservation.

AB Tropical forests have been a permanent feature of the Amazon basin for at least 55 million years, yet climate change and land use threaten the forest's future over the next century. Understory forest fires, which are common under the current climate in frontier forests, may accelerate Amazon forest losses from climate-driven dieback and deforestation. Far from land use frontiers, scarce fire ignitions and high moisture levels preclude significant burning, yet projected climate and land use changes may increase fire activity in these remote regions. Here, we used a fire model specifically parameterized for Amazon understory fires to examine the interactions between anthropogenic activities and climate under current and projected conditions. In a scenario of low mitigation efforts with substantial land use expansion and climate change - Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 - projected understory fires increase in frequency and duration, burning 4-28 times more forest in 2080-2100 than during 1990-2010. In contrast, active climate mitigation and land use contraction in RCP4.5 constrain the projected increase in fire activity to 0.9-5.4 times contemporary burned area. Importantly, if climate mitigation is not successful, land use contraction alone is very effective under low to moderate climate change, but does little to reduce fire activity under the most severe climate projections. These results underscore the potential for a fire-driven transformation of Amazon forests if recent regional policies for forest conservation are not paired with global efforts to mitigate climate change.

AB The relationships between biodiversity and aboveground biomass in forest ecosystems have been intensively studied in recent decades. Still, the mechanisms that underlie it remain highly debated. We hypothesized that overstorey species diversity and individual tree size variation contribute to aboveground biomass and understorey species diversity through the niche complementarity effect, while weaken the relationship between understorey aboveground biomass and individual tree size variation due to the mixed effects of tree development, biotic interaction and reduced available resources by over storey strata. The integrative relationships of species diversity and tree size variation (variation in diameter at breast height-DBH) with aboveground biomass were analysed at overstorey and understorey strata across 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest in Eastern China. For comparison, we tested these relationships at individual strata (isolation modelling), and whole-community level, by using linear structural equation model while accounting for the effects of soil nutrients. The integrative modelling accounted for 35, 31, 16, 12, 4, and 0% of the variation in understorey aboveground biomass, overstorey aboveground biomass, overstorey DBH variation, overstorey species diversity, understorey species diversity, and understorey DBH variation, respectively. Overstorey DBH variation and species diversity had the positive direct effects on overstorey aboveground biomass. Overstorey species diversity significantly promoted the understorey species diversity, but DBH variation and aboveground biomass of overstorey strata had negligible effects on the diversity and aboveground biomass of understorey strata. Soil nutrients had positive direct effect on overstorey DBH variation, but negative direct effects on overstorey and understorey aboveground biomass and overstorey species diversity. These results provide strong evidence for the niche complementarity effect for driving positive relationships of species diversity and individual tree size variation with aboveground biomass at overstorey strata. The strong and consistent negative effects of soil nutrients on overstorey aboveground biomass and species diversity suggest an important mechanism that high species diversity of overstorey strata with great tree size variation on nutrient-poor soils is crucial for driving high aboveground biomass in subtropical forest ecosystems. In conclusion, this study suggests that no sole and ubiquitous relationship between biodiversity and aboveground biomass exists in a structurally complex forest, but rather that the magnitude and direction of this relationship is greatly dependent on the forest strata where available resources shift substantially. We argue that ecological models for predicting aboveground biomass would be improved by including separate effects of overstorey and understorey diversity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Consistent long-term estimates of fire emissions are important to understand the changing role of fire in the global carbon cycle and to assess the relative importance of humans and climate in shaping fire regimes. However, there is limited information on fire emissions from before the satellite era. We show that in the Amazon region, including the Arc of Deforestation and Bolivia, visibility observations derived from weather stations could explain 61% of the variability in satellite-based estimates of bottom-up fire emissions since 1997 and 42% of the variability in satellite-based estimates of total column carbon monoxide concentrations since 2001. This enabled us to reconstruct the fire history of this region since 1973 when visibility information became available. Our estimates indicate that until 1987 relatively few fires occurred in this region and that fire emissions increased rapidly over the 1990s. We found that this pattern agreed reasonably well with forest loss data sets, indicating that although natural fires may occur here, deforestation and degradation were the main cause of fires. Compared to fire emissions estimates based on Food and Agricultural Organization's Global Forest and Resources Assessment data, our estimates were substantially lower up to the 1990s, after which they were more in line. These visibility-based fire emissions data set can help constrain dynamic global vegetation models and atmospheric models with a better representation of the complex fire regime in this region.

AB Large dams cause extensive inundation of habitats, with remaining terrestrial habitat confined to highly fragmented archipelagos of land-bridge islands comprised of former hilltops. Isolation of biological communities on reservoir islands induces local extinctions and degradation of remnant communities. "Good practice" dam development guidelines propose using reservoir islands for species, conservation, mitigating some of the detrimental impacts associated with flooding terrestrial habitats. The degree of species retention on islands in the long-term, and hence, whether they are effective for conservation is currently unknown. Here, we quantitatively review species' responses to isolation on reservoir islands. We specifically investigate island species richness in comparison with neighbouring continuous habitat, and relationships between island species richness and island area, isolation time, and distance to mainland and to other islands. Species' responses to isolation on reservoir islands have been investigated in only 15 of the >58,000 large-dam reservoirs (dam height >15m) operating globally. Research predominantly originates from wet tropical forest habitats and focuses on mammals, with species richness being the most widely-reported ecological metric. Terrestrial taxa are, overall, negatively impacted by isolation on reservoir islands. Reservoir island species richness declines with isolation time, and although the rate of loss is slower on larger islands, all islands exhibit depauperate species richness <100 years after isolation, compared to continuous mainland habitats. Such a pattern of sustained and delayed species loss following largescale habitat disturbance is indicative of an extinction debt existing for reservoir island species: this pattern is evident across all taxonomic groups and dams studied. Thus, reservoir islands cannot reliably be used for species conservation as part of impact mitigation measures, and should instead be included in area calculations for land impacted by dam creation. Environmental licensing assessments as a precondition for future dam development should explicitly consider the long-term fate of island communities when assessing biodiversity loss vs energy output.

AB This paper addresses the differential impacts on decisions towards collective action in the context of payments for ecosystem services (PES) where individual and collective rewards are conditional on a minimum collective conservation level being achieved. Interactions between the different reward types, farmers' social preferences, social ties and communication are identified. A field game experiment is conducted with Andean farmers in Peru and framed around their decisions to conserve agrobiodiversity as an impure public good. The main results are that PBS schemes could be effective in motivating collective action for agrobiodiversity conservation and that individual rewards are likely to be more effective and less sensitive to social factors than collective rewards. The latter might have a positive effect on conservation when they are shared within socially closely-related groups or in situations where communication and deliberation about collective action are possible.

AB Land development contributes to the clearance of large trees that are sometimes offset with many smaller trees as compensatory wildlife habitat. But are many smaller trees a valid biodiversity offset for the loss of a single large tree? To answer this question, we tested predictions underpinned by island biogeography theory. Targeting birds, we investigated size and landscape context effects at 72 trees of three sizes (small, medium, and large) located in four landscape contexts (reserves, pasture, urban parklands, and urban built-up areas). Significant positive relationships occurred between tree basal area and bird abundance and species richness in all landscape contexts. SLOSS (single large or several small) analysis revealed that in modified landscapes, several small and medium trees supported an equivalent number of individuals and species as a single large tree, but the same pattern was weaker in reserves. Extrapolated rarefaction curves revealed that in reserves and urban built-up areas, many small or medium trees accumulated the same number or more species than large trees. However, in pasture and urban parklands, many small or medium trees accumulated fewer species than large trees. Overall, 29% of bird species were recorded only at large trees, highlighting that many smaller trees will not be suitable habitat compensation for all species. Complementary approaches to biodiversity offsets are needed, balancing large tree preservation and revegetation. Response patterns for birds at trees conformed to some biogeographic predictions (species-area relationship), but not others (habitat-isolation relationship), underscoring the need for novel conceptual frameworks for habitat structures in modified landscapes.

AB Aim Resource bottlenecks - periods of severe restriction in resource availability - triggered by increased climate variability represent important and little-understood mechanisms through which climate change will affect biodiversity. In this review, we aim to synthesize the key global change processes that exacerbate the severity of bottlenecks in resource availability on animal populations, and outline how adaptation responses can help buffer the impacts.
   Location Global.
   Methods We collate examples from the literature of population-level impacts of resource bottlenecks induced by extreme weather and climate events to explore the types of population impacts that have most frequently been recorded, and the type of extreme events associated with them. We then develop a conceptual framework that captures the factors contributing to species' vulnerability to climate-induced spatial and temporal resource bottlenecks in increasingly variable environments.
   Results Increases in the frequency, severity and/or duration of extreme weather and climate events can trigger resource bottlenecks that act as powerful demographic constraints on terrestrial fauna, and often exacerbate other human-induced pressures such as land use change. Such phenomena are likely to become more frequent and severe, with potentially nonlinear increases in impact. Forty-nine instances of population-level impacts from climate-induced resource bottlenecks were recorded from the literature, including four extinctions and ten population crashes. Anthropogenic land use change interacts with increasing climatic variability to exacerbate these resource 'crunches', but can sometimes act as a buffer for species.
   Main Conclusions Resource bottlenecks are likely to be a large class of climate-sensitive stressors whose impacts may play out at the population scale, even well within a species' apparent climatic envelope. More effective conservation responses to climate-related threats include explicit actions, such as managing protected area networks for spatial and temporal resource complementarities, that buffer vulnerable species against bottlenecks.

AB Understanding linkages between human well-being and ecological stewardship at the land-water nexus is needed in order to develop effective, equitable, and resilient institutions to govern watershed resources. In this paper, we argue that payments for ecosystem services (PES) plays a useful role for achieving integrated and adaptive water resource management, but only if attention is drawn to: (a) nested governance arrangements which reflect horizontal coordination across space according to the economic characteristics of watershed goods and services as well as hierarchical legitimacy between higher and lower levels of governance; (b) 'payments' that are socially negotiated rather than designed according to oversimplified efficiency claims for watershed services and (c) 'payments' that are well placed to overcome the individual, social and physical constraints associated with watershed goods and services so that capabilities or the freedom to do and be can be enhanced. This paper illustrates the impossibility of effectuating sheer market-based trades for regulating, cultural and supporting ecosystem services due to their inherent non-rival characteristics. Furthermore, a heuristic approach to characterising watershed goods and services clearly demarcates the extent to which PES can serve as an implementation tool for integrated and adaptive water resources management.

AB The potential influence of diversity on ecosystem structure and function remains a topic of significant debate, especially for tropical forests where diversity can range widely. We used Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) methodology to establish forest dynamics plots in montane wet forest and lowland dry forest on Hawai'i Island. We compared the species diversity, tree density, basal area, biomass, and size class distributions between the two forest types. We then examined these variables across tropical forests within the CTFS network. Consistent with other island forests, the Hawai'i forests were characterized by low species richness and very high relative dominance. The two Hawai'i forests were floristically distinct, yet similar in species richness (15 vs. 21 species) and stem density (3078 vs. 3486/ha). While these forests were selected for their low invasive species cover relative to surrounding forests, both forests averaged 5->50% invasive species cover; ongoing removal will be necessary to reduce or prevent competitive impacts, especially from woody species. The montane wet forest had much larger trees, resulting in eightfold higher basal area and above-ground biomass. Across the CTFS network, the Hawaiian montane wet forest was similar to other tropical forests with respect to diameter distributions, density, and aboveground biomass, while the Hawai` i lowland dry forest was similar in density to tropical forests with much higher diversity. These findings suggest that forest structural variables can be similar across tropical forests independently of species richness. The inclusion of low-diversity Pacific Island forests in the CTFS network provides an similar to 80-fold range in species richness (15-1182 species), six-fold variation in mean annual rainfall (835-5272 mm yr(-1)) and 1.8-fold variation in mean annual temperature (16.0-28.4 degrees C). Thus, the Hawaiian forest plots expand the global forest plot network to enable testing of ecological theory for links among species diversity, environmental variation and ecosystem function.

AB Climate models predict a range of changes in tropical forest regions, including increased average temperatures, decreased total precipitation, reduced soil moisture and alterations in seasonal climate variations. These changes are directly related to the increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, primarily CO2. Assessing seasonal forest growth responses to climate is of utmost importance because woody tissues, produced by photosynthesis from atmospheric CO2, water and light, constitute the main component of carbon sequestration in the forest ecosystem. In this paper, we combine intra-annual tree growth measurements from published tree growth data and the corresponding monthly climate data for 25 pan-tropical forest sites. This meta-analysis is designed to find the shared climate drivers of tree growth and their relative importance across pan-tropical forests in order to improve carbon uptake models in a global change context. Tree growth reveals significant intra-annual seasonality at seasonally dry sites or in wet tropical forests. Of the overall variation in tree growth, 28.7% was explained by the site effect, i.e. the tree growth average per site. The best predictive model included four climate variables: precipitation, solar radiation (estimated with extrasolar radiation reaching the atmosphere), temperature amplitude and relative soil water content. This model explained more than 50% of the tree growth variations across tropical forests. Precipitation and solar radiation are the main seasonal drivers of tree growth, causing 19.8% and 16.3% of the tree growth variations. Both have a significant positive association with tree growth. These findings suggest that forest productivity due to tropical tree growth will be reduced in the future if climate extremes, such as droughts, become more frequent.

AB Species traits may provide a sort-cut to predicting generalities in species turnover in response to environmental change, particularly for poorly known taxa. We ask if morphological traits of assemblages respond predictably to macrohabitats across a large scale. Ant assemblages were collected at nine paired pasture and remnantsites from within three areas along a 300 km distance. We measured ten functional morphological traits for replicate individuals of each species. We used a fourth corner model to test associations between microhabitat variables, macrohabitats (pastures and remnants) and traits. In addition, we tested the phylogenetic independence of traits, to determine if responses were likely to be due to filtering by morphology or pylogeny Nine of ten traits were predicted by macrohabitat and the majority of these traits.' were independent of phylogeny. Surprisingly, microhabitat variables were not associated with morphological traits. Traits which were associated with macrohabitats were involved in locomotion, feeding behaviour and sensory ability. Ants in remnants had more maxillary palp segments, longer scapes and wider eyes, while having shorter femurs smaller apical mandibular teeth and shorter Webers lengths. A clear relationship between traits and rnacrohabitats across a large scale suggests that species are filtered by coarse environmental differences. In contrast to the findings of previous studies, fine-scale filtering of morphological traits was not apparent. if such generalities in morphological trait responses to habitat hold across even larger scales, traits may prove critical in predicting the response of species assemblages to global change.

AB Background: There is much interest in how the Amazon rainforest may respond to future rainfall reduction. However, there are relatively few ecosystem-scale studies to inform this debate.
   Aims: We described the carbon cycle in a 1 ha rainforest plot subjected to 8-10 consecutive years of ca. 50% through-fall reduction (TFR) and compare these results with those from a nearby, unmodified control plot in eastern Amazonia.
   Methods: We quantified the components of net primary productivity (NPP), autotrophic (R-a) and heterotrophic respiration, and estimate gross primary productivity (GPP, the sum of NPP and R-a) and carbon-use efficiency (CUE, the ratio of NPP/GPP).
   Results: The TFR forest exhibited slightly lower NPP but slightly higher R-a, such that forest CUE was 0.29 +/- 0.04 on the control plot but 0.25 +/- 0.03 on the TFR plot. Compared with four years earlier, TFR plot leaf area index and small tree growth recovered and soil heterotrophic respiration had risen.
   Conclusions: This analysis tested and extended the key findings of a similar analysis 4 years earlier in the TFR treatment. The results indicated that, while the forest recovered from extended drought in some respects, it maintained higher overall R-a relative to the undroughted control, potentially causing the droughted forest to act as a net source of CO2.

AB This paper provides insights into the multiple dimensions of fairness in payments for ecosystem services (PES) using the results of pilot agrobiodiversity conservation auctions. In two sites in the Bolivian and Peruvian Andes farming groups bid for payments for the conservation of traditional crop varieties. We assess different payment rules relating to how to allocate payments among groups subject to a fixed conservation budget. The discriminatory, uniform and conditional payment rules tested in these case studies incorporate alternative principles of fairness, while resulting in varying conservation and distributional outcomes. The latter are measured in terms of the distributional equality of payments among farmers and groups, and the distributional effects of payments on different types of groups. Findings indicate that conservation and distributional outcomes are highly sensitive to the payment rule chosen and vary across study sites. There may be contexts where cost-effectiveness does not need to be traded-off against fairness. Yet given the number of competing fairness considerations, achieving PES outcomes that are perceived as fair is very challenging. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Across the Neotropics, small-bodied terrestrial insectivores are sensitive to forest fragmentation and are largely absent from second-growth forests. Despite their sensitivity to forest structure, the microhabitat relationships of these birds have not been quantified. From July 1994 to January 1995 in central Amazonia, we characterized habitat at sites where nine species of terrestrial insectivores were observed foraging, as well as at randomly selected sites in continuous forest and two types of 1015-yr-old second-growth forest common in Amazonia (Vismia- and Cecropia-dominated). We used factor analysis to find suites of correlated variables. From each factor, we selected a representative variable that was relatively easy to measure. We used Bayesian analysis to estimate means and standard deviations of these variables for each species and for each type of habitat. All nine focal species were associated with ranges of microhabitat variables, such as leaf litter depth and tree densities, often absent in second-growth forests. At least in the early stages of regeneration, neither type of second-growth forest provides suitable structure for the terrestrial insectivores in our study. The large leaves of Cecropia trees that make up the thick leaf litter may preclude the use of Cecropia-dominated second growth by our focal species, many of which manipulate leaves when foraging. The leaf litter in Vismia-dominated second growth was also thicker than sites used for foraging by our focal species. In addition, Vismia-dominated growth had more small trees and small nonwoody vegetation, perhaps impeding movement by terrestrial birds. In continuous forest, our focal species foraged in microhabitats with characteristics that generally overlapped those of randomly selected sites. Thus, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that microhabitat differences make second-growth forests unsuitable for our focal species. RESUMEN A lo largo del Neotropico, aves insectivoras terrestres de tamano corporal pequeno son sensibles a la fragmentacion del bosques y en gran parte estan ausentes en los bosques de crecimiento secundario. A pesar de su sensibilidad a la estructura del bosque, las relaciones de estas aves con el micro habitat no han sido cuantificadas. Desde julio de 1994 hasta enero de 1995 en la Amazonia central caracterizamos habitats en lugares en donde nueve especies de aves insectivoros terrestres fueron observadas buscado alimento, al igual que en lugares seleccionados aleatoriamente en un bosque continuo y en dos tipos de bosques secundarios de 10 y 15 anos, comunes en la Amazonia (Vismia-dominado y Cecropia-dominado). Usamos un analisis factorial para encontrar el conjunto de variable que se correlacionaron. Tambien usamos un analisis bayesiano para estimar el promedio y las desviaciones estandar de estas variables para cada especie y cada tipo de habitat. Las nueve especies focales se asociaron con elementos variables del micro habitat, tales como profundidad de la hojarasca y densidad de arboles, usualmente ausentes en bosques de crecimiento secundario. Al menos en los estadios tempranos de regeneracion ninguno de los tipos de crecimiento secundario provee una estructura adecuada para los insectivoros terrestres de nuestro estudio. Las largas hojas de los arboles de Cecropia que crean una hojarasca mas gruesa pueden evitar el uso de bosques de crecimiento secundario dominado Cecropia por parte de nuestras especies focales, muchas de las cuales manipulan hojas cuando estan buscando alimento.
   La hojarasca de los bosques de crecimiento secundario dominados por Vismia tambien fue mas gruesa respecto a los lugares usados por nuestras especies focales para buscar alimento. Adicionalmente, los bosques dominados por Vismia tuvieron mas arboles pequenos y pequena vegetacion no lenosa, que puede impedir el movimiento de las aves terrestres. En bosques continuos, nuestras especies focales buscaron alimento en micro habitats con caracteristicas que generalmente se superpusieron con las de los lugares escogidos aleatoriamente. En consecuencia, nuestros resultados son consistentes con la hipotesis que diferencias en micro habitat hacen que los bosques de crecimiento secundario sean lugares inadecuados para nuestras especies focales.

AB Species employ diverse strategies to cope with natural disturbance, but the importance of these strategies for maintaining tree species diversity in forests has been debated. Mechanisms that have the potential to promote tree species coexistence in the context of repeated disturbance include life history trade-offs in colonization and competitive ability or in species' ability to survive at low resource conditions and exploit the temporary resource-rich conditions often generated in the wake of disturbance (successional niche). Quantifying these trade-offs requires long-term forest monitoring and modeling.
   We developed a hierarchical Bayes model to investigate the strategies tree species employ to withstand and recover from hurricane disturbance and the life history trade-offs that may facilitate species coexistence in forests subject to repeated hurricane disturbance. Unlike previous approaches, our model accommodates temporal variation in process error and observations from multiple sources. We parameterized the model using growth and mortality data from four censuses of a 16-ha plot taken every five years (1990-2005), together with damage data collected after two hurricanes and annual seed production data (1992-2005).
   Species' susceptibilities to hurricane damage as reflected by changes in diameter growth and fecundity immediately following a storm were weak, highly variable, and unpredictable using traditional life history groupings. The lower crowding conditions (e.g., high light) generated in the wake of storms, however, led to greater gains in growth and fecundity for pioneer and secondary-forest species than for shade-tolerant species, in accordance with expectation of life history. We found moderate trade-offs between survival in high crowding conditions, a metric of competitive ability, and long-distance colonization. We also uncovered a strong trade-off between mean species fecundity in low crowding conditions, a metric of recovery potential, and competitive ability. Trade-offs in competitive and colonization ability, in addition to successional niche processes, are likely to contribute to species persistence in these hurricane-impacted forests. The strategies species employ to cope with hurricane damage depend on the degree to which species rely on sprouting, repair of adult damage, changes in demographic rates in response to enhanced resource availability after storms, or long-distance dispersal as recovery mechanisms.

AB Alien ants are among the most deleterious predatory invertebrates causing havoc to native biodiversity including negative effects on other ant species, other invertebrates and vertebrates, particularly birds and lizards, ecosystem function, economy, animal and human health. The patterns of alien ant invasions and reasons for their success are among the most intensively studied facets of invasion ecology, with feedback to a general understanding of ant ecology. Alien ant management can intervene at any step during the invasion process, with action for preventive measures being the most efficient. Beside standard chemical treatments, new methods and technologies for mitigation and control of ant invasions are mostly in a trial stage. A brief outlook on the most promising offensive lines is given with particular attention paid to Wolbachia-symbiosis. Ultimately, an integrative alien species management strategy is imperative to cope with accelerating biodiversity losses due to biological invasions.

AB Since 1989, we have conducted a large-scale ecological experiment in semiarid thorn scrub of a national park in north-central Chile. Initially, we focused on the role of biotic interactions including predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory in small mammal and plant components of the community. We utilized a reductionist approach with replicated 0.56 ha fenced grids that selectively excluded vertebrate predators and/or larger small mammal herbivores such as the degu, Octodon degas. Although we detected small transitory effects of predator exclusions on degu survival and numbers, other species failed to show responses. Similarly, interspecific competition (i.e., degus with other small mammals) had no detectable numerical effects (although some behavioral responses occurred), and degu-exclusions had relatively small effects on various plant components. Modeling approaches indicate that abiotic factors play a determining role in the dynamics of principal small mammal species such as O. degas and the leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini). In turn, these are mainly related to aperiodic pulses of higher rainfall (usually during El Nino events) which trigger ephemeral plant growth; a food addition experiment. in 1997-2000 verified the importance of precipitation as a determinant of food availability. Since 2004, we have expanded long-term monitoring efforts to other important community components including birds and insects in order to understand effects of abiotic factors on them; we report some of the first results of comprehensive surveys on the former in this region. Finally, we recently shifted focus to documenting effects of exotic lagomorphs in the park. We installed additional treatments selectively excluding small mammals, lagomorphs, or both, from replicated grids in order to evaluate putative herbivore impacts. In conjunction with increased annual rainfall since 2000, we predict that introduced lagomorphs will have increasing impacts in this region, and that more frequent El Ninos in conjunction with global climatic change may lead to marked changes in community dynamics. The importance of long-term experimental studies is underscored by the fact that only now after 20 years of work are some patterns becoming evident.

AB In order to understand the capacity of habitats to conserve species, many authors have searched for a species-area relationship (SAR) to evaluate the effect of patch size on species richness in habitat fragments. However, a range of different processes may underlie or obscure this relationship. For woody plant species in forest fragments, as for other taxa, considering forest edges separately in the investigation of SAR is particularly relevant. The objective of our study was to evaluate edge influence on SAR in a fragmented forest landscape in south-western France. To achieve this objective, we considered SAR in two separate spatial portions of the forest fragment: the edge and the forest interior. We also considered SAR for different ecological groups of species based on their shade tolerance and their mode of dispersal, as species can respond differently to habitat reduction depending on their ecological characteristics. In 40 woodlands in an agricultural landscape, we observed the presence/absence of all woody species along parallel walking transects 20-m wide to inventory the total number of species in each woodlot. Vegetation surveys resulted in the identification of 53 woody species, with a total of 23 trees and 30 shrubs, and a number of species per woodlot ranging from 18 to 44. The species richness found in a given woodlot was significantly correlated with its area. When considering the edge and the interior parts of the woodlot separately we found a steeper increase in species richness with area for the part we considered as the edge, compared with the increase found in the interior part of the forest. Our results confirm the contribution of forest edge to forest fragment SAR. Results also underlined the importance of two additional processes that may contribute to SAR: a possible extinction debt of shade-tolerant species in forest edge zones and colonisation by light-demanding species in forest interior zones probably due to disturbances. This approach underlines the importance of taking the edge effect into account when studying the influence of patch size on species richness and the dynamic of species richness pattern.

AB Although only a few Studies have explicitly evaluated live-dead agreement of species and community responses to environmental and spatial gradients, paleoecological analyses implicitly assume that death assemblages capture these gradients accurately. We use nine data sets from modern, relatively undisturbed coastal study areas to evaluate how the response of living molluscan assemblages to environmental gradients (water depth and seafloor type; "environmental component" of a gradient) and geographic separation ("spatial component") is captured by their death assemblages. We find that:
   1. Living assemblages vary in composition either in response to environmental gradients alone (consistent with a species-sorting model) or in response to a combination of environmental and spatial gradients (mass-effect model). None of the living assemblages support the neutral model (or the patch-dynamic model), in which variation in species abundance is related to the spatial configuration of stations alone. These findings also Support assumptions that mollusk species consistently differ in responses to environmental gradients, and suggest that in the absence of postmortem bias, environmental gradients might be accurately captured by variation in species composition among death assemblages. Death assemblages L in fact respond uniquely to environmental gradients, and show a stronger response when abundances are square-root transformed to downplay the impact of numerically abundant species and increase the effect of rare species.
   2. Species' niche positions (position of maximum abundance) along bathymetric and sedimentary gradients in death assemblages show significantly positive rank correlations to species positions in living assemblages in seven of nine data sets (both square-root-transformed and presence-absence data).
   3. The proportion of compositional variation explained by environmental gradients in death assemblages is similar to that of counterpart living assemblages. Death assemblages thus show the same ability to capture environmental gradients as do living assemblages. In some instances compositional dissimilarities in death assemblages show higher rank correlation with spatial distances than with environmental gradients, but spatial structure in community composition is mainly driven by spatially structured environmental gradients.
   4. Death assemblages correctly identify the dominance of niche metacommunity models in mollusk communities, as revealed by counterpart living assemblages. This analysis of the environmental resolution of death assemblages thus supports fine-scale niche and paleoenvironmental analyses using molluscan fossil records. In spite of taphonomic processes and time-averaging effects that modify community composition, death assemblages largely capture the response of living communities to environmental gradients, partly because of redundancy in community structure that is inherently associated with multispecies assemblages. The Molluscan data sets show some degree of redundancy as evidenced by the presence of at least two mutually exclusive subsets of species that replicate the community structure, and simple simulations show that between-sample relationships can be preserved and remain significant even when a large proportion of species is randomly removed from data sets.

AB A number of traits have been attributed important roles in tolerance of shade by plants. Some explanations emphasize traits enhancing net carbon gain; others emphasize energy conservation traits such as storage of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). To date, cross-species studies have provided mixed support for the role of NSC storage in low-light survival. We examined NSC status, survival, biomass, and growth of large seedlings of two evergreen species of differing shade tolerance (Nothofagus nitida and N. dombeyi) grown in deep shade and 50% light for two growing seasons. We expected to find higher NSC concentration in the more shade-tolerant N. nitida and since allocation to storage involves sacrificing growth, higher growth rate in the shade-intolerant N. dombeyi. NSC concentration of both species was > twofold higher in 50% light than in deep shade, and in roots and stems did not differ significantly between species in either environment. NSC contents per plant were also similar between dead and living plants in deep shade. N. dombeyi outgrew N. nitida in 50% light, while this pattern was reversed in deep shade. Survival in deep shade was not correlated with NSC concentration. Leaf mass fraction was similar between species in 50% light, but lower in N. dombeyi in deep shade. Results provide little evidence of a link between carbohydrate storage and low-light survival in Nothofagus species, and support the view that understorey survival is primarily a function of net carbon gain. Patterns of variation in NSC concentration of the temperate species we studied are likely dominated by more important influences than adaptation to shade, such as limitation of growth or adaptation to cold stress.

AB Soil-borne pathogens are posited to maintain forest diversity. However, their in situ impact and spatial variation are largely unknown. We examined spatial patterns of pathogenic activity in a deciduous forest using a common garden experiment and also in a natural experiment around replicated trees, and we quantified Pythium (a soil-borne pathogen) density around individual Prunus serotina trees. In both experiments, P. serotina seedling survival was 52-57% greater in plots treated with a metalaxyl-based fungicide specific to oomycetes (i.e., Pythium) than in untreated plots. Disease dynamics were not density dependent, but pathogenic activity and Pythium density were spatially variable. In the common garden and natural experiments, pathogenic activity of soil inoculum varied among trees, while in the natural experiment disease dynamics were also distance dependent and pathogenic activity decreased away from P. serotina trees. Disease and Pythium density were not always related but displayed considerable spatial variation. We found that Pythium density did not vary with distance away from P. serotina trees but did vary among trees. Understanding the spatial complexity of soil-borne pathogens is critical to accurately characterizing their effects on populations and ultimately on forest diversity.

AB There is general agreement regarding the importance of analysing the territories' roles under different biodiversity management figures in order to support better decision making in the management of natural resources in tropical countries. in this study we analyse the deforestation process to address the question of whether existing strategies such as national protected areas (PAs) and indigenous reservations (IRs) are effective protecting forests in the Colombian Guyana shield. We analyse whether these territories have successfully halted deforestation and agricultural frontier expansion by comparing deforestation occurring within these areas with their surroundings from 1985 to 2002. We also evaluate the impact of roads, illicit crops, and the size of PAs and IRs on deforestation rates. The results indicate that deforestation levels along the outside borders of both management figures were almost four times higher than inside declared PAs and 1.5 times higher than in IRs. However, within IRs, the loss of forested ecosystems was approximately six times greater than inside national parks. As a whole, roads were a significant factor associated with the changes in the region, as well as the influential expansion of coca cultivation particularly outside the national parks. The size of the PAs and indigenous lands also determined their positive impact as barrier against deforestation. Our results suggest strong pressure on areas surrounding PAs, driven by economic forces such as illegal crop expansion, particularly in the last decade. Indigenous lands with small territories have suffered intensive deforestation processes since the 1980s, but changes have been less dramatic in larger areas. Today, PAs are an effective barrier to deforestation, especially given their large extension, but are still under high risk. Future management plans should consider a designed infrastructure development paired with the establishment of new indigenous reservations with minimum viable sizes in order to control accessibility, natural resources extraction, and deforestation.

AB It is an essential feature of plants that leaves at higher levels have better access to light than those at lower levels. Thus, larger plants generally enjoy greater success in competing for light than smaller ones. We analyse the effect of such size-asymmetry, or one-sided competition, on the successful coexistence of plant species, using an analytically tractable model for stratified populations, in which a plant in the same layer exhibits the same crowding effect as any other, irrespective of species.
   A two-layer population that is reproductive in upper layer and juvenile in lower layer has a uniquely stable (plant-size-weighted) equilibrium density, as long as its fecundity is sufficient to compensate for its mortality rate. We also calculate a unique threshold lower-layer density of this layered population when there is no upper-layer plant. This threshold lower-layer density is larger than the weighted equilibrium density with upper layer, except for the case of perfect two-sided competition.
   A two-layer species can stably coexist with a one-layer, understorey species as a result of one-sided, but not two-sided competition. The coexistence condition is that the equilibrium density of the one-layer species lies between the threshold lower-layer density and the equilibrium density of the two-layer species. For an understorey species to coexist successfully with a two-layer species, any advantage in demographic performance, most prominently in a sufficiently high fecundity per plant must offset the disadvantage of living in dark conditions.
   Results from a model of multi-layer populations suggest that several species differing in terms of maximum layer and fecundity can coexist under conditions of one-sided competition. We demonstrate an example of the stable coexistence of eight species. The inter-specific trade-offs predicted by the model correspond to patterns observed in a rain forest.
   Synthesis. We propose a stratification theory that explains the generation and maintenance of the successful coexistence of plant species. Under the condition of one-sided competition, a canopy population that takes advantage of escaping from understorey competition shows an ability to invade an understorey with a density higher than its own equilibrium density, and which offers opportunities for an understorey population with high fecundity and/or shade tolerance to coexist. The predicted coexistence of species that share maximum canopy height is most pronounced for trees of tropical rain forests.

AB A wide range of anthropogenic activities are impacting the ecology of coastal areas. Exploitation of marine resources is one such activity, which, through cascading trophic effects, can have influences well beyond that of the target species. We investigated the mid-rocky-shore community structure of the Azores archipelago, a seldom-studied habitat, where there is a local tradition of exploiting limpets, the main intertidal grazers. The limpet population structure differed among islands, and there was an inverse relationship between the abundance of larger limpets and the human population per coastal perimeter, but not the associated catch data. At small scales of resolution (quadrats), there was a negative relationship between the cover of algae and limpets and a positive relationship between barnacles and limpets. These relationships were also apparent at the larger scale of islands as a function of the gradient of exploitation. Our results show how natural habitat fragmentation may be useful where the experimental testing of a hypothesis is not possible, and provide evidence for the trophic cascading effects of limpet exploitation at landscape scales.

TI Nearest-neighbor tree species combinations in tropical forest: the role
   of chance, and some consequences of high diversity
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article
ID COSTA-RICA; VEGETATION
AB In three permanent inventory plots comprising 12.4 ha of undisturbed forest at La Selva, Costa Rica, all stems >= 10 cm dbh were mapped and identified to species. There were 1628, 1478 and 1954 trees in the plots, representing 168, 166 and 171 species respectively. We determined the species of each nearest-neighbor pair of trees, and asked whether the occurrence of species pairs conforms to a simple random mixing model. If trees are randomly mixed in terms of species, the expected frequency of any nearest neighbor species combination is a function of the relative abundance of the two species. Departures from random mixing could arise from species interactions, differential responses to habitat, or both. The number of possible ij species combinations increases approximately as the square of the number of species. For the 168 species in plot 1, for example, there are 14 196 possible combinations. We compared the expected frequency of each species combination in the three plots (42 736 combinations in all) with observed frequencies. Over 98% of the combinations had observed frequencies of zero and expected frequencies close to zero. A consequence of high diversity is low density of most individual species, and exceedingly low frequencies of the vast majority of species combinations. For each of the 805 combinations with observed frequencies > 0, we used simulation to generate a distribution of expected frequencies. We used a t-test to compare the observed frequency with the mean of the simulated distribution for each combination. Only 40 combinations (0.09% of the possible species combinations in the plots) departed from expected frequencies; 39 combinations were more common, and one less common than expected. The overwhelming majority of nearest neighbor species combinations occur at frequencies predictable from their individual abundances.

AB Freshwater species and ecosystems are gravely imperiled, particularly within urban landscapes of tropical Asia. In one of the region's most urbanized landscapes (i.e., Singapore), we determined: (1) the importance of six different habitats (i.e., catchment reservoirs, estuarine reservoirs, forest streams, rural streams, ponds and monsoon canals) for conserving the diversity of freshwater molluscs; (2) key environmental factors (e.g., pH) affecting molluscan distribution; (3) important biogeographical determinants (e.g., area) of molluscan richness within each habitat; and (4) the habitat affinities of introduced species. High sampling saturation was achieved at most study habitats with minimal sampling effort, suggesting that the utilization of molluscs as bioindicators can expedite freshwater conservation initiatives. Estuarine reservoirs (6.0 +/- 2.0) had the highest molluscan richness, vis-a-vis catchment reservoirs, forest streams, rural streams, ponds and monsoon canals (3.0 +/- 1.5; 0; 3.3 +/- 2.0; 1.8 +/- 0.5 and 3.5 +/- 0.5 respectively). Both reservoir types possessed species compositions distinct from other habitats and contained majority (76%) of the sampled species. Reservoirs therefore serve to conserve the bulk of local freshwater malacofauna, especially if they are maintained at near-neutral pH levels (i.e., similar to 7.3) and contain large substrates (i.e., rocks). Area was the best predictor of molluscan richness across all habitats, implying that larger freshwater habitats require higher conservation priorities than smaller ones. Introduced (non-native) species (e.g., Pomacea canaliculata) had high affinities for reservoirs, which are in need of monitoring to curb population expansions. The interminable growth of human settlements urgently requires a reconciliatory approach, which includes the ecologically-sound design and management of modified habitats to complement reserves in sustaining native freshwater species.

AB Conservation of wildlife populations requires extensive knowledge of their habitat requirements, efficient methods to evaluate habitat quality, and an understanding of the value of fragments and edges. Kibale National Park, Uganda has areas that differ in the densities of 2 species of frugivorous monkeys-Cercopithecus mitis and Lophocebus albigena-including one on an edge and forest fragments outside the park that lack both species. We compared the basal area densities of important food trees with primate densities. The density of Cercopithecus mitis correlates most strongly with the basal area density of all types of food trees combined. The density of Lophocebus albigena does not correlate with the basal area densities of any category of food trees or with fruit availability. An index of their density-number of groups seen per km walked-correlates to fruit availability but with marginal significance. Lack of a relationship between the basal area densities of food trees and density of Lophocebus albigena may be the result of a mismatch in scale between the forest area measured and their large home ranges. We compared the unused area of forest to the other areas of the forest and the fragments and found it had higher basal area densities in all food tree categories for both species than the fragments and lower basal area densities of most categories than the other parts of the forest, indicating that the fragments are poor quality and would probably be unused even if dispersal were likely.

AB This paper analyzes the diversity of dung and carrion beetles (Scarabaeinae and Silphidae) in four human-induced habitats of a disturbed tropical montane cloud forest: polyspecific shade coffee plantations, monospecific shade coffee plantations, tropical montane cloud forest fragments, and clear cuts. The four habitats had similar richness, species composition, and assemblage structure of dung and carrion beetles. Differences were found in abundance and biomass levels for the four dominant species in the landscape. Dung beetles were more abundant than carrion beetles, but the biomass was higher for the latter. Carrion beetles were seasonal, while dung beetles were clearly not. When forest fragments and shade coffee plantations were compared to other similar habitats in the region, the same general pattern was observed. However, forests with high disturbance and monospecific shade coffee plantations had lower species richness than forests with low and medium disturbance and polyspecific shade coffee plantations. Thus shade coffee plantations maintain connectivity between patches of cloud forest in a landscape that is strongly affected by human activities. Protecting landscape diversity appears to ensure high species richness.

AB Significant changes in land-use practices, combined with increasing levels of fragmentation within the last century, have made the landscape an important and relevant scale for studies of wildlife ecology and management. However, relatively few landscape-level investigations have explicitly addressed characteristics of the landscape matrix. Even fewer studies have examined how specific land uses within the matrix affect wildlife, and most of these confound the amount and type of disturbances within study designs. Recent research demonstrates that land uses can differ markedly in their effects on wildlife in nearby forests or grasslands-even in landscapes with comparable amounts of habitat. In particular, urban or residential development within the matrix can alter diversity or abundance of some species and can depress avian nesting success even in large forest tracts. Simply the presence of certain land uses, such as agricultural openings, within forested regions can negatively impact some animal communities. Collectively, these studies provide strong evidence that land uses within forested and fragmented landscapes are important influences on wildlife populations and communities. Consequently, biologists and managers involved in the design and management of natural areas, parks, reserves, and other public lands should carefully consider types of land uses occurring within or adjacent to their boundaries.

AB Accidental surface fires are emerging as one of the most pervasive threats to tropical forests. Although unimpressive in appearance, these fires can have surprisingly potent impacts on rainforest plant and animal communities, as demonstrated by recent studies led by Jos Barlow and Carlos Peres in central Amazonia. Even worse, surface fires greatly increase the likelihood of far larger conflagrations that can lead to complete forest destruction.

AB Little is known about the impacts of selective logging on herbaceous plants of tropical forests. If logging impacts on nontimber species are low and little time is required for recovery, logged forests could be compatible with conservation of some elements of the understory flora. As many nqntimber species may have commercial value, knowledge about the impacts of different logging intensities is necessary to determine levels of timber extraction compatible with multiple use of forests. In this study, we examined the effects of logging intensity, time after logging, and skidder tracks, on the composition and diversity of the ground-level herb community of a terra-firme forest in central Amazonia. Logging was carried out at varying intensities in eight 4-ha experimental plots in 1987, three plots in 1993, and five plots were controls. Herb community composition, analyzed with hybrid multidimensional scaling (HMDS), was not significantly affected by logging intensity, but was significantly related to the area covered by logging gaps and skidder tracks. There was no significant difference in community composition and richness between treatments with different times after logging. Species richness was also not related to the logging intensity. Some species (18.2%) were found only in logged plots and were mainly from habitats outside the rain forest. There were significant differences in herb composition between controls and skidder tracks, but recent and old skidder tracks were mixed in the ordination space, suggesting that recovery in skidder tracks is slower than in other areas affected by logging. Overall, our results indicate that the ground herb community is not severely affected by selective logging at the intensities used in this experiment. The alterations in composition are mainly local, and restricted to the most disturbed patches. We conclude that forests managed with logging intensities similar to those used in this experiment could be compatible with conservation of understory herbs. Skidder tracks should be minimized, as they have the greatest long-term impact and allow species from other habitats to invade the forest.

AB Scale-dependent influence of environmental complexity has become a central issue in ecology. We quantified the impact of artificial reefs on community characteristics (biomass, density) and on individual mussel growth, and we tested the relative importance of physical processes (i.e. flow velocity, substratum temperature) as intermediate factors mediating the scale-dependent influence of topographic heterogeneity on benthic communities. Twelve concrete reefs (cylinders) of 3 different sizes (52, 76 and 115 cm) were placed on randomly selected sites along a rocky intertidal platform. The area around each reef and 4 control sites were divided into 24 sampling cells (6 orientation and 4 distance categories). Hydrodynamic patterns around reefs and control sites were determined using the dissolution of plaster cylinders. Flow velocity was simulated around reefs using a finite-element hydrodynamic model. Substratum temperature was also measured. The biomass and density of benthic community adjacent to the reefs was sampled using 10 x 10 cm quadrats before and 1 yr after installation. Growth of individual Mytilus edulis attached to experimental panels was measured, A flow index revealed a strong scale-dependent gradient of decreasing water motion intensity with distance from the reefs, and the hydrodynamic model showed a reduction of flow velocity on the downstream side of large reefs. Substratum temperature was lower closer to reefs, and shaded areas increased with reef size. Maximum MI. edulis biomass was around large reefs, while the biomasses of other dominant species were not positively influenced by reef size. Biomass and density patterns close to the reefs were significant only around large reefs, with the downstream side having the lowest M. edulis biomass. Growth of M. edulis decreased significantly with distance away from the reefs. Biomass patterns were best explained by the flow velocity around the large reefs (R-2 = 0.27), while mussel growth was best correlated with substratum temperature close to the medium reefs (R-2 = 0.66). Our study shows that the spatial structure of the benthic community studied and its scaling with topographic heterogeneity depends on dominant mediating physical factors (i.e. hydrodynamic processes or substratum temperature).

AB The role of regeneration strategies in structuring tropical tree communities has been a recent focus of attention of tropical ecologists. Canopy discontinuities created by tree-falls are considered to be critical to many rain forest trees for establishing and completing their life cycles. It was investigated whether it is advantageous for two common large-seeded and shade-tolerant Amazonian tree species, the palm Astrocaryum murumuru and the legume, Dipteryx micrantha, to have their seeds dispersed to gaps. The dispersal process was simulated by placing experimental seeds and seedlings in gaps and in the shaded understorey, and then following their performance. Seeds and seedlings from the two species were used. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the survival functions and compare survivorship curves. Survival of Astrocaryum seeds, and of Dipteryx seeds and seedlings, was higher in two gap zones (crown and bole) than in the shaded understorey (both near and far away from a conspecific adult). A higher proportion of seedlings of both plant species survived within gaps than in the shaded understorey over an 18-wk period. One year after the seedlings had been transplanted into gaps these patterns still held. Naturally occurring Astrocaryum seeds survived better beneath conspecific adult trees located within 30 m of gaps than beneath trees located 100 m from gaps. Variation in gap size was significant for Dipteryx seeds, but not for Dipteryx seedlings and Astrocaryum seeds and seedlings. Dipteryx seeds survived longer in smaller than in larger gaps. By colonizing tree-fall gaps, these two species improved their chances of completing their life cycles.

AB Patterns of seed rain were observed at five forest locations in recent treefall gaps and paired understory sites in a tropical wet forest in northeast Costa Rica. Seed rain was dominated by animal-dispersed species. Overall, significantly more wind-dispersed seeds arrived into treefall gaps than into forest understory. Contrary to expectations, understory sires received a greater seed rain than did gap sites during three of four sample periods over the course of one year. Considerable spatial heterogeneity, however, existed among forest locations, with some forest sites receiving up to three times more seed rain input than ochers. Results from this seed rain study generally marched those from an earlier study at this sire in terms of seed rain volume and dominant plane families. Composition of seed rain was more similar among habitat types (i.e., gap, understory) than among forest locations (i.e., paired sites) suggesting that spatial foraging activity and habitat preference of seed dispersers result in non-random patterns of seed rain. If true, then such patterns have implications for evolution of fruit and seed characters that promote survival and establishment of seeds under certain environmental conditions.

AB Competitive interaction among sessile organisms was studied by suspending PVC (polyvinylchloride) panels in 4 different seasons at Tomioka Bay, south Japan. Panels were suspended in such a way that only 1 side received direct sunlight. Panels were monitored by intermittent photography for a maximum period of 14 mo. On the sunlit side of the panels, 35 species belonging to 8 taxonomic groups were encountered. A total of 7980 interspecific interactions among these organisms were monitored and the competitive relationships among them were ascertained. Competitive relationships on panels suspended in November 1991 (autumn) and August 1992 (summer) and monitored until December 1992 resulted in a simple hierarchy. On the other hand, panels suspended in February (winter) and April 1992 (spring) and monitored until December 1992 did not result in a hierarchy. Observation of panels after 4 mo of initiation in all 4 seasons showed different levels of competitive dominance for the same set of species. At the end of the study, the colonial ascidians Diplosoma mitsukurii and Didemnum moseleyi dominated on the panels initiated in autumn and summer, whilst no such hierarchy could be observed on the panels initiated in winter and spring. However, at the end of 4 mo of initiation, hierarchy could be detected in all 4 seasons. The branching bryozoan Zoobotryon pellucidum occupied the topmost position in the hierarchical order in panels initialed in winter and spring when observed after 4 mo of initiation. Reversal of organisms' positions in the hierarchical order with the change in panel initiation season could be observed on the panels at the end of study. The results showed the competitive interactions among these organisms, the time of panel initiation and/or the initial colonizers of the panel surfaces which significantly affected the subsequent species composition and the succession of species on these panels.

AB The epibiotic communities on locally abundant macroinvertebrates, in particular the brachiopod Liothyrella uva and the limpet Nacella concinna, were examined from depths between 0 and 50 m at Signy Island, Antarctica. The percentage cover by epibionts on Liothyrella increased from <20% on the smallest individuals to >50% on the largest, and decreased slightly with depth. The percentage cover of Nacella by epibionts increased with size of individual over an approximately similar range of values, but in contrast with Liothyrella increased greatly with depth. Cheilostome bryozoans and annelids of the genus Spirorbis formed >90% (by area) of the colonists on Liothyrella and 30-60% on Nacella, the coralline alga Lithothamnion and sponges making up the remainder. The bryozoans, which generally dominated the epibiotic communities, comprised complex associations of species which could be described as either generalists, host-specific epibiotic, low specificity epibiotic or locally abundant background species. Positive associations of both occurrence and abundance were found between some of the bryozoans living epibiotically on the brachiopod Liothyrella. The overgrowth interactions recorded, between the three main epibiotic faunal taxa; sponges, bryozoans and annelids, were essentially hierarchical. Sponges usually overgrew Bryozoa, and Bryozoa overgrew Spirorbis as well as occasionally smothering small brachiopods. In four adult Liothyrella death may have been caused by the epibiotic bryozoan Arachnopusia inchoata growing over the gape, so preventing feeding and/or respiration.

AB The effects of Sika deer (Cervus nippon) browsing on the regeneration of pioneer species were studied in relation to canopy gaps in a warm temperate evergreen oak forest in Kasugayama, Nara City. Four study sites, three in canopy gaps and one under a closed canopy, were selected and each divided into fenced and unfenced plots. Under the dosed canopy, seedlings of all the pioneer species died irrespective of browsing pressure. However, in the canopy gap sites, seedlings of the pioneer species could establish and grow well. The seedling survival ratio in the fenced plots in the canopy gaps was > 60% 1 year after germination. However, in the unfenced plots, only < 20% of the seedlings survived 1 year, with all dying within 3 years after germination. Thus, the regeneration of pioneer trees in this forest was strongly inhibited by deer browsing. Successful regeneration of a pioneer, Zanthoxylum ailanthoides, occurred for several years even after two major wind disturbances during the past 90 years.  This may be due to less browsing pressure from the deer.

Our understanding of cyclone ecology is biased towards the North Atlantic Basin, because cyclone effects do differ across oceanic basins. Cyclones have both short and long-term effects across the levels of biological organization, but we lack a scale-perspective of cyclone ecology. Effects on individual trees, such as defoliation or branch stripping and uprooting, are mechanistically linked to effects at the community and ecosystem levels, including forest productivity and stand regeneration time. Forest dwarfing via the gradual removal of taller trees by cyclones over many generations illustrates that cyclones shape forest structure through the accumulation of short-term effects over longer timescales.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) is an effective policy in conserving ecosystem services and is increasingly applied globally. The concept of PES was firstly defined in 2005, researches with various terminologies, concepts, and practices emerged since then. This paper analyzed the research patterns of PES studies through bibliometric methods, with a special focus on the trends of terminology, location (geographical research hotspot), types of PES, and PES effectiveness evaluation based on author keywords analysis. The results showed that PES started to receive considerable academic attentions from 2005, and the number of PES publications have relatively kept an increasing trend since then. The most influential journal, country, research organization, and author were Ecological Economics, USA, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS, China), and Dr. Wunder. Further analysis revealed that there were various terminologies in PES studies, notably "ecological compensation" and "eco-compensation" (EC) were primarily adapted by Chinese research community. China was the geographical research hotspot and developing countries (Vietnam, Mexico, and Brazil) have received growing academic interests in last decade. "Forest and Carbon" PES was the most concerned types of PES in last five years. There were 125 articles evaluated the effectiveness of empirical PES initiatives, and the majority focused on the social aspect. We proposed two suggestions for future research: (1) adapting EC as an alternative term for PES studies because of its inclusiveness and representation of empirical practices; (2) enhancing integrated evaluation of PES programs to achieve multiple benefits.

AB Recent studies suggest that habitat amount is the main determinant of species richness, whereas habitat fragmentation has weak and mostly positive effects. Here, we challenge these ideas using a multi-taxa database including 2230 estimates of forest-dependent species richness from 1097 sampling sites across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. We used a structural equation modeling approach, accounting not only for direct effects of habitat loss, but also for its indirect effects (via habitat fragmentation), on the richness of forest-dependent species. We reveal that in addition to the effects of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation has negative impacts on animal species richness at intermediate (30-60%) levels of habitat amount, and on richness of plants at high ( > 60%) levels of habitat amount, both of which are mediated by edge effects. Based on these results, we argue that dismissing habitat fragmentation as a powerful force driving species extinction in tropical forest landscapes is premature and unsafe.

AB Understanding processes that drive community recovery are needed to predict ecosystem trajectories and manage for impacts under increasing global threats. Yet, the quantification of community recovery in coral reefs has been challenging owing to a paucity of long-term ecological data and high frequency of disturbances. Here we investigate community re-assembly and the bio-physical drivers that determine the capacity of coral reefs to recover following the 1998 bleaching event, using long-term monitoring data across four habitats in Palau. Our study documents that the time needed for coral reefs to recover from bleaching disturbance to coral-dominated state in disturbance-free regimes is at least 9-12 years. Importantly, we show that reefs in two habitats achieve relative stability to a climax community state within that time frame. We then investigated the direct and indirect effects of drivers on the rate of recovery of four dominant coral groups using a structural equation modelling approach. While the rates of recovery differed among coral groups, we found that larval connectivity and juvenile coral density were prominent drivers of recovery for fast growing Acropora but not for the other three groups. Competitive algae and parrotfish had negative and positive effects on coral recovery in general, whereas wave exposure had variable effects related to coral morphology. Overall, the time needed for community re-assembly is habitat specific and drivers of recovery are taxa specific, considerations that require incorporation into planning for ecosystem management under climate change.

AB Domestic dogs are increasingly being recognized as a conservation threat for native species. In many places, their impacts may be as severe as other invasive predators such as cats and rats. We conducted the first ever sub-continent scale assessment of the impacts of dogs on native species in India using an online key informant survey and reports from national print media. Dogs reportedly attacked 80 species, of which 31 were IUCN Red list threatened species, including four Critically Endangered species. Larger bodied mammals such as ungulates and carnivores, were most commonly reported to be attacked, although this may be an observation bias. Approximately 68% of the attacks were carried out by dogs unaccompanied by humans. Most of the attacks were carried out by packs of dogs with 45% of these attacks leading to the death of the prey. Nearly 48% of the incidents were reported in and around wildlife protected areas, suggesting that dogs are an important large-scale edge effect around protected areas in India. For Critically Endangered species that are already suffering from serious population declines due to other causes, the impact of dogs may seriously impede population recovery efforts. Mitigating the impacts of dogs on wildlife requires a multi-pronged approach of responsible dog ownership, restriction in free-ranging behaviour, and strong population control measures, especially around sensitive conservation areas.

AB Savanna vegetation is variable, and predicting how water, nutrients, and chronic disturbances interact to determine vegetation structure in savannas represents a challenge.
   Here, we examined in situ interactions among rainfall, soils, grasses, fire, and elephants that determine tree layer responses to resource gradients in Kruger National Park in South Africa, using 363 long-term monitoring sites throughout the park.
   Grass biomass increased with rainfall and on nutrient-rich clay soils. Fire frequency, too, increased with rainfall. Conversely, tree density was greater on sandier soils, where water infiltrates more readily, and in areas where the maximum interval between fires was longer, irrespective of average fire frequency. Elephant density responded positively to tree density, but did not contribute significantly to decreasing tree density.
   Savanna vegetation structure was reasonably predictable, via a combination of rainfall (favoring grasses), soil (sandy soils favoring trees), and fire (limiting trees until a longer interval between fires allows them to establish). Explicit consideration of bottom-up and top-down interactions may thus contribute to a predictive understanding of savanna vegetation heterogeneity.

AB We hypothesized that dinitrogen (N-2)- and non-N-2-fixing tropical trees would have distinct phosphorus (P) acquisition strategies allowing them to exploit different P sources, reducing competition.
   We measured root phosphatase activity and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization among two N-2- and two non-N-2-fixing seedlings, and grew them alone and in competition with different inorganic and organic P forms to assess potential P partitioning.
   We found an inverse relationship between root phosphatase activity and AM colonization in field-collected seedlings, indicative of a trade-off in P acquisition strategies. This correlated with the predominantly exploited P sources in the seedling experiment: the N-2 fixer with high N-2 fixation and root phosphatase activity grew best on organic P, whereas the poor N-2 fixer and the two non-N-2 fixers with high AM colonization grew best on inorganic P. When grown in competition, however, AM colonization, root phosphatase activity and N-2 fixation increased in the N-2 fixers, allowing them to outcompete the non-N-2 fixers regardless of P source.
   Our results indicate that some tropical trees have the capacity to partition soil P, but this does not eliminate interspecific competition. Rather, enhanced P and N acquisition strategies may increase the competitive ability of N-2 fixers relative to non-N-2 fixers.

AB Fire has played an important role in the plant dynamics and diversity of the Cerrado for millions of years. We evaluated fire behaviour in different fire seasons in areas of an open savanna, providing information for fire management plans. It has been hypothesised that early fires (May - end of the rainy season) will be less intense than those conducted in the middle and end of the dry season (July and October) owing to the amount of dead biomass accumulated. Therefore, we compared fire behaviour in early, mid- and late dry season, evaluating the main fire and environmental variables. Fire intensity was mainly influenced by the combination of dead fuel percentage and fuel load. Even though this combination was the best model to explain fire intensity variability, fire parameters (including fire intensity) did not differ between fire seasons. Flame height was best explained by dead fuel percentage+fuel moisture content, dead fuel percentage+fuel load and also by dead fuel percentage. Our study showed that, in areas with fire exclusion for 2 years, fire season did not influence fire parameters and fire behaviour and the main factors influencing fire intensity were the proportion of dead biomass and total fuel load.

AB The human microbiome project (HMP) has made it possible to test important ecological theories for arguably the most important ecosystem to human health-the human microbiome. Existing limited number of studies have reported conflicting evidence in the case of the neutral theory; the present study aims to comprehensively test the neutral theory with extensive HMP datasets covering all five major body sites inhabited by the human microbiome. Utilizing 7437 datasets of bacterial community samples, we discovered that only 49 communities (less than 1%) satisfied the neutral theory, and concluded that human microbial communities are not neutral in general. The 49 positive cases, although only a tiny minority, do demonstrate the existence of neutral processes. We realize that the traditional doctrine of microbial biogeography "Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects" first proposed by Baas-Becking resolves the apparent contradiction. The first part of Baas-Becking doctrine states that microbes are not dispersal-limited and therefore are neutral prone, and the second part reiterates that the freely dispersed microbes must endure selection by the environment. Therefore, in most cases, it is the host environment that ultimately shapes the community assembly and tip the human microbiome to niche regime.

AB 1. Plants evolved strategies to attract pollinators that are essential for reproduction. However, plant defence against herbivores may trade off with pollinator attraction. 2. Here, we investigated the role of inducible plant secondary metabolites in such a trade-off. Our objective was to reveal the mechanisms underlying the effects of induced plant responses to pollination and herbivory. We assessed how responses of plants to pollination and insect herbivory affect the behaviour of flower visitors. Subsequently, we investigated how the production of volatile and non-volatile compounds changes after pollination and herbivory. 3. Both herbivores and pollinators induced important phenotypic changes in flowers. Brassica nigra plants respond to pollination and herbivory with changes in the profile of volatiles and non-volatiles of their flowers. Our results show that butterflies use different cues when searching for an oviposition site or a nectar source. Pollination status influenced the behaviour of butterflies, but not that of syrphid flies. 4. We discuss the results in the context of the trade-off between defence and reproduction in plants and suggest that systemic responses to herbivores can interfere with local responses to pollination. Therefore, these responses must be addressed in an integrated way because, in nature, plants are simultaneously exposed to herbivores and pollinators.

AB Coastal defences are proliferating in response to climate change, leading to the creation of more vertical substrata. Efforts are being made to mitigate their impacts and create novel habitats to promote biodiversity. Little is known about the effect of aspect (i.e. north-south directionality) and inclination on intertidal biodiversity in artificial habitats. Artificial and natural habitats were compared to assess the role of aspect and substratum inclination in determining patterns of biodiversity at two tidal heights (high and mid). We also compared grazing activity between north-and south-facing surfaces in natural habitats to examine the potential for differential grazing pressure to affect community structure and functioning. Results were variable but some clear patterns emerged. Inclination had no effect on biodiversity or abundance. There was a general trend towards greater taxon richness and abundance on north-facing than south-facing substrata in natural and artificial habitats. On natural shores, the abundance and grazing activity of 'southern' limpets (i.e. Patella depressa) was greater on south-facing than north-facing substrata, with possible implications for further range-expansion. These results highlight the importance of incorporating shaded habitats in the construction of artificial habitats. These habitats may represent an important refuge from grazing pressure and thermal and desiccation stress in a warming climate.

AB In a rapidly changing world, characterized by novel ecological scenarios and fluctuating socioeconomic and ecological demands, ecological restoration practices must constantly adapt to emerging issues and circumstances. Restoration ecology, the scientific discipline that informs ecological restoration, must therefore evolve and expand its focus to address this need. To describe and evaluate the evolution of research pertaining to the ecological restoration of forests within the field of forestry, we performed a review of all 29,766 abstracts published over the last 35 years (1980-2014) in 15 leading forestry journals using automated content analysis, a machine learning-based tool for automated review of large volumes of literature ("big literature"). We found not only a 50-fold increase in the prominence of restoration ecology in forestry literature from 2000 to 2013, but also an evolution in the focus of forest restoration research. This evolution is likely in response to emerging topics and issues affecting forest restoration, such as exotic species, altered disturbance regimes, degraded tropical forests, and ecosystem services. Our results also revealed a pattern of "cyclic development," in which research in the 1990s was focused on constructing theoretical frameworks, in the 2000s research appeared to be concentrated on restoration practices and programs, while in the 2010s research revisited established theoretical frameworks, possibly indicating a conceptual expansion. Our study highlighted gaps in research on important topics and emerging challenges, such as global climate change, genetic considerations, landscape-level factors, and restoring degraded systems, thus pointing the way for new and necessary research directions.

AB When forest ecosystems develop over millennia, trees live five centuries, and mortality unfolds over decades, direct repeated observation (hereafter, longitudinal data) may be the only way to understand the fate of forests. Longitudinal data sets contribute greatly to our understanding, complementing experimental, modeling, and chronosequence approaches. Changing climate is changing forests, perhaps most rapidly through altered mortality regimes, and the elusive nature of integrated mechanistic understanding requires refinements and extensions to historically productive protocols. Changing climate reduces the inferential power of chronosequence techniques and changes model parameterization, and only some of the different factors contributing to tree mortality are expected to respond to climate variability and change. Because annual tree mortality rates are 5% to 1% for trees >= 1 cm dbh in young and old forests (respectively), detecting changes in mortality rates requires tracking thousands of trees, particularly to examine rare sub-populations of concern (e.g., large-diameter trees). And because mortality factors can be spatially aggregated and density-dependent, the causes and rates of tree mortality depend on the relationships between forest spatial structure and the direct and indirect effects of climate. Permanent plots with a combination of larger size, higher spatial precision, and greater sampling frequency will be required to further elucidate spatially explicit aspects of western forest demography. The combination of the longitudinal protocols developed by the Smithsonian Center for Tropical Forest Science, originally for studying tropical forest species diversity, and those developed by the US Geological Survey for annual tree mortality assessment together uniquely allow robust investigation of climate-mediated change in temperate forests.

TI The relationship between species richness and biomass changes from

AB Diversity-manipulation experiments suggest a positive effect of biodiversity on ecosystem properties (EPs), but variable relationships between species richness and EPs have been reported in natural communities. An explanation for this discrepancy is that observed richness-EPs relationships in natural communities change with environment and species functional identities. But how the relationships change along broad-scale climatic gradients has rarely been examined. In this paper, we sampled 848 plots of 20 x 30 m(2) from boreal to tropical forests across China. We examined plot biomass with respect to environmental factors, tree species richness and functional group identity (FGI, i.e. evergreen vs deciduous, and coniferous vs broadleaf). Variation partitioning was used to evaluate the relative effects of the three classes of factors. We found that, most of the effects' (percentage of variation explained) of richness and FGI on forest biomass were shared with environmental factors, but species richness and FGI still revealed significant effects in addition to environment for plots across China. Richness and FGI explained biomass mainly through their shared effects instead of independent effects, suggesting that the positive biodiversity effect is closely associated with a sampling effect. The relative effects of richness, FGI and environment varied latitudinally: the independent effects of environment and richness decreased from boreal to subtropical forests, whereas the total effect of FGI increased. We also found that the slope of richness-biomass relationship decreased monotonically from boreal to subtropical forests, possibly because of decreasing complementarity and increasing competition with increasing productivity. Our results suggest that while species richness does have significant effects on forest biomass it is less important than environmental gradients and other biotic factors in shaping large-scale biomass patterns. We suggest that understanding how and why the diversity-EPs relationships change along climatic gradient would be helpful for a better understanding of real biodiversity effects in natural communities.

AB 1. We hypothesized that tropical plant species with different mycorrhizal associations reduce competition for soil phosphorus (P) by specializing to exploit different soil organic P compounds. We assayed the activity of root/mycorrhizal phosphatase enzymes of four tree species with contrasting root symbiotic relationships - arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) (angiosperm and conifer), ectomycorrhizal (EM) and non-mycorrhizal - collected from one of three soil sites within a montane tropical forest. We also measured growth and foliar P of these seedlings in an experiment with P provided exclusively as inorganic orthophosphate, a simple phosphomonoester (glucose phosphate), a phosphodiester (RNA), phytate (the sodium salt of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) or a no-P control. The EM tree species expressed twice the phosphomonoesterase activity as the AM tree species, but had similar phosphodiesterase activity. The non-mycorrhizal Proteaceae tree had markedly greater activity of both enzymes than the mycorrhizal tree species, with root clusters expressing greater phosphomonoesterase activity than fine roots. Both the mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal tree species contained significantly greater foliar P than in no-P controls when limited to inorganic phosphate, glucose phosphate and RNA. The EM species did not perform better than the AM tree species when limited to organic P in any form. In contrast, the non-mycorrhizal Proteaceae tree was the only species capable of exploiting phytate, with nearly three times the leaf area and more than twice the foliar P of the no-P control. Our results suggest that AM and EM tree species exploit similar forms of P, despite differences in phosphomonoesterase activity. In contrast, the mycorrhizal tree species and non-mycorrhizal Proteaceae appear to differ in their ability to exploit phytate. We conclude that resource partitioning of soil P plays a coarse but potentially ecologically important role in fostering the coexistence of tree species in tropical montane forests.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS
AB There has been an increased interest in using sustainability indicators for evaluating the impacts of development and conservation projects. Past and recent experiences have shown that sustainability indicators can be powerful tools for measuring the outcomes of various interventions, when used appropriately and adequately. Currently, there is a range of methods for applying sustainability indicators for project impact evaluation at the environment-development interface. At the same time, a number of challenges persist which have implication for impact evaluation processes especially in developing countries. We highlight some key and recurrent challenges, using three cases from Kenya, Indonesia and Brazil.
   In this study, we have conducted a comparative analysis across multiple projects from the three countries, which aimed to conserve biodiversity and improve livelihoods. The assessments of these projects were designed to evaluate their positive, negative, short-term, long term, direct and indirect impacts. We have identified a set of commonly used sustainability indicators to evaluate the projects and have discussed opportunities and challenges associated with their application. Our analysis shows that impact evaluation processes present good opportunities for applying sustainability indicators. On the other hand, we find that project proponents (e.g. managers, evaluators, donors/fundets) face challenges with establishing full impacts of interventions and that these are rooted in monitoring and evaluation processes, lack of evidence-based impacts, difficulties of measuring certain outcomes and concerns over scale of a range of impacts.
   We outline key lessons learnt from the multiple cases and propose ways to overcome common problems. Results from our analysis demonstrate practical experiences of applying sustainability indicators in developing countries context where there are different prevailing socio-economic, cultural and environmental conditions. The knowledge derived from this study may therefore be useful to a wider range of audience who are concerned with sustainable integration of development and environmental conservation.

AB Niche differentiation is a major hypothesized determinant of species distributions, but its practical importance is heavily debated and its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Trait-based approaches have been used to infer niche differentiation and predict species distributions. For understanding underlying mechanisms, individual traits should be scaled up to whole-plant performance, which has rarely been done.
   We measured seven key traits that are important for carbon and water balance for 37 tropical tree species. We used a process-based plant physiological model to simulate the carbon budget of saplings along gradients of light and water availability, and quantified the performance of the species in terms of their light compensation points (a proxy for shade tolerance), water compensation points (proxy for drought tolerance), and maximum carbon gain rates (proxy for potential growth rate). We linked species performances to their observed distributions (the realized niches) at two spatial scales in Bolivian lowland forests: along a canopy openness gradient at local scale (similar to 1 km 2) and along a rainfall gradient (1100-2200 mm/yr) at regional (similar to 1000 km) scale.
   We show that the water compensation point was the best predictor of species distributions along water and light resource gradients within and across tropical forests. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the stomatal regulation of minimum leaf water potentials, rather than stem hydraulic traits (sapwood area and specific conductivity), contributed to the species differences in the water compensation point of saplings. The light compensation point and maximum carbon gain, both driven by leaf area index and leaf nitrogen concentration, also contributed to differential species distributions at the local scale, but not or only marginally at the regional scale. Trait-and-physiology-based simulations of whole-plant performance thus help to evaluate the possible roles of individual traits in physiological processes underlying species performance along environmental gradients. The development of such whole-plant concepts will improve our ability to understand responses of plant communities to shifts in resource availability and stress under global change.

AB Primates are among the most observable and best studied vertebrate order in tropical forest regions, with widespread attention dedicated to the feeding ecology of wild populations. In particular, primates play a key role as frugivores and seed-dispersal agents for a myriad of tropical plants. Sampling effort by primatologists, however, has been unequally distributed, hampering quantitative comparisons of primate diets. We provide the first systematic review of primate diets, with an emphasis on frugivory, using a comprehensive compilation of 290 unique primate dietary studies from 164 localities in 17 countries across the entire Neotropical realm. We account for sampling effort (standardised as hours) in comparing the richness of fruiting plants recorded in primate diets, and the relative contribution of frugivory to the overall diet in relation to key life-history traits, such as body mass. We find strong support for the long-held hypothesis, based on Kay's Threshold, that body size imposes an upper limit on insectivory and a lower limit on folivory, and therefore that frugivory is most important at intermediate body sizes. However, the upper body mass limit of extant neotropical primates, truncated by the post-Pleistocene megafaunal overkill, has implications for the extent of the frugivory-folivory continuum in extinct lineages. Contemporary threats faced by the largest primates serve as a further warning that the feeding ecology and diet of all neotropical primates remain severely undersampled with regard to the composition and richness of fruits consumed. Indeed, frugivorous primates expected to have the most species-rich plant diets are amongst those most poorly sampled, exposing implications for our current understanding of primate-plant interaction networks.

AB Earthworms, termites, and ants are common macroinvertebrates in terrestrial environments, although for most ecosystems data on their abundance and biomass is sparse. Quantifying their areal abundance is a critical first step in understanding their functional importance. We intensively sampled dead wood, litter, and soil in eastern US temperate hardwood forests at four sites, which span much of the latitudinal range of this ecosystem, to estimate the abundance and biomass m(-2) of individuals in macroinvertebrate communities. Macroinvertebrates, other than ants and termites, differed only slightly among sites in total abundance and biomass and they were similar in ordinal composition. Termites and ants were the most abundant macroinvertebrates in dead wood, and ants were the most abundant in litter and soil. Ant abundance and biomass m(-2) in the southernmost site (Florida) were among the highest values recorded for ants in any ecosystem. Ant and termite biomass and abundance varied greatly across the range, from < 1% of the total macroinvertebrate abundance (in the northern sites) to > 95% in the southern sites. Our data reveal a pronounced shift to eusocial insect dominance with decreasing latitude in a temperate ecosystem. The extraordinarily high social insect relative abundance outside of the tropics lends support to existing data suggesting that ants, along with termites, are globally the most abundant soil macroinvertebrates, and surpass the majority of other terrestrial animal (vertebrate and invertebrate) groups in biomass m(-2). Our results provide a foundation for improving our understanding of the functional role of social insects in regulating ecosystem processes in temperate forest.

AB We present experimental data obtained from an experiment with newly hatched veliger larvae of the gastropod Concholepas concholepas exposed to three pCO(2) levels. Egg capsules were collected from two locations in northern and central Chile, and then incubated throughout their entire intra-capsular life cycle at three nominal pCO(2) levels, similar to 400, 700 and 1000 ppm (i.e. corresponding to similar to 8.0, 7.8 and 7.6 pH units, respectively). Hatched larvae were fed with natural food assemblages. Food availability at time zero did not vary significantly with pCO(2) level. Our results clearly showed a significant effect of elevated pCO(2) on the intensity of larval feeding, which dropped by >60%. Incubation also showed that pCO(2)-driven ocean acidification (OA) may radically impact the selectivity of ingested food by C. concholepas larvae. Results also showed that larvae switched their clearance rate based on large cells, such as diatoms and dinoflagellates to tiny and highly abundant nanoflagellates and cyanobacteria as pCO(2) levels increased. Thus, this study reveals the important effect of low pH conditions on larval feeding behavior, in terms of both ingestion magnitude and selectivity. These findings support the notion that larval feeding is a key physiological process susceptible to the effects of OA.

AB It is generally recognized that addressing the ongoing loss of global biodiversity requires a substantial increase in funding for conservation activities, particularly in developing countries. An increasing interest in Payment Mechanisms for Ecosystem Services (PES) begs the question of whether a focus on developing payment mechanisms will also reduce the ongoing loss of global biodiversity. We review, firstly, current flows of funds for biodiversity conservation, including PES and other market mechanisms, and secondly, the opportunities and constraints of PES to contribute to biodiversity protection globally. We argue that PES can and should make an important contribution, but that it will not be sufficient to rely on PES alone to finance the actions necessary to substantially reduce biodiversity loss. In response to the identified constraints, we believe there is a need to develop additional funding mechanisms specifically targeted at biodiversity conservation.

AB Although recent studies have revealed that the relationship between diversity and environmental heterogeneity is not always positive, as classical niche theory predicts, scientists have had difficulty interpreting these results from an ecological perspective. We propose a new concept-microfragmentation-to explain how small-scale heterogeneity can have neutral or even negative effect on species diversity. We define microfragmentation as a community level process of splitting habitat into a more heterogeneous environment that can have non-positive effects on the diversity through habitat loss and subsequent isolation. We provide support for the microfragmentation concept with results from spatially explicit heterogeneity-diversity model simulations, in which varying sets of species (with different ratios of specialist and generalist species) were modeled at different levels of configurational heterogeneity (meaning that only the habitat structure was changed, not its composition). Our results indicate that environmental heterogeneity can affect community diversity in the same way as fragmentation at the landscape level. Although generalist species might not be seriously affected by microfragmentation, the persistence of specialist species can be seriously disturbed by small-scale patchiness. The microfragmentation concept provides new insight into community level diversity dynamics and can influence conservation and management strategies.

AB The area covered by Eucalyptus plantations is significantly increasing in Brazil for economic reasons. However, the impact of such land use change is still unknown. In this study we evaluated the spatial-temporal distribution and abundance of terrestrial non-volant small mammals on a recently converted landscape whose matrix is formed by Eucalyptus plantations up to 3 years of age. From August 2007 to July 2009 we carried out monthly sampling campaigns over a grid of 30 sampling units, formed by pitfall traps covering both the landscape matrix of Eucalyptus plantations (n = 18) and legal conservation areas of native vegetation (n = 7) and abandoned pastures (n = 5). A total of 1640 individuals from 14 species of the orders Didelphimorphia (4 spp.) and Rodentia (10 spp.) were captured. However, only three species of rodents (Olygorysomys flavescens, Oligoryzomys nigripes and Calomy tener) represented 81.8% of the total amount. Eucalyptus plantations had a lower species richness and abundance than the abandoned pasture and the remaining fragments of native vegetation. Although the present species are predominantly generalists, there is clear distinction among environments in terms of their species composition and relative abundance, which also present a pronounced time variation. The assemblage found in this study suggests that silvicultural landscapes still have some conservation value, with species that seem to be resident at the Eucalyptus plantations. Moreover, the presence of the native and abandoned pastures patches imbibed in the Eucalyptus plantation matrix may increase the carrying capacity of such a silvicultural system and these landscapes may play a role in maintaining local biodiversity.

AB High solar radiation in the tropics is known to cause transient reduction in photosystem II (PSII) efficiency and CO2 assimilation in sun-exposed leaves, but little is known how these responses affect the actual growth performance of tropical plants. The present study addresses this question. Seedlings of five woody neotropical forest species were cultivated under full sunlight and shaded conditions. In full sunlight, strong photoinhibition of PSII at midday was documented for the late-successional tree species Ormosia macrocalyx and Tetragastris panamensis and the understory/forest gap species, Piper reticulatum. In leaves of O. macrocalyx, PSII inhibition was accompanied by substantial midday depression of net CO2 assimilation. Leaves of all species had increased pools of violaxanthin-cycle pigments. Other features of photoacclimation, such as increased Chl a/b ratio and contents of lutein, beta-carotene and tocopherol varied. High light caused strong increase of tocopherol in leaves of T. panamensis and another late-successional species, Virola surinamensis. O. macrocalyx had low contents of tocopherol and UV-absorbing substances. Under full sunlight, biomass accumulation was not reduced in seedlings of T. panamensis, P. reticulatum, and V. surinamensis, but O. macrocalyx exhibited substantial growth inhibition. In the highly shade-tolerant understory species Psychotria marginata, full sunlight caused strongly reduced growth of most individuals. However, some plants showed relatively high growth rates under full sun approaching those of seedlings at 40 % ambient irradiance. It is concluded that shade-tolerant tropical tree seedlings can achieve efficient photoacclimation and high growth rates in full sunlight.

AB Tree growth response across environmental gradients is fundamental to understanding species distributional ecology and forest ecosystem ecology and to predict future ecosystem services. Cross-sectional patterns of ecosystem properties with respect to climatic gradients are often used to predict ecosystem responses to global change. Across sites in the tropics, primary productivity increases with temperature, suggesting that forest ecosystems will become more productive as temperature rises. However, this trend is confounded with a shift in species composition and so may not reflect the response of in situ forests to warming. In this study, we simultaneously studied tree diameter growth across the altitudinal ranges of species within a single genus across a geographically compact temperature gradient, to separate the direct effect of temperature on tree growth from that of species compositional turnover. Using a Bayesian state space modeling framework we combined data from repeated diameter censuses and dendrometer measurements from across a 1700-m altitudinal gradient collected over six years on over 2400 trees in Weinmannia, a dominant and widespread genus of cloud forest trees in the Andes. Within species, growth showed no consistent trend with altitude, but higher-elevation species had lower growth rates than lower-elevation species, suggesting that species turnover is largely responsible for the positive correlation between productivity and temperature in tropical forests. Our results may indicate a significant difference in how low-and high-latitude forests will respond to climate change, since temperate and boreal tree species are consistently observed to have a positive relationship between growth and temperature. If our results hold for other tropical species, a positive response in ecosystem productivity to increasing temperatures in the Andes will depend on the altitudinal migration of tree species. The rapid pace of climate change, and slow observed rates of migration, suggest a slow, or even initially negative response of ecosystem productivity to warming. Finally, this study shows how the observed scale of biological organization can affect conclusions drawn from studies of ecological phenomena across environmental gradients, and calls into question the common practice in tropical ecology of lumping species at higher taxonomic levels.

AB Phenological variations in tropical forests are usually explained by climate. Nevertheless, considering that soil water availability and nutrient content also influence plant water status and metabolism, soil conditions may also be important in the regulation of plant reproductive and vegetative activities over time. We investigated whether phenological patterns and stem growth differ in trees growing in two types of soil that display contrasting water and nutrient availability, namely, Gleysol (moist and nutrient-poor) and Cambisol (drier and nutrient-rich).
   Phenological observations (flushing, leaf fall, flowering and fruiting) and stem diameter growth were recorded for 120 trees fitted with fixed dendrometer bands, at 15 days intervals, for 1 year. Two species of contrasting deciduousness were investigated: Senna multijuga (semi-deciduous) and Citharexylum myrianthum (deciduous).
   Both species were seasonal in all phenophases, regardless of soil type. However, frequency, mean date and intensity of phenophases varied according to soil type. Girth increment of C. myrianthum was four times greater in Cambisol than in Gleysol, whereas the type of soil had no significant effect on that of S. multijuga.
   These results show that soil characteristics also play an important role in determining phenological patterns and growth and must be considered when analysing phenological patterns in tropical forests.

AB Community structure depends on both deterministic and stochastic processes. However, patterns of community dissimilarity (e.g. difference in species composition) are difficult to interpret in terms of the relative roles of these processes. Local communities can be more dissimilar (divergence) than, less dissimilar (convergence) than, or as dissimilar as a hypothetical control based on either null or neutral models. However, several mechanisms may result in the same pattern, or act concurrently to generate a pattern, and much research has recently been focusing on unravelling these mechanisms and their relative contributions. Using a simulation approach, we addressed the effect of a complex but realistic spatial structure in the distribution of the niche axis and we analysed patterns of species co-occurrence and beta diversity as measured by dissimilarity indices (e.g. Jaccard index) using either expectations under a null model or neutral dynamics (i.e., based on switching off the niche effect). The strength of niche processes, dispersal, and environmental noise strongly interacted so that niche-driven dynamics may result in local communities that either diverge or converge depending on the combination of these factors. Thus, a fundamental result is that, in real systems, interacting processes of community assembly can be disentangled only by measuring traits such as niche breadth and dispersal. The ability to detect the signal of the niche was also dependent on the spatial resolution of the sampling strategy, which must account for the multiple scale spatial patterns in the niche axis. Notably, some of the patterns we observed correspond to patterns of community dissimilarities previously observed in the field and suggest mechanistic explanations for them or the data required to solve them. Our framework offers a synthesis of the patterns of community dissimilarity produced by the interaction of deterministic and stochastic determinants of community assembly in a spatially explicit and complex context.

AB Savannas commonly consist of a discontinuous cover of overstory trees and a groundcover of grasses. Savanna models have previously demonstrated that vegetation feedbacks on fire frequency can limit the density of overstory trees, thereby maintaining savannas. Positive feedbacks of either savanna trees alone or trees and grasses together on fire frequency have been shown to result in a stable savanna equilibrium. Grass feedbacks on fire frequency, in contrast, have resulted in stable equilibria in either a grassland or forest state, but not in a savanna. These results, however, were derived from a system of differential equations that assumes that fire occurrence is strictly deterministic and that vegetation losses due to fire are continuous in time. We develop an alternative formulation of the grass-fire feedback model that assumes that fires are discrete and occur stochastically in time to examine the influence of these assumptions on the predicted state of the system. We show that incorporating fire as a discrete event can produce a recurring temporal refuge in which both grass and trees co-occur in a stable, bounded savanna. In our model, tree abundance is limited without invoking demographic bottlenecks in the transition from fire-sensitive to fire-resistant life history stages. An increasing strength of grass feedback on fire results in regular, predictable fires, which suggests that the system can also be modeled using a set of difference equations. We implement this discrete system using modified Leslie/Gower difference equations and demonstrate the existence of a bounded savanna state in this model framework. Our results confirm the potential for grass feedbacks to result in stable savannas, and indicate the importance of modeling fire as a discrete event rather than as a loss rate that is continuous in time.

AB The invasion success of introduced plants is frequently explained as a result of competitive interactions with native flora. Although previous theory and experiments have shown that plants are largely equivalent in their competitive effects on each other, competitive nonequivalence is hypothesized to occur in interactions between native and invasive species. Small overlap in resource use with unrelated native species, improved competitiveness, and production of novel allelochemicals are all believed to contribute to the invasiveness of introduced species. I tested all three assumptions in a common-garden experiment by examining the effect of plant origin and relatedness on competition intensity. Competitive interactions were explored within 12 triplets, each consisting of an invasive species, a native congeneric (or confamilial) species, and a native heterogeneric species that are likely to interact in the field. Plants were grown in pots alone or in pairs and in the absence or the presence of activated carbon to control for allelopathy. I found that competition intensity was not influenced by the relatedness or origin of competing neighbors. Although some exotic species may benefit from size advantages and species-specific effects in competitive interactions, none of the three mechanisms investigated is likely to be a principal driver of their invasiveness.

AB Ants due to their nesting habits are ideal for studying temporal fluctuations in trace metal accumulation changes in morphological traits as well as for assessing evolutionary processes and monitoring environmental Impact of metals derived from human activities Although metal pollution may affect basic ecological traits such as colony size and survival ants can be considered relatively resistant to metal pollution at least partly due to relatively high metal regulation efficiency At both polluted and unpolluted areas the body metal levels in ants vary considerably between species This observation and other experimental data suggest differences in metal regulation physiology however the physiological basis of these differences remains unknown It was shown that metal pollution may suppress the Immune defense systems which in turn could theoretically lead to a higher risk of infections Biodiversity studies are limited however the evidence for a clear negative influence of metal pollution on ant species diversity and abundance was not yet provided Since many aspects of ant ecotoxicology remain unclear the questions for possible future research are suggested (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS All rights reserved

AB The Dudhwa landscape, a priority conservation area representing Terai ecosystem (woodland-grassland-wetland complex) has witnessed a sea change in past 150 years or so on account of long history of forest management, changes in land use, and rapid economic development. We assessed fragmentation in two constituent protected areas (Dudhwa National Park-DNP and Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary-KAT) of the landscape due to forest management activities (clear cutting, development of rail and road network, and plantations) and compared the magnitude among them using select metrics at the forest class level. We applied FRAGSTATS spatial pattern analysis software (ver.3.3) on different forest classes deciphered by land use/cover maps generated using IRS P6 LISS IV digital data. Study amply revealed that the forests in DNP are less fragmented and of better habitat quality than forests of KAT. The set of seven metrics (patch density, mean patch size, edge density, mean shape index, mean core area, mean nearest neighbour, and interspersion and juxtaposition index) at the class level quantified in the present study are simple and proved useful for quantifying complex spatial processes and can be used as an effective means of monitoring in Dudhwa landscape.

AB The demographic impacts of harvesting nontimber forest products (NTFP) have been increasingly studied because of reports of potentially unsustainable harvest. Nevertheless, our understanding of how plant demographic response to harvest is altered by variation in ecological conditions, which is critical for developing realistic sustainable-use plans, is limited. We built matrix population models to test whether and how variation in ecological conditions affects population responses to harvest. In particular, we examined the effect of bark and foliage harvest on the demography of populations of African mahogany (Khaya senegalensis) in two contrasting ecological regions of Benin, West Africa. K. senegalensis bark and foliage harvest significantly reduced its stochastic population growth rates, but ecological differences between regions had a greater effect on population growth rates than did harvest. The effect of harvest on population growth rates (Delta lambda) was slightly stronger in the moist than in the drier region. Life-table response experiments revealed that the mechanism by which harvesting reduced. differed between ecological regions. Lowered stasis (persistence) of larger life stages lead to a reduction in. in the drier region, whereas lowered growth of all life stages lowered. in moist region. Potential strategies to increase population growth rates should include decreasing the proportion of individuals harvested, promoting harvester-owned plantations of African mahogany, and increasing survival and growth by promoting no-fire zones in gallery forests. Our results show how population responses to harvest of NTFP may be altered by ecological differences across sites and emphasize the importance of monitoring populations over the climatic range in which they occur to develop more realistic recommendations for conservation.

AB We present five Brachystegia spiciformis Benth. (BrSp) tree-ring chronologies from the seasonally dry miombo woodland in south central Africa. Between 9 and 34 stem discs were collected from three dry and two wet miombo sites. All samples showed distinct growth rings, which were marked by terminal parenchyma bands. Site chronologies varied in length between 43 and 149 years. An increase in the number of growth ring anomalies in older trees, however, resulted in an increase in dating error and a decrease in between-tree correlations with increase in the chronology length. Annual precipitation variability accounted for some 28% of the common variance in the BrSp chronologies and we found no difference in climate sensitivity between wet and dry miombo sites. The influence of climate, and of precipitation in particular, on tree growth was strongest at the core of the rainy season (December February). This is also the time of the year when ENSO peaks in amplitude and ENSO effects on precipitation variability in southern Africa are the strongest. We found a negative response of tree growth to ENSO throughout most of the growth year, suggesting that the development of longer chronologies from the miombo region would allow for the investigation of temporal ENSO variability. A spatial extension of the miombo tree-ring network should therefore focus on regions where ENSO effects are the strongest (e.g., southeastern Africa). (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI Evaluating relationships among tree growth rate, shade tolerance, and

AB Interspecific differences in shade tolerance among woody species are considered a primary driving force underlying forest succession. However, variation in shade tolerance may be only one of many interspecific differences that cause species turnover. For example, tree species may differ in their sensitivity to herbivory. Nonetheless, existing conceptual models of forest dynamics rarely explicitly consider the impact of herbivores. We examined whether browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) alters the relationship between light availability and plant performance. We monitored growth and survival for seedlings of six woody species over 2 years within six windthrow gaps and the nearby intact forest in the presence and absence of deer. Browsing decreased seedling growth for all species except beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.). More importantly, browsing altered growth rankings among species. Increased light availability enhanced growth for three species when excluded from deer, but browsing obscured these relationships. Browsing also reduced survival for three species; however, survival rankings did not significantly differ between herbivory treatments. Our results indicated that browsing and light availability operated simultaneously to influence plant growth within these forests. Thus, existing models of forest dynamics may make inaccurate predictions of the timing and composition of species reaching the canopy, unless they can account for how plant performance varies as a result of a variety of environmental factors, including herbivory.

AB The body temperature of ectotherms is influenced by the interaction of abiotic conditions, morphology, and behavior. Although organisms living in different thermal habitats may exhibit morphological plasticity or move from unfavorable locations, there are few examples of animals adjusting their thermal properties in response to short-term changes in local conditions. Here, we show that the intertidal sea star Pisaster ochraceus modulates its thermal inertia in response to prior thermal exposure. After exposure to high body temperature at low tide, sea stars increase the amount of colder-than-air fluid in their coelomic cavity when submerged during high tide, resulting in a lower body temperature during the subsequent low tide. Moreover, this buffering capacity is more effective when seawater is cold during the previous high tide. This ability to modify the volume of coelomic fluid provides sea stars with a novel thermoregulatory "backup" when faced with prolonged exposure to elevated aerial temperatures.

AB Growth-survival trade-offs play an important role in niche differentiation of tropical tree species in relation to light-gradient partitioning. However, the mechanisms that determine differential species performance in response to light and soil resource availability are poorly understood. To examine responses to light and soil nutrient availability, we grew seedlings of five tropical tree species for 12 mo at < 2 and 18 percent full sunlight and in two soil types representing natural contrasts in nutrient availability within a lowland dipterocarp forest in North Borneo. We chose two specialists of nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils, respectively, and one habitat generalist. Across all species, growth was higher in high than low light and on more nutrient rich soil. Although species differed in growth rates, the ranking of species, in terms of growth, was consistent across the four treatments. Nutrient-rich soils improved seedling survival and increased growth of three species even under low light. Slower-growing species increased root allocation and reduced specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) in response to decreased nutrient supply. All species increased LAR in response to low light. Maximum growth rates were negatively correlated with survival in the most resource-limited environment. Nutrient-poor soil specialists had low maximum growth rates but high survival at low resource availability. Specialists of nutrient-rich soils, plus the habitat generalist, had the opposite suite of traits. Fitness component trade-offs may be driven by both light and belowground resource availability. These trade-offs contribute to differentiation of tropical tree species among habitats defined by edaphic variation.

AB The ecosystem service concept has been proposed as a meaningful framework for natural resource management. In theory it holds concomitant benefit and consequence for the forest product sector. However, numerous barriers impede practitioners from developing concrete and enduring responses to emerging ecosystem service markets, policies, and initiatives. Principle among these barriers is that the ecosystem service concept has a complex history, numerous definitions in use, and an astounding diversity in rationale and application. This article provides a conceptual review of ecosystem services and its economic foundations, distinguishes among several current definitions of the term and their relatedness to strategies in practical application, discusses diverse approaches to valuation, and explores potential for future relevance in forest product and other sectors.

AB The New Zealand wrens (Acanthisittidae) are basal in passerine birds and in New Caledonia, the closest country to New Zealand, Amborella is basal in angiosperms. A review of molecular studies indicates that 29 other locally or regionally endemic clades around the Tasman and Coral Sea basins have cosmopolitan or globally widespread sister groups. Other areas that have local endemics basal to diverse global groups include Borneo, Madagascar/South Africa/Tanzania, southern China-Taiwan-Japan, and different parts of Latin America, especially the Guayana Plateau and western Mexico. Basal clades are widely interpreted as ancestral and their location is generally taken to represent a centre of origin for the group as a whole. In the present study, basal groups are treated simply as small (less speciose) sister groups. The Tasman and western Mexico/Caribbean regions have important biogeographic and tectonic ties with each other and with the central Pacific. Large igneous provinces (Ontong Java, Hikurangi-Manihiki, and Gorgona Plateaus) formed in the central Pacific in the Cretaceous. Fossil wood is found on the Ontong Java Plateau, and formerly emergent seamounts up to 24 km across occur on Hikurangi Plateau. Many terranes in New Zealand, New Caledonia, New Guinea and western America represent former island arcs (or their products) that formed in the central Pacific and later accreted to the Pacific margins. Long-term survival of taxa as metapopulations on the ephemeral volcanic islands and atolls of plate margins and fissures may explain the biogeographical connections among the Tasman region, the central Pacific, and the accreted terranes of western America. Branching sequences in cladograms and phylogenetic trees have been interpreted as dispersal events, but instead probably indicate the sequence of differentiation in an already widespread ancestor. Major disjunctions of tens of thousands of kilometres often occur between taxa at consecutive nodes on a tree and dispersal by physical movement is unlikely. The break between the globally basal centres and the rest of the world marks the initial site of differentiation of a widespread ancestor, with subsequent or more or less simultaneous differentiation occurring in other areas. Differentiation of the modern angiosperms, passerines and other groups first took place around the Tasman region, or at least the terranes now accumulated there, and then around other centres, especially Madagascar-South Africa and Mexico-north-west South America. Angiosperms are now recognized as basal to extant gymnosperms and major tectonic dynamism around the globally basal centres during the Mesozoic, involving terrane accretion, orogeny, and rifting could have been involved with the last important modernization of angiosperms, birds and other groups.

AB Tropical savannas and rainforests contrast in their flammability and the fire resilience of their associated species. While savanna species generally exhibit high resilience to burning, there is much debate about the fire resilience of forest-associated species, and the persistence of forest patches in a flammable savanna matrix. Where fire has been excluded, savanna tends on a trajectory towards forest, with an increase in forest-associated plants and animal species. This study tested the idea that given the high proportion of forest-associated taxa in long-unburnt savanna, the fauna of these areas would be expected to exhibit less resilience to fire than the fauna in frequently burnt savannas. The study investigated the immediate and short-term effects on ant assemblages of re-introducing fire into long-unburnt savanna in northern Australia. The ant fauna exhibited high resistance to fires, with no significant short-term change in mean abundance or species richness; instead, seasonality had a far stronger influence on overall ant activity. Fire caused dramatic declines in dominance of the patchily distributed forest-associated species Oecophylla smaragdina and Papyrius sp., but had no effect on overall dominance by open savanna species of Iridomyrmex. Dominance by Iridomyrmex pallidus declined, but this was compensated for by increases in I. reburrus while two other species of Iridomyrmex showed no change. This indicates a high level of functional redundancy among dominant species of Iridomyrmex, which universally dominate open savanna communities, but not of dominant forest-associated species. Overall, our findings demonstrate a high degree of fire-resilience of the long-unburnt savanna ant fauna. Despite the occurrence of forest-associated species, the high proportion of savanna species persisting in this habitat means that long-unburnt savanna retains the general response characteristics of frequently burnt savanna.

AB The effects of habitat loss and fragmentation in tropical forests are difficult to separate, as they usually occur concurrently. In the state park La Sierra, in Tabasco, Mexico, the rainforest is being cleared for pasture, and fragments are being used by local inhabitants. This study examined the response of bird feeding guilds to habitat characteristics, including human disturbance, in five fragments of different sizes (1 similar to 4,500 ha, 2 similar to 150 ha, and 2 similar to 80 ha). Using point count observations, 125 species were recorded and were grouped into 11 feeding guilds. As expected, the largest fragment had higher species richness and abundances than the smaller fragments. However, five habitat features differed significantly among fragment sizes, including tree density, the number of tree stumps and the number of trails. Thus the larger fragment was also less disturbed. Fragment size alone was significant only for scavenger species richness, and for the abundance of bark gleaning insectivores and insectivore/nectarivores. Raptors were more diverse and abundant in the large fragment and less disturbed sites. Arboreal frugivores and bark or foliage gleaning insectivores, depended on higher trees and less disturbed sites. A better understanding of the mechanisms that affect persistence is essential for the planning of conservation actions.

AB Plasticity in hydraulic architecture of five dominant Atlantic forest species differing in light requirements and growth rates was evaluated in saplings grown at different irradiances to determine if hydraulic architecture changes in coordination with photosynthetic capacity. Saplings were grown in shade-houses at 10, 30, 45 and 65% of full solar irradiance for 4 months. In four of the five species, maximum relative growth rates were observed at intermediate irradiances (30 and 40% of full sun). Slow-growing species had lower maximum electron transport rates (ETRmax) than fast-growing species. A positive correlation between ETRmax and maximum leaf hydraulic conductivity (K-L) was found across species, suggesting that species-specific stem hydraulic capacity and photosynthetic capacity were linked. Species with relatively high growth rates, such as Cedrela fissilis Vell., Patagonula americana L. and Cordia trichotoma (Vell.) Arrab. Ex Stend, exhibited increased KL and specific hydraulic conductivity (K-s) with increased growth irradiance. In contrast, K-S and K-L did not vary with irradiance in the slower-growing and more shade-tolerant species Balfourodendron riedelianum (Engl.) Engl. and Lonchocarpus leucanthus Burkart, despite a relatively large irradiance-induced variation in ETRmax. A correlation between K-s and ETRmax was observed in fast-growing species in different light regimes, suggesting that they are capable of plastic changes in hydraulic architecture and increased water-transport efficiency in response to changes in light availability resulting from the creation of canopy gaps, which makes them more competitive in gaps and open habitats.

AB It has been suggested that the anthropogenically driven loss of herbivorous mammals might lead to changes in the recruitment patterns of tropical rain forest plants, but few studies have examined the explicit mechanisms that might account for this effect. Here we propose a conceptual model linking differential mammalian defaunation and differential plant recruitment. We posit that in the absence of medium/large herbivores but with small rodent granivores still present (i.e. differential defaunation), predation pressure will be greater on small-seeded species than on large-seeded species. We tested such differential predation hypothesis (DPH) by means of a series of experiments directed to assess: 1) seed consumption by small rodents in laboratory cages; 2) seed-removal rates in small rodent enclosures in the field and 3) removal of seeds placed on the forest floor and exposed to either the full complement of mammals or only small rodents. Seeds used in the experiments were arranged in pairs consisting of species from the same taxonomic family but with a contrasting size (large, small). We found: 1) a significantly greater consumption of smaller seeds (a 2.3- to 20.5-fold difference) in cages and 2) a significantly greater removal of small-seeded species (a 3.7- to 65-fold difference) in field enclosures. Results of seed removal experiments in free-access plots and selective exclosures were more complex, with a general absence of significant differences among treatments but we found that predation was in general concentrated on smallseeded species and small rodents were the predominant visitors to the plots. This, together with the overall short distance of dispersal among large seeds suggest that in differentially defaunated forests large-seeded species are more likely to escape predation. We posit that such size related differential predation may lead to the floristic impoverishment observed in some defaunated forests.

AB Intertidal seawalls support different assemblages and fewer species than do natural habitats. One explanation for these patterns may be the lack of some microhabitats on seawalls. Preliminary observations suggested that some features of sandstone seawalls, such as the presence of crevices among blocks, may provide chitons with an important habitat. To test the hypothesis that numbers of the chiton, Sypharochiton pelliserpentis, would be greater in crevices than on exposed surfaces of seawalls, sampling was done on sandstone seawalls in Sydney Harbour. S. pelliserpentis were more abundant in crevices among blocks than on exposed surfaces. Experimental manipulations transplanting chitons to exposed surfaces showed that they were found in greater numbers in crevices where those were available than on exposed surfaces. Chitons transplanted to blocks where crevices had been filled tended to move to non-filled crevices on other blocks. The design of seawalls could easily be improved to offer a better habitat for survival and maintenance of species such as chitons by incorporating crevices and similar features. In an increasingly urbanized world, understanding how to improve the value as habitat of man-made structures will be essential for conserving biodiversity. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Tropical birds may differ from temperate birds in their sensitivity to forest edges. We provide predictions about the proportions of tropical and temperate species that should avoid or exploit edges, and relationships between natural-history characters and edge responses. We conducted exploratory meta-analyses from 11 studies using 287 records of 220 neotropical and temperate species' responses to edges to address our predictions. A higher proportion of neotropical species were edge-avoiders compared with temperate species and a higher proportion of temperate species were edge-exploiters compared with neotropical species. Edge-avoiding responses were positively associated with being an insectivore for neotropical birds, and with being of small body mass and a latitudinal migrant for temperate birds. Temperate edge-exploiters were less likely to be insectivores and migrants than temperate birds that were not edge-exploiters. A greater proportion of neotropical birds than temperate birds may be at risk from forest fragmentation if edge-avoidance is a reasonable indicator of an inability to adapt to land-cover change. Future progress in our understanding of forest bird responses to edges is dependent upon greater standardization of methods and designing studies in the context of recent theoretical developments.

AB Red wood ants (Formica rufa group, RWAs) are common insects in boreal forests in Fennoscandia, and they build large, long-lived mounds as their nests. RWA mounds are enriched with carbon and nutrients, but little information is available about how they affect root distribution and the nutrient uptake of trees. In this study, we investigated the biomass, biomass density, nutrient concentrations, and amounts of fine (< 2 mm) and coarse (> 2 mm) roots in RWA mounds, and compared them with those of surrounding forest soil in mixed coniferous stands of different age classes in Finland. Neither fine nor coarse root biomasses differed significantly between the aboveground parts of the mounds and the organic layer of the soil. Root biomass density was lower in mounds than in the organic layer. However, fine root biomass and biomass density were higher in the below-ground parts of mounds than in the surrounding mineral soil. Macroelement (N, Ca, K, P, S, Mg) and Zn and Cu concentrations in roots in the mounds were significantly higher than those in the organic layer. Root biomass and biomass density did not differ between stands of different age classes. The results of this study indicate that RWA mounds increase heterogeneity in root distribution in forest ecosystems, and also increase the availability of nutrients for plants that extend their roots inside RWA mounds.

AB Natural seed deposition patterns and their effects on post-dispersal seed fate are critical in tropical tree recruitment. Previous research showed that the key dispersal agent of the neotropical tree, Virola calophylla, is the spider monkey (Ateles paniscus). Spider monkeys generate a heterogeneous seed deposition pattern because they scatter-disperse seeds diurnally, whereas they clump-disperse seeds at their sleeping sites. The recruitment consequences of this pattern were investigated using manipulative experiments and observations. Scatter-hoarding by spiny rats (Proechimys spp.) caused little rearrangement of the initial seed deposition pattern because they moved seeds only short distances. Seed survival to the seedling stage depended negatively on conspecific seed density and positively on the distance from the nearest adult V. calophylla female. These effects were likely mediated by two important seed predators, spiny rats and beetles (Scolytidae). Furthermore, spider monkeys' seed deposition patterns influenced seed survival. Scatter-dispersed and experimentally dispersed seeds had the highest survival. Conversely, clump-dispersed seeds at sleeping sites, which are far from V. calophylla females, and non-dispersed seeds had equally low survival, suggesting that conspecific density- and distance-dependence acted independently and did not explain all variation in seed survival. Instead, other characteristics of the seed deposition pattern, such as the multi-specific assemblage of seeds at: sleeping sites, also affected post-dispersal seed fates.

AB 1. Management recommendations intended to reduce rangeland degradation and increase livestock productivity often assume equilibrium conditions wherein vegetation and herbivore dynamics are tightly coupled. Recent research in Africa, Asia and North America, however, suggests that the dynamics of some arid systems are driven more by precipitation, a non-equilibrium factor. We examined the applicability of equilibrium and non-equilibrium theory for key grazing resources within an Andean pastoral ecosystem.
   2. Residents of Cosapa, Bolivia, recently fenced off portions of critical communal grazing areas called bofedal (wet meadow) and gramadal (dry meadow) as part of a livestock development project. Fenced exclosures were used to implement seasonally deferred grazing practices. We evaluated the effects of deferred grazing on peak standing crop (SC), above-ground net primary production (ANPP) and plant species composition and diversity over a 4-month growing season across 10 locations. Effects of exclosure access on the productivity of alpaca Llama pacos, llama L. glama and sheep Ovis aries were assessed through interviews with 32 herd owners.
   3. One to three years of deferred grazing had no effect on SC or ANPP from bofedal or gramadal, but it did reduce plant species diversity for bofedal. Access to exclosures improved survival rates of young alpaca and birth rates for sheep. Llamas were typically denied access to exclosures, which negatively affected their productivity.
   4. Our results suggest that both non-equilibrium and equilibrium forces operate on bofedal. Stable and low rates of ANPP are largely shaped by the cold climate, a non-equilibrium factor. Changes in plant species composition and livestock productivity, however, support equilibrium theory.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Ecological models of rangeland dynamics often play a critical role in determining the direction of range management and pastoral development. On bofedal, we found that vegetation and herbivore dynamics are coupled to a large extent, consistent with predictions that equilibrium behaviour can occur for critical, mesic subsystems nested within arid landscapes. Seasonal grazing deferral on bofedal can thus yield benefits to livestock productivity. However, these benefits must be weighed against negative social consequences that can occur when communal resources are privatized.

AB Aim This study aims to evaluate the relative importance of birds, small mammals, and ants as seed predators at a semi-arid site in northern Chile.
   Location Northern Chile, in Parque Nacional Bosque Fray Jorge (30degrees41' N, 71degrees40' W, c. 80 m elevation).
   Methods We studied the relative abilities of birds, small mammals, and ants to find and remove millet seeds either singly (i.e. background seed removal) or in bulk. Single seeds were set in shallow depressions in Plexiglas trays which were established in long and arbitrary transects, and were available either to birds (diurnally) or small mammals (nocturnally) or were covered by hardware cloth and therefore available only to ants. Bulk removal was evaluated with seeds in Petri dishes that also were established in long and arbitrary transects, and trays were either open diurnally (birds) or nocturnally (small mammals); a third set of trays was covered with hardware cloth cages to excluded vertebrates, and ants were given access to Petri dishes with twigs that were arranged across the edge of the dishes. All experiments lasted four days and nights, and trays and dishes were checked and replenished as needed in the morning and evening. In the former study vertebrate consumption was determined as the mean number of seeds removed from trays (within a given transect) minus the number removed from ant-only trays. Because ants were rarely seen in vertebrate access Petri dishes, however, we did not correct consumption there. Treatments were compared using repeated measures mixed model analysis of variance. In addition to evaluating patterns within this community, we compared our results against those obtained in similar studies in various arid regions.
   Results Diurnal seed consumption was significantly greater than nocturnal seed consumption, which in turn was significantly greater than consumption by ants. Diurnal consumption was highly seasonal, evidently corresponding to the seasonal arrival and departure of migratory birds. In general, South American sites exhibit much lower levels of seed predation than sites in the northern hemisphere, but removal at our site appears to be much greater and more strongly avian-dominated than at other sites in South America. Our results are consistent with predictions based on a hypothesis relating precipitation to seed predictability.
   Main conclusions Both birds and small mammals were much more important seed consumers at our site than elsewhere in South America, whereas ants have been relatively unimportant at all South American sites studied to date. Although the dominant seed consumers differ across sites, overall levels of seed removal appear similar in South America and Australia, and substantially lower than reported from sites in the northern hemisphere and Africa.

AB Stems of 4348 lianas from 12 subsampled 1 ha plots in Yasuni, Ecuador represented more than 311 species of climbing woody plants. The plots (each 0.2 ha in area), which individually included up to 106 species among 314 stems, were established in the Huaorani Ethnic Reserve and Yasuni National Park and represent terra firme and floodplain habitats. Yasuni is one of the richest areas sampled for liana diversity in the neotropics. A relatively small group of species (similar to38) comprise the dominants in this forest, as defined by species contributing consistently to 50% of all stems to samples from either habitat. Distance-related diversity (i.e., beta) is low across both spatially adjacent and distant plots. Floodplain habitats show a slightly higher decay of similarity with distance than either terra firme habitats or cross-habitat comparisons. Cross-habitat comparisons are significantly less similar than same-habitat comparisons at all distances. Habitat-related beta diversity probably contributes to total richness in Yasuni although abundant liana species in Yasuni rarely show absolute restriction to one habitat or the other. A comparison of these data to other sampled sites in the neotropics highlights the problems inherent in comparisons among areas sampled by different methods. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The number of ant species from the old-growth native forests, second-growth native forests and conifer plantations was 10-20, 15-20 and 11-15, respectively. The overall ant species richness had not been affected by forest conversion. However, correspondence analysis (CA) showed that the ant species composition was markedly different between old-growth forests and converted forests (second-growth forests and conifer plantations). The species richness of woodland specialists was greater in the old-growth forests, and open-habitat specialists and habitat generalists dominated the converted forests. The impacts of forestry on ant assemblages were of a long duration. Ant assemblages of the second-growth forests under regeneration for 40-70 years after logging were still distinct from those of old-growth forests. Careful management of second-growth forests bordering old-growth remnants would be essential to prevent the invasion of open-habitat species of ants into the interior of old-growth forests.

AB The pollination biology of Aechmea pectinata (Bromeliaceae) was studied in a submontane rainforest in southeastern Brazil. This species has a mainly clumped distribution and its aggregated individuals are likely to be clones. From October to January, during the flowering period, the distal third of its leaves becomes red. The inflorescence produces 1-15 flowers per day over a period of 20-25 d. The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-white coloured, tubular shaped with a narrow opening, and the stigma is situated just above the anthers. Anthesis begins at 0400 h and flowers last for about 13 h. The highest nectar volume and sugar concentration occur between 0600 and 1000 h, and decrease throughout the day. Aechmea pectinata is self-incompatible and therefore pollinator-dependent. Hummingbirds are its main pollinators (about 90 % of the visits), visiting flowers mainly in the morning. There is a positive correlation between the number of hummingbird visits per inflorescence and the production of nectar, suggesting that the availability of this resource is important in attracting and maintaining visitors. The arrangement of the floral structures favours; pollen deposition on the bill of the hummingbirds. Flowers in clumps promote hummingbird territoriality, and a consequence is self-pollination in a broader sense (geitonogamy) as individuals in assemblages are genetically close. However, trap-lining and intruding hummingbirds promote cross-pollination. These observations suggest that successful fruit set of A. pectinata depends on both the spatial distribution of its individuals and the interactions among hummingbirds.

AB Reproductive phenology of 171 plant species belonging to 57 families of angiosperms was studied according to life-forms in four habitat types in a savanna-forest mosaic on the Venezuelan Central Plain. Flowering, unripe fruit, and mature fruit patterns were affected significantly according to life-forms and habitats respectively. Production of flowers, unripe fruits, and mature fruits showed marked seasonality for all habitats except for the forest. Flowering peaked during the rainy season, and fruiting peaked toward the end of the rainy season. The savanna and the disturbed area had similar proportions of species that flowered over the year. The percentage of species with unripe fruits produced throughout the year was more seasonal for the disturbed area than for the other habitats. Mature fruit patterns showed an increase during the late rainy season for the ecotone and savanna. A large number of herbaceous (annual and perennial) and liana species flowered during the wet season, and a smaller fraction flowered during the dry season; and trees, shrubs, and epiphytes increased flowering activity during the dry season. Unripe fruit patterns were similar to those of flowering for all life-forms, however, tree species were less seasonal. Mature fruit production by shrubs peaked in the period of maximum rainfall, while the peak for perennial herbs was in the late rainy season and the peak for annual herbs was during the transition between the rainy season and the dry season. The largest proportion of tree and liana species with ripe fruits occurred during the dry season. Differences among phenological patterns in habitats were caused mainly by life-forms and promote a wider distribution of reproductive events in habitats and overall community in the Venezuelan Central Plain.

AB Behavioural and demographic changes in animal populations resulting from exploitation are of conservation significance if they affect population growth rates. In this study, demography and behaviour of T9 larger mammals in conservation areas where legal and illegal hunting occurred were compared to that in a fully protected non-hunted area in western Tanzania. Results showed that there were few differences in species' demography between exploited and unexploited areas, but that, in general, mammals were more flighty outside protected areas and that these tended to be species that were more heavily exploited. Nevertheless, there were few differences in other behaviour patterns between the two areas. These findings question the supposition that behaviour and demography of mammals necessarily changes in areas of exploitation, and that population growth rates or monitoring strategies need be affected in anthropogenically disturbed habitats.

AB 1 The establishment probabilities, short-term survival, growth rates and biomass allocation patterns of seedlings in two large-seeded tree species, Carapa procera (Meliaceae) and Vouacapoua americana (Caesalpiniaceae), were studied in contrasting microhabitats at Paracou, French Guiana.
   2 Seeds (100 per habitat per species) were buried to simulate rodent caches into gap and understorey microhabitats (n = 20 of each) surrounding mature parent trees. The experiment was replicated in Cal apa procera (in early March and May) to investigate the effect of temporal variation in seed dispersal on the establishment process.
   3 Surviving seeds and sprouting seedlings were repeatedly censused during 2 years after establishment, and the causes of mortality determined. Growth and biomass parameters were calculated for surviving seedlings after 2.5 years.
   4 A greater proportion of seeds and germinating seedlings were dug up but less seedlings suffered from damping-off in C. procera than in V. americana. For both species, short-term survival of seedlings was lower in the understorey where predation by mammals and damping-off occured more frequently than in gaps,
   5 Damping off killed more Carapa procera n seedlings when buried in March than in May, whereas mammal predation caused more deaths in May planted seeds.
   6 Although survival and growth were enhanced in gaps for both species, seeds and seedlings were much more intolerant to the understorey microhabitat in Carapa procera (almost 100% mortality in shaded habitat) than in Vouacapoua americana.
   7 Seedling biomass allocation was consistent with previous data for large-seeded species but differed markedly between the two study species.

AB Hummingbird Bower mites consume nectar and pollen in the flowers they inhabit and are transported on hummingbirds. This study, conducted at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, measured the effects of the mite Proctolaelaps kirmsei (Gamasina: Ascidae) and of pollinating hummingbirds on nectar volume of Hamelia patens (Rubiaceae), by replicated exclusion experiments. The mites consume, on average, some 40 percent of the nectar produced by Bowes, when hummingbirds are excluded. Mites and hummingbirds together consume about 85 percent of the nectar. Individual trees in the study differed significantly and independently in both nectar production and mice population density. These results help establish hummingbird flower mites as significant plant parasites-especially considering their concomitant role as voracious consumes of pollen (Paciorek et al. 1995)-as well as important competitors with hummingbirds for the nectar of their host plants. Published estimates of nectar production races in mite host plants may be seriously in error, unless mites were excluded.

AB The fruits of Pistacia terebinthus, a circum-Mediterranean tree/shrub, are consumed by an array of bird species that differ in feeding methods and in relative frequencies of visits to plants. In this study I document interindividual variation in the proportion of fruits consumed by three types of frugivores: legitimate dispersers, pulp-consumers and seed predators. The results show that the relative frequencies of each kind of frugivore notably influence the final reproductive output (absolute number of viable seeds dispersed) and in fact prevail over the effects of pre-dispersal factors acting on plant fitness. Those relative frequencies are not associated with any of the plant traits related to fitness, such as fruit crop size and the number of viable seeds produced, suggesting that the type of avian frugivory exerts a negligible, if not null, selective pressure on such plant attributes. Plant specialization to attract the most effective seed dispersers seems to be precluded, given the small scale at which the high variation in seed dispersal success takes place.

AB Population dynamics and height growth of colonizing seedlings were monitored for three years in newly created artificial gaps and beneath intact canopy in primary lowland rain forest in Sabah, Malaysia. The effects of gap size, soil surface conditions and competition from advance regeneration were assessed. Recruitment during the first two years was less than 100 seedlings m-2, or less than 5% of the estimated seed bank in the top 5 cm of the soil prior to disturbance. Overall, germination was not obviously affected by gap size, but was increased markedly, by soil exposure or disturbance. The diversity of the colonizing vegetation at the end of two years appeared to be negatively related to gap size. Seedling mortality was less both at larger gap size and in the absence of competition from advance regeneration, whereas the opposite appeared true for seedling growth. The results indicate that gap size is unlikely to influence the composition of colonizing vegetation by controlling seed germination, but an effect operating through differential mortality cannot be discounted.

AB In agroforestry systems, shade trees strongly affect the physiology of the undergrown crop. However, a major paradigm is that the reduction in absorbed photosynthetically active radiation is, to a certain extent, compensated by an increase in light-use efficiency, thereby reducing the difference in net primary productivity between shaded and non-shaded plants. Due to the large spatial heterogeneity in agroforestry systems and the lack of appropriate tools, the combined effects of such variables have seldom been analysed, even though they may help understand physiological processes underlying yield dynamics.
   In this study, we monitored net primary productivity, during two years, on scales ranging from individual coffee plants to the entire plot. Absorbed radiation was mapped with a 3D model (MAESPA). Light-use efficiency and net assimilation rate were derived for each coffee plant individually. We found that although irradiance was reduced by 60% below crowns of shade trees, coffee light-use efficiency increased by 50%, leaving net primary productivity fairly stable across all shade levels.
   Variability of aboveground net primary productivity of coffee plants was caused primarily by the age of the plants and by intraspecific competition among them (drivers usually overlooked in the agroforestry literature) rather than by the presence of shade trees.

AB Land-use change is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, especially in the tropics where secondary and plantation forests are expanding while primary forest is declining. Understanding how well these disturbed habitats maintain biodiversity is therefore important-specifically how the maturity of secondary forest and the management intensity of plantation forest affect levels of biodiversity. Previous studies have shown that the biotas of different continents respond differently to land use. Any continental differences in the response could be due to differences in land-use intensity and maturity of secondary vegetation or to differences among species in their sensitivity to disturbances. We tested these hypotheses using an extensive dataset collated from published biodiversity comparisons within four tropical regions-Asia, Africa, Central America and South America-and a wide range of animal and plant taxa. We analysed responses to land use of several aspects of biodiversity-species richness, species composition and endemicity-allowing a more detailed comparison than in previous syntheses. Within each continent, assemblages from secondary vegetation of all successional stages retained species richness comparable to those in primary vegetation, but community composition was distinct, especially in younger secondary vegetation. Plantation forests, particularly the most intensively managed, supported a smaller-and very distinct-set of species from sites in primary vegetation. Responses to land use did vary significantly among continents, with the biggest difference in richness between plantation and primary forests in Asia. Responses of individual taxonomic groups did not differ strongly among continents, giving little indication that species were inherently more sensitive in Asia than elsewhere. We show that oil palm plantations support particularly low species richness, indicating that continental differences in the response of biodiversity to land use are perhaps more likely explained by Asia's high prevalence of oil palm plantations.

AB Soil respiration (Rs) is the second largest carbon flux in terrestrial ecosystems and therefore plays a crucial role in global carbon (C) cycling. This biogeochemical process is closely related to ecosystem productivity and soil fertility and is considered as a key indicator of soil health and quality reflecting the level of microbial activity. Wildfires can have a significant effect on Rs rates and the magnitude of the impacts will depend on environmental factors such as climate and vegetation, fire severity and meteorological conditions post-fire. In this research, we aimed to assess the impacts of a wildfire on the soil CO2 fluxes and soil respiration in a semi-arid ecosystem of Western Australia, and to understand the main edaphic and environmental drivers controlling these fluxes for different vegetation types. Our results demonstrated increased rates of Rs in the burnt areas compared to the unburnt control sites, although these differences were highly dependent on the type of vegetation cover and time since fire. The sensitivity of Rs to temperature (Q10) was also larger in the burnt site compared to the control. Both Rs and soil organic C were consistently higher under Eucalyptus trees, followed by Acacia shrubs. Triodia grasses had the lowest Rs rates and C contents, which were similar to those found under bare soil patches. Regardless of the site condition (unburnt or burnt), Rs was triggered during periods of higher temperatures and water availability and environmental factors (temperature and moisture) could explain a large fraction of Rs variability, improving the relationship of moisture or temperature as single factors with Rs. This study demonstrates the importance of assessing CO2 fluxes considering both abiotic factors and vegetation types after disturbances such as fire which is particularly important in heterogeneous semi-arid areas with patchy vegetation distribution where CO2 fluxes can be largely underestimated.

AB Analysis of plant-frugivore interactions provides a quantitative framework for integrating community structure and ecosystem function in terms of how the roles and attributes of individual species contribute to network structure and resilience. In this study, we used centrality metrics to rank and detect the most important species in a mutualistic network of fruit-eating birds and plants in a cloud forest in the Colombian Andes. We identified a central core of ten bird and seven plant species in a network of 135 species that perform dual roles as local hubs and connectors. The birds were mostly large forest frugivores, such as cracids, cotingas, and toucans, which consume fruits of all sizes. The plants were species of intermediate successional stages with small- to medium-sized seeds that persist in mature forest or forest borders (e.g., Miconia, Cecropia, Ficus). We found the resilience of our network depends on super-generalist species, because their elimination makes the network more prone to disassemble than random extinctions, potentially disrupting seed-dispersal processes. At our study site, extirpation of large frugivores has already been documented, and if this continues, the network might collapse despite its high diversity. Our results suggest that generalist species play critical roles in ecosystem function and should be incorporated into conservation and monitoring programs.
   Resumen Las interacciones planta-frugivoro proveen un marco de referencia cuantitativo para integrar la estructura de las comunidades con las funciones ecosistemicas, al identificar los roles y atributos de especies individuales y su contribucion a la estructura y resiliencia de la red. En este estudio, clasificamos las especies usando indices de centralidad para detectar las especies mas importantes en una red de interacciones mutualista compuesta por aves frugivoras y plantas en un bosque nublado de los andes de Colombia. Identificamos un grupo central de diez aves y siete plantas en una red de 135 especies, que realizan la doble funcion de actuar como nodos locales y conectores. Las aves fueron en su mayoria frugivoras grandes como cracidos, cotingas y tucanes que consumen frutos de todos los tamanos. Las plantas fueron especies de etapas intermedias de sucesion con semillas pequenas a medianas que persisten en bosques maduros o bordes (ej. Miconia, Cecropia, Ficus). Encontramos que la resiliencia de nuestra red depende de las especies super-generalistas, porque su eliminacion hace mas posible el colapso de la red que las extinciones aleatorias, irrumpiendo potencialmente los procesos de dispersion de semillas. En nuestro sitio de estudio ya se han documentado extinciones locales de grandes aves frugivoras, y si su perdida continua la red puede colapsar a pesar de ser altamente diversa. Nuestros resultados sugieren que las especies generalistas juegan roles importantes para el funcionamiento de los ecosistemas y deben ser incorporadas en programas de conservacion y monitoreo que prevengan la perdida de fauna y mantengan la conectividad del bosque a nivel del paisaje con un mosaico de estados sucesionales.

AB Assessing zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton is crucial to understand, model, and predict the structure and dynamics of pelagic communities. Our hypothesis is that phytoplankton consumption by zooplankton in freshwater lakes can be well represented by clustering phytoplankton species into morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) and zooplankton species into broad taxonomic units: cladocerans, calanoid copepods, and rotifers. We characterized zooplankton potential grazing on MBFG based on an extensive literature review of experimental data including clearance and ingestion rates. Rotifers show greater potential grazing upon small-and medium-sized species (MBFG I and IV) and presented a Type III trait-based functional response. Cladocerans also show greater potential impact upon MBFG IV but a Type II response. Both groups maintained their respective feeding response regardless of the type of food available, indicating poor food selectivity. Copepods consumed different MBFGs, but a clear Type II pattern was observed when feeding on MBFGs V and VI. Prediction intervals indicated a greater variability in cladocerans' and copepods' response. This approach is a step to summarize and characterize grazing to the future quantification of ecosystem models. Further efforts should be done to include information about different larval stages and phytoplankton traits not directly related to morphology.

AB Context Tropical forest regeneration is increasingly prominent as agro-pastoral lands are abandoned. Regeneration is characterised as favouring 'marginal' lands; however, observations of its drivers are often coarse or simple, leaving doubt as to spatial dynamics and causation.
   Objectives We quantified the spatial dynamics of forest regeneration relative to marginality and remnant forest cover in a 3000 km(2) pastoral region in northern tropical Australia.
   Methods Classification and regression trees related the extent and distribution of regeneration to soil agricultural potential, land-cover history, terrain slope, distance to primary forest, and primary forest fragment size, as defined by aerial photography.
   Results Secondary forest extent and distribution overwhelmingly reflect the proximity and size of primary forest fragments. Some 85 % of secondary forest area occurs < 1 km of primary forest, and 86 % of secondary forest patches >50 ha are < 400 m from primary forest and coincident with historic primary forest fragments. Where primary forest fragments are >8.5 ha, secondary forest area declines less rapidly with increasing distance from primary forest up to 1.5 km. Marginality inferred by soil potential and slope had no bearing on regeneration, except at the coarsest of spatial scales where regeneration is a proxy for primary forest cover.
   Conclusion Findings underline the need to conserve even modest rainforest patches as propagule reservoirs enabling regeneration. Marginality per se may have a limited role in regeneration. As most secondary forest was an extension of primary forest, its unique conservation value relative to that of primary forest may likewise merit reconsideration.

AB A key research frontier in global change research lies in understanding processes of land change to inform predictive models of future land states. We believe that significant advances in the field are hampered by limited attention being paid to critical points of change termed land-use regime shifts. We present an analytical framework for understanding land-use regime shifts. We survey historical events of land change and perform in-depth case studies of soy and shrimp development in Latin America to demonstrate the role of preconditions, triggers, and self-reinforcing processes in driving land-use regime shifts. Whereas the land-use literature demonstrates a good understanding of within-regime dynamics, our understanding of the drivers of land-use regime shifts is limited to ex post facto explications. Theoretical and empirical advances are needed to better understand the dynamics and implications of land-use regime shifts. We draw insights from the regime-shifts literature to propose a research agenda for studying land change.

AB Habitat destruction and degradation are major drivers of biodiversity loss and attention is increasingly focused on how different traits of species affect their vulnerability. Dietary traits are critical in this respect, and are typically examined by assigning species to different feeding and foraging guilds. However, such guilds may mask large variation in species' trophic interactions, limiting our understanding of species' responses. Here we use stable isotopes to quantify trophic positions within a Family of insectivorous understory birds, the Timaliidae (babblers), within Bornean rainforests. We then relate changes in species' abundances following intensive selective logging of forest to their trophic positions, body sizes and foraging heights. We found that trophic positions within this single feeding guild spanned more than an entire trophic level. Moreover, changes in abundance following logging were significantly and independently related to mean trophic position in primary forest, body size and foraging height: large ground-feeding species occupying high trophic positions were more adversely affected than small understory-feeders with lower trophic positions. These three variables together explained 81% of the variance in species' responses to logging. The single most important predictor, however, was a species' mean trophic position. Species recorded in both habitats also had significantly higher trophic positions in logged forest. These data provide critical new understanding of species' responses to disturbance. They also indicate previously unrecognised functional changes to species assemblages following logging, highlighting the importance of numerical assessments of trophic position within individual feeding guilds.

AB Many insectivorous birds of the tropical rainforest understory, particularly terrestrial species, are prone to local extinctions in fragmented forests. We evaluated the hypothesis that vegetation structural changes in rainforest fragments reduce the availability of microhabitats used by terrestrial insectivores. Near Manaus, Brazil, we compared the vegetation in forest fragments to the vegetation in a continuous forest site where nine species of terrestrial insectivores were observed foraging. Our focal species included those that are extinction prone in fragments (Myrmornis torquata [Wing-banded Antbird], Grallaria varia [Variegated Antbird], Hylopezus macularius [Spotted Antpitta]), a fragmentation-tolerant species (Myrmothera campanisona [Thrush-like Antpitta]), and species that have and intermediate response (Myrmeciza ferruginea [Ferruginous-backed Antbird], Formicarius colma [Rufous-capped Anttrush], Formicarius analis [Black-faced Antthrush], Conopophaga aurita [Chestnut-belted Gnateater], and Corythopis torquata [Ringed Antpipit]). To quantify vegetation, we measured sixteen habitat variables in 8-m radius plots where birds were observed foraging as well as random points in continuous forest and forest fragments of 1-, 10-, and 100-ha. Four principal components were produced from a principal component analysis and we selected a variable (leaf litter depth, plant cover 3-10 m, density of plants 1-2 m, and plant cover >20 m) from each principal component for our fragment vs continuous forest comparisons. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, we estimated the probabilities that the density of plants 1-2 m, proportion of plant cover 3-10 m, and leaf litter depth increased with decreasing fragment area and also exceeded the values associated with fragmentation-sensitive species. We also tested the prediction that plant cover >20 m decreased in forest fragments and that those sites became more open than typical sites used by our focal species. Our predictions were strongly supported: decreasing fragment size was correlated with increasing density of tall plants, increasing mid-story vegetation cover, decreased canopy cover, and increasing leaf litter depth. Even if our focal species are able to disperse to small forest fragments, our results suggest that they may not find enough appropriate habitat. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Community genetics studies frequently focus on individual communities associated with individual plant genotypes, but little is known about the genetically based relationships among taxonomically and spatially disparate communities. We integrate studies of a wide range of communities living on the same plant genotypes to understand how the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of one community may be constrained or modulated by its underlying genetic connections to another community. We use pre-existing data sets collected from Populus angustifolia (narrowleaf cottonwood) growing in a common garden to test the hypothesis that the composition of pairs of distinct communities (e.g. endophytes, pathogens, lichens, arthropods, soil microbes) covary across tree genotypes, such that individual plant genotypes that support a unique composition of one community are more likely to support a unique composition of another community. We then evaluate the hypotheses that physical proximity, taxonomic similarity, time between sampling (time attenuation), and interacting foundation species within communities explain the strength of correlations. Three main results emerged. First, Mantel tests between communities revealed moderate to strong (=0.25-0.85) community-genetic correlations in almost half of the comparisons; correlations among phyllosphere endophyte, pathogen and arthropod communities were the most robust. Secondly, physical proximity determined the strength of community-genetic correlations, supporting a physical proximity hypothesis. Thirdly, consistent with the interacting foundation species hypothesis, the most abundant species drove many of the stronger correlations. Other hypotheses were not supported.Synthesis. The field of community genetics demonstrates that the structure of communities varies among plant genotypes; our results add to this field by showing that disparate communities covary among plant genotypes. Eco-evolutionary dynamics between plants and their associated organisms may therefore be mediated by the shared connections of different communities to plant genotype, indicating that the organization of biodiversity in this system is genetically based and non-neutral.

AB We propose a new approach for identification of areas of endemism, the Geographical Interpolation of Endemism (GIE), based on kernel spatial interpolation. This method differs from others in being independent of grid cells. This new approach is based on estimating the overlap between the distribution of species through a kernel interpolation of centroids of species distribution and areas of influence defined from the distance between the centroid and the farthest point of occurrence of each species. We used this method to delimit areas of endemism of spiders from Brazil. To assess the effectiveness of GIE, we analyzed the same data using Parsimony Analysis of Endemism and NDM and compared the areas identified through each method. The analyses using GIE identified 101 areas of endemism of spiders in Brazil GIE demonstrated to be effective in identifying areas of endemism in multiple scales, with fuzzy edges and supported by more synendemic species than in the other methods. The areas of endemism identified with GIE were generally congruent with those identified for other taxonomic groups, suggesting that common processes can be responsible for the origin and maintenance of these biogeographic units.

AB Understanding the main drivers of species extinction in human-modified landscapes has gained paramount importance in proposing sound conservation strategies. Primates play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of forest ecosystem functions and represent the best studied order of tropical terrestrial vertebrates, yet primate species diverge widely in their responses to forest habitat disturbance and fragmentation. Here, we present a robust quantitative review on the synergistic effects of habitat fragmentation on Neotropical forest primates to pinpoint the drivers of species extinction across a wide range of forest patches from Mexico to Argentina. Presence-absence data on 19 primate functional groups were compiled from 705 forest patches and 55 adjacent continuous forest sites, which were nested within 61 landscapes investigated by 96 studies. Forest patches were defined in terms of their size, surrounding matrix and level of hunting pressure on primates, and each functional group was classified according to seven life-history traits. Generalized linear mixed models showed that patch size, forest cover, level of hunting pressure, home range size and trophic status were the main predictors of species persistence within forest isolates for all functional groups pooled together. However, patterns of local extinction varied greatly across taxa, with Alouatta and Callicebus moloch showing the highest occupancy rates even within tiny forest patches, whereas Brachyteles and Leontopithecus occupied fewer than 50% of sites, even in relatively large forest tracts. Our results uncover the main predictors of platyrrhine primate species extinction, highlighting the importance of considering the history of anthropogenic disturbances, the structure of landscapes, and species life-history attributes in predicting primate persistence in Neotropical forest patches. We suggest that large-scale conservation planning of fragmented forest landscapes should prioritize and set-aside large, well-connected and strictly protected forest reserves to maximize species persistence across the entire spectrum of primate life-history.

AB The use of natural resources and the services they provide often do not have an explicit price and are therefore undervalued in decision-making, leading to environmental degradation. To 'monetize' the benefits from these services requires the use of non-market valuation techniques. Using a stated preference survey of recreational divers in Barbados conducted between 2007 and 2009, the economic value of marine biodiversity to recreational SCUBA divers in Barbados was estimated. In addition to a variety of demographic variables, divers were asked about their level of experience, expenditures related to travel and diving, and encounters with fish and sea turtles. Divers then completed a choice experiment, selecting between alternative dives with varying characteristics including price, crowding, fish diversity, encounters with sea turtles, and coral cover. Results indicate that divers in Barbados have a clear appreciation of reef quality variables. Willingness to pay for good coral cover, fish diversity and presence of sea turtles is significantly higher than prices paid for dives. In general, divers valued reef attributes similarly, although their appreciation of low density of divers at a site and high coral cover varied with prior diving experience. The results of this study demonstrate the economic value generated in Barbados by the recreational SCUBA diving industry and highlight the potential for substantial additional economic contributions with improvements to the quality of a variety of reef attributes. These results could inform management decisions regarding reef use and sea turtle conservation, and could aid in the development of informed 'win win' policies aimed at maximizing returns from diving while reducing negative impacts often associated with tourism activities.

AB Rapid increases of secondary forest areas in the tropics make understanding of their carbon dynamics critical to estimate net CO2 emissions and uptake. This understanding is needed for performance based mechanisms that aim to halt global warming (REDD+). Despite the importance of secondary forests to global C cycling, the impacts of recovering secondary vegetation on C dynamics are poorly understood. We present carbon stocks and accumulation rates in biomass and soil pools, using as a basis of analysis 87 sampling plots established along a secondary forest chronosequence derived from shifting cultivation. We test the influence of age, land-use intensity (prior land-use history) and two site quality indices on the size of the C stocks and C accumulation rates. Biomass and Total C pools were positively correlated with age and negatively with LU intensity, whereas C accumulation rates had opposite signs for both parameters. Soil C did not show any variation along the age gradient, but C in the upper 20 cm was positively correlated to both site quality indices. The LU-intensity influenced the tree C stock in the younger plots. We propose a nested approach in which detailed studies can be up-scaled to landscape and regional estimates of carbon pools in forest fallow and undisturbed forests and carbon accumulation rates in forest fallow.

AB Wild pollinators provide important services to both wild and human-dominated ecosystems, yet this group may be threatened by widespread anthropogenic landscape change. Suburban sprawl is one of the fastest growing types of land use change in North America, and it has certain characteristics, such as abundant floral resources, that may be beneficial for many pollinators. We examined the effects of sprawl on the wild bee assemblage of the shortgrass steppe on the Front Range of Colorado, USA. Diversity, abundance, and community composition of bees in remnant grassland fragments surrounded by suburban residential land use were compared with those in extensive, continuous grassland. No overall effect of suburbanization on bee abundance was observed, and abundance was extremely variable even within study sites. Bee species richness was positively but nonlinearly related to grassland habitat area. Bee species density was higher and more variable in suburban sites. Suburban sites and smaller habitat area were both related to relative increases in the proportions of small bee species, social bees, and solitary cavity-nesting bees in the assemblage; small suburban habitat areas also favored species of the family Halictidae over Apidae, and individuals of the genus Halictus over those of the genus Lasioglossum. In this landscape, large native habitat areas surrounded by suburban sprawl may actually increase species richness and species density over that of continuous grassland, probably by means of habitat complementation or supplementation between grassland remnants and the surrounding suburban matrix. However, at habitat areas < 20 ha, species richness became quite variable; sites < 8 ha contained less than half the species of controls.

AB The storage effect is a mechanism that can facilitate the coexistence of competing species through temporal fluctuations in reproductive output. Numerous natural systems have the prerequisites for the storage effect, yet it has rarely been quantitatively assessed. Here, we investigate the possible importance of the storage effect in explaining the coexistence of tree species in the diverse tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. This tropical forest has been monitored for more than 20 years, and annual seed production is asynchronous among species, a primary requirement for the storage effect. We constructed a model of forest regeneration that includes species-specific recruitment through seed, sapling, and adult stages, and we parameterized the model using data for 28 species for which information is known about seedling germination and survival. Simulations of the model demonstrated that the storage effect alone can be a strong mechanism allowing long-term persistence of species. We also developed a metric to quantify the strength of the storage effect in a way comparable to classical resource partitioning. Applying this metric to seed production data from 108 species, the storage effect reduces the strength of pairwise interspecific competition to 11-43% of the strength of intraspecific competition, thereby demonstrating strong potential to facilitate coexistence. Finally, for a subset of 51 species whose phylogenetic relationships are known, we compared the strength of the storage effect between pairs of species to their phylogenetic similarity. The strength of the storage effect between closely related species was on average no different from distantly related species, implying that the storage effect can be important in promoting the coexistence of even closely related species.

AB 1. One of the earliest hypotheses to explain high tropical forest diversity proposes that species are differentially specialized in their germination or growth and survival to particular habitats. 2. I examined evidence for habitat associations in seedling density and demography in 9 years of seedling dynamics data from Yasuni National Park, Ecuador, a lowland rain forest where previous studies have demonstrated habitat preferences among adult trees. I included 136 species or morphospecies from multiple annual seedling cohorts with known age of recruitment. 3. Approximately 90% of the species examined demonstrated negative or positive associations with one or more topographic habitats in their recruitment, growth and/or mortality at some point in the study, and approximately 60% of species had significant associations in at least half of the census periods studied. The survival of newly recruited seedlings varied among seedlings in response to topographic gradients, indicating the potential for species to partition habitat niches at a young stage. 4. There was significant inter-annual variation in seedling habitat associations, indicating the characteristics of the topographic niche important to seedling performance change through time. This variability alone can contribute to the maintenance of species diversity through storage effects. While associations may also be weak or ephemeral, the seedling dynamics for many species supported the possibility that associations seen in adult populations develop through differential mortality across habitats as seedlings. 5. Synthesis. That species seedlings perform differently among topographic habitats and that these differences are detectable very early on in a plants life indicate the potential for the abiotic environment to mediate or exaggerate the roles of other mechanisms in influencing the composition of the understorey seedling assemblage.

AB Sustaining the regular flow of water from mountain forests is important for downstream stakeholders in seasonally dry tropical countries, and a watershed payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme that links rural ecosystem service providers to urban water users through economic transfers may help to maintain water supply and forest habitat. A CARE/WWF project in the Uluguru Mountains of Tanzania has established a pilot watershed PES scheme. We trace the development of this scheme and outline its initial impacts. Memoranda of Understanding between companies in Dar es Salaam (the downstream water users) and farmers in the mountains provide the framework to deliver tangible financial benefits to local people, help change patterns of land use and potentially improve water quality. A number of lessons learned from this project are relevant for similar schemes elsewhere in the region. Overcoming the various challenges is essential for expanding the current pilot project to a scale where it delivers measurable changes in water quality for downstream users.

AB Patch size, isolation, and vegetation structure are expected to strongly affect species persistence in fragmented landscapes, particularly for those with < 30% of native habitat remaining. Those influences should be modulated by species characteristics, resulting in complex relationships. In order to investigate how species, habitat structure and landscape factors are related and how they affected species persistence, we studied bird communities in a fragmented Atlantic Forest region. Patch size strongly affected species richness and population abundances. However, some functional groups were more affected than others, particularly endemic and understory insectivores, species that are near the limits of their geographical distribution, those using few forest types, and those with their center of abundance in high altitude tropical forests. The effect of vegetation structure was mainly at the species level, reflecting specific responses to habitat quality. The importance of landscape variables varies according to the species group. For the most affected ones, which usually have low dispersal capacity, patch size and quality were the most relevant factors, whereas patch isolation was associated with the richness of groups with more generalist species. This pattern is due to the limited structural connectivity in the study region, composed of low matrix permeability (e.g. pastures and sugar cane), which isolate the most affected species, making them more dependent on local factors. In such a fragmented landscape, the largest patches should be prioritized for conservation purposes, as they aggregate the most vulnerable species and present the highest alpha diversity. Landscape management, as such, should also reconnect large fragments through corridors or matrix improvements, promoting better conditions for long-term persistence of the most affected species.

AB A common observation in tropical dry forests is the habitat preference of tree species along spatial soil water gradients. This pattern of habitat partitioning might be a result of species differentiation in their strategy for using water, along with competing functions such as maximizing water exploitation and tolerating soil water stress. We tested whether species from drier soil conditions exhibited a tolerance strategy compared with that of wet-habitat species. In a comparison of 12 morphophysiological traits in seedlings of 10 closely related dry and wet-habitat species pairs, we explored what trade-offs guide differentiation between habitats and species. Contrary to our expectations, dry-habitat species showed mostly traits associated with an exploitation strategy (higher carbon assimilation capacity, specific leaf area and leaf-specific conductivity and lower water-use efficiency). Strikingly, dry-habitat species tended to retain their leaves longer during drought. Additionally, we detected multiple strategies to live within each habitat, in part due to variation of strategies among lineages, as well as functional differentiation along the water storage capacity-stem density (xylem safety) trade-off. Our results suggest that fundamental trade-offs guide functional niche differentiation among tree species expressed both within and between soil water habitats in a tropical dry forest.

AB Aim
   Island faunas, particularly those with high levels of endemism, usually are considered especially susceptible to disruption from habitat disturbance and invasive alien species. We tested this general hypothesis by examining the distribution of small mammals along gradients of anthropogenic habitat disturbance in northern Luzon Island, an area with a very high level of mammalian endemism.
   Location
   Central Cordillera, northern Luzon Island, Philippines.
   Methods
   Using standard trapping techniques, we documented the occurrence and abundance of 16 endemic and two non-native species along four disturbance gradients where habitat ranged from mature forest to deforested cropland. Using regression analysis and AIC(c) for model selection, we assessed the influence of four predictor variables (geographic range, elevational range, body size and diet breadth) on the disturbance tolerance of species.
   Results
   Non-native species dominated areas with the most severe disturbance and were rare or absent in mature forest. Native species richness declined with increasing disturbance level, but responses of individual species varied. Elevational range (a measure of habitat breadth) was the best predictor of response of native species to habitat disturbance. Geographic range, body size and diet breadth were weakly correlated.
   Main conclusions
   The endemic small mammal fauna of northern Luzon includes species adapted to varying levels of natural disturbance and appears to be resistant to disruption by resident alien species. In these respects, it resembles a diverse continental fauna rather than a depauperate insular fauna. We conclude that the long and complex history of Luzon as an ancient member of the Philippine island arc system has involved highly dynamic ecological conditions resulting in a biota adapted to changing conditions. We predict that similar responses will be seen in other taxonomic groups and in other ancient island arc systems.

   DESIGN
AB P>1. Species-area (SA) models have often been used to predict biodiversity loss resulting from habitat loss. This application of SA models hinges on two fundamental assumptions: the resultant landscape matrix is inhospitable to the taxa of interest; and edge effects do not factor into extinction risks. Despite growing consensus that these assumptions are unrealistic, the SA approach continues to be used in assessments of biodiversity decline and conservation planning.
   2. We propose an overhaul of the SA approach by accounting for taxon-specific responses to landscape-specific matrix quality and deleterious effects of habitat edges. We pitted nine variants of an improved SA model (calibrated for edge and/or matrix) against two variants of the conventional model (calibrated with island or continental z values) to predict species extinction and endangerment in 15 tropical biodiversity hotspots.
   3. The matrix-calibrated SA model received the highest Akaike's Information Criterion weight (birds: 66 center dot 8%; mammals: 63 center dot 3%), which reflects the weight of evidence in support of it being the most parsimonious model given the set of candidate models and data considered. Additionally, the matrix-calibrated (MC) model produced species extinction predictions that were the most accurate and least biased.
   4. The second best model (for both birds and mammals) was one that simultaneously corrected for matrix and edge effects.
   5. The conventional SA model (particularly when calibrated with an island z value) performed worse than the matrix-calibrated and/or edge-corrected models.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that accounting for the landscape matrix per se is a sufficient and significant improvement to the SA approach in terms of assessing species extinction risks from land-use change. More importantly, given that the MC model was also the most parsimonious model (in that it requires only one additional model parameter than the conventional SA model), it could prove to be a cost-effective heuristic tool for conservation scientists and decision makers to accurately evaluate extinction risks resulting from land-use decisions. We argue that, henceforth, the MC model, which takes account of both the extent of deforestation and quality of the resultant matrix, should replace the conventional SA model for predicting biodiversity loss.

AB Although studies on stable-carbon isotopes in trees from temperate zones provide abundant paleoclimatic data, tropical trees are still understudied in this context. Therefore this study examined the variability of intra- and inter-annual stable-carbon isotopic pattern in several tree species from various tropical climates. The delta C-13 Values of samples of 12 broadleaved trees (seven species) from various paleotropical and neotropical sites along a climatic moisture gradient were investigated. The inter-annual variability between species and sites was studied. Further the relationship between delta C-13 and precipitation time series was analyzed. Results show that tropical tree species show a similar variability in carbon isotopic composition as temperate tree species. Significant correlations between annual precipitation and tree-ring delta C-13 time series were negative. Successful crossdating of a tree-ring delta C-13 time series highlights the potential of carbon isotope measurements for tropical tree-ring analytical studies. Tropical broadleaved trees are able to capture a carbon isotopic signal in their annual rings even under everwet conditions and show good potential for paleoclimatic research.

AB Three sampling designs - simple random, stratified random, and systematic sampling - are compared on the basis of precision of estimated loss of intact humid tropical forest area in the Brazilian Legal Amazon from 2000 to 2005. MODIS-derived deforestation is used to partition the study area into strata to intensify sampling within forest clearing hotspots. The precision of the estimator of deforestation area for each design is calculated from a population of wall-to-wall PRODES deforestation data available for the study area. Both systematic and stratified sampling yield smaller standard errors than simple random sampling, and the stratified design has smaller standard errors than the systematic design at each sample size evaluated. The results of this case study demonstrate the utility of a stratified design based on MODIS-derived deforestation data to improve precision of the estimated loss of intact forest area as estimated from sampling Landsat imagery.

AB Theory suggests that the spatial context within which species interactions occur will have major implications for the outcome of competition and ultimately, coexistence, but empirical tests are rare. This is surprising given that individuals of species in real communities are typically distributed nonrandomly in space. Nonrandom spatial arrangement has the potential to modify the relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition by changing the ratio of conspecific to heterospecific competitive encounters, particularly among sessile species where interactions among individuals occur on local scales. Here we test the influence of aggregated and random spatial arrangements on population trajectories of competing species in benthic, marine, sessile-invertebrate assemblages. We show that the spatial arrangement of competing species in simple assemblages has a strong effect on species performance: when conspecifics are aggregated, strong competitors perform poorly and weaker competitors perform better. The effect of specific spatial arrangements depends on species identity but is also strongly context dependent. When there are large differences in species competitive ability, aggregated spatial arrangements can slow competitive exclusion, and so nonrandom spatial arrangement can work synergistically with other trade-off based mechanisms to facilitate coexistence.

   ECOLOGY; MORTALITY; SOCIALITY; DENSITY; RESERVE; DIET
AB Predation is a constant risk for most primates, impacting demography, population dynamics, activity patterns and social behaviour. Data are limited on both the rates of predation and its spatial and temporal variability. We present long-term observations of Cryptoprocta ferox predation on rainforest sifakas in Madagascar, Propithecus diadema at Tsinjoarivo (22 group years) and Propithecus edwardsi at Ranomafana (73 group years), derived from intensive observations based on ongoing behavioural studies. Average per capita offtake rates are relatively low (0.06-0.07), but temporal variability is high (kills are clumped in time). This is consistent with Cryptoprocta ecology; individual home ranges are much larger than sifaka ranges, and individuals may hunt in a subsection of their range until prey density is decreased, then move on. These results have broad implications. First, in terms of the evolution of anti-predator strategies, it now becomes important to ask: (1) whether average or peak predation rates determine the strength of selection and (2) whether antipredator strategies (e.g. vigilance, sleeping site selection) fluctuate interannually, reflecting recent experience. Second, in terms of population ecology, Cryptoprocta may have disproportionately large impacts on the (small) sifaka groups, even driving groups to extinction (as observed at both sites). Third, the disappearance of groups has important implications for conservation. When this happens in continuous forest (as at Ranomafana), home ranges will likely be re-filled over time, whereas in isolated forest fragments (as at Tsinjoarivo), recolonization is less likely. Thus, conservation planners should consider predation as a potentially important proximate cause of extirpation in fragmented landscapes, even when resource density and quality could otherwise sustain populations. Considering the effects of predation can be useful in (1) decisions regarding the allocation of limited conservation resources, including which landscapes to invest resources in and (2) investigating ways to increase resilience of prey species.

AB Effect of disturbance, habitat fragmentation and exotic plant species invasion on plant diversity is documented for the dry. deciduous forests of India's Vindhyan highlands. Plant communities were identified with the help of satellite imagery and ground data, and community wise diversity was estimated. Analysis of landscape matrices using satellite images and GIS tools showed deforestation of smaller fragments, and fragmentation and degradation of larger ones. Fragments of smaller size had lesser number of plant communities compared to larger fragments. Generally large size fragments were species rich and more diverse as compared to smaller fragments. Lagestoemia-Acacia-Lannea community was richest for both tree and herb strata, whereas Shorea-Buchanania community was the richest when all vascular flora were considered. The study indicates that species rich communities of the dry tropical forests are not only being reduced in area but they are also becoming species poof and less diverse due to rapid deforestation and forest fragmentation. The communities most vulnerable to alien invasive plants were Acacia-Terminalia, Terminalia-Shorea and Hardwickia-Acacia. Ecological implications of plant invasion are discussed and conservation measures suggested.

AB We examined the impact of both seasonal and year-to-year variations in precipitation on simulated soil moisture dynamics at a tropical rain forest (TRF) site and a tropical seasonal forest (TSF) site in Southeast Asia, between which there is a clear difference in the precipitation regime, through a probabilistic ecohydrological model. All model parameters have apparent physical meaning and were obtained by field observations. Rainfall statistics as the primary model forcing terms were constructed from long-term rainfall records, and their analysis revealed a close relationship between drought and El Nino events at the TRF site and a long-term drying trend at the TSF site. The model results further demonstrated that the studied ecosystem's robustness ( mainly concerning the plant water availability) are attributed to functional factors such as soil texture for the TRF site and rooting depth and the dry season use of water from the preceding wet season for the TSF site.

AB Recent data on oribatid mites (Acari: Oribatida) indicates that Mediterranean soil communities tend to show uneven patterns of species abundance distribution (SAD) that are well fitted by a simple model such as the geometric series. In the case of linear distributions, the fraction of total sampled individuals that is contributed by the most abundant species, known as the Berger-Parker index, synthetically describes the SAD of disturbed communities. This study assessed the bioindicator potential of the Berger-Parker index by comparing its variations among Mediterranean oribatid assemblages under different types of soil disturbance. The index significantly changes between undisturbed and disturbed soils reaching the highest values in areas with strong physical disturbance due to agricultural management. The Berger-Parker index is therefore a practical and effective tool for monitoring biodiversity impairment linked to human disturbance in soil ecosystems.

AB Background and Aims Lianas are expected to differ from trees in their growth strategies. As a result these two groups of woody species will have different spatial distributions: lianas are more common in high light environments. This study determines the differences in growth patterns, biomass allocation and leaf traits in five closely related liana and tree species of the genus Bauhinia.
   Methods Seedlings of two light-demanding lianas (Bauhinia tenuiflora and B. claviflora), one shade-tolerant liana (B. aurea), and two light-demanding trees (B. purpurea and B. monandra) were grown in a shadehouse at 25 % of full sunlight. A range of physiological, morphological and biomass parameters at the leaf and whole plant level were compared among these five species.
   Key Results The two light-demanding liana species had higher relative growth rate (RGR), allocated more biomass to leaf production [higher leaf mass fraction (LMF) and higher leaf area ratio (LAR)] and stem mass fraction (SMF), and less biomass to the roots [root mass fraction (RMF)] than the two tree species. The shade-tolerant liana had the lowest RGR of all five species, and had a higher RMF, lower SMF and similar LMF than the two light-demanding liana species. The two light-demanding lianas had lower photosynthetic rates per unit area (A(area)) and similar photosynthetic rates per unit mass (A(mass)) than the trees. Across species, RGR was positively related to SLA, but not to LAR and A(area).
   Conclusions It is concluded that the faster growth of light-demanding lianas compared with light-demanding trees is based on morphological parameters (SLA, LMF and LAR), and cannot be attributed to higher photosynthetic rates at the leaf level. The shade-tolerant liana exhibited a slow-growth strategy, compared with the light-demanding species.

AB 1 Trade-offs among plant traits may contribute to specialization for different environments and coexistence of plant species. This may be the first study that shows how trade-offs among branch traits contribute to variation in crown size, light requirements and maximum height across multiple sympatric tree species in a tropical rain forest.
   2 Ten saplings were selected for each of 30 tree species in a Bolivian rain forest. Sapling height and crown dimensions were measured and branch and stem samples were harvested. Fresh density, dry density, modulus of rupture, centre of mass, biomass and diameters were determined for those samples. For each species, cantilever theory predicted the mass needed to produce a stable 1-m long horizontal branch.
   3 Generally, shade-tolerant species had denser and stronger branches, and produced a stable horizontal branch at lower resource costs. These species had branches with a higher resistance against mechanical failure, and a wide crown that favours effective light acquisition. Less shade-tolerant species had low density and weak branches, short branches, high resource costs per unit branch length, and low resource costs per unit stem length. These traits seem advantageous under conditions of prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, where such species grow rapidly to reproductive size, while mechanical risks are low and light levels are favourable.
   4 Branch (wood and bark) traits are good predictors for performance differences across tree species in heterogeneous forest light environments. Physical trade-offs among branch traits contribute to the specialization of tree species for different light habitats and to tree species coexistence in tropical rain forests, even within classical functional groups such as pioneers and shade tolerants.

AB The population dynamics of the epiphytic orchid Aspasia principissa, growing in the moist tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panama, were studied from 1997 until 2004. Using growth analysis, projection matrix analysis, elasticity analysis, and different types of simulations, we identified the components of the life cycle with the strongest effect on population growth rate (lambda), and related differences in vital rates to environmental variation, mainly in precipitation. Such information, which is almost completely lacking for tropical orchids, is essential for the efficient conservation of these frequently rare and endangered plants. Elasticity analysis indicated that the population growth rate (lambda), which averaged 0.92, was primarily affected by survival, and much less affected by growth or by sexual reproduction. Simulations, which included different levels of pollinator limitation, showed that complete pollination would raise lambda to such an extent as to allow long-term persistence of the population. Pollinator limitation per se, however, is presumably not responsible for the currently observed population decline. Instead, we discuss a possible link between low lambda and (a) a long-term decline in precipitation and (b) recent increases in forest dynamics: variation in annual rainfall significantly affected both recruitment and growth rates of smaller orchid individuals, while the hypothesised increase in the rates of branch and tree falls would increase mortality rates in this epiphyte.

AB The study of the relative importance of the feedback structure (intrinsic processes) and exogenous (climatic or environmental) factors in determining population dynamics, in particular the interaction between density-dependence and climate, is a major question in population ecology. We sought to explain the numerical fluctuations of 2 sympatric rodent species at one well-studied site in semi-arid Chile using simple theoretically based population dynamics models and Royama's theoretical framework for analyzing the dynamics of populations influenced by exogenous climatic forces. We found that rainfall effects appear to operate in a different manner on the 2 rodent species. For one species (Phyllotis darwini), rainfall appeared to influence the carrying capacity of the environment, whereas for a second (Akodon olivaceus) the rainfall effect had a primarily additive influence on the maximum per capita growth rates.

AB Fragmentation is the most common disturbance induced by humans in tropical forests. Some insect groups are particularly suitable for studying the effects of fragmentation on animal communities because they are taxonomically and ecologically homogenous. We investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on a dung beetle species community in the forest archipelago created in 1994-1995 by the dam of Petit Saut, French Guiana. We set and baited an equal number of pitfall traps for dung beetles on three mainland sites and seven island sites. The sites ranged from 1.1 to 38 ha. In 250 trap days, we captured 50 species in 19 genera. Diversity indices were high (2.18-4.06). The lowest diversity was on the small islands and one mainland site. Species richness and abundance were positively related to fragment area but not to distance from mainland or distance to the larger island. The islands had lower species richness and population than mainland forest, but rarefied species richness was relatively invariant across sites. There was a marked change in species composition with decreasing fragment that was not caused by the presence of a common fauna of disturbed area species on islands. Small islands differed from larger islands, which did not differ significantly from mainland sites. Partial correlation analyses suggested that species richness and abundance of dung beetle species were positively related to the number of species of nonflying mammals and the density index of howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus), two parameters positively related to fragment area.

AB The arboreal ant communities of a primary lowland rain forest and three differently disturbed forests that lie close together forming an anthropogenic disturbance gradient were collected with insecticide fogging. Combined samples from all trees (87 foggings) comprised 153,504 ants sorted to 331 morphospecies. The primary forest ant fauna was characterized by high species richness and 53 foggings were necessary to collect communities representatively. Another 63 species of ants were found in the disturbed forests indicating a large regional species pool that might exceed 420 species of arboreal ants. Anthropogenic disturbance caused a change in the taxonomic composition, diversity and structure of ant communities. Community size was a predictor of species richness in the severely disturbed forest types but not in the old secondary or primary forest. Ant abundance had declined significantly in the disturbed forests and only 10% of the primary forest's species were collected in the most disturbed forest type. In each of the secondary forests a change in the frequency distribution of species was observed and a small number of species had gained numerical dominance. Analysis of species associations indicates that the strength of species interactions changed with the degree of forest disturbance. These changes were still clearly recognizable after 40 years of forest regeneration despite optimal conditions for colonization from the adjacent primary forest, demonstrating that the time scale needed for forest recovery after anthropogenic disturbance is very long.

AB Canopy gaps play an important role in forest vegetation dynamics when fire return intervals are long. However, there is little known about the role of gaps in the development of forest stands that initially dominate following stand-replacing disturbance. We investigated gap disturbance during the breakup of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands at two scales: at the stand level we quantified gap fraction and gap size as stand development proceeds; at the gap level we determined causes of gap-maker mortality and evaluated resulting gap-maker structure and decay as stand development proceeds. We also evaluated the impact that gaps have on stand transition by quantifying the abundance and growth of juvenile trees in gaps of different sizes and ages. Ten stands between 60 and 120 years since fire in northeastern Ontario were sampled using line intersect transects. Gap fraction doubled (18%-36%) and mean gap size was more than four times greater (45-200 m(2)) over the time period. Standing dead gap makers in early states of decay were most frequent in young stands, whereas snapped gap makers in various states of decay were most frequent in old stands. Infection by fungal pathogens was the most frequent cause of mortality (56%) and was not related to time since fire. Balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) was the most abundant juvenile recruit. However, transition probabilities for tree species were independent of gap type. These results indicate that gap creation is frequent during early stages of stand development in boreal forests; however, it is unlikely that successional trajectory is affected by their formation.

AB Although competition between plants is nearly universal in vegetation, we know relatively little about belowground competition and how it interacts with aboveground competition in tropical forests, and almost nothing about such interactions on soils of intermediate fertility in sites with a moderate dry season, despite the fact that such forests are extensive. We investigated this over one year in a Panamanian tropical semi-evergreen rain forest, using tree seedlings (Simarouba amara, Gustavia superba, Tachigali versicolor, and Aspidosperma cruenta; least to most shade tolerant), experimental gaps, and trenching. Gaps increased growth and decreased mortality; growth increases were: Simarouba 684% (increase in height relative growth rate), Gustavia 411%, Aspidosperma 364%, and Tachigali 324%. Trenching in gaps increased growth in three species (Simarouba 49%, Gustavia 63%, and Aspidosperma 38%) but had very small effects in the understory; trenching did not affect mortality. We infer that trenching caused increased growth due to increased nutrients in the wet season, and increased water and/or nutrients in the dry season. Thus, across the tropics, in all but the wettest sites with fertile soils, seedlings of many species will be limited by belowground competition, at least in gaps. This is similar to the pervasive importance of belowground competition in temperate forests.

AB We studied the impact of hunting on monkey species in the Tai National Park and adjacent forests in Cote d'Ivoire. The average wild meat consumption per capita per year was assessed from market surveys and interviews. We determined that the amount of primate wild meat being extracted in the Tai National Park and surrounding forests was 249 t in 1999. Hunting pressure was the highest on the larger primate species such as red colobus, Procolobus badius, and white colobus, Colobus polykomos, and the sooty mangabey, Cercocebus torquatus atys. Estimates of population densities were based on line transect surveys. The maximum annual production of each species was calculated using the Robinson and Redford model (1991) and assuming unhunted conditions. Comparing current harvest levels with the maximum sustainable yield suggests that harvest of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus badius) is sustainable, whereas current off-take of the black and white colobus (Colobus polykomos), the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys), diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana), and Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli) exceeds sustainability by up to three times.

AB Conservation of species of concern in fire-dependent ecosystems requires restoring the historical fire regime that has shaped the species' life history. The historical fire regime of the endangered pine rockland ecosystem is controversial. In this study, we attempted to infer the historical fire regime of this ecosystem by studying the effects of contrasting experimental fire regimes on Chamaecrista keyensis, a narrowly endemic species of the pine rocklands of the Lower Florida Keys, USA. We constructed multiple matrix population models for C. keyensis using demographic data from replicated wet- and dry-season burns, 1-30 years since fire, and seed bank dynamics derived from extensive field seed bank experiments. We then carried out deterministic analyses and stochastic simulations. Recently burned sites (1-2 years postfire) had the highest finite population growth rates of all sites. Differences in finite population growth rate between winter and summer fires were more pronounced during the year of burn than in subsequent years. Stochastic simulations show that dry-season (winter) burns generated lower extinction risks and population decline probabilities than a wet-season (summer) fire regime. Fire return intervals of 5-7 years generated the lowest, extinction and population decline probabilities for both seasons. C. keyensis may have evolved under a fire regime that consisted of both anthropogenic dry-season fires along with lightning caused wet-season fires. If phenology is also a key to fire responses in other pine rockland species, a diverse fire regime including a wide range of fire seasons may be critical, to maintaining the diversity of the pine rockland ecosystem.

AB Man-made structures have become ubiquitous features of coastal landscapes. These artificial habitats are popular recreation sites. Patterns and effects of recreational activities were investigated from 1999 to 2004 on coastal structures along 40 km of shoreline in the Emilia Romagna region (North Adriatic Sea, Italy). Four studies estimated the magnitude and frequency of exploitation by people, and established how human exploitation varied in space and time. A manipulative experiment involving the removal of mussels, mimicking the impact of human harvesting, was carried out to identify the effects of extensive mussel exploitation. Recreational exploitation was a major recurrent disturbance. Hundreds of people visited defence structures for recreational fishing and to harvest a variety of invertebrates to be used primarily as food. Human exploitation was most intense during the spring and summer but relatively unpredictable at scales of days and hours. Exploitation was homogeneous among different locations, despite marked differences in the accessibility of the structures. Visitors to the structures were mainly local people. Harvesting of mussels was particularly disruptive for the assemblages, leading to depletion of mussel beds, opening of unoccupied space, patchiness in the assemblages, and favouring the development of macroalgae. The main types of macroalgae were green and filamentous algae, which are a nuisance for beach tourism in the area, and the invasive species Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides. Effective management of human access to artificial habitats is essential, since recreational exploitation influences the distribution and structure of their associated assemblages, ultimately affecting the native characteristics of the areas.

AB This paper summarizes the results of a women's community-based marine protected area that has been successful in sustaining invertebrate biological resources and in prompting strong community support. We outline the project and the associated biological results, describe the processes involved in attaining a committed level of community participation, and review the lessons learned during the project's implementation. We attribute the project's preliminary success-improved shellfish biomass, enhanced local environmental awareness, and the reinvigoration of cultural management practices-to the following factors: 1) the high level of participatory involvement and community leadership; 2) the local perception that shell beds have recovered rapidly and the role that scientific evaluation has played in reinforcing this notion; 3) a research program that is cross-fertilizing indigenous and scientific ecological knowledge; 4) the unique marine tenure system that allows for the project's development and the area's policing; and 5) the tangible economic incentives created by the development project, which ultimately empowers local women. We hope that the project's findings can be generalized to other regions of the world with operational sea-tenure regimes and that it can help to make the establishing of community-based marine protected areas (CBMPAs) across the Pacific region more effective.

AB Using North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) feeding scars on trees as an index of past porcupine abundance, we have found that porcupine populations have fluctuated regularly over the past 130 years in the Bas St. Laurent region of eastern Quebec, with superimposed periodicities of 11 and 22 years. Coherency and phase analyses showed that this porcupine population cycle has closely followed the 11- and 22-year solar activity cycles. Fluctuations in local precipitation and temperature were also cyclic and closely related to both the solar cycle and the porcupine cycle. Our results suggest that the solar cycle indirectly sets the rhythm of population fluctuations of the most abundant vertebrate herbivore in the ecosystem we studied. We hypothesize that the solar cycle has sufficiently important effects on the climate along the southern shore of the St. Lawrence estuary to locally influence terrestrial ecosystem functioning. This constitutes strong evidence for the possibility of a causal link between solar variability and terrestrial ecology at the decadal timescale and local spatial scale, which confirms results obtained at greater temporal and spatial scales.

AB Habitat fragmentation produces isolated patches characterized by increased edge effects from an originally continuous habitat. The shapes of these patches often show a high degree of irregularity: their shapes deviate significantly from regular geometrical shapes such as rectangular and elliptical ones. In fractal theory, the geometry of patches created by a common landscape transformation process should be statistically similar, i.e. their fractal dimensions and their form factors should be equal. In this paper, we analyze 49 woodlot fragments (Pinus sylvestris L.) in the Belgian Kempen region to study the direct relationship between a transformation process and the concomitant patch geometry. Although the fractal dimension of the woodlots is scattered (i.e. they are not statistically similar), the perimeter-area relation of the fragments is characterized by a single, 'dimension-like' exponent. This exponent suggests a certain shape homogeneity among the patches, which is confirmed by the absence of hierarchical levels associated with sharp increases of the fractal dimension at scale transitions. The interaction of different natural (soil factor, vegetation type) and anthropogenic (afforestation, urbanization) processes during patch development is assumed to have generated this feature. Comparison of the area and perimeter fractal dimension with an ecological index for habitat quality, the interior-to-edge ratio, shows that the fractal dimension is suitable for predicting interior habitat presence, which is more likely for patches with smooth perimeters and compact areas. The ratio of the area to the perimeter fractal dimension confirms this observation, with high values for high interior-to-edge ratios, characteristic for regularly shaped patches.

AB Logging and wildfire are significant anthropogenic disturbance agents in tropical forests. We compared the abundance and species richness of selected terrestrial wildlife taxa including small mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and terrestrial invertebrates in areas burned by wildfire and then logged and in adjacent undisturbed areas of a tropical humid forest in Bolivia. Disturbed areas had 24% less canopy cover than undisturbed areas but had 2.6 times the cover of large woody debris. Understory cover did not differ between disturbed and undisturbed areas. Small mammal abundance and species richness in disturbed areas were 43 and 70% higher, respectively, than in adjacent undisturbed areas. Herpetofaunal abundance did not differ significantly among disturbed and undisturbed areas, but trends for higher abundance were observed for both reptiles and amphibians in disturbed areas. Herpetofaunal species richness was significantly higher in disturbed compared to undisturbed areas. Total terrestrial invertebrate abundance, as estimated by pitfall traps, was significantly higher in undisturbed compared to disturbed areas mostly due to higher abundances of Formicidae and Blattidae. However, two invertebrate groups, Orthoptera and Lepidoptera (larvae) were more abundant in disturbed areas. Wildlife conservation strategies for areas where logging or wildfire occur should take into account species- or guild-specific responses to these disturbance agents.

AB Increased predation and parasitism of bird nests has become a major problem in many biological communities altered by human activities, often causing declines in bird populations. To help solve this threat to biodiversity, I propose restoring the abundance of symbiotic nest-protecting animals in habitats where birds face an increased risk from predators and parasites, so that birds there can increase their chances of reproductive success by nesting close to these protectors. The re-establishment of such protective nesting associations to increase avian reproductive success differs from other proposed solutions to this problem in that it involves point defense of bird nests themselves. Rather than diminishing the number of nest predators and brood parasites in the whole habitat or community, as proposed with other approaches, the presence, activity and success of these enemies are reduced only within the microhabitat defended by the protector. The animal protecting the nest need not be larger in size than the predators or brood parasites, and is often many times smaller. In addition, it need not be from a higher trophic position, and in many cases comes from the same or a lower trophic level. Research suggests that an informed and careful use of nest protecting animals by wildlife managers can help reverse or prevent the decline of many bird populations, especially when used in combination with other approaches such as restoration of top predator populations and habitats. Although wildlife biologists have long recognized the important role that plants play in concealing and protecting bird nests from enemies, and regularly recommend manipulation of vegetation to enhance nest survival, they have generally ignored the important role that formidable animals play in protecting bird nests, and failed to incorporate animal protectors into management strategies. Because of this neglect, a host of new studies and experiments are urgently needed to provide managers with the critical information needed to use protective nesting associations effectively in integrated strategies to preserve avian biodiversity.

AB Benthic organisms compete for space, and standoff interactions, i.e, interactions with no clearly observable outcome such as win or loss, are very common in marine hard substratum communities. Standoffs were more common than overgrowths among all sponge-coral interactions observed in a coral reef community off Santa Marta, NE Colombia. The dynamics of these standoffs and the role played by each of the interacting organisms were examined in a series of standard observations of sponge coral interactions involving the sponge species Niphates erecta, Rhaphidophlus venosus, Scopalina ruetzleri and the coral Montastraea cavernosa. Most sponge-coral standoffs in this study displayed rapid changes in number of polyps along the coral border, sponge area and sponge-coral distance. The outcome of sponge-coral standoffs depended on the ecological stategy (e.g., growth) of the sponge species. Scopalina ruetzleri and N. erecta did not show any signs of direct competition with Monlastraea cavernosa. R. venosus, however, was often observed to take over vacant space formed by dead coral polyps (54 % of interactions). The impact of coral damage (lesions) on the interaction process between R. venosus and M. cavernosa was shown by a significant increase in coral polyp death in damaged compared with undamaged M. cavernosa colonies (22.7 % versus 6.9 %). This study demonstrates that (1) sponge-coral standoffs are actually quite dynamic because of the continually changing distance between the organisms, (2) the dynamic nature of sponge-coral standoffs depends on growth-related strategies (growth form, growth rate) of The competing sponge species, (3) the actual frequency of coral overgrowth by (thinly encrusting) sponge species can only be determined by means of intermittent observations; space gained at the cost of coral tissue cannot be seen by single observations, (4) coral damage (lesions) on reefs may enhance deterioration of corals by increasing their susceptibility to sponge overgrowth.

AB We tested concentration preferences of Rufous Hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) offered sucrose solutions in small feeders in the field. When sucrose solutions differing in increments of 10%, from 10% to 70%, were presented simultaneously, hummingbirds preferred 50% to higher and lower concentrations. They did not show a significant preference in the range from 50% to 70%. When options were offered in pairs of choices differing from 1-25%, hummingbirds demonstrated statistically significant preferences that varied with mean concentration in a curvilinear manner. At concentrations approximating those of hummingbird-pollinated flowers (20%), hummingbirds showed greatest specificity and could distinguish solutions differing by only 1%. At concentrations above and below 20%, greater differences between choices were required to elicit significant preferences.

AB We tested whether compounds in ripe Solanum americanum fruits affect gut retention time of S. americanum seeds in Cedar Waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum). Glycoalkaloids were of special interest because they commonly occur in ripe Solanum fruits and are associated with diarrhea in humans. Also, we determined the influence of gut retention time and the presence/absence of two glycoalkaloids, alpha-solasonine and alpha-solamargine, on germination of S. americanum seeds. In one trial, we measured seed retention times of 10 waxwings fed three types of artificial fruits, Control (containing no secondary metabolites), Low Concentration (containing low concentrations of a-solasonine and alpha-solamargine, matching those in ripe S. americanum fruit), and Extract (containing an ethanol extract of ripe S. americanum fruits, with many unidentified secondary metabolites). Seeds in Low Concentration fruits were not defecated more quickly than those in Control fruits, but seeds in Extract fruits were. Thus, ripe S. americanum fruits contain a chemical or chemicals with a laxative effect. Also, seeds from Control fruits were deposited in more defecations and at lower densities in each defecation than those from Extract fruits. In a second trial, we compared retention times of seeds in control fruits and in fruits with high concentrations of glycoalkaloids, typical in ripe fruits of other Solanum species. These high concentrations had a significant constipative effect on seed passage. Percentage germination and mean germination time of defecated seeds were not influenced by mean retention time in waxwing guts. However, proportionately fewer seeds germinated from Low Concentration fruits than from Control fruits. These results suggest that plants have more control over seed processing by frugivores than generally acknowledged. Secondary metabolites in ripe fruits can increase or decrease retention time and thereby influence seed deposition patterns (e.g., number of defecations with seeds, number of seeds per defecation, and presumably, dispersal distance).

AB Three analyses of species diversity in a lowland dipterocarp forest were conducted to examine whether the nature of forest community dynamics are determined by density-dependent recruitment and mortality of saplings with a data set obtained in a 50 ha plot in Pasoh Forest Reserve. The first analysis examined whether sapling density varied as a function of distance from the nearest conspecific adult. The second analysis assessed the relationship between the spatial distribution patterns of saplings and adult trees. A third analysis examined sapling recruitment and mortality based on data from 2 censuses, taken in 1985 and 1990. Four hundred forty-four species (each with more than 100 individuals) out of the total of 814 species recorded in the plot, were chosen for the analyses. Of these selected species, 56 species showed significant reduction in sapling densities close to the conspecific adults. Within this group, 11 species were in the emergent layer (29.0% of the total species in this layer), 17 were in the canopy layer (10.5%), 18 were in the understory layer (11.3%), and 10 were in treelet and shrub layer (11.8%). In contrast, the sapling densities of 53 species decreased with increasing distance from conspecific adults; 2 of these species were in the emergent layer (5.2% of the total species in this layer), 14 were in the canopy layer (8.6%), 21 were in the understory layer (13.2%), and 16 were in the treelet and shrub layer (18.8%). The saplings of 35 of the 444 total selected species were clumped, while adults were regularly or randomly distributed. Of the remaining species, in 183 species (41.2%), the distributions of both adults and saplings were clumped. Thus, these 2 analyses do not support the prediction that most of the species of lowland tropical forests fail to produce new adults in their vicinity and as a result of this, adult trees are more regularly distributed than their conspecific juveniles (Janzen 1970). In the third analysis, the recruitment of saplings of species in the emergent and canopy layers increased significantly and in proportion with mortality, suggesting that the dominant species suffer higher mortality than do less common species. This trend is not so apparent in the understory, and the treelet and shrub layers. The results imply that a dynamic equilibrium process, which prevents competitive exclusion and maintains space for minor species, may be active among the species in the upper layers (particularly the emergent layer); however, such a dynamic equilibrium condition is not due exclusively to the reduced recruitment of saplings near conspecific adults, and the dynamic equilibrium condition is not prevalent among the lower story species.

AB 1. The ability of rain-forest plants to utilize sunflecks for growth was investigated using the following species: Alocasia macrorrhiza, Diploglottis diphyllostegia, Micromelum minutum and Omalanthus novo-guinensis.
   2. Growth analysis and gas-exchange measurements were used to assess performance of the four species when exposed to either constant or fluctuating light.
   3. Final biomass (g dry wt) in D. diphyllostegia and M. minutum grown under the lightfleck regime (total daily PFD = 7.02 mol m(-2) day(-1)) was significantly greater than in the same species grown under constant low PFD (total daily PFD = 4.86 mol m(-2) day(-1)). In contrast, final biomass in lightfleck O. novo-guinensis and A. macrorrhiza was significantly reduced in comparison with the same species grown under constant low PFD.
   4. When grown under either constant or fluctuating light but with the same total daily PFD, A. macrorrhiza and O. novo-guinensis had significantly lower final biomass in fluctuating light as compared to constant light. Final biomass in D. diphyllostegia was not significantly different in either regime, while M. minutum had significantly higher final biomass in the fluctuating light regime.
   5. Responses of the four species to fluctuating or constant light appeared to be the result of physiological rather than morphological acclimation as net assimilation rate was more closely correlated with relative growth rate than was leaf area ratio.

AB The association between the hermit crab Pagurus longicarpus Say and an ectosymbiotic colonial hydroid of the genus Hydractinia was studied to determine whether the presence of Hydractinia affects the resistance of Pagurus longicarpus to predation. Observations of tethered hermit crabs confirmed the importance of predation by the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus Rathbun, on the Pagurus longicarpus population in Nantucket Harbor, Massachusetts. In a predation experiment, caged hermit crabs in Littorina littorea (L.) shells with and without Hydractinia were exposed to single blue crabs. Shell damage indicated that blue crabs attacked hermit crabs in both shell types in roughly equal proportions: 65% of hermit crabs in shells with Hydractinia were attacked compared to 69% of hermit crabs in shells without Hydractinia. Only 20% of hermit crabs in shells with the hydroid survived attack, however, compared to 54% in shells without Hydractinia. Continuous observation of predation in aquaria showed that hermit crabs in shells with Hydractinia had significantly shorter survival times when attacked by a blue crab than hermit crabs in shells without the colonial hydroid. The crushing resistance of shells was measured with an InstronTM testing machine. A comparison of the regression equations of shell mass (g) vs. crushing resistance (N) between shell types showed that shells with Hydractinia had a lower slope than shells without Hydractinia, although because of a wide range in crushing resistance, this difference was not significant. Shells with Polydoran worm burrows, however, were significantly weaker than shells without burrows, and shells with Hydractinia were more likely to hold worms than shells without Hydractinia. The positive correlation between Hydractinia and shell-degrading worms explains the vulnerability of hermit crabs in shells with the colonial hydroid to predation by blue crabs. Other studies have shown that hermit crabs may benefit from having Hydractinia on their shells because the hydroid prevents large and potentially harmful ectosymbionts, such as Crepidula species, from colonizing. Thus, for Pagurus longicarpus the costs and benefits of the association with Hydractinia may change depending upon the presence of other organisms and this may shift the nature of the association with Hydractinia from mutualism to commensalism to parasitism.

AB The dramatic increase in soil degradation in the last few decades has led to the need to identify methods to define not only soil quality but also, in a holistic approach, soil health. In the past twenty years, indices based on living communities have been proposed alongside the already proven physical-chemical methods. Among them, some soil invertebrates have been included in monitoring programs as bioindicators of soil quality. Being an important portion of soil fauna, soil arthropods are involved in many soil processes such as organic matter decomposition and translocation, nutrient cycling, microflora activity regulation and bioturbation. Many studies have reported the use of soil arthropods to define soil quality; among taxa, some have been explored more in depth, typically Acari and Collembola, while generally less abundant groups, such as Palpigradi or Embioptera, have not been investigated much. This paper aims to evaluate and compare the use of different soil microarthropod taxa in soil degradation/quality studies to highlight which groups are the most reported for soil monitoring and which are the most sensitive to soil degradation. We have decided not to include the two most present and abundant taxa, Acari and Collembola, in this paper in consideration of the vast amount of existing literature and focus the discussion on the other microarthropod groups. We reported some studies for each taxon highlighting the use of the group as soil quality indicator. A brief section reporting some indices based on soil microarthropods is proposed at the end of this specific discussion. This paper can be considered as a reference point in the use of soil arthropods to estimate soil quality and health.

   SHIFTS; COVER; LIFE; MAP
AB Changing forest cover is a key driver of local climate change worldwide, as it affects both albedo and evapotranspiration (ET). Deforestation and forestation are predicted to have opposing influences on surface albedo and ET rates, and thus impact local surface temperatures differently. Relationships between forest change, albedo, ET, and local temperatures may further vary regionally, as the strengths of warming by albedo effects and cooling by ET effects vary with latitude. Despite these important relationships, the magnitude of forest cover effects on local surface temperature across the globe remains unclear. Using recently-released global forest change data, we first show that forestation and deforestation have pervasive and opposite effects on LST, ET and albedo worldwide. Deforestation from 2000 to 2010 caused consistent warming of 0.38 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SE) and 0.16 +/- 0.01 degrees C in tropical and temperate regions respectively, while forestation caused cooling in those regions of -0.18 +/- 0.02 and -0.19 +/- 0.02 degrees C. Tropical forests were particularly sensitive to the climate effects of forest change, with forest cover losses of similar to 50% associated with increased LST of 1.08 +/- 0.25 degrees C, whereas similar forest cover gains decreased LST by -1.11 +/- 0.26 degrees C. Secondly, based on a new structural equation model, we show that these changes on LST were largely mediated by changes in albedo and ET. Finally, based on this model, we show that predicted forest changes in Brazil associated with a business-as-usual land use scenario through 2050 may increase LST up to 1.45 degrees C. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the mechanistic inter-relationships between forest change and changes in albedo, ET and LST, and provide additional evidence that forestation has the potential to reverse deforestation impacts on local climate, especially in tropical and temperate regions.

AB 1. Active restoration strategies have been recommended to recover Neotropical savannas in abandoned lands, but no studies have investigated the trajectories and speeds of spontaneous recovery for these systems. Research into the dynamics of degraded savannas is urgently needed to guide restoration decision making.
   2. We analysed the dynamics of secondary savannas in the Brazilian Cerrado by sampling 29 abandoned pastures (time since abandonment ranging from 3 to 25 years) and applying the space-for-time substitution method. We modelled the temporal changes in plant community attributes and estimated the time (years) required for these attributes to match those of two reference ecosystems (three replicates each), old-growth savanna and a forest-type savanna, which had encroached following fire suppression (encroached savanna). We also analysed the plant community composition of the study sites.
   3. Our models showed that tree canopy cover, richness and density rapidly increased with time since pasture abandonment, easily surpassing the values of the old-growth savanna (28 years) and reaching the values of encroached savanna 49 years after abandonment. The cover and richness of the ground layer increased at a much slower pace. Since the species in this layer, including the exotic grasses, are shade intolerant, they will be eliminated by canopy closure over time.
   4. Up to 25 years after abandonment, secondary savannas continued to lack many (37%) old-growth savanna species, mostly from the ground layer (82% of grasses absent). This period was also not sufficient for the secondary savannas to become floristically similar to the encroached savannas, which are dominated by shade-tolerant tree species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Despite the reported high natural regeneration of Neotropical savanna vegetation, abandoned pastures will not spontaneously return to an old-growth savanna state. Protected from fire and lacking the native ground layer, the end state of secondary savannas will be a low-diversity forest. If restoration goals include the recovery of old-growth savanna biodiversity and structure, interventions are required to prevent woody encroachment and reintroduce native grasses, forbs and shrubs. However, if the desirable endpoint is a low-diversity forest, passive restoration (non-intervention) and fire protection are appropriate.

AB The Atlantic Forest is an intensely fragmented and globally important ecological hotspot. In this context, the objective of this study was to analyze the landscape ecology and submit proposals for creating ecological corridors (ECs) in a Brazilian Atlantic Forest region. Landscape ecology metrics, based on the forest fragments map, were used for the analysis. Suggested corridors were based on least-cost path analysis, considering land use, declivity, permanent preservation areas (PPM), and forest fragment sizes. Although the predominant class sizes in the study area are small fragments, landscape ecology analysis has shown good environmental quality for fragments larger than 100 ha that do not lose their central area, even for the largest edge distances. Four ECs were proposed, with an average length of 53.86 km, average width of 5.39 km, and average area of 28,786.32 ha. Land use conflicts showed that the fragments within the corridors were situated in a matrix dominated by grassland. PPM within the proposed corridors were dominated by misused land and did not comply with environmental legislation. The proposed corridors were efficient in using the largest fragments, which have the least edge effect and provide necessary support for most wildlife. However, we emphasize that other factors can influence the delimiting of ECs; additional studies are required to obtain more effective ECs to connect habitats. The proposed methodology can be applied to other Brazilian and global ecoregion.

AB 1. Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are critically endangered, and their restoration is understudied. Large-scale passive restoration efforts in north-west (NW) Costa Rica have catalysed TDF regeneration but are not effective on degraded Vertisols, where active restoration is necessary due to high content of shrink-swell clays that impede regeneration following degradation.
   2. We established a large-scale restoration experiment in degraded former pastures in NW Costa Rica to determine (1) the restoration potential of native TDF tree species on Vertisols, (2) if plant functional traits elucidate mechanisms behind interspecific variability in species performance and (3) if affordable and readily available soil amendments increase seedling survivorship and growth. We planted 1,710 seedlings of 32 native species coupled with five amendments aimed at ameliorating root-zone microclimatic conditions: sand, rice hulls, rice hull ash, hydrogel and unamended controls. For each species, we quantified a suite of resource-acquisition and ecophysiological functional traits, and monitored survival and growth seasonally over 2 years.
   3. Interspecific survivorship after 2 years ranged widely (0%-92.5%). Functional traits including wood density, photosynthetic parameters and upregulation of integrated water-use efficiency, explained interspecific variation in survivorship and growth at distinct ontogenetic stages. Easily measured leaf traits, however, were not good predictors of restoration potential.
   4. Hydrogel and sand amendments increased initial seedling survival, but after 2 years no differences among treatments were found.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown it is possible, albeit challenging, to-restore tropical dry forest (TDF) on degraded Vertisols. Our results support the use of functional trait-based screenings to select tree species for restoration projects as tree species with high survivorship and growth in this stressful environment have overlapping ecophysiological functional traits. Furthermore, practitioners should consider water-use and photosynthetic traits when designing initial-species mixes for TDF restorations.

AB Seasonality causes fluctuations in resource availability, affecting the presence and abundance of animal species. The impacts of these oscillations on wildlife populations can be exacerbated by habitat fragmentation. We assessed differences in bat species abundance between the wet and dry season in a fragmented landscape in the Central Amazon characterized by primary forest fragments embedded in a secondary forest matrix. We also evaluated whether the relative importance of local vegetation structure versus landscape characteristics (composition and configuration) in shaping bat abundance patterns varied between seasons. Our working hypotheses were that abundance responses are species as well as season specific, and that in the wet season, local vegetation structure is a stronger determinant of bat abundance than landscape-scale attributes. Generalized linear mixed-effects models in combination with hierarchical partitioning revealed that relationships between species abundances and local vegetation structure and landscape characteristics were both season specific and scale dependent. Overall, landscape characteristics were more important than local vegetation characteristics, suggesting that landscape structure is likely to play an even more important role in landscapes with higher fragment-matrix contrast. Responses varied between frugivores and animalivores. In the dry season, frugivores responded more to compositional metrics, whereas during the wet season, local and configurational metrics were more important. Animalivores showed similar patterns in both seasons, responding to the same group of metrics in both seasons. Differences in responses likely reflect seasonal differences in the phenology of flowering and fruiting between primary and secondary forests, which affected the foraging behavior and habitat use of bats. Management actions should encompass multiscale approaches to account for the idiosyncratic responses of species to seasonal variation in resource abundance and consequently to local and landscape scale attributes.

AB This paper provides the first analysis at the sub-municipality scale of the relationships between population densities and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon between 2000 and 2010. We use the database on deforestation published by the Brazilian space research center (INPE) and the population census data released by the federal geographical and statistical agency IBGE at their finest scale: the census tract level. By crossing the population density and deforestation variables, we identify ten human settlement patterns in the Amazon. There are low-low and high-high classes of population density and deforestation, but also low-high and high-low classes. This analysis helps understand the low overall relations in the Amazon for population and deforestation. We emphasize the expansion of large-scale agriculture and cattle ranching as causing the depopulation of rural areas while in many regions of the Amazon quite strong population densities coexist with relatively low extents of deforestation. Such findings stress the need to implement case-specific public policies in these regions in order to encourage human presence compatible With the conservation of forest cover and biodiversity. We also confirm the importance of the Amazon urbanization process, including the 'discrete urbanization' of rural areas, and the need to better recognize the distinct social and environmental problems of urban areas.

AB Salvage logging following windthrow is common throughout forests worldwide even though the practice is often considered inimical to forest recovery. Because salvaging removes trees, crushes seedlings, and compacts soils, many warn this practice may delay succession, suppress diversity, and alter composition. Here, over 8 yr following windthrow, we experimentally evaluate how salvaging affects tree succession across 11 gaps in Eastern deciduous forests of Pennsylvania, wherein each gap was divided into salvaged and control (unsalvaged) halves. Our gaps vary in size and windthrow severity, and we explicitly account for this variation as well as variation in soil disturbance (i.e., scarification) resulting from salvaging so that our results would be generalizable. Salvage logging had modest and ephemeral impacts on tree succession. Seedling richness and density declined similarly over time in both salvaged and unsalvaged areas as individuals grew into saplings. The primary impact of salvaging on succession occurred where salvaging scarified soils. Here, salvaging caused 41 to 82% declines in sapling abundance, richness, and diversity, but these differences largely disappeared within 5 yr. Additionally, we documented interactions between windthrow severity and scarification. Specifically, low-severity windthrow and scarification combined reinforced dominance by shade-tolerant and browse-tolerant species (Acer pensylvanicum, Fagus grandifolia). In contrast, high windthrow severity and scarification together reduced the density of a fast-growing pioneer tree (Prunus pensylvanica) and non-tree vegetation cover by 75% and 26%, respectively. This reduction enhanced the recruitment of two mid-successional tree species, Acer rubrum and Prunus serotina, by 2 and 3-fold, respectively. Thus, our findings demonstrate that salvaging creates novel microsites and mitigates competing vegetation, thereby enhancing establishment of important hardwoods and promoting tree species coexistence. Our results, coupled with an assessment of 27 published post-windthrow salvage studies, suggest short-term studies may overestimate the impact of salvaging on regeneration. We conclude that the ecological costs and benefits of salvaging depend upon the variation in canopy and soil disturbance severity as well as the timescale at which effects are evaluated. Thus, our findings are inconsistent with the view that salvaging inexorably undermines plant diversity; rather we suggest salvaging can promote tree species coexistence within various contexts.

AB Selective logging can alter the biota (presence of seed source) and distribution of resources (light and soil factors), modifying the performance of seedlings. To evaluate these effects on forest regeneration processes is of critical importance, since reduced impact logging (Rh) has been advocated as a potential tool for conservation. We describe the abiotic alterations caused by selective logging and examine the effect of disturbances on the abundance and performance of seedlings of seven trees species. To test long-term effects we evaluated the regeneration process in a chronosequence spanning 11-years after logging in which 144 plots were sampled, representing an area of 300,000 ha in the central Amazonia. Seedling performance was affected by habitat alterations caused by logging. Growth is enhanced in logged sites for up to three years after logging for all species. However, in five out of seven species, the mortality rates found in logged were higher than the ones in control sites up to 11 years after logging. For most species the presence of a seed source is the most important factor determining the number of regenerating individuals. This effect of dispersal limitation on seedlings can affect tree regeneration on logged areas, since no rules limit the number of individuals per species that can be harvested per hectare. Demographic responses to abiotic alterations resulting from selective logging affect tree species regeneration patterns, and in a long term can influence the structure of tropical forest communities. We concluded that over time the habitat becomes less suitable for species regeneration on logged areas. These results indicate that RIL can have more effects on tree regeneration than previously supposed. Methods to minimize these effects (mainly on survivorship rates) should be considered in future management plans. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forest biophysical structure - the arrangement and frequency of leaves and stems - emerges from growth, mortality and space filling dynamics, and may also influence those dynamics by structuring light environments. To investigate this interaction, we developed models that could use LiDAR remote sensing to link leaf area profiles with tree size distributions, comparing models which did not (metabolic scaling theory) and did allow light to influence this link. We found that a light environment-to-structure link was necessary to accurately simulate tree size distributions and canopy structure in two contrasting Amazon forests. Partitioning leaf area profiles into size-class components, we found that demographic rates were related to variation in light absorption, with mortality increasing relative to growth in higher light, consistent with a light environment feedback to size distributions. Combining LiDAR with models linking forest structure and demography offers a high-throughput approach to advance theory and investigate climate-relevant tropical forest change.

AB Tropical seasonal forests in Southeast Asia are among the most important biomes in terms of global and local hydrologic and carbon fluxes, and their vulnerability to climate change. We conducted eddy flux measurements in a teak (Tectona grandis Linn. f.) plantation in northern Thailand over a 6-year period; this forest undergoes a drastic seasonal change in foliage with somewhat constant incident radiative energy. We used a combination of actual evapotranspiration (ET) flux data and an inversed version of a simple two-layer ET model for estimating the mean canopy stomatal conductance (g(s)). The main novelty of this analysis is that canopy conductance can be extracted from total surface conductance (including the canopy and forest floor effects), and thus environmental and biological controls of g(s) are explicitly compared among seasons and years. The relationship between seasonal variations in the leaf area index (LAI) and g(s) revealed an apparent effect of leaf age on leaf gas exchange capacity: within a year, g(s) peaked earlier than full-leaf expansion and abruptly declined after the peak of LAI. We used this result to classify three leaf age stages: leaf-out, mid-growing, and leaf-senescence seasons. Then, two ecophysiological parameters, the reference value of g(s) (g(sref)), and the sensitivity of g(s) to atmospheric demand (m), as well as their proportion (m/g(sref)), were derived from the logarithmic response curve of g(s) to vapor pressure deficit (VPD) for each season. We showed seasonal variation in g(sref) as follows: leaf-out season approximate to mid-growing season > leaf-senescence season. m demonstrated little seasonality and little interannual variation was observed in either parameter. This resulted in a value of almost 0.6 for m/g(sref) during the leaf-senescence season and of less than 0.6 in the leaf-out and mid-growing seasons, which suggests that the teak trees had strict stomatal regulation to prevent excessive xylem cavitation during the leaf-senescence season (i.e., under drought conditions) and less strict stomatal regulation during the leaf-out and mid-growing seasons (i.e., under moist conditions) when little risk of water stress-induced hydraulic failure would occur. In addition, we obtained a simple linear relationship between soil moisture and g(sref), which can be a powerful tool for further research of land atmosphere interactions using global climate and vegetation dynamics models.

AB Deforestation in the tropical Andes is affecting ecological conditions of streams, and determination of how much forest should be retained is a pressing task for conservation, restoration and management strategies. We calculated and analyzed eight benthic metrics (structural, compositional and water quality indices) and a physical-chemical composite index with gradients of vegetation cover to assess the effects of deforestation on macroinvertebrate communities and water quality of 23 streams in southern Ecuadorian Andes. Using a geographical information system (GIS), we quantified vegetation cover at three spatial scales: the entire catchment, the riparian buffer of 30 m width extending the entire stream length, and the local scale defined for a stream reach of 100 m in length and similar buffer width. Macroinvertebrate and water quality metrics had the strongest relationships with vegetation cover at catchment and riparian scales, while vegetation cover did not show any association with the macroinvertebrate metrics at local scale. At catchment scale, the water quality metrics indicate that ecological condition of Andean streams is good when vegetation cover is over 70%. Further, macroinvertebrate community assemblages were more diverse and related in catchments largely covered by native vegetation (>70%). Our results suggest that retaining an important quantity of native vegetation cover within the catchments and a linkage between headwater and riparian forests help to maintain and improve stream biodiversity and water quality in Andean streams affected by deforestation. This research proposes that a strong regulation focused to the management of riparian buffers can be successful when decision making is addressed to conservation/restoration of Andean catchments.

AB Semi-arid and arid ecosystems dominated by shrubs ("dry shrublands") are an important component of the global C cycle, but impacts of climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2 on biogeochemical cycling in these ecosystems have not been synthetically assessed. This study synthesizes data from manipulative studies and from studies contrasting ecosystem processes in different vegetation microsites (that is, shrub or herbaceous canopy versus intercanopy microsites), to assess how changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 affect biogeochemical cycles by altering plant and microbial physiology and ecosystem structure. Further, we explore how ecosystem structure impacts on biogeochemical cycles differ across a climate gradient. We found that: (1) our ability to project ecological responses to changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 is limited by a dearth of manipulative studies, and by a lack of measurements in those studies that can explain biogeochemical changes, (2) changes in ecosystem structure will impact biogeochemical cycling, with decreasing pools and fluxes of C and N if vegetation canopy microsites were to decline, and (3) differences in biogeochemical cycling between microsites are predictable with a simple aridity index (MAP/MAT), where the relative difference in pools and fluxes of C and N between vegetation canopy and intercanopy microsites is positively correlated with aridity. We conclude that if climate change alters ecosystem structure, it will strongly impact biogeochemical cycles, with increasing aridity leading to greater heterogeneity in biogeochemical cycling among microsites. Additional long-term manipulative experiments situated across dry shrublands are required to better predict climate change impacts on biogeochemical cycling in deserts.

AB Dwarf bamboos are an important understory component of the lowland and montane forests in the subtropical regions of Asia and South America, yet little is known about their physiology and phenotypic plasticity in response to changing light environments. To understand how bamboo species adapt to different light intensities, we examined leaf morphological, anatomical, and physiological differentiation of Sinarundinaria nitida (Mitford) Nakai, a subtropical woody dwarf bamboo, growing in open and shaded natural habitats in the Ailao Mountains, SW China. Compared with leaves in open areas, leaves in shaded areas had higher values in leaf size, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen, and chlorophyll concentrations per unit area but lower values in leaf thickness, vein density, stomatal density, leaf carbon concentration, and total soluble sugar concentration. However, stomatal size and leaf phosphorus concentration per unit mass remained relatively constant regardless of light regime. Leaves in the open habitat exhibited a higher light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, dark respiration rate, non-photochemical quenching, and electron transport rate than those in the shaded habitat. The results of this study revealed that the bamboo species exhibited a high plasticity of its leaf structural and functional traits in response to different irradiances. The combination of high plasticity in leaf morphological, anatomical, and physiological traits allows this bamboo species to grow in heterogeneous habitats.

AB The desire to improve urban sustainability is motivating many city planners to adopt growth strategies that increase residential density, leading to substantial changes to urban landscapes. What effect this change will have on biodiversity remains unclear, but it is expected that the role of public greenspace in providing wildlife habitat will become critical. We explored the role of urban "pocket parks" as habitat for birds, and how this role changed with increasing residential density in the surrounding neighbourhood. We found that parks in neighbourhoods with high levels of public greenspace (corresponding to less residential land) supported more bird species and individuals overall, and more woodland-dependent species, insectivores and hollow-nesters. Total greenspace area was more important (included in the best ranked models for all bird responses) than the configuration (number, average size and connectivity) of greenspace patches. The majority of species were common suburban birds, indicating that species we assume are tolerant to urban areas will be negatively affected by increasing residential density. Parks form part of an interconnected network of urban open space. For parks to continue to support a diverse native bird community, the network must be viewed, managed, and maintained in its entirety. We suggest three key management actions to improve the bird diversity values of urban greenspaces in compact cities: (1) Increase urban greenspace cover in residential neighbourhoods. (2) Increase vegetation structure in greenspace. (3) Encourage homeowners to plant trees and shrubs.

AB Seasonal shifts in bacterial diversity of microbial mats were analyzed in three hot springs (39-68 A degrees C) of Patagonia, using culture-independent methods. Three major bacterial groups were detected in all springs: Phyla Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and Order Thermales. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Green Non-Sulfur Bacteria were also detected in small amounts and only in some samples. Thermophilic filamentous heterocyst-containing Mastigocladus were dominant Cyanobacteria in Porcelana Hot Spring and Geyser, and Calothrix in Cahuelm, followed by the filamentous non-heterocyst Leptolyngbya and Oscillatoria. Bacteroidetes were detected in a wide temperature range and their relative abundance increased with decreasing temperature in almost all samples. Two Meiothermus populations with different temperature optima were found. Overall, fingerprinting analysis with universal bacterial primers showed high similarities within each hot spring despite differences in temperature. On the other hand, Cahuelm Hot Spring showed a lower resemblance among samples. Porcelana Hot Spring and Porcelana Geyser were rather similar to each other, possibly due to a common geological substrate given their geographic proximity. This was even more evident with specific cyanobacterial primers. The different geological substrate and the seawater influence in Cahuelm might have caused the differences in the microbial community structure with the other two hot springs.

AB Much of the forest remaining in South East Asia has been selectively logged. The processes promoting species coexistence may be the key to the recovery and maintenance of diversity in these forests. One such process is the Janzen-Connell mechanism, where specialized natural enemies such as seed predators maintain diversity by inhibiting regeneration near conspecifics. In Neotropical forests, anthropogenic disturbance can disrupt the Janzen-Connell mechanism, but similar data are unavailable for South East Asia. We investigated the effects of conspecific density (two spatial scales) and distance from fruiting trees on seed and seedling survival of the canopy tree Parashorea malaanonan in unlogged and logged forests in Sabah, Malaysia. The production of mature seeds was higher in unlogged forest, perhaps because high adult densities facilitate pollination or satiate pre-dispersal predators. In both forest types, post-dispersal survival was reduced by small-scale (1 m(2)) conspecific density, but not by proximity to the nearest fruiting tree. Large-scale conspecific density (seeds per fruiting tree) reduced predation, probably by satiating predators. Higher seed production in unlogged forest, in combination with slightly higher survival, meant that recruitment was almost entirely limited to unlogged forest. Thus, while logging might not affect the Janzen-Connell mechanism at this site, it may influence the recruitment of particular species.

AB This study investigated changes in diversity of shrub-tree layer, leaf decomposition rates, nutrient release and soil NO fluxes of a Brazilian savanna (cerrado sensu stricto) under N, P and N plus P additions. Simultaneous addition of N and P affected density, dominance, richness and diversity patterns more significantly than addition of N or P separately. Leaf litter decomposition rates increased in P and NP plots but did not differ in N plots in comparison to control plots. N addition increased N mass loss, while the combined addition of N and P resulted in an immobilization of N in leaf litter. Soil NO emissions were also higher when N was applied without P. The results indicate that if the availability of P is not increased proportionally to the availability of N. the losses of N are intensified. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In addition to patch-level attributes (i.e., area and isolation), the nature of land cover between habitat patches (the matrix) may drive colonization and extinction dynamics in fragmented landscapes. Despite a long-standing recognition of matrix effects in fragmented systems, an understanding of the relative impacts of different types of land cover on patterns and dynamics of species occurrence remains limited. We employed multi-season occupancy models to determine the relative influence of patch area, patch isolation, within-patch vegetation structure, and landscape matrix on occupancy dynamics of nine Neotropical insectivorous birds in 99 forest patches embedded in four matrix types (agriculture, suburban development, bauxite mining, and forest) in central Jamaica. We found that within-patch vegetation structure and the matrix type between patches were more important than patch area and patch isolation in determining local colonization and local extinction probabilities, and that the effects of patch area, isolation, and vegetation structure on occupancy dynamics tended to be matrix and species dependent. Across the avian community, the landscape matrix influenced local extinction more than local colonization, indicating that extinction processes, rather than movement, likely drive interspecific differences in occupancy dynamics. These findings lend crucial empirical support to the hypothesis that species occupancy dynamics in fragmented systems may depend greatly upon the landscape context.

AB 1. The term 'dispersal limitation' represents two distinct component processes: the number of seeds produced (fecundity) and the spatial pattern of the seed rain (distribution). We present a quantitative evaluation of these component processes of dispersal limitation for a tropical forest tree community.
   2. Using a regularly spaced grid of 289 seed traps (0.5 m(2) each), we monitored the seed rain into 1.44 ha of upper Amazonian floodplain forest for 6 years whilst concurrently monitoring sapling recruitment in a 0.81-ha subplot centred within the seed-trapping grid. This arrangement allowed us to compare the spatial pattern of seed rain with that of sapling recruitment.
   3. We endeavoured to distinguish between undispersed and dispersed seeds by applying a series of criteria to seeds collected in the traps and by removing from certain analyses all seeds that fell under reproductive conspecifics. Gross fecundity of 30 common species that contribute to the advanced regeneration was uniformly low and the rain of dispersed seeds was lower still, being < 1.0 m(-2) year(-1) in every case.
   4. The rain of dispersed seeds with respect to conspecific reproductives closely matched the recruitment of saplings, whereas gross seed rain (all seeds, including undispersed seeds) did not.
   5. Synthesis. 'Dispersal limitation' in this faunally intact Amazonian forest is primarily attributable to a scant rain of dispersed seeds, i.e. fecundity limitation, whereas the distribution of dispersed seeds, being random for most species, appears adequate. Evidence from this and earlier research at the same site indicates that the per-capita success of dispersed seeds is many times higher than that of undispersed seeds. Thus, seed dispersal kernels that do not distinguish between dispersed and undispersed seeds are likely to be biologically misleading.

AB Demographic and genetic replenishment of populations through the exchange of individuals is essential for their persistence. Habitat loss and fragmentation can reduce the permeability of landscapes, hinder dispersal and compromise the genetic integrity of populations over time. We examined ecological connectivity in an arboreal marsupial, the common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) in fragmented forests of southeastern Australia. This species is potentially robust to fragmentation based on its presence in degraded landscapes and known use of plantations for foraging and nesting. Using 312 individuals screened at 15 microsatellites, we measured dispersal and gene flow across seven native Eucalyptus forest remnants surrounded by exotic Pinus radiata plantations and three sites within a large continuous forest. The permeability of the pine matrix to dispersing possums was significantly lower than that of the native forest. Small, isolated patches exhibited signatures of genetic drift, having lower heterozygosity and allelic richness than possums in large patches. Most (87%) possums were born in their sampled patch or dispersed only short distances into neighbouring remnants. The continuous forest was identified as an important source of immigrants only for proximate patches (within 2.5 km), thus emphasizing for the common ringtail possum and more specialized arboreal mammals the need to conserve large, proximate forest remnants. Our findings highlight the importance of using genetic tools to understand the long-term biological consequences of fragmentation for effective management.

AB Plantations of exotic trees for industrial and agricultural purposes are burgeoning in the tropics, and some of them offer the opportunity to study community ecology of animals in a simplified forest setting. We examined bird community assembly in different aged groves of the industrial tree mangium (Acacia mangium) at two plantations in Malaysian Borneo: Sabah Softwoods near Tawau, Sabah, and the Planted Forest Project, near Bintulu, Sarawak. Bird communities were compared among three age-groups of mangium (2-, 5-, and 7-years old) and logged native forest. Mangium rapidly developed into a secondary forest consisting of a wide diversity of understory trees and shrubs. The bird community correspondingly increased in species richness and diversity, and we were able to relate these increases specifically to canopy height, secondary canopy development, and shrub cover. Species of common, small bodied frugivores, nectarivores, and insectivores were diverse in older plantation groves, as were common mid-sized insectivores. However, large, specialized, and normally uncommon taxa (e.g., galliforms, pigeons, hornbills, barbets, midsized woodpeckers, muscicapine flycatchers, and wren babblers) were rare or nonexistent in the plantations. Because we lacked species-specific data on foraging, nesting, and other behaviors of most groups of birds, it was difficult to explain the precise causes of seral diversification in any group except woodpeckers, which have been well studied in Southeast Asia. Thus, in future, particular emphasis needs to be placed on obtaining such data. Industrial plantations, by virtue of their simple structure, variably aged groves, and bird community richness, are good places to gather such data. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines the soil hydrological and erosional effects of ant mounds during summer and winter conditions following a wildfire in scrub terrain in eastern Spain. Forty rainfall simulations (1 m(2) plots, 1 h duration, 78 mm h(-1) intensity) were carried out over plots with mounds (n = 20) and mound-free control plots (n = 20) in August 2002, and repeated in December. By winter, some of the mound material had been removed and some vegetation regrowth occurred. Overall, mound presence increased soil erodibility in summer and winter due to the availability of highly erodible mound material. However, mound plots showed higher mean overland flow rates in summer (10.1 vs 6.9% for control plots) but lower rates in winter (59.3 vs 74.4% for control plots). This reversal is suggested to be caused by (i) post-fire changes in ground cover and (ii) seasonal differences in antecedent soil moisture. First, immediately after burning, an absorbent ash layer covered much of the soil surface, but this was partially masked by less permeable mound material, reducing infiltration on mound plots. By winter, the ash layer had been largely removed and ash particles clogged soil surface pores, reducing overall infiltration on control plots compared to mound plots. Second, during summer, the dry soil underneath the absorbent ash cover has a high infiltration capacity. In winter, soils are near saturation, resulting in a much greater runoff coefficient. Under these wet soil conditions, the presence of macropores (i.e. nest entrances) becomes important, reducing overland flow in mound plots. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A multitemporal analysis to determine the land cover change was conduced in the pre-Andean range of Maule region of Chile. We used satellite imagery from the year 1989 and 2003 to analyze the likely causes of native forest change. In this period, there was a reduction in native forest area of 44% in the study area, which is equivalent to an annual forest loss rate of 4.1%. The native forest area is replaced by shrublands (29%) and exotic forest plantations (27%). A great proportion of current exotic forest plantations are established on lands that were native forest in 1989 (63%). Most forest loss was associated with intermediate elevation and less distance to road network, where native forest area dominated. Native forest replacing by shrublands was associated to selective forest logging and firewood, which leads to degradation of these forests. Native forest replacing by exotic forest plantations was the result of the forestation incentive and an increase in the demand for forest products such as wood and pulp. Because of multiple impacts of the forest loss, we propose to focus the government incentives. Priority areas for incentives must be characterized by high forest loss rate and poverty, presence of threatened species and low availability of water from catchments. Moreover, we propose to prioritize the connectivity of the current network protected areas and to develop an effective forest management monitoring system using advanced technologies.

AB Above-ground biomass (AGB) is increasing inmost of the Amazon forests. One hypothesis is that forests are responding to widespread and intense human intervention prior to the European conquest (> 500 y ago). In this study we confront this hypothesis with changes in AGB over 6.3 y in a large western Amazonian forest plot (> 150 000 shrubs and trees and 1100 species with dbh >= 10 mm in 2 5 ha). We examined AGB flux in different habitats and across diameter classes. The forest lost small stems (4.6%), gained large trees (2.61%), and gained biomass (0.7%). The change in AGB stock was due entirely to this upward shift in size leading to more canopy trees and fewer saplings after just 6 y. Across habitats, the biggest increment in biomass was in the secondary-forest patch (3.4% y(-1)) which we know was cleared about 27 y ago, whereas mature forest on ridges and valleys had small increases (0.10%, and 0.09% y(-1), respectively). In both censuses. AGB stocks were > 50% higher on the ridge than in the valley while relative growth and mortality were higher in the valley. Mean wood specific gravity (WSG) decreased with increasing diameter class: WSG did not change much between censuses in mature forests and did not contribute to the change in AGB stocks. Our forest increased its standing biomass, but far less than the average reported for other Amazonian forests (i.e. 0.30 vs. 0.98 Mg ha(-1) y(-1)). We find no evidence to support the notion that this forest is recovering from long-past human intervention. Instead of a long-term recovery. we believe the forest changed in response to natural fluctuations of the environment (e.g. changes in precipitation, higher CO2). windstorms or other more recent events. The significant differences in AGB stocks between valley and ridge suggest that the terra firme forests are a mosaic of natural habitats, and that this mosaic is in part responsible for the variation in biomass stocks detected in Amazonian terra firme forests.

AB Trees, perennial phanerophytes, display a rich variety of rhythmic phenomena. These are either due to exclusive environmental entrainment or due to the functioning of endogenous oscillators independent of the environment. Both types of rhythms are covered in this review. Purely environment controlled rhythms may be considered as a prelude to endogenous rhythms. Environment controlled rhythms discussed are (i) the diurnal rhythms of nyctinastic and heliotropic leaf movements and oscillatory phenomena of photosynthesis, such as the midday depression and Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), and (ii) the annual rhythms of annual growth ring formation, autumnal leaf senescence, over wintering mechanisms and flowering. Among the diurnal rhythms, nyctinastic movements and CAM are also free-running endogenous rhythms showing the operation of circadian clocks in trees. In leaf senescence, over wintering, and flowering control, photoperiod sensing is involved which suggests the participation of endogenous clocks. A question asked is if diurnal and annual rhythms are mechanistically correlated. Evidently, phenological phenomena based on photoperiodism (as dependent on measurement of night length) are co-ordinately regulated by the phytochrome system and the circadian clocks and many aspects of annual developments and over wintering are linked to photoperiodism. The existence in trees of circadian clock genes as known to be anchored in the genome of A. thaliana can be assessed by attempts of alignment with the sequenced genome of Populus or by isolating cDNA clones from trees to check them against the genome of A. thaliana. At extreme latitudes near the equator and north of the polar circle trees also display photoperiod-independent phenological phenomena. In the polar region, total irradiance of red and far red light could possibly be involved and the signalling pathway then involves phytochrome, and thus, may still be similar to that of photoperiodism. At the equator, total daily light irradiance received or sensing the dynamics of daily changes in solar irradiance are essential and it remains enigmatic whether signalling cascades are either attached to the circadian clocks in a still unknown way or totally independent of circadian clocks.

AB Human predation has affected population size structures (in the sense of distribution of body size within particular populations), which has been used to track losses of larger and more fertile individuals from populations. In this sense, human exploitation can also decrease the reproductive output of invertebrate populations such as the endangered limpet Patella ferruginea. A total of 7077 individuals of this protected limpet were analysed among 'Under custody" and "Without custody" sites, the strongest indication of human exploitation being the absence of a great number of larger limpets at "Without custody" sites. Likewise, recruitment was lower in "Without custody" than in "Under custody" sites, although the mean density was not affected. The presence of 4084 individuals inside the harbour area of Ceuta indicates the requirement of the involvement of harbour authorities and environmental agencies in a global conservation plan, establishing small fenced reserve areas in artificial breakwaters and natural substrates where dense populations are settled. These reserves could be useful as a focus for larval export via their previous rebalance of sex ratio.

AB The general reluctance of policy makers to include forests in discussions about global warming has changed with the development of C measures to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD). Mesoamerica presents a logical starting point to promote REDD due to the extent of its forest, and the relatively advanced state of its forest management institutions and policies. This paper reviews the prospects for REDD in Mesoamerica using PES and other instruments, with emphasis on the effectiveness of REDD measures at reducing emissions, and their efficiency and fairness. It Concludes that in spite of reduced deforestation in the region, the growth of payments to avoid deforestation will be the most important policy change related to REDD in the region in the coining years. However, the magnitude and impact of any payments must not be exaggerated and Should be set in context of the overall trends resulting from broader social and economic dynamics.

AB Grazing, fire and selective tree cutting are major disturbances that shape species diversity in savanna ecosystems, yet their effects are highly variable. We carried out a factorial experiment with two levels to examine the effects of grazing, fire and selective tree cutting on herbaceous species richness, abundance and diversity on two sites in the Sudanian savanna-woodlands of Burkina Faso for 10 years (1994-2003). The results showed significant inter-annual variation in species richness, abundance and diversity at both sites (p<0.001), while main or combined effects of fire, grazing and selective cutting were very limited and varied between life forms and sites. Grazing tended to favour the diversity of perennial grasses; fire tended to influence the richness of annual grasses and abundance and diversity of perennial grasses while selective tree cutting had no effect on any of the vegetation attributes assessed. The combined effect of grazing, fire and selective cutting tended to increase the diversity of forbs. In many cases, the responses of herbaceous species to treatments were clearer on the site with deeper soils than the one with shallow soils. Depending on the site and treatments, the inter-annual variation in vegetation attributes was partly related to amount and/or frequency of rainfall and partly to inter-annual variation in grazing or fire intensity. It can be concluded that both disturbances and climatic condition influence the structure and diversity of herbaceous flora in the Sudanian savanna-woodland ecosystem. The responses were site-specific, which accentuates the importance of landscape-scale approaches to understand the impacts of disturbances on composition, structure and diversity of savanna ecosystems.

AB Background and Aims Neutral theory predicts that the diversity and relative abundance of species in ecological communities do not depend on their specific traits. This prediction remains controversial, as many studies suggest that variations in the niches of species determine the structure of communities. The aim of this study was to test empirically the relative importance of niche and neutral processes as drivers of species abundance within plant communities along a successional gradient.
   Methods Information on the abundance (density and frequency) and traits (aboveground individual biomass and seed mass) of > 90 species was collected in alpine and sub-alpine meadows of the Tibet Plateau (China). A successional gradient (1, 3, 15 and 30 years after abandonment) was established in a sub-alpine meadow. The relationships between species traits and their abundance were evaluated using regression models.
   Key Results Seed mass was negatively related to both species density (r = -0.6270, P < 0.001) and frequency (r = -0.5335, P = 0.005) in the 1-year meadow. Such relationships disappeared along the successional gradient evaluated (P > 0.07 in the 3-, 15- and 30-year meadows). Data gathered in all sites showed a significant negative relationship between the average individual biomass of a given species and its density within the community (r < -0.30, P < 0.025 in all cases).
   Conclusions The results show that seed mass was a key driver of species abundance in early successional communities, and that niche forces may become more important as succession progresses. They also indicate that predictions from neutral theory, in its current form, do not hold for the meadow communities studied.

AB Plant size often influences shade tolerance but relatively few studies have considered the functional response of taller plants to contrasting light environments. Several boreal and sub-boreal Abies, Picea and Pinus species were studied along a light (0-90% full sunlight) and size (30-400-cm high) gradient to examine the interactive influence of tree size and light availability on aboveground biomass distribution. Sampling was conducted in two regions of Canada: (A) British Columbia, for Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt., the Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss x R engelmannii Parry ex. Engelm. complex and Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm.; and (B) Quebec, for Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., Picea glauca (Moench. Voss) and Pinus banksiana (Lamb.).
   All biomass distribution traits investigated varied with size, and most showed a significant interaction with both size and light, which resulted in increasing divergences among light classes as size increased. For example, the proportion of needle mass decreased as size increased but the rate of decrease was much greater in saplings growing at below 10% full sunlight. Needle area ratio (total needle area: aboveground mass) followed a similar pattern, but decreased more rapidly with increasing tree size for small trees up to I m tall. The proportion of needle biomass (needle mass ratio) was always lower in taller trees (i.e., > 1 m tall) than in small trees (< 1 m tall) and increasingly so at the lowest solar irradiances (0-10% full sunlight). Thus, extrapolating the functional response to light from small seedlin- to taller individuals is not always appropriate.

AB Fallow periods used in slash-and-burn agriculture in the Bragantina region, the oldest agricultural frontier in the Brazilian Amazon, are being reduced. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of a shortened fallow period on the Bragantina landscape dynamics and equilibrium. Dynamics were characterized by landscape structural changes, particularly in the spatial distribution of secondary forests, and by transition matrix. Equilibrium was defined by temporal and spatial parameters, and by the increment of agricultural areas from 1985 to 1996, analyzed with 6 LANDSAT-TM images. I worked with 6 areas of 250 ha each, 3 with short fallow periods (2-4 years) and 3 with long fallow periods (about 10 years). Results showed that short fallow period areas did not present an equilibrium situation. In these areas, developed secondary vegetation tended to disappear and agricultural areas were being expanded at an average rate of 3% per year. Landscape structure changes pointed out that a reduction in fallow period was occurring in already short fallow period areas. Long fallow period areas presented a shifting mosaic steady-state condition, where punctual changes due to agricultural uses were compensated by field abandonment rate. Both agricultural uses and field abandonment rates were lower in long fallow period areas when compared with short ones. Comparisons with indigenous traditional cropping-fallow cycles indicate that sustainable conditions could be maintained with 11 years of fallow for each cropping year, while shorter cycles would break down the system if agricultural improvements are not implemented.

AB Enrichment planting is commonly used for enhancing the density of desired tree species in secondary forests. Bertholletia excelsa is one of the most important economic species of northern Bolivia, and there is interest in increasing its density in secondary forests. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of line planting on the survival, height growth and crown traits of Bertholletia plants growing in a secondary, forest. Seedlings were planted randomly to five different treatments: cutting lines of 2, 4, and 6 m wide, total clearing of the vegetation, and untouched vegetation; each with four replications. Light levels were estimated twice during the experiment using hemispherical photographs. Survival and height growth were measured for a period of 4 years, while crown traits were measured once.
   Cutting lines with different widths resulted in significantly different canopy openness (range 16-55%). The reduction in canopy openness above the plant crown through the study period ranged from 32 to 54% depending on the treatment. Survival rate of Bertholletia plants was lower in the untouched vegetation (86.5% per year) than in the other treatments (97% per year). After 4 years, mean plant height ranged from 0.7 to 3.9 m. Height growth rate was higher during the period 1995-1996 than during 1998-1999, and it was higher in the more open treatments, Crown traits of the Bertholletia plants varied with plant size, and were not affected by treatment.
   There was no effect of line width on survival of Bertholletia plants, but plants grew better in height in the 6 m line width and the total clearing of the vegetation. These results indicate that for enrichment planting of secondary forests with Bertholletia, it is necessary to open and to maintain line widths that allow for a canopy openness in the range of 25-40% to guarantee high rates of height growth.

AB The Janzen-Connell escape hypothesis predicts that the success of tree propagules increases with distance from the parent tree. Fleshy fruits that are transported in the guts of frugivores are believed to have evolved to facilitate the wide dispersal of seeds. However, some fragivores deposit seeds in latrines, thus creating aggregations of seeds that are large enough to attract seed predators and negate the advantages of dispersal. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) often produce large seed deposits since they habitually defecate in latrines. The survival of wild black cherry (Prunus serotina) seeds in simulated raccoon latrines was monitored in areas with natural levels of food availability and in areas to which supplemental food had been supplied to the primary seed predators. Dispersal of seeds by raccoons did not necessarily provide effective protection from post-dispersal seed predation at natural food levels. Once the resident seed predators had located the latrines, the majority of the seeds were quickly removed. However, seed removal from raccoon latrines was reduced significantly and dramatically by the addition of alternative food. This implies that raccoon latrines may represent safe sites for tree recruitment during periods of high food availability such as during masting events, thus providing conditional support for the escape hypothesis.

AB The interactive effects of irradiance and N on growth of young tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) were studied. Plants were grown at 70 or 300 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1), hereafter referred to as 'low' and 'high' irradiance, and at a range of exponential N supply rates (70-370 mg g(-1) d(-1)) or at a constant concentration in the nutrient solution of 12 mM NO3-. At both irradiance levels, leaf area ratio was more important than net assimilation rate (NAR) in explaining effects of N on growth at mild N limitation. However, at severe N limitation, NAR became the most important parameter, as indicated by calculated growth response coefficients. Furthermore, this study shows that N supply and growth irradiance interacted strongly. The decrease of specific leaf area with increasing N limitation and increasing growth irradiance correlated with increasing leaf dry mass percentage and starch concentration. Furthermore, at low irradiance, plants partitioned more dry mass to the stem. Dry mass partitioning to roots increased with decreasing plant N concentration, and this relation appeared to be independent of irradiance. Shading increased plant N concentration and decreased dry mass partitioning to roots. Also, the relationship between plant N concentration and N partitioning to different plant organs was largely independent of growth irradiance.

AB Two classifications are presented that organize the major processes and theories addressing the high species diversity of tropical rain forests. The first typology organizes environmental and biological processes within a spatio-temporal hierarchy, whilst the second classifies 12 theories according to over-arching driving forces: genetic differentiation, environmental change, niche/habitat diversification and biotic interaction. The theories are reviewed and evaluated by delineating the development and current state of academic knowledge pertaining to each. General issues that arise from examining species diversity within the tropical realm are discussed and this indicates where the academic debate stands today. Some thoughts concerning future research avenues are included.

   Method Data on population density and body mass from 827 populations belonging to 330 different terrestrial mammal species were derived from a review of the literature.
   Results LOWESS and polynomial regression analysis indicated that the overall mass : density relationship on log-log scales was not linear and that the slope of this relationship behaves differently across the range of body mass. Body mass explained between 37 and 67% of the variability in population density depending upon the dietary category or the biome group. We also developed two multivariate models that can explain up to 65% of the variability in population density in terrestrial mammals. We also tested for a confounding effect of census area on the mass : density relationship on log-log scales in terrestrial mammals.
   Conclusions Our findings support previous studies suggesting that body mass is a major predictor of the variance in population density in terrestrial mammals. We suggest that the nonlinearity of the mass : density relationship may result from the fact that the overall distribution of body mass is a mixture of distributions across dietary groups and biomes. In contrast to body mass, our results indicate that climatic and geographical factors have a minor effect on population density. Although census area was closely correlated with body mass, body mass was generally a better predictor of population density than was census area.

AB We investigated the role of wood-boring insects in the creation of light gaps within mangrove forests. We compared the frequency of gaps caused by wood borers to other gap-forming processes and characterized the physical attributes of light gaps in mangrove forests on small islands in Belize. Methods of quantifying light gaps included aerial photography, ground surveys, and experimental plots. Small light gaps (less than or equal to 12 m(2)) were very common in Rhizophora mangle fringe, comprising almost: 22 percent of these forests. Rhizophora mangle gaps were smaller than gaps in Avicennia germinans forests. In R, mangle forests, gaps were caused by branch death, and in R germinans forests, gaps were caused primarily by downed trees. More than 91 percent of the gap-forming branches and boles in the R. mangle fringe were killed by a wood-boring cerambycid beetle, Elaphidion mimeticum, indicating that it is the major cause of small-scale disturbances in these forests. No trees or branches in the A. germinans forest were attacked by this beetle. In R. mangle forests, small gaps had significantly higher light levels and soil temperatures than areas under the closed canopy; however, soil conditions for sulfide concentrations, porewater salinity and redox potentials were similar in small gaps and under the closed canopy. Survival of R. mangle, A. germinans, and Laguncularia racemosa seedlings was also higher inside these small gaps, indicating their importance in regeneration of mangrove forests. Feeding by wood borers is thus an important type of indirect herbivory in mangrove forests, with a critical role in ecological processes such as gap dynamics.

AB Because hummingbirds are extremely sensitive to energy stress, yet often face conditions when energy intake is reduced or energy expenditures must be increased, they should have flexible energy budgets.  I experimentally measured the ability of two syntopic tropical hummingbird species to manage daytime energy budgets under conditions simulating natural foraging constraint, defined here as low nectar secretion rate, low flower density, or both.  I tested a territorial species, Amazilia saucerottei, and a traplining species, Chlorostibon canivetii, individually in a large flight cage at two rates of food delivery (HIGH = ad libitum, LOW = 64% of ad libitum) and two perch-to-feeder distances (NEAR = 4 m, FAR = 20 m).  Both species increased flight time when distance was increased (FAR > NEAR by 44%) and when rate of food delivery was reduced (LOW > HIGH by 23%).  However, birds on the HIGH food delivery rate did not increase food intake to compensate for increased flight expenditures to the FAR feeder.  Birds on LOW food maintained total rates of energy expenditure that were less than birds on HIGH food, and LOW food birds experienced no effect of feeder distance on expenditure.  These results appear to be due primarily to short-term reductions in perching metabolic rates (PMRs) by birds on LOW food or with the FAR feeder.  Reduced daytime PMRs helped to mitigate the potentially negative impacts of foraging constraint:  rates of mass loss of the LOW food birds were an estimated 48% less than if birds had maintained normal PMRs.  Reduced PMRs also enabled birds visiting the HIGH FAR feeder to maintain rates of mass gain equal to unconstrained birds (HIGH NEAR feeder).  Relative differences between species in energy management reflected their foraging modes.  The low-reward trapliner paid the greatest energy costs at LOW food, regardless of distance, due to its overall tendency for high flight time.  In contrast, the territorialist did poorly in the HIGH FAR treatment, due to flight expenditures associated with defending a rich but dispersed resource.  Although individual birds exhibited considerable flexibility in energy management, the foraging mode represented by each species appeared to be energetically specialized for particular levels of food availability and dispersion.

AB Understanding the dynamics of native forest loss and gain is critical for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, especially in regions experiencing intense forest transformations. We quantified native forest cover dynamics on an annual basis from 1990 to 2017 in Brazil's Atlantic Forest. Despite the relative stability of native forest cover during this period (similar to 28 Mha), the ongoing loss of older native forests, mostly on flatter terrains, have been hidden by the increasing gain of younger native forest cover, mostly on marginal lands for mechanized agriculture. Changes in native forest cover and its spatial distribution increased forest isolation in 36.4% of the landscapes. The clearance of older forests associated with the recut of 27% of younger forests has resulted in a progressive rejuvenation of the native forest cover. We highlight the need to include native forest spatiotemporal dynamics into restoration programs to better estimate their expected benefits and unexpected problems.

AB Abiotic constraints and biotic interactions act simultaneously to shape communities. However, these community assembly mechanisms are often studied independently, which can limit understanding of how they interact to affect species dynamics and distributions. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian neighborhood modeling approach to quantify the simultaneous effects of topography and crowding by neighbors on the growth of 124,704 individual stems 1cm DBH for 1,047 tropical tree species in a 25-ha mapped rainforest plot in Amazonian Ecuador. We build multi-level regression models to evaluate how four key functional traits (specific leaf area, maximum tree size, wood specific gravity and seed mass) mediate tree growth response to topography and neighborhood crowding. Tree growth is faster in valleys than on ridges and is reduced by neighborhood crowding. Topography and crowding interact to influence tree growth in similar to 10% of the species. Specific leaf area, maximum tree size and seed mass are associated with growth responses to topography, but not with responses to neighborhood crowding or with the interaction between topography and crowding. In sum, our study reveals that topography and neighborhood crowding each influence tree growth in tropical forests, but act largely independently in shaping species distributions. While traits were associated with species response to topography, their role in species response to neighborhood crowding was less clear, which suggests that trait effects on neighborhood dynamics may depend on the direction (negative/positive) and degree of symmetry of biotic interactions. Our study emphasizes the importance of simultaneously assessing the individual and interactive role of multiple mechanisms in shaping species dynamics in high diversity tropical systems.

AB The expansion of agricultural land remains one of the main drivers of deforestation in tropical regions. Stronger land property rights could possibly enable farmers to increase input intensity and productivity on the already cultivated land, thus reducing incentives to expand their farms by deforesting additional land. This hypothesis is tested with data from a panel survey of farm households in Sumatra. The survey data are combined with satellite imageries to account for spatial patterns, such as historical forest locations. Results show that plots for which farmers hold formal land titles are cultivated more intensively and are more productive than untitled plots. However, due to land policy restrictions, farmers located at the historic forest margins often do not hold formal titles. Without land titles, these farmers are less able to intensify and more likely to expand into the surrounding forest land to increase agricultural output. Indeed, forest closeness and past deforestation activities by households are found to be positively associated with current farm size. In addition to improving farmer's access to land titles for non-forest land, better recognition of customary land rights and more effective protection of forest land without recognized claims could be useful policy responses.

AB 1. Poaching is one of the greatest threats to wildlife conservation world-wide. However, the spatial and temporal patterns of poaching activities within protected areas, and the effectiveness of ranger patrols and ranger posts in mitigating these threats, are relatively unknown.
   2. We used 10 years (2006-2015) of ranger-based monitoring data and dynamic multi-season occupancy models to quantify poaching-related threats, to examine factors influencing the spatio-temporal dynamics of these threats and to test the efficiency of management actions to combat poaching in Nyungwe National Park (NNP), Rwanda.
   3. The probability of occurrence of poaching-related threats was highest at lower elevations (1,801-2,200 m), especially in areas that were close to roads and tourist trails; conversely, occurrence probability was lowest at high elevation sites (2,6013,000 m), and near the park boundary and ranger posts. The number of ranger patrols substantially increased the probability that poaching-related threats disappear at a site if threats were originally present (i.e. probability of extinction of threats). Without ranger visits, the annual probability of extinction of poaching-related threats was an estimated 7%; this probability would increase to 20% and 57% with 20 and 50 ranger visits per year, respectively.
   4. Our results suggest that poaching-related threats can be effectively reduced in NNP by adding ranger posts in areas where they do not currently exist, and by increasing the number of patrols to sites where the probability of poaching activities is high.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our application of dynamic occupancy models to predict the probability of presence of poaching-related threats is novel, and explicitly considers imperfect detection of illegal activities. Based on the modelled relationships, we identify areas that are most vulnerable to poaching, and offer insights regarding how ranger patrols can be optimally deployed to reduce poaching-related threats and other illegal activites, while taking into account potential sampling biases. We show that poaching can be effectively reduced by increasing ranger patrols to areas under high risk of poaching activities, and by adding ranger patrols near these sites. These findings are broadly applicable to national parks and protected areas experiencing a high degree of poaching and other illegal activities.

AB Tropical forest restoration is increasingly seen as an activity that may counteract or reduce biodiversity loss. However, few studies monitor fauna or consider measures of functional diversity to assess restoration success. We assessed the effect of a tropical montane forest restoration program on species and functional diversity, using amphibians as the target group. We compared amphibian assemblages in three types of land use: restoration areas, tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF; reference ecosystem) and cattle pastures (degraded ecosystem) in southern Mexico. We also described microclimate, microhabitat heterogeneity, woody vegetation structure and diversity for each type of land use, and their relationship to amphibian species and functional diversity. Compared to TMCF, restoration areas had similar environmental conditions. However, amphibian species richness was similar in the three types of land use and abundance was lower in the restoration areas. In TMCF, the amphibian assemblage was dominated by forest-specialist species, the pastures by generalist species, and the restoration areas by a combination of both species types. Interestingly, functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence did not vary with land use, though the number of functional groups in restoration areas and TMCF was slightly higher. Overall, the results suggest that after seven years, active restoration provided habitat heterogeneity and recovered woody vegetation capable of maintaining amphibian species and functional groups similar to those inhabiting TMCF. Forest fragments adjacent to restoration areas seem to facilitate fauna recolonization and this emphasizes the importance of the conservation of the reference ecosystems to achieving restoration success.

AB 1. Anthropocene defaunation is the global phenomenon of human-induced animal biodiversity loss. Understanding the patterns and process of defaunation is critical to predict outcomes for wildlife populations and cascading consequences for ecosystem function and human welfare.
   2. We investigated a defaunation gradient in north-eastern Gabon by establishing 24 transects at varying distances (2-30 km) to rural villages and surveying the abundance and composition of vertebrate communities. Distance from village was positively correlated with observations of hunting (shotgun shells, campfires, hunters), making it a good proxy for hunting pressure.
   3. Species diversity declined significantly with proximity to village, with mammal richness increasing by roughly 1 similar to 5 species every 10 km travelled away from a village. Compared to forest far from villages, the wildlife community near villages consisted of higher abundances of large birds and rodents and lower abundances of large mammals like monkeys and ungulates.
   4. Distance to nearest village emerged as a key driver of the relative abundance of five of the six taxonomic guilds, indicating that the top-down force of hunting strongly influences large vertebrate community composition and structure. Several measures of vegetation structure also explained animal abundance, but these varied across taxonomic guilds. Forest elephants were the exception: no measured variable or combination of variables explained variation in elephant abundances.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Hunting is concentrated within 10 km around villages, creating a hunting halo characterized by heavily altered animal communities composed of relatively small-bodied species. Although the strongest anthropogenic effects are relatively distance-limited, the linear increase in species richness shown here even at distances 30 km from villages suggests that hunting may have altered vertebrate abundances across the entire landscape. Central African forests store > 25% of the carbon in tropical forests and are home to 3000 endemic species, but roughly 53% of the region lies within the village hunting halo. Resource management strategies should take into account this hunting-induced spatial variation in animal communities. Near villages, resource management should focus on sustainable community-led hunting programmes that provide long- term supplies of wild meat to rural people. Resource management far from villages should focus on law enforcement and promoting industry practices that maintain remote tracts of land to preserve ecosystem services like carbon storage and biodiversity.

AB Brazil's riparian forests are continuously threatened by conversion into agricultural areas, causing not only degradation and loss of vegetation but also negative changes in soil properties and ecosystem services. In order to select vegetation and soil variables that are affected by degradation and to evaluate whether forest structure can be used as a proxy for soil ecosystem services, two watersheds in eastern Amazon were chosen as a study area in which four degradation levels were identified (very high, high, moderate and low), based on forest canopy openness and height. Vegetation structural characteristics, water infiltration rates, and soil properties were evaluated in 24, 1,000m(2) permanent plots. Results indicated that forest degradation significantly reduced soil carbon, phosphorus, cation exchange capacity, silt proportion, total porosity, and water content as well as water infiltration rate. Vegetation structure was a good proxy for monitoring soil ecosystem services (i.e. regulation of water flow, erosion control and life-supporting). Tree height and basal area, as well as herb biomass, were identified as the best vegetation indicators for changes in soil properties that underlie ecosystem services. Application of this strategy may facilitate the monitoring and modeling of riparian forest ecosystem services across broader spatial scales, to help guide efficient restoration efforts and conservation policies.

AB Adaptations to resource availability strongly shape patterns of community composition along successional gradients in environmental conditions. In the present study, we examined the extent to which variation in functional composition explains shifts in trait-based functional strategies in young tropical secondary forests during the most dynamic stage of succession (0-20 years). Functional composition of two size classes in 51 secondary forest plots was determined using community-weighted means of seven functional traits, which were intensively measured on 55 woody plant species (n = 875-1,761 individuals). Along the successional gradient in forest structure, there was a significant and consistent shift in functional strategies from resource acquisition to resource conservation. Leaf toughness and adult plant size increased significantly, while net photosynthetic capacity (A (mass)) decreased significantly during succession. Shifts in functional strategies within size classes for A (mass) and wood density also support the hypothesis that changes in functional composition are shaped by environmental conditions along successional gradients. In general, 'hard' functional traits, e.g., A (mass) and leaf toughness, linked to different facets of plant performance exhibited greater sensitivity to successional changes in forest structure than 'soft' traits, such as leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content. Our results also suggested that stochastic processes related to previous land-use history, dispersal limitation, and abiotic factors explained variation in functional composition beyond that attributed to deterministic shifts in functional strategies. Further data on seed dispersal vectors and distance and landscape configuration are needed to improve current mechanistic models of succession in tropical secondary forests.

AB Indigenous and rural communities have developed strategies aimed at supporting their livelihoods and protecting biodiversity. Motivational factors underlying these local conservation strategies, however, are still a largely neglected topic. We aimed to enrich the conceptualization of community-based conservation by exploring trigger events and motivations that induce local people to be engaged in practical institutional arrangements for successful natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. By examining the history and development of three community conservation initiatives in Brazil, Mexico, and Bolivia, we have illustrated and discussed two main ways of understanding community-based conservation from the interaction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. First, incentive-based conservation policies can stimulate people's economic interests and mobilize individual and collective behavior toward the formalization of conservation-oriented actions. Second, environmental justice concerns, such as international and national movements for the recognition of indigenous peoples' rights, can support local people's sense of autonomy and result in increased control over their territory and resources, as well as a renewed conservation commitment. The results are useful from a policy perspective because they provide insight into the governance of conservation development by bridging the gap between communities' culturally based motivations for conservation, which are still embedded in customary institutions, and broader political and socioeconomic contexts.

AB Land use changes in the Amazon region strongly impact soil macroinvertebrate communities, which are recognized as major drivers of soil functions (Lavelle et aL, 2006). To explore these relations, we tested the hypotheses that (i) soil macrofauna communities respond to landscape changes and (ii) soil macrofauna and ecosystem services are linked. We conducted a survey of macrofauna communities and indicators of ecosystem services at 270 sites in southern Colombia (department of Caqueta) and northern Brazil (state of Para), two areas of the Amazon where family agriculture dominates. Sites represented a variety of land use types: forests, fallows, annual or perennial crops, and pastures. At each site we assessed soil macroinvertebrate density (18 taxonomic units) and the following ecosystem service indicators: soil and aboveground biomass carbon stock; water infiltration rate; aeration, drainage and water storage capacities based on pore-size distribution; soil chemical fertility; and soil aggregation. Significant covariation was observed between macrofauna communities and landscape metric data (co-inertia analysis: RV = 0.30, p < 0.01, Monte Carlo test) and between macrofauna communities and ecosystem service indicators (co-inertia analysis: RV= 0.35, p<0.01, Monte Carlo test). Points located in pastures within 100 m of forest had greater macrofauna density and diversity than those located in pastures with no forest within 100 m (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p<0.01). Total macroinvertebrate density was significantly correlated with macroporosity (r(2) = 0.42, p<0.01), as was the density of specific taxonomic groups: Chilopoda (r(2) =0.43, p <0.01), Isoptera (r(2) =0.30, p<0.01), Diplopoda (r(2) =0.31, p <0.01), and Formicidae (r(2) = 0.13, p<0.01). Total macroinvertebrate density was also significantly correlated with available soil water (r(2) =0.38, p<0.01) as well as other soil-service indicators (but with r(2)<0.10). Results demonstrate that landscape dynamics and composition affect soil macrofauna communities, and that soil macrofauna density is significantly correlated with soil services in deforested Amazonia, indicating that soil macrofauna have an engineering and/or indicator function.

AB Forestry as a large industry has significant impacts on the quality of forest landscapes in boreal forests. In Finland, the rapid growth of nature-based tourism has expanded tourism and outdoor recreation activities from protected areas into commercial forests, especially in northern Finland. This has created demands to modify current forest management regimes, in particular regeneration practices. As the landscape and recreational benefits of forests mainly represent direct and indirect use values, there may be a case for a direct contractual mechanism of payments between the users (e.g. tourism entrepreneurs) and providers (forest owners). This paper presents the key results of a choice experiment study analyzing domestic and foreign tourists' demand for and willingness to pay for enhanced forest amenities, in particular landscape values and biodiversity, in private forests in the Ruka-Kuusamo tourism area in northeastern Finland. The results support the idea that tourists are willing to pay for selected improvements in the quality of outdoor recreation environments through adjustments in forest management in the case study area. Both foreign and domestic tourists were willing to pay for improvements in forest landscape, in terms of less frequent clear-cutting and site preparation areas along the routes, as well as for increased biodiversity. Foreign tourists' willingness to pay was significantly higher than domestic tourists'. Neither group would pay for extended outdoor recreation routes or increased carbon sequestration, even though reductions in these services would mean a welfare loss. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The seed-bank dynamics of cerrado, a savanna-like vegetation type in central Brazil, was monitored for a year after a fire event in the mid-dry season. Fifty paired soil and litter samples were collected 1 day before and 1 day after the fire to record the immediate effects on the seed bank, and thereafter at monthly intervals to investigate the post-fire seed bank dynamics. The samples were hand-sorted and the intact seeds were classified as monocot or dicot and counted. All seeds underwent germination trials in a germination chamber for 1 month. Seeds that did not germinate were checked for the presence and viability of the embryo. The sorted soil samples were placed in a greenhouse for 6 months, and the count of emerging seedlings was added to the number of germinated and dormant seeds from the germination trials to estimate the total number of viable seeds per sample. The fire did not affect the total seed-bank density: 63 +/- A 8 seeds m(-2) before the fire, and 83 +/- A 20 seeds m(-2) (mean +/- A se) immediately after it. Although monocots represented 65 % of the pre-fire seed bank, 1 year after the fire, the monocot seed density did not reach the pre-fire value, whereas the density of dicot seeds increased threefold. After the fire, the viable seed density and species richness, decreased with the onset of the rainy season coinciding with germination in the field. Therefore, post-fire recruitment increases genetic variability and contributes to the persistence of plant populations in cerrado communities.

AB In the Jomoro district in Ghana, tree plantations were the first cause of deforestation in the past, drastically reducing the area occupied by primary forests. The aim of this study was to quantify soil organic carbon (SOC) losses due to a change in land use from primary forest to tree plantations (cocoa, coconut, rubber, oil palm) on the different substrates of the district. Secondary forests and mixed plantations were also included in the study.
   Soils were sampled at different depths up to 100 cm along a series of chronosequences in each of the three substrates (Granite, Lower Birrimian and Tertiary Sands) present in the area.
   The highest SOC losses in the 0-30 cm layer were caused by the conversion of primary forests to tree plantations: cocoa -61 % of the original SOC stock, coconut -55 %, rubber -35 % and oil palm 28 %, while mixed plantations and secondary forests showed a loss of 23 % and 21 % of the original SOC stock, respectively. C losses were less apparent from the entire profile (to a depth of 100 cm).
   All conversions to tree plantations caused substantial SOC losses, comparable to the conversion of forests to agricultural systems. Secondary forests and mixed plantations were the only sustainable land uses that restricted SOC losses considerably.

AB Interest in pollinator-mediated evolutionary divergence of flower phenotype and speciation in plants has been at the core of plant evolutionary studies since Darwin. Specialized pollination is predicted to lead to reproductive isolation and promote speciation among sympatric species by promoting partitioning of (1) the species of pollinators used, (2) when pollinators are used, or (3) the sites of pollen placement. Here this last mechanism is investigated by observing the pollination accuracy of sympatric Pedicularis species (Orobanchacae).
   Pollinator behaviour was observed on three species of Pedicularis (P. densispica, P. tricolor and P. dichotoma) in the Hengduan Mountains, south-west China. Using fluorescent powder and dyed pollen, the accuracy was assessed of stigma contact with, and pollen deposition on, pollinating bumble-bees, respectively.
   All three species of Pedicularis were pollinated by bumble-bees. It was found that the adaptive accuracy of female function was much higher than that of male function in all three flower species. Although peak pollen deposition corresponded to the optimal location on the pollinator (i.e. the site of stigma contact) for each species, substantial amounts of pollen were scattered over much of the bees bodies.
   The Pedicularis species studied in the eastern Himalayan region did not conform with Grants Pedicularis Model of mechanical reproductive isolation. The specialized flowers of this diverse group of plants seem unlikely to have increased the potential for reproductive isolation or influenced rates of speciation. It is suggested instead that the extreme species richness of the Pedicularis clade was generated in other ways and that specialized flowers and substantial pollination accuracy evolved as a response to selection generated by the diversity of co-occurring congeners.

AB In a series of laboratory Y-maze experiments, we investigated the directional res ponse of juveniles of the muricid snail Concholepas concholepas, a rocky-shore keystone predator characteristic of the southeastern Pacific coast, in displaying prey detection and predator escape behaviour after 5 mo rearing under contrasting levels of pCO(2): 390 (present-day), 700 and 1000 mu atm CO2 (as expected in near-future scenarios of ocean acidification [OA]). Regardless of the experimental condition, juveniles significantly chose the Y-maze arm containing prey. In general terms, the directions of the displacement paths of the snails in the Y-maze were straight from the starting point to the final position, where the prey items were offered. Moreover, juveniles reared at present-day concentrations and 700 mu atm CO2 significantly avoided displacement in the Y-maze arm receiving predator odours. This predator-avoidance behaviour was disrupted in juveniles reared at 1000 mu atm CO2. In most cases, displacements recorded under such conditions were sinuous, and the trial individuals did not significantly choose the predator-free arm. In contrast, displacement paths recorded for snails reared at present-day concentrations and at 700 mu atm CO2 were straight from the initial to the final position, with displacements mostly ending near the prey and in the arm free of cues associated with predation. The loss of responses to a natural predator under high pCO(2) levels in the early ontogeny of C. concholepas may result in ecologically deleterious decisions by this keystone species. We conclude that the negative effects of OA on the chemosensory behaviour of keystone species could have negative consequences for community dynamics.

AB Brazil's Amazon rainforest provides an important environmental service with its storage of carbon, thereby reducing global warming. A growing number of projects and proposals intend to reward carbon storage services. Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is currently a key issue for negotiations on an international agreement that is to take effect in 2013. Various issues require decisions that will have substantial impacts on both the effectiveness of mitigation and the scale of Amazonia's potential role. These decisions include the effects that money generated from payments can have, the spatial scale of mitigation (e. g. projects or countries and sub-national political units), whether to have voluntary or mandatory markets, and whether these reductions will generate carbon credits to offset emissions elsewhere. It is argued that national-level programmes, combined with a national target under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, are the best solution for Brazil in terms of both capturing international funding and stimulating the major cuts in global emissions that are needed to minimize climate risk to the Amazon rainforest. The high likelihood of passing a tipping point for maintaining the Amazon rainforest implies the need for urgency in altering current negotiating positions.

AB Tropical dry forests (TDFs) host a large diversity of tree species but little is known of potential mechanisms that contribute to its maintenance. Given the paramount importance of water availability in such forests, tree species would be expected to show nonrandom patterns along water availability gradients, as well as differential individual species responses. In this work we explored whether that was true for 50 dominant tree species. Within a total area of 5.2 ha, divided into 26 transects each with ten 20 x 10 m plots, we registered presence-absence of these tree species with diameter at breast height >= 5 cm. We assessed the response of trees to four environmental variables differentially related to water availability in three steps: (1) identifying the shape of the response to individual environmental variables, (2) testing for artifacts in previous patterns due to spatial autocorrelation of presence-absence, and (3) identifying the environmental variable or combination of variables that best explained the pattern. We then classified the species with respect to their probability of occurrence along the gradient, and explored which components of the water cycle were likely to be driving the observed patterns. We found that 14 species were generalists, 16 drought tolerant, 9 intermediate, 3 water demanding and 8 showed mixed responses. Lateral flow and access to ground water most likely underlie such patterns. Our results confirm the key role played by water availability in tree species distribution. Water-related niche differentiation seems to be crucial for maintaining the high diversity of this TDF.

AB A central goal of conservation science is to identify the most important habitat patches for maintaining biodiversity on a landscape. Spatial biodiversity patterns are often used for such assessments, and patches that harbor unique diversity are generally prioritized over those with high community similarity to other areas. This places an emphasis on biodiversity representation, but removing a patch can have cascading effects on biodiversity persistence in the remaining ecological communities. Metacommunity theory provides a mechanistic route to the linking of biodiversity patterns on a landscape with the subsequent dynamics of diversity loss after habitat is degraded. Using spatially explicit neutral theory, I focus on the situation where spatial patterns of diversity and similarity are generated by the structure of dispersal networks and not environmental gradients. I find that gains in biodiversity representation are nullified by losses in persistence, and as a result the effects of removing a patch on metacommunity diversity are essentially independent of complementarity or other biodiversity patterns. In this scenario, maximizing protected area and not biodiversity representation is the key to maintaining diversity in the long term. These results highlight the need for a broader understanding of how conservation paradigms perform under different models of metacommunity dynamics.

AB Secondary forests are gaining increased importance in tropical landscapes and have recently been reported to act as potential belowground carbon sinks. While economic interest in the management of secondary forests to mitigate carbon emissions is rising, the dynamics of soil carbon stocks under these ecosystems remain poorly understood. Recent studies report conflicting results concerning soil carbon trends as well as multiple confounding factors (e.g. soil type, topography and land-use history) affecting these trends. In this study, organic carbon stocks were measured in the mineral soil up to 20 cm depth of at 24 active pastures, 5-8-year-old, and 12-15-year-old secondary forest sites on former pastures. Additionally, we estimated carbon stocks under a 100-year-old secondary forest and compared them to those of nearby mature forests. Abiotic conditions in the study area were homogenous, enabling us to isolate the effect of land-use change on soil organic carbon stocks. Contrary to our expectations, soil carbon stocks in the top 10 cm did not change with young secondary forest development. Pasture soils stored 24.8 +/- 2.9 Mg ha(-1) carbon (mean +/- standard error) in the top 10 cm, and no accumulation of soil carbon was apparent during the first 15 years of secondary succession. Soil carbon stocks under 100-year-old secondary forests, averaging 43.0 +/- 7.9 Mg ha(-1) (mean +/- standard error), were clearly higher than those recorded at younger sites and approached levels of soil carbon stocks under mature forests. These data indicate that soil carbon stocks in this region of Panama are not affected by the land-use transition from pasture to young secondary regrowth. However, an increase of soil carbon storage might be possible over a longer period of time. Our results support trends observed in other tropical areas and highlight the importance of environmental conditions such as soil properties rather than land-use transitions on soil carbon dynamics. While our understanding of organic carbon dynamics in tropical soils remains limited, these results underscore the challenges of undertaking short-term reforestation projects with the expectation of increasing soil carbon sequestration. 2010 Elsevier BM.

AB Land degradation, as a threat to smallholders in the tropics, attracts less attention than other global challenges. In addition, gaps between scientific understandings of land degradation and international policy regimes are problematic. We identify the three most significant debates including their different policy implications: desertification in the Sahel, nutrient depletion in Africa, and rural reforms in China. Using a political ecology frame across disciplines, scales of inquiry, and regional experiences, we nuance the often polarized scientific debate while seeking to bridge the gap between science and policy. Three main findings emerge: State-led rural reforms in China represent an important approach to land degradation; a renewed focus on agriculture and sustainability in development discourses opens new ways for tackling nutrient depletion with combined sociotechnological reforms; and a policy void in Africa paves the way for market mechanisms, such as payment for environmental services, that are insufficiently understood and put fairness at risk.

AB Aim
   Asian elephants, Elephas maximus, are threatened throughout their range by a combination of logging, large scale forest conversion and conflict with humans. We investigate which environmental factors, both biotic and abiotic, constrain the current distribution of elephants. A spatially explicit habitat model is constructed to find core areas for conservation and to assess current threats.
   Location
   Ulu Masen Ecosystem in the province of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia.
   Methods
   A stratified survey was conducted at 12 sites (300 transects) to establish the presence of elephants. Presence records formed the basis to model potential habitat use. Ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) is used to describe their niche and to identify key factors shaping elephant distribution. An initial niche model was constructed to describe elephant niche structure, and a second model focused on identifying core areas only. To assess the threat of habitat encroachment, overlap between the elephants' optimal niche and the occurrence of forest encroachment is computed.
   Results
   Elephants were recorded throughout the study area from sea level to 1600 m a.s.l. The results show that the elephant niche and consequently habitat use markedly deviates from the available environment. Elephant presence was positively related to forest cover and vegetation productivity, and elephants were largely confined to valleys. A spatially explicit model showed that elephants mainly utilize forest edges. Forest encroachment occurs throughout the elephants range and was found within 80% of the elephants' ecological niche.
   Main conclusions
   In contrast to general opinion, elephant distribution proved to be weakly constrained by altitude, possibly because of movement routes running through mountainous areas. Elephants were often found to occupy habitat patches in and near human-dominated areas. This pattern is believed to reflect the displacement of elephants from their former habitat.

AB The hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin) is a South American strict folivorous bird, with a crop microbial ecosystem that ferments dietary plants. Chicks progressively become independent from the adult-fed regurgitated crop liquids, and we hypothesized that the crop bacterial ecosystem develops through ecological succession mechanisms, as they grow into adults. The aim of this work was to compare the crop bacterial community in hoatzins from three age groups: newly hatched chicks, juveniles and adults by sequencing 16S rRNA genes and using the G2 PhyloChip. Cloning yielded a total of 2123 nearly full-length sequences binned into 294 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (with <97% homology) belonging to 7 phyla, with 91% of novel OTUs. The microarray identified a diverse bacterial community dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with similar to 1400 taxa grouped in 40 phyla that included those detected by cloning. In comparison with the adult, the hoatzin chick crop had a greater abundance of Flavobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae but lacked phyla DSS1, Deferribacteres and Termite group 1, which were mostly present in adults. The overall community structure of the crop of the hoatzin changes with age in a complex manner, probably responding to new niches made available through dietary changes related to the transition from dependent to independent feeding.

AB In tropical systems, habitat heterogeneity and resource availability have been reported as important factors driving ant species richness and composition. For this reason, these variables have been widely used as indicators of forest disturbance. The aim of this study was to compare the composition and richness of arboreal ants between the dry and wet seasons in three successional stages of a tropical dry forest at the Parque Estadual da Mata Seca, northern Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Ant sampling was performed in 15 plots in three different forest secondary stages: early, intermediate and late. Ants were sampled during the wet and dry seasons, using five pitfall traps per plot. We collected 43 ant species, distributed in 19 genera. Our results indicated a change on ant species composition along the successional gradient (p < 0.05). However, ant species richness did not differ between stages and seasons (p > 0.05) and was not affected by the variables used here as surrogates to habitat heterogeneity (tree richness) and resource availability (tree density) (p > 0.05). Ant composition did not change significantly between the dry and wet seasons for the early successional stage, but plots from the intermediate and late stages were clearly segregated according to seasons. We suggest that it is likely that 25 years of forest regeneration are enough to restore most of the arboreal ant communities in tropical dry forests, strengthening the importance of secondary habitats to biodiversity maintenance.

AB Whether neutral or deterministic factors structure biotic communities remains an open question in community ecology. We studied the spatial structure of a desert grassland grasshopper community and tested predictions for species sorting based on niche differentiation (deterministic) and dispersal limitation (neutral). We contrasted the change in species relative abundance and community similarity along an elevation gradient (i.e., environmental gradient) against community change across a relatively homogeneous distance gradient. We found a significant decrease in pairwise community similarity along both elevation and distance gradients, indicating that dispersal limitation plays a role in structuring local grasshopper communities. However, the distance decay of similarity was significantly stronger across the elevational gradient, indicating that niche-based processes are important as well. To further investigate mechanisms underlying niche differentiation, we experimentally quantified the dietary preferences of two common species, Psoloessa texana and Psoloessa delicatula, for the grasses Bouteloua eriopoda and Bouteloua gracilis, which are the dominant plants (similar to 75% of total cover) in our study area. Cover of the preferred host plant explained some of the variation in relative abundances of the two focal species, although much variance in local Psoloessa distribution remained unexplained. Our results, the first to examine these hypotheses in arid ecosystems, indicate that the composition of local communities can be influenced by both probabilistic processes and mechanisms based in the natural histories of organisms.

AB We report a mechanism of crypsis present during the vulnerable early post-metamorphic ontogeny (<= 20 mm peristomal length) of the muricid snail Concholepas concholepas, a rocky shore keystone predator characteristic of the southeastern Pacific coast. In the field, we found a significant occurrence (>95%) of specimens bearing patterns of shell coloration (dark or light colored) that matched the background coloration provided by patches of Concholepas' most abundant prey (mussels or barnacles respectively). The variation in shell color was positively associated with the color of the most common prey (r = 0.99). In laboratory experiments, shell coloration of C. concholepas depended on the prey-substrate used to induce metamorphosis and for the post-metamorphic rearing. The snail shell color matched the color of the prey offered during rearing. Laboratory manipulation experiments, switching the prey during rearing, showed a corresponding change in snail shell color along the outermost shell edge. As individuals grew and became increasingly indistinguishable from the surrounding background, cryptic individuals had higher survival (71%) than the non cryptic ones (4%) when they were reared in the presence of the predatory crab Acanthocyclus hassleri. These results suggest that the evolution of shell color plasticity during the early ontogeny of C. concholepas, depends on the color of the more abundant of the consumed prey available in the natural habitat where settlement has taken place; this in turn has important consequences for their fitness and survivorship in the presence of visual predators.

AB Market-based instruments such as payments, auctions or tradable permits have been proposed as flexible and cost-effective instruments for biodiversity conservation on private lands. Trading the service of conservation requires one to define a metric that determines the extent to which a conserved site adds to the regional conservation objective. Yet, while markets for conservation are widely discussed and increasingly applied, little research has been conducted on explicitly accounting for spatial ecological processes in the trading. In this paper, we use a coupled ecological-economic simulation model to examine how spatial connectivity may be considered in the financial incentives created by a market-based conservation scheme. Land use decisions, driven by changing conservation costs and the conservation market, are simulated by an agent-based model of land users. on top of that, a metapopulation model evaluates the conservational success of the market. We find that optimal spatial incentives for agents correlate with species characteristics such as the dispersal distance, but they also depend on the spatio-temporal distribution of conservation costs. We conclude that a combined analysis of ecological and socio-economic conditions should be applied when designing market instruments to protect biodiversity. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ants are a diverse and abundant insect group that form mutualistic associations with a number of different organisms from fungi to insects and plants. Here, we use a phylogenetic approach to identify ecological factors that explain macroevolutionary trends in the mutualism between ants and honeydew-producing Homoptera. We also consider association between ant-Homoptera, ant-fungi and ant-plant mutualisms. Homoptera-tending ants are more likely to be forest dwelling, polygynous, ecologically dominant and arboreal nesting with large colonies of 10(4)-10(5) individuals. Mutualistic ants (including those that garden fungi and inhabit ant-plants) are found in under half of the formicid subfamilies. At the genus level, however, we find a negative association between ant-Homoptera and ant-fungi mutualisms, whereas there is a positive association between ant-Homoptera and ant-plant mutualisms. We suggest that species can only specialize in multiple mutualisms simultaneously when there is no trade-off in requirements from the different partners and no redundancy of rewards.

AB Widespread loss of primary habitat in the tropics has led to increased interest in production landscapes for biodiversity conservation. In the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India, shade coffee plantations are located in close proximity to sites of high conservation value: protected and unprotected forests. Coffee is grown here under a tree canopy that may be dominated by native tree species or by nonnative species, particularly silver oak (Grevillea robusta). We investigated the influence of properties at the local scale and the landscape scale in determining bird communities in coffee plantations, with particular emphasis on species of conservation priority. We used systematic point counts in 11 coffee plantation sites and analyzed data in a randomized linear modeling framework that addressed spatial autocorrelation. Greater proportion of silver oak at the local scale and distance to contiguous forests at the landscape scale were implicated as factors most strongly driving declines in bird species richness and abundance, while increased basal area of native tree species, a local-scale variable, was frequently related to increased bird species richness and abundance. The influence of local-scale variables increased at greater distances from the forest. Distance to forests emerged as the strongest predictor of declines in restricted-range species, with 92% reduction in the abundance of two commonly encountered restricted-range species (Pompadour Green Pigeon and Yellow-browed Bulbul) and a 43% reduction in richness of bird species restricted to Indian hill forests within 8 km of forests. Increase in proportion of silver oak from 33% to 55% was associated with 91% reduction in the abundance of one commonly encountered restricted-range species (Crimson-fronted Barbet). One conservation strategy is providing incentives to grow coffee in a biodiversity-friendly manner. One implication of our study is that plantations located at varying distances to the forest cannot be compared fairly for biodiversity friendliness by existing certification methodology. Another is that conservation of existing forests at the landscape scale is essential for maintaining higher biodiversity in coffee plantations. Incentive schemes that promote conservation of remnant forests at the landscape scale and biodiversity-friendly practices locally and that relate to coffee communities as a whole rather than individual planters are likely to be more effective.

AB The composition of communities of sessile organisms, and the change in species diversity with time, is a spatially explicit phenomenon. Three spatial factors clearly affect diversity: (1) the structure and heterogeneity of the landscape that limits species immigration and ultimate community size; (2) neighborhood interactions that determine colonization and extinction rates and influence residence times of local populations; and (3) disturbances that open spatially contiguous areas for recolonization by less abundant species. The importance of these three factors was first reviewed and then examined with a spatially explicit, multi-species model of plant dispersal, competition and establishment, with an assumption of neutrality (all species had equivalent life histories) that reduced the initial dimensionality of the problem. The simulations assumed that the probability of immigration was a linear function of mainland abundance and distance to islands, similar to the equilibrium theory of island biogeography and the unified neutral theory of biodiversity. The rate of increase in species richness was not constant across island sizes, declining as island area became very large. This pattern was explained by the spatial dynamics of colonization and establishment, a non-random process that cannot be explained by passive sampling alone. Simulations showed that population establishment depended critically on rare long-distance dispersal events while population persistence was achieved by the formation of aggregated species distributions that developed through restricted dispersal and local competitive interactions. Nevertheless, species richness always declined to a single species in the absence of disturbances, while up to 40 species could persist to 10,000 years when spatially dependent mortality was added. Further explorations with spatially explicit models will be required to fully appreciate the consequence of land use change and altered disturbance regimes on patterns of species distribution and the maintenance of diversity.

AB Tropical savannas commonly exhibit large spatial heterogeneity in vegetation structure. Fine-scale patterns of soil moisture, particularly in the deeper soil layers, have not been well investigated as factors possibly influencing vegetation patterns in savannas. Here we investigate the role of soil water availability and heterogeneity related to vegetation structure in an area of the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). Our objective was to determine whether horizontal spatial variations of soil water are coupled with patterns of vegetation structure across tens of meters. We applied a novel methodological approach to convert soil electrical resistivity measurements along three 275-m transects to volumetric water content and then to estimates of plant available water (PAW). Structural attributes of the woody vegetation, including plant position, height, basal circumference, crown dimensions, and leaf area index, were surveyed within twenty-two 100-m(2) plots along the same transects, where no obvious vegetation gradients had been apparent. Spatial heterogeneity was evaluated through measurements of spatial autocorrelation in both PAW and vegetation structure. Comparisons with null models suggest that plants were randomly distributed over the transect with the greatest mean PAW and lowest PAW heterogeneity, and clustered in the driest and most heterogeneous transect. Plant density was positively related with PAW in the top 4 m of soil. The density-dependent vegetation attributes that are related to plot biomass, such as sum of tree heights per plot, exhibited spatial variation patterns that were remarkably similar to spatial variation of PAW in the top 4 m of soil. For PAW below 4 m depth, mean vegetation attributes, such as mean height, were negatively correlated with PAW, suggesting greater water uptake from the deep soil by plants of larger stature. These results are consistent with PAW heterogeneity being an important structuring factor in the plant distribution at the scale of tens of meters in this ecosystem.

AB The Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) at c. 55.8 Ma marks a transient (c. 100 ka duration) interval of rapid greenhouse warming that had profound effects on marine and terrestrial biota. Plant communities responded rapidly with major compositional turnover. The long-term effects on tropical vegetation communities that stein from the brief period of global warming are unclear. We present pollen data from the paratropical US Gulf Coast (eastern Mississippi, western Alabama and Georgia), which had background Palacogene mean annual temperatures of 26-27 degrees C. Sporomorph data (pollen and spores) demonstrate that taxonomic diversity increases over c. 1 Ma in the Late Palaeocene but this trend is replaced, with the first occurrences of taxa that mark the Early Eocene, by a pronounced extinction into the Early Eocene (c. 20% of the palynoflora). Taxonomic diversity also decreases by up to 38% in the Early Eocene. The timing of the extinction is not clearly resolved but may be restricted to the earliest part of the Early Eocene. Two richness estimators (Chao 2 and Jackknife 2) both demonstrate that Late Palaeocene samples contain significantly more taxa than those in the Early Eocene. Extinction on the US Gulf Coast proves that ancient tropical ecosystems were highly susceptible to changes in diversity mediated directly or indirectly by environmental change even during equable greenhouse climates in the early Palaeogene.

AB We used tree-rings to reconstruct long-term patterns of suppression, release and growth among five sympatric canopy tree species representing the full range of shade tolerance in a seasonal tropical forest in western Thailand. We expected that the frequency and duration of suppression and release events would be positively correlated with shade tolerance. All five species showed evidence of major and moderate growth releases. As expected, Melia azederach. an extreme heliophile. had the fewest releases. However, among the other species the number of major releases was consistent across the range of shade tolerance. The most significant difference among the species was the number of moderate releases recorded. There was a general positive correlation between the number of moderate releases and shade tolerance: however, Chukrasia tabularis. a relatively shade-intolerant species, had an anomalously high number of moderate releases. The study species also showed considerable variation in canopy accession strategies. The least common canopy accession strategy was establishment in the understorey and growth into the canopy in the absence of any gaps. However. with the exception of Melia, all four study species had one or more individuals that successfully reached the canopy using each of the four canopy accession strategies. These results highlight the importance of periodic or episodic bouts of gap formation on canopy tree recruitment and the utility of tree-rings for reconstructing long-term growth patterns in tropical trees.

SO FUTURES

DT Article
ID WILDLIFE POPULATIONS; RAIN-FOREST; EXTINCTION; IMPACTS; RESERVE
AB In recent decades, large expanses of tropical rainforest in central and western Africa have been cleared, logged, fragmented, and overhunted. In contrast, extensive forest in Gabon has survived in a relatively intact condition because the country has a sparse population and substantial petroleum and mineral deposits that have reduced economic pressures on forests. Unfortunately, Gabon's petroleum reserves are dwindling. As a direct result, industrial logging is expanding rapidly; nearly half of the country's forest is currently in timber leases, and this could increase to over 75% of the remaining forest during the next decade. Mechanized logging has important ecological impacts on forests, but the most severe effects are indirect, because loggers create labyrinths of roads that greatly increase access to forests for hunters and slash-and-burn farmers. Declines of forest wildlife from overhunting have been severe in much of tropical Africa, and are likely to rise sharply in Gabon as physical accessibility to forests increases.
   The Gabonese government is eager to consider afternative strategies to augment economic development, including promotion of an ecotourism industry. This commitment is evidenced by the government's recent designation of 13 new national parks that comprise over a tenth of the country's land area. Efforts to develop ecotourism face substantial challenges, however, including the high profitability of exploitative land uses like logging, the illegal encroachment of loggers and hunters into nature reserves, political instability in the surrounding region, and limited infrastructure for tourism. Nevertheless, these and other efforts to promote more-sustainable development should be strongly supported, as Gabonese forests have among the highest levels of species diversity and endemism in tropical Africa and are likely to play a critical future role in biodiversity conservation.

AB We examined bat diversity at two different spatial scales: habitat and matrix, in the Quindio coffee region in Colombia. Habitats were: forest, shaded coffee and associated coffee; and matrices were: associated coffee (M1) and shaded coffee (M2). Three sampling sites from each type of habitat were located at each matrix. The forest areas of the Quindio region are severely fragmented and less structurally complex than coffee patches. The shaded coffee habitat had patches that were larger and more complex. In spite of limited patch size and lower complexity, the forest remnants were those with greatest species richness and demonstrated clear similarities even between the two matrices. This was not observed in coffee plantations, neither in associated coffee nor shaded coffee. On the landscape scale, M2 slowed lower beta diversity and greater edge density (ED) than M1. This fact explains that greater connectivity between different habitats exists in M2 than in M1. Our results suggest that production and conservation are compatible, as maintenance of forest remnants in a mosaic structure by landowners of the vegetation is sufficient to conserve phyllostomid bats at landscape level.

AB This study investigated the influence of the width of patches of native eucalypt forest on bird occurrence in stands of exotic radiata pine (Pinus radiata) forests that surrounded such patches. Boundaries between eucalypt and pine forests were surveyed to examine bird occurrence and species richness at different distances in the pine matrix from eucalypt forest edges. Birds were counted by the area search method within 0.5 ha quadrats at 32 study sites (where sites spanned the boundaries of pine and eucalypt forests). Data were examined using generalised linear mixed models. Species richness and occurrence of particular species in quadrats located within pine forests decreased with increasing distance from eucalypt patches. This resulted, in part, from the fact that several species found in native patches also use pine plantations as additional foraging areas. Species richness decreased more quickly with distance from eucalypt patches in younger than in older pine stands. The width of native forest patches also influenced bird occurrence in adjacent pine forest matrix. Bird species richness decreased more rapidly in exotic plantations adjacent to wide rather than narrow patches of native forest. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have previously reported that dimensions of patches can influence the use of surrounding matrix. We introduce the term "halo effect" for the influence of patch attributes on the differential use of matrix adjacent to native patches. These patterns highlight that conservation efforts in patchy environments should protect not only native patches but also adjacent areas of matrix into which animals extend their home ranges.

AB 1 Few species of Indo-pacific mangroves co-occur at spatial scales of canopy gaps despite environmental heterogeneity and a flora that has varied physiological and morphological traits, but experiments on why such communities are species poor are uncommon.
   2 Lack of habitat partitioning, in concert with competitive exclusion, may explain low species richness at canopy gap scales. This study examined whether mangrove recruitment differs among species with respect to the effect of forest gap size, ground disturbance, position along an intertidal gradient and canopy membership.
   3 The canopy of a tropical mangrove forest in northern Australia was experimentally manipulated to create two gap sizes (50 m(2) and 225 m(2)) in low and high intertidal forests with or without sediment disturbance. Propagules of six species, from three mangrove families, were sown into treatments and their predation, establishment, growth and survival measured for 5 years.
   4 All species established, and five survived, in canopy gaps in both high and low intertidal positions. Interspecific difference in establishment, growth and survival of seedlings in two intertidal positions were not closely matched to canopy membership and hence this does not explain zonation.
   5 No seedlings survived under the canopy and there was little evidence for shade-tolerant species. The interactions between canopy treatments and sediment disturbance that would have indicated gap partitioning were not detected. Seedling growth and survival was enhanced in large canopy gaps but there were no growth differences among species that matched canopy membership of plots.
   6 Most species appear to be able to recruit in canopy gaps if there is no dispersal limitation. Rather, the range of species available to fill gaps is limited because predation of propagules advantages species that are from the adjacent canopy. Lack of partitioning of resources within gaps by species may result in the exclusion of competitors that are not canopy members, further reducing coexistence.

AB We report on the foraging behavior of three small-mammal species over 2 1/2 years using experimental foraging trays. Trays provisioned with oat seed were set out in the field at dawn and dusk, and the amount of seed consumed (with re-provisioning) was determined over three consecutive nights and days. Experiments simultaneously evaluated the role of lunar phase, season, and microhabitat (shrub vs. open); additionally, artificial exclosures (similar to0.56 ha) were employed to evaluate the influence both of mammalian and avian predators and of a dominant competitor species, the large diurnal degu (Octodon degus). Other principal small mammals included Darwin's leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini) and the olive field mouse (Akodon olivaceus). Trays were enclosed by hardware-cloth cages with either small or large holes in the side to exclude avian consumers and provide selective access to all small mammals (large holes) or to exclude the largest species (small holes). Small-mammal population sizes varied greatly throughout the study. Principal factors affecting seed consumption rates were population size, followed by season (winter > summer), and microhabitat (shrub > open). The role of the latter factors was relatively minor in 1999 and 2000 but amplified greatly in the final year of study when small-mammal numbers increased five-fold. In contrast to earlier work at this site, predation had minimal direct effects on foraging activities, although significant effects of microhabitat, lunar phase, and season suggest the importance of perceived predator risk. Both Phyllotis and Akodon foraged more in the absence of degus, and two- and three-way interactions further supported an important role for competition in this system. The combination of large-scale predator/ competitor manipulations with fine-scale foraging experiments and long-term replication illustrates the importance of utilizing such approaches to gain insights to behavior and foraging strategies in variable environments.

SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY

DT Article
ID TROPICAL FOREST CONSERVATION; DYNAMICS; AMERICA; SYSTEMS
AB This longitudinal study examines the impact of native hunting on the populations of 10 important game species in the Mbaracayu Reserve, Paraguay. From July 1994 to July 2001, native Ache research assistants surveyed 7,535 km of diurnal random transects in the reserve. Analyses of data from these transects and harvest-rate data from 5,526 Ache hunter days suggest that the hunting return rate declined significantly for one species. Nonsignificant declines were observed for 6 of the other 9 species. Native harvest percentages of the stock population appear sustainable for 10 major prey species, but rates of harvest from nonindigenous poaching could not be determined. Crude encounter rates for all 10 species declined over time, but only 2 of these were statistically significant in a univariate model. Multivariate logistic regression controlling for habitat type and location in the reserve showed significant declines in encounter rates over time for 4 species, but the effect of interaction between time and hunting pressure failed to confirm that declines in encounter rates were steeper in more-hunted versus less-hunted areas of the reserve. This may mean that other factors unrelated to hunting pressure are responsible for some of the declines in game encounter rates.

AB 1. Many studies discuss the adaptive value of plant architecture, but few have actually measured architectural effects on plant growth and survival. In this study, sapling growth and survival are related to crown traits for two tree species, Trophis mexicana (Liebm.) Bur. and Pseudolmedia oxyphyllaria Donn. Sm., in the Los Tuxtlas lowland rainforest of Mexico. The traits investigated were crown width, crown depth, number of leaves, number of leaves per unit crown area (horizontal self-shading), and number of leaves per unit silhouette area (vertical self-shading).
   2. Self-shading indices decreased with crown size, but were unaffected by the number of leaves per tree. Larger crowns thus had more diffuse foliage, with less self-shading.
   3. The number of leaves had positive effects on growth and survival, while self-shading indices had no effect. This indicates that shaded leaves do not necessarily have negative carbon balances.
   4. Negative effects of crown width on horizontal crown growth, and positive effects on vertical crown growth, suggest that saplings tend to grow towards a shape intermediate between the narrow and wide crown extremes.
   5. Survival was positively correlated with crown width in Pseudolmedia , and with the number of leaves in Trophis . Apparently, dependence of survival on crown traits differed among species.
   6. Crown traits affected plant growth and survival, but the hypothesis emerging from light-limited carbon acquisition was confounded by other factors, such as tree size and the inherent branching patterns.
   7. Crown traits are good and rather simple predictors of future sapling growth and survival, and may help foresters to select potential crop trees.

   EXPLOITATION; ORGANISMS
AB Evolution of a new policy for the management of marine fisheries in South Africa led to the Marine Living Resources Act of 1998 (MLRA). Among other innovations, this requires that management strategies be developed for subsistence fisheries. As a prerequisite, definitions and criteria are needed to identify and distinguish them. To achieve this, the Chief Director of Marine & Coastal Management (MCM), the authority responsible for managing marine fisheries, appointed a Subsistence Fisheries Task Group (SFTG) to make recommendations about definitions and modes of management. The process involved successive surveys and consultations with fishing communities, communication with MCM, and a national workshop of all participants. This led to consensus about the following definition:
   Subsistence fishers are poor people who personally harvest marine resources as a source of food or to sell them to meet the basic needs of food security; they operate on or near to the shore or in estuaries, live in close proximity to the resource, consume or sell the resources locally, use low-technology gear (often as part of a long-standing community-based or cultural practice), and the kinds of resources they harvest generate only sufficient returns to meet the basic needs of food security.
   This definition builds on the facts that existing subsistence fisheries are usually: (1) local operations; (2) customary, traditional or cultural; (3) undertaken for personal or family use; (4) primarily for nutritional needs (though excess resources may be sold to ensure food security); (5) based on minimal technology; and (6) undertaken by people with low cash incomes. They are specifically non-commercial and non-recreational. The definition was designed to allow protection of the rights of these people and sustainability of the resources. While developing this definition, it became obvious that the definition of "commercial fishing" in the MLRA is also inadequate, and a new definition was developed. Commercial fisheries span a wide spectrum, and the SFTG defined "small-scale commercial fishers" as a distinct component that has not received adequate attention, and for whom specific management plans need to be developed. They are distinguished by living on or close to the coast, having a history of involvement with fishing, being personally involved in hands-on day-to-day running of their enterprises, operating with limited amounts of capital investment and low levels of technology, and employing small numbers of people.

AB The mechanisms for species-specific growth responses to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration within narrow ecological groups of species, such as shade-tolerant, late-successional trees, have rarely been addressed and are not well understood. In this study the underlying functional traits for interspecific variation in the biomass response to elevated CO2 were explored for seedlings of five late-successional temperate forest tree species (Fagus sylvatica, Acer pseudoplatanus, Quercus robur, Taxus baccata, Abies alba). The seedlings were grown in the natural forest understorey in very low and low light microsites (an average of 1.3% and 3.4% full sun in this experiment), and were exposed to either current ambient CO2 concentrations, 500, or 660 mul CO2 l(-1) in 36 open-top chambers (OTC) over two growing seasons. Even across the narrow range of successional status and shade tolerance, the study species varied greatly in photosynthesis, light compensation point, leaf dark respiration (R-d), leaf nitrogen concentration, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio (LAR), and biomass allocation among different plant parts, and showed distinct responses to CO2 in these traits. No single species combined all characteristics traditionally considered as adaptive to low light conditions. At very low light, the CO2 stimulation of seedling biomass was related to increased LAR and decreased R-d, responses that were observed only in Fagus and Taxus. At slightly higher light levels, interspecific differences in the biomass response to elevated CO2 were reversed and correlated best with leaf photosynthesis. The data provided here contribute to a mechanistic process-based understanding of distinct response patterns in co-occurring tree species to elevated CO2 in natural deep shade. I conclude that the high variation in physiological and morphological traits among late-successional species, and the consequences for their responses to slight changes in resource availability, have previously been underestimated. The commonly used broad definitions of functional groups of species may not be sufficient for the understanding of recruitment success and dynamic changes in species composition of old-growth forests in response to rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2.

ID POPULATION-STRUCTURE; DEMOGRAPHY; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS
AB To assess the genetic consequences for a Neotropical tree of the loss of its main seed disperser, we compared the genetic structure of Inga ingoides in a site where the spider monkey (Ateles paniscus) was abundant and a site where it had been eliminated by subsistence hunting. Gene flow should be reduced in the site where the spider monkey is absent, and there should be a corresponding subpopulation differentiation of seedlings within the spatial range of the movements of these primates in the absence of between-site differences in allelic frequencies. At the microhabitat (family) scale, seedlings growing under-parent plants should be genetically more related in the absence of the spider monkey, than in its presence. Subpopulation differentiation was smaller where the spider monkey was present (four loci, F-ST = 0.011) than where it was absent (four loci F-ST = 0.053) for the first year of study, but not for the second year (three loci, F-ST = 0.005 vs. 0.003). The number of alleles in common among seedlings growing under parent plants was smaller in the presence of the spider monkey than in its absence, showing family genetic structure in the first generation for both years of study (Mann-Whitney, z = -2.17, p = 0.03 and z = -2.72, p =0.006 for 1996 and 1997, respectively). This family genetic structure in the first generation should accelerate the development of population genetic structure. Development of genetic structure might result in demographic changes, one of which would be a fitness I-eduction if the species were self-incompatible, as suggested for Inga by available evidence. Large birds and mammals are the main targets of subsistence hunting in the Neotropics. Extinction of seed-dispersing frugivores may result in pronounced changes in the demographic and genetic structure of tree species In Neotropical forests.

AB Seeds of seven tree species. sis shrub species, and one epiphyte were tested for their rates of removal by seed predators in two remnant patches (15-20 ha) of old-growth temperate forest in Chiloe Island, southern Chile (47 degrees 30'S). Field assays were aimed at assessing the rates of post-dispersal seed consumption, mainly by rodents and understory birds. Assays were conducted in summer and early fall of 1996 and 1997. We investigated whether seed consumption differed among habitats, between seasons and among species differing in seed mass and abundance in the canopy of remnant parches. Trays containing 20 seeds each, 6 8 replicate trays per species and habitat, were placed in the forest floor in each of three habitats: forest edges adjacent to pastures, forest interior (100 m away from any edge), and inside canopy gaps formed by tree falls. Overall, 7-65% of the seeds in experimental trays were removed by predators from 43 to 93% of all the trays within five days. Removal rates increased from mid-summer to tarry fall, presumably as a result of increasing density of birds and rodents. When seed removal rates differed among habitats. more seeds were taken from trays placed in forest interior than under canopy gaps. Forest margins had intermediate rates of seed removal. Marked differences in seed removal rates observed among species were unrelated to seed mass or plant species abundance. We conclude that season and habitat are the most important variables determining the intensity of seed predation in forest fragments. Seed predation rates recorded in live-day assays suggest that the regeneration of woody species, particularly in forest interior, may be affected by post-dispersal seed consumption by vertebrates.

AB Among the several hypotheses on selective advantage of seed dispersal, the directed dispersal hypothesis explains the advantage of non-random seed transportation by animals to particular patch type suitable for offspring establishment. We tested this hypothesis in dispersal of a large-seeded, rodent-dispersed tree (Aesculus turbinata) in a temperate forest. We investigated the change in location of seeds through secondary dispersal, and the survival and growth of seedlings at their destinations. Hemispherical photographs taken at the seed locations both before and after secondary dispersal were used to evaluate the consequence of dispersal. Survival and growth rates of seedlings were measured to evaluate the responses of seedlings to light, the most important factor for seedling establishment in A. turbinata. Survival and growth rates of the seedlings were both positively correlated with light conditions, indicating the advantage of dispersal to the microsites with more light available. However, light levels at seed destinations were not significantly different from those at the locations of seeds before secondary dispersal nor those of the surrounding background forest floor. Survival of newly-emerged seedlings varied as a function of light level but not seedling density. This suggests that the effect of density-dependent mortality was small relative to light-dependent mortality during the seedling stage. Therefore we conclude that the directed dispersal hypothesis for this species is rejected, and that the role of rodents in dispersing large seeds secondarily is more important for finding suitable sites merely by enlarging seed shadow (mean dispersal distance = 12.2-44.7 m during the 3 years studied, max. = 41.5-114.5 m) and relatively less important for escaping natural enemies.

AB The effect of 3 spatial heterogeneity scales on benthic community species richness, diversity, total biomass, biomass of dominant taxa (Fucaceae, littorinids and Mytilus edulis) and M. edulis recruitment was investigated in the intertidal zone over a 90 km portion of the south shore of the St. Lawrence Estuary, Quebec, Canada. Three scales of coastline heterogeneity and cascade (interaction) of these scales were examined using a nested and crossed design with replication. Large-scale heterogeneity (LSH) was determined with a shore heterogeneity index (SHI) which was the ratio of the length of the coastline, measured on a 1:20 000 map, over the 1 km Linear distance between end points. The SHI were classified as low, medium, and high. Within each of the 3 categories of LSH, 2 levels of medium-scale heterogeneity (MSH) were examined: linear coasts (100 m linear portions of the shore) and headlands (mean length 52 +/- 5 m). Within each of the MSH sections, small-scale heterogeneity (SSH) was investigated by sampling twenty 10 x 10 cm quadrats at positions upstream, apex and downstream. SSH was represented as 2 types of rock surfaces, flat exposed surfaces and crevices (n = 540). LSH did not influence the community characteristics considered, MSH had only a minor influence on them but SSH had a major influence on them. LSH explained 1% or less of biomass variance of taxa encountered; MSH explained at most 11% of biomass of littorinids; SSH explained 30% of variance in total biomass, 28% of biomass of M, edulis, and 21% of biomass of Fucaceae and littorinids. We also observed that some scale combinations affected the diversity and biomass of littorinids.

AB In this paper, we studied three species of prosimian primate (Propithecus diadema edwardsi, Eulemur fulvus rufus, and Eulemur rubriventer) from June-July 1995 at the Ranomafana National Park to answer three questions: 1) how they handle and process seeds, 2) how the physical properties of seeds influence seed handling and seed fate, and 3) whether handling and processing patterns influence seed dispersal. Seeds from five plant species were collected from feces and examined for external damage (punctures and scrapes), weighed, measured, and checked daily for germination. P. d. edwardsi masticated seeds into two or more pieces while feeding. Seed fragments were either dropped under the parent tree or chewed and swallowed; seeds never emerged as recognizable units in feces. In contrast, both Eulemur species either dropped or swallowed seeds whole while feeding. E. rubriventer passed seeds that were longer, wider, and heavier than seeds passed by E. f. rufus. Although seeds emerged as separate units when passed by both Eulemur species, 65 Protorhus sp. seeds were scraped and/or punctured prior to being swallowed. Based on physical property tests, Protorhus seeds were more susceptible to mastication than undamaged seeds from Eugenia sp., Cissus sp., and Chrysophyllum madagascariensis. H. madagascariensis seeds also were undamaged but had physical properties comparable to Protorhus and may avoid being masticated due to their small size (2-3 mm). All damaged seeds were moldy or rotten within 6 days, and only 15% of the undamaged seeds passed by E. rubriventer germinated. None of the seeds passed by E. f. rufus germinated. Eulemur species also rested in the same tree after feeding and defecated prior to a new feeding bout or before moving, so seeds were most likely to be dispersed under the parent tree. Consequently, we concluded that these primate species do not appear to serve as effective seed dispersers for these plant species at this time of year. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB A linkage between the two major modeling approaches to forest dynamics, transition Markovian models and JABOWA-FORET type simulators, is generated by developing a compact model of forest dynamics. This patch transition model utilizes functional roles instead of species. The roles or types are based on the regeneration and mortality characteristics of tree species; specifically, the requirements of canopy gaps for regeneration and the capacity to create canopy gaps upon death. A gap-size plot can be assigned to each of a set of states defined according to dominance of one of the roles. Transition probabilities among these states and mean holding times in each transition lead to semi-Markovian analytical calculations of the stationary state probabilities. Forest dynamics, as the proportions of total canopy space occupied by each role in a collection of gap-size plots, can be analyzed and simulated using a chain of first-order differential equations to emulate the distributed time-delays. Additional fixed time-delays in the transition of every pair of states is also included to account for long latencies. In addition to simplifying the simulations, the resulting model can also utilize available results of the theory of semi-Markov processes; and therefore, can provide analytical guidance to the simulations, the feasibility of direct exploration of hypothesis and the possibility of fast computation from closed-form solutions and formulae. These advantages can especially be useful in the simulation of landscape dynamics and species-rich tropical forests.

AB Clonal growth or vegetative propagation is widespread among plants, yet we still have no clear understanding of the circumstances under which it is favored over sexual reproduction (via seeds). Within some growth forms of rainforest plants (lianas, understory shrubs), vegetative propagation may be the primary means of regeneration. In this study, the mode and frequency of vegetative propagation in 30 co-occurring species of the tropical shrub genus Piper at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica was assessed through field observations made over several months. Piper species were found to propagate by several means, including stem sprouting, root sprouting, layering, and fragmentation. The mode and frequency of propagation varied significantly among habitats and among species. Shade-tolerant Piper species typical of mid- and late-successional habitats regenerated primarily by vegetative means, especially layering and fragmentation, while shade-intolerant, early-successional species appeared to reproduce and disperse primarily by seed. These differences among Piper species in regeneration mode were due not only to environment, but also to a genetic component, as indicated by experiments investigating the importance of one means of vegetative propagation, fragmentation, to Piper species from different successional habitats. A shadehouse experiment showed that early-successional species were less likely than late-successional species to regenerate from detached fragments, independent of light regime. This outcome was corroborated by a transplant experiment in forest understory and large gaps comparing fragment vs. seedling survival among five Piper species from different stages of succession over a 7-mo period. Almost none of the cuttings from early-successional species survived in either habitat. Species of later successional stages survived better as fragments in the understory than in gaps; however, surviving fragments grew larger in gaps. Almost no seedlings from experimentally planted seeds of any species survived in either gaps or understory. Natural seedlings of early-successional Piper species were frequently found in large treefall gaps and other disturbances, while seedlings of species from later succession were seldom found in any habitat.

AB Microorganisms are strongly influenced by the bottom-up effects of resource supply. While many species respond to fluctuations in the concentration of resources, microbial diversity may also be affected by the heterogeneity of the resource pool, which often reflects a mixture of distinct molecules. To test this hypothesis, we examined resource-diversity relationships for bacterioplankton in a set of north temperate lakes that varied in their concentration and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which is an important resource for heterotrophic bacteria. Using 16S rRNA transcript sequencing and ecosystem metabolomics, we documented strong relationships between bacterial alpha-diversity (richness and evenness) and the bulk concentration and the number of molecules in the DOM pool. Similarly, bacterial community beta-diversity was related to both DOM concentration and composition. However, in some lakes the relative abundance of resource generalists, which was inversely related to the DOM concentration, may have reduced the effect of DOM heterogeneity on community composition. Together, our results demonstrate the potential metabolic interactions between bacteria and organic matter and suggest that changes in organic matter composition may alter the structure and function of bacterial communities.

AB Elevated nitrogen (N) deposition may exacerbate soil phosphorus (P) limitations in P-deficient subtropical forest ecosystems. However, which abiotic factors predominantly contribute to soil P transformations and how plant roots affect soil P variations after N addition in these ecosystems are unclear. To address these issues, we studied a natural Castanopsis carlesii forest in Fujian, China subjected to 3 years of N addition. Soil P fractions, soil properties, iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) oxides, root biomass (RB), and root length density (RLD) were investigated. The results showed that N application remarkably increased the concentrations of soil available P but significantly decreased content of soil moderately labile P. The quantities of free Fe and Al (Fe-d and Al-d) and organic-bound Fe and Al (Fe-p and Al-p) decreased after N addition. These changes indicated an important relationship between Fe and Al oxides and P fractions, especially Fe-p and moderately labile P, suggesting that Fe and Al oxides predominantly influenced soil P fractions in N-enriched plots. Meanwhile, RB and RLD were higher after N addition treatments than control treatment. Positive correlations between RB and RLD and P fractions (available P, labile P, and moderately labile P) indicated that plant roots exert an essential influence on changes in soil P fractions. In conclusion, N addition in subtropical forests significantly influenced soil P fractions, primarily by decreasing Fe and Al oxides and increasing plant root biomass and density.

AB The presence of riparian vegetation provides microclimatic regulation of stream conditions [e.g. luminosity (lux), air temperature (degrees C) and relative humidity (%)], which varies naturally throughout the day. These variables explain the diurnal behaviour patterns of ectotherms such as Odonata in natural areas. However, human land uses (e.g. pastures) modify the abiotic conditions of riparian environments, favouring the presence of disturbance-tolerant species. In this context, we assess relationships between riparian land use (control streams-natural areas and pasture), abiotic conditions habitat integrity index (in control and pastures streams), (air temperature, luminosity and humidity in control streams), and Odonata diversity (between pasture and control streams and throughout the time of day) in Brazilian savannah (Cerrado) streams. First, the control streams had higher habitat integrity index than pasture. Higher abundance and difference in composition of Odonata species were observed in streams surrounded by pasture relative to natural areas. The conversion of natural areas to pasture near streams was also accompanied by an increase in overall body size of Odonata species. Odonata species richness and abundance in natural areas varied throughout the day, but peaked around 12:00h, coinciding with changes in air temperature and luminosity. Our study highlights that changes in the physical characteristics of streams through conversion of natural habitats to pasture will change environmental conditions and act as a filter on the distribution and persistence of Odonata species in Cerrado streams.

AB Aim: The importance of anthropogenic activities in reshaping biodiversity is increasing fast. Interactive effects of climate change, biological invasions and species replacement are poorly understood, particularly at large scales and in megadiverse biomes. We aimed to assess the effects of climate change as a driver of spatio-temporal biodiversity patterns and homogenization of woody plants at multiple scales, in a hyperdiverse species assemblage.
   Location: The Atlantic Forest, Brazil.
   Time period: Present, future projections.
   Major taxa studied: Woody plants.
   Methods: We used ecological niche modeling to estimate geographic distributions of 2,255 plant species under present and future climates. Range-diversity plots based on species presence-absence matrices and null models were used to explore changes in alpha and beta diversity, range size and covariance in species composition across ecoregions, climatic scenarios and within protected areas. We also partitioned dissimilarity into turnover and nestedness components and explored expansions and retractions of species' ranges to infer invasive potential and implications for conservation in the future.
   Results: Despite a general increase in local richness, beta diversity decreased with time. Similarity among sites was accentuated in severe climate change scenarios enhancing biotic homogenization at large scales. Changes were not constant or homogeneous across ecoregions and at smaller scales, but a consistent pattern was the reduction of beta diversity accompanied by increments in the mean range size of widespread species. Likewise, subsets of assemblages within protected areas presented higher similarity, increased mean range size and invariability of richness through time, indicating potential compositional turnover promoted by the expansion of widespread species.
   Main conclusions: Expansion of current generalist and disturbance-tolerant species rather than extinction or retraction of local endemics may lead to woody plant homogenization in the tropics. The woody plant assemblage in the Atlantic Forest is prone to a structural reorganization due to climate change, threatening conservation of biodiversity and potentially leading to severe large-scale biotic homogenization in the near future.

AB Effective use of soil phosphorus (P) for crop production requires an understanding of how P pools are stabilized and cycled within soil aggregates, rather than assuming that P dynamics, particularly organic P, closely follow those of C. The main goal of this study was to compare C and N cycling with P dynamics in soil aggregate fractions under two distinct crop species, maize (Zea mays) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) in a highly-weathered Lixisol. We found that while C and N follow an open cycle, whereby C and N are mineralized from micro aggregates during macroaggregate turnover and partially exit the soil system as gas and leachate, P has a relatively closed cycle, where most of the mineralized and solubilized P from microaggregates is lost from the plant-available pool via sorption to the unaggregated silt and clay-sized particles (< 53 mu m). While the above postulated P cycling mechanisms were the same for maize and pigeon pea, P loss from microaggregates and subsequent enrichment of the silt and clay particles was significantly higher in soils under maize compared to pigeon pea (320 and 331 mg P kg(-1) lost from occluded microaggregates and gained by free silt and day partides, respectively, compared to 129 and 97 mg P kg(-1) under pigeon pea). This is attributed to the significantly increased soil aggregation under pigeon pea, which led to greater accumulation of P, particularly organic P, in the free microaggregates (77 mg P kg(-1) compared to 29 mg P kg(-1)) and slower rates of macro aggregate turnover. We conclude that increasing soil aggregation can substantially reduce organic P losses from aggregate occluded fractions and its subsequent sorption as inorganic P to silt and day particles. Thus, P cycling can be improved in tropical cropping systems on highly-weathered soils by introducing crop species that enhance the ocdusion of organic P into aggregates.

AB This article examines the social and environmental costs of living in the mineral age, wherein contemporary global livelihoods depend almost completely on the extraction of mineral resources. Owing to the logic of extractivism-the rapid and widespread removal of resources for exchange in global capitalist markets-both developed and developing countries are inextricably entangled in pursuing resource extraction as a means of sustaining current lifestyles as well as a key mechanism for promoting socioeconomic development. The past 15 years has seen a massive expansion of mineral resource extraction as many developing countries liberalized their mining sectors, allowing foreign capital and mining companies onto the lands of peasant farmers and indigenous people. This mining expansion has also facilitated the rise of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM). Transformations in livelihoods and corporate practices as well as the environmental impacts and social conflicts wrought by mining are the central foci of this article.

AB The southwestern Ethiopian montane forests are one of the most species-rich ecosystems and are recognised globally as a priority area for the conservation of biodiversity. Particularly, in contrast to the drier central and northern Ethiopian highlands, they have received little attention by researchers. Here, we review changes to agricultural systems in and around these forests that are known as the genetic home of coffee (Coffea arabica L.) and that are important to the livelihoods of many rural people who have developed traditional management practices based on agro-ecological knowledge, religious taboos and customary tenure rights. We explored the impacts of conversions to agroforestry and cereal-based cropping systems on biodiversity, soil fertility, soil loss and the socio-economic conditions and culture. The increasing trend of cereal cropping, resettlement and commercial agriculture causes the deterioration of natural forest cover in the region and threatens biodiversity, land quality, sustainable, traditional farming practices and the livelihood of the local community. Large-scale plantations of tea, coffee, soapberry locally known as endod (Phytolacca dodecandra L'Her.) and cereals have resulted in biodiversity loss. Following the conversion of forests, cultivated fields exhibit a significant decline in soil fertility and an increase in soil loss as compared with the traditional agroforestry system. The establishment of a sustainable agricultural system will require a change in paradigm, whereby the intrinsic values of the traditional forest-based agricultural system are recognised, rather than the ongoing mimicking of agricultural policies that were developed for the open fields of central Ethiopia.

AB Fire is an increasingly important agent of forest degradation in the Amazon, but little attention has been given to the susceptibility of seasonally flooded forests to fire. Satellite images suggest that forests flooded seasonally by nutrient-poor black waters are more susceptible to fire and may suffer greater fire damage than nearby upland forests. Reasons for this difference may include the presence of a root mat, more fine fuel as litter and a drier understory in the flooded forest. We investigated this difference in the field, hypothesizing that differences in the aboveground structure of the pre-burn forest can contribute to the difference in impacts of, and susceptibility to, fires. We employed a portable profiling LiDAR (PPL), first to compare damage between adjacent black water seasonally flooded and upland forests that were burned by the same fire event, and to then assess pre-fire canopy structure attributes known to affect fire susceptibility. For both assessments, we used PPL-derived metrics of leaf area and vertical and horizontal variation in the structure of vegetation in the canopy. Four years after the fire, the LiDAR metrics showed greater combined effects of high damage and slow recovery in the seasonally flooded forest; reduction of total Leaf Area Index (LAI) after burning was only 10% for upland forest but was 71% in the flood forest. Compared to unburned upland, the canopy of unburned flood forest had structural differences that increase susceptibility to fire, including drier microclimate. It had more gaps, a more open understory and a lower upper canopy. Small patches lacking canopy closure (LAI < 1.0) were far more abundant in the unburned flood forest. We conclude that black water seasonally flooded forest suffers greater fire damage than upland forest and canopy structure contributes to its greater susceptibility to the occurrence of fires.

AB As distinct community assembly processes can produce similar community patterns, assessing the ecological mechanisms promoting coexistence in hyperdiverse rainforests remains a considerable challenge. We use spatially explicit neighbourhood models of tree growth to quantify how functional trait and phylogenetic similarities predict variation in growth and crowding effects for the 315 most abundant tree species in a 25-ha lowland rainforest plot in Ecuador. We find that functional trait differences reflect variation in (1) species maximum potential growth, (2) the intensity of interspecific interactions for some species, and (3) species sensitivity to neighbours. We find that neighbours influenced tree growth in 28% of the 315 focal tree species. Neighbourhood effects are not detected in the remaining 72%, which may reflect the low statistical power to model rare taxa and/or species insensitivity to neighbours. Our results highlight the spectrum of ways in which functional trait differences can shape community dynamics in highly diverse rainforests.

AB 1. Whether plants use leaf colour to deter herbivores remains controversial. The warning signal hypothesis predicts that red pigmentation is adaptive by reducing herbivory; plants with predominantly red foliage should have higher fitness than those with green leaves. Despite many discussions, this prediction has rarely been tested, and alternative, non-exclusive hypotheses cannot be ruled out.
   2. We have exploited leaf colour polymorphism in Pseudowintera colorata to test the warning signal hypothesis and to address possible alternative explanations.
   3. Consistent with warning signals, redder foliage contained higher concentrations of polygodial, a sesquiterpene dialdehyde with strong antifeedant properties, and incurred less herbivory than green leaves. Redder plants hosted 22% fewer lepidopteran leafroller larvae than neighbouring green plants.
   4. However, contrary to the predictions of the hypothesis, there were no differences in fitness parameters between red and green plants. Overall leaf canopy colour was not a significant predictor of the number of seeds per fruit or of mean seed weight. This may be explained by differences in photosynthesis: green P. colorata leaves had 47% higher maximum CO2 assimilation rates than matched red leaves from neighbouring plants.
   5. These results indicate that the benefits of deterring insect herbivores by signalling may be balanced by the higher photosynthetic rate of non-signalling plants. A balance between signalling and photosynthesis is a novel mechanism for the maintenance of leaf colour polymorphisms in nature.
   6. Synthesis. Anthocyanin pigments may simultaneously serve multiple functions within leaves, and individuals of the same plant species may use different strategies to cope with insect herbivores. Therefore, investigations into the role of these pigments in plant-insect interactions need to consider plant physiology and the diversity of plant defence mechanisms.

AB AimsAcross tropical regions, large forest areas have been converted to different agricultural land uses. These uses impose ecological disturbances affecting forest regeneration potential after field abandonment. Finding ways to identify those agricultural land uses limiting forest regeneration is a critical issue for conserving biodiversity in human-modified landscapes. Here, we developed a fast and inexpensive index, useful for quantifying ecological disturbance regimes associated with agricultural land uses, and tested its power to predict forest regeneration potential.
   LocationMunicipality of Marques de Comillas, southeast Mexico.
   MethodsInterviews were conducted with local farmers to quantify disturbance components (size, duration and severity) associated with agricultural land uses. The scaled values of these disturbance components were added in a simple ecological disturbance index (EDI). In each one of nine recently abandoned fields representing a wide range of EDI values, two 10-m(2) plots, one close to and one far from nearby forest remnants, were established. On each plot, all woody plants of 10-100m in height were counted, identified and measured in four 1-m(2) subplots, at the time of field abandonment and 2yr later. In addition, at each plot, 18 site condition (microclimate and soil) attributes were quantified at the time of abandonment. Plant density, biomass, species richness and species diversity were used as regeneration variables, and EDI and site condition attributes as independent ones.
   ResultsTwo years after abandonment, most regeneration variables declined exponentially with EDI. Biomass was not explained by EDI but changed positively with light availability. EDI was strongly correlated to vapour pressure deficit, which also predicted regeneration potential (except biomass).
   ConclusionsEDI is a cheap and easy tool for quantifying the ecological disturbance produced by a wide range of agricultural land uses. The index predicted several regeneration variables as well as or better than direct measurements of the site condition at the time of abandonment. EDI can be used to identify biodiversity-friendly agricultural land uses in human-modified landscapes.

AB Grazing exclusion practices can be promising restoration techniques where ecosystem degradation follows from rapidly increasing grazing pressure, as widely observed in northern Chinese grasslands. However, the mechanisms of plant-soil interactions responsible for nutrient cycling restoration remain unclear.
   We examined the functional response of the two most dominant grass species with contrasting nutrient economies to a grazing exclusion chronosequence varying greatly in soil moisture and extractable N and P.
   The relative biomass of the nutrient acquisitive species Leymus chinensis increased while that of the nutrient conservative Stipa grandis decreased across the chronosequence. Leymus chinensis displayed increasing leaf nutrient concentration and decreasing nutrient resorption with time since grazing exclusion for both N and P. In contrast, S. grandis showed decreasing leaf N and P concentrations and largely stable nutrient resorption.
   These differences in plasticity, with respect to nutrient stoichiometry and resorption, suggest contrasting abilities of these two dominant species to compete for soil resources and/or differences in their affinity to the changing forms of soil available N and P likely occurring along the restoration gradient. Ecosystem trajectory of change after grazing exclusion appears therefore largely dependent on the nutrient use strategies of co-occurring dominant grassland species.

AB The chemical composition of soil phosphorus can vary markedly during pedogenesis, which has implications for phosphorus availability to plant and microbial communities during long-term ecosystem development. We used NaOH-EDTA extraction and solution P-31 NMR spectroscopy to examine changes in soil phosphorus composition along the Haast chronosequence, a 6,500 year sequence of coastal dunes under lowland temperate rain forest on the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand. Soils along the chronosequence contained a variety of inorganic (orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, and long-chain polyphosphate) and organic (phosphomonoesters, phosphodiesters, and phosphonates) phosphorus compounds, although long-chain polyphosphates were detected only in the organic horizon and phosphonates were detected only in mineral soil. The concentrations of most compounds increased initially during the first few hundred years of pedogenesis and then declined as soils aged. However, concentrations of phospholipids, DNA, and long-chain polyphosphate all increased markedly in the organic horizon of older sites. The four inositol hexakisphosphate stereoisomers (myo, scyllo, neo, and D-chiro) accounted for a considerable proportion of the phosphomonoesters in mineral soil along the sequence (36-52 % of the organic phosphorus), but were not detected in quantifiable concentrations in the youngest mineral soil and all but one organic horizon. Concentrations of the two most abundant isomers (myo- and scyllo) declined along the chronosequence, but the scyllo isomer increased markedly as a proportion of the soil organic phosphorus as soils aged. Amorphous aluminum and iron oxides (i.e., extractable in acid-ammonium oxalate) increased continually throughout the chronosequence, indicating that the decline in inositol hexakisphosphate is due to low phosphorus availability rather than a decline in stabilization potential. Overall, these results provide further evidence that the chemical composition of organic and inorganic phosphorus pools vary markedly during pedogenesis, which has important implications for our understanding of biologically-available organic phosphorus during ecosystem development.

AB Sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) are responsible for the transmission of protozoan parasites that cause leishmaniases. They are found predominantly in forests, but some species exploit environments that have been subject to deforestation and subsequent human colonization. Studies conducted in Brazil over the past 30 years show that some species are adapting to pen-urban and urban settings. We evaluated sand fly diversity and abundance in the rural settlement of Rio Pardo, Presidente Figueiredo Municipality, Amazonas State, Brazil. Settlement households were divided into four categories. These categories were determined by the human population density and the degree of deforestation in the immediate area. We used CDC light traps to sample the area surrounding 24 households (6 households in each category). Samples were taken on six occasions during September-November 2009 and June-August 2010. A total of 3074 sand fly specimens were collected, including 1163 females and 1911 males. These were classified into 13 genera and 52 species. The greatest abundance of sand flies and the greatest richness of species were observed in areas where human population density was highest. Our results show that changes in the human occupancy and vegetation management in rural settlements may affect the population dynamics and distribution of sand fly species, thereby affecting the local transmission of cutaneous leishmaniases.

AB Aim To determine whether there is evidence of changes in small mammals distributions and emergent metacommunity structure in the Atlantic Forest resulting from extensive habitat loss and fragmentation associated with anthropogenic activities.
   Location South American Atlantic Forest from northeastern Brazil to eastern Paraguay.
   Methods Using presence-absence data for non-volant small mammals, we analysed metacommunity structure for communities from 76 fragments distributed throughout Atlantic Forest. We evaluated coherence, range turnover and range boundary clumping for the entire non-volant small mammal assemblage, marsupials, rodents and sigmodontine rodents separately. beta-diversity based on the multiplicative model was used to estimate the number of compartments (groups of sites with similar species composition) in Clementsian structures, and cluster analysis identified which sites formed compartments. Canonical correspondence analysis determined which environmental factors were associated with the gradients along which metacommunities were structured. Distance-decay analysis evaluated the spatial structure in small mammal and environmental data, and Mantel tests evaluated correlations between them.
   Results Rodent metacommunities had Clementsian structure, whereas marsupials had Gleasonian structure. Compartment locations for rodents were consistent with areas of endemism. Temperature seasonality was most associated with the gradients along which metacommunities were structured. Assemblage and environmental dissimilarity among sites had significant positive relationships with geographic distance.
   Main conclusions Compartment locations in Clementsian structures mirrored historical refugium locations and important vicariance events associated with large rivers. Despite extensive deforestation in Atlantic Forest, small mammal distributions are consistent with expectations based on historical biogeography, suggesting that anthropogenic activities have not yet greatly affected geographic distributions of emergent metacommunity structures. However, extinction debt associated with recent fragmentation and habitat loss may exist. Any effective conservation plan for large and fragmented biomes must consider areas of endemism to maintain regional biodiversity and maintain sufficiently large and connected fragments to facilitate rescue effects and minimize effects of extinction debt.

AB Ants are ecosystems engineers, keystone species and incredibly abundant worldwide. A major cosmopolitan interaction between ants and plants is ant-mediated seed dispersal (myrmecochory). The interaction involves more than 11,000 plant species, but far fewer ant species, possibly just a few dozen keystone species worldwide. Researchers only began recognizing this degree of asymmetry in ant-mediated seed dispersal in recent years, and we explore the ecological and evolutionary implications of the changed perspective. We review what makes ants effective dispersers, how plants coevolve with ant partners, and how the interaction may benefit both participants. We suggest that morphological adaptations for myrmecochory have evolved repeatedly and independently in many plants lineages worldwide, and these trait adaptations likely select for effective seed dispersing ants. We propose that myrmecochory evolves and spreads only in ecosystems where the ant community includes potentially effective seed dispersers in high abundance. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the evolution and maintenance of the interaction only is possible where the distribution of traits between beneficial and antagonistic ants can fall under plant selection for the best partners.

AB BACKGROUND: In many parts of the world, livestock production is undergoing a process of rapid intensification. The health implications of this development are uncertain. Intensification creates cheaper products, allowing more people to access animal-based foods. However, some practices associated with intensification may contribute to zoonotic disease emergence and spread: for example, the sustained use of antibiotics, concentration of animals in confined units, and long distances and frequent movement of livestock.
   OBJECTIVES: Here we present the diverse range of ecological, biological, and socioeconomic factors likely to enhance or reduce zoonotic risk, and identify ways in which a comprehensive risk analysis may be conducted by using an interdisciplinary approach. We also offer a conceptual framework to guide systematic research on this problem.
   DISCUSSION: We recommend that interdisciplinary work on zoonotic risk should take into account the complexity of risk environments, rather than limiting studies to simple linear causal relations between risk drivers and disease emergence and/or spread. In addition, interdisciplinary integration is needed at different levels of analysis, from the study of risk environments to the identification of policy options for risk management.
   CONCLUSION: Given rapid changes in livestock production systems and their potential health implications at the local and global level, the problem we analyze here is of great importance for environmental health and development. Although we offer a systematic inter-disciplinary approach to understand and address these implications, we recognize that further research is needed to clarify methodological and practical questions arising from the integration of the natural and social sciences.

AB Decreases in rainfall have been proposed to have a negative impact on tropical rain forests, and West Africa is currently experiencing a decline in rainfall at the multi-decadal scale. Here, we present analyses of a long-term dataset on the plant fruiting status from individuals of 44 species of the tropical rain forest of Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. This study includes records of 1401 individuals collected at monthly intervals for over 12yr, 984 of which survived throughout the entire study period. The aims of this study were to: (1) quantitate inter-annual trends in species and forest scale fruit presence; and (2) test the importance of rainfall in explaining inter-annual fruit presence variability. Long-term upward trends in the expected proportion of individuals with fruits were found for the majority of species, while no significant downward trends were detected, driving a significant upward trend at the community level. Peak production months of the upward trending species were not associated with the dry or wet season. Significant rainfall correlations with the total proportion of individuals showing fruit were generally negative, with only five species showing significant positive correlations. Taken together, these results suggest that the observed inter-annual trends and variability of fruit abundance are currently not associated with rainfall. We discuss several parsimonious and complex alternative explanations.

AB Aim Anthropogenic land-use change is a major driver of the current extinction crisis, but the processes through which it acts on biodiversity are complex and still poorly understood. Here, we use several biodiversity metrics to make a comprehensive assessment of the response of an endemic-rich bird assemblage to land-use change. Location SAo Tome Island (SAo Tome and Principe, Africa). Methods We sampled bird assemblages in 220 point counts, stratified across three regions and four land-use types. Species richness was examined using accumulation curves and generalized linear mixed-effect models. Compositional and structural changes were analysed with ordination techniques. We used correlations and model selection to identify species traits and environmental variables associated with such changes. Results At the point level, there was a slight decrease of species richness in more intensive land uses. However, higher dissimilarities within these land uses led them to have higher overall species richness. Endemics dominated forest environments and, although most preferred less-disturbed land uses, many persisted across all land uses. Non-endemics were virtually absent from forests, but became very abundant in the more intensive land uses. Canopy cover was the best predictor of the shift between endemic and non-endemic species, and allowed identifying regional differences in the local responses of bird assemblages to land-use change. Main conclusions To better understand biodiversity, it is crucial to use several metrics simultaneously. In SAo Tome, simply using species richness, the single most used biodiversity metric, could have been misleading as it concealed major shifts in the bird assemblage structure towards an endemism impoverished avifauna. Despite scarce data on land-use cover, we demonstrate how landscape context can be vital to understand biodiversity patterns and that highly forested surroundings might overestimate the strict value of more intensive land uses. Our results raise concerns about the long-term persistence of endemic species restricted to islands where forested land uses are being lost.

TI Importance of local participation in achieving equity in benefit-sharing

   Development Reserve

AB Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+) in tropical countries is now a critical piece of any international agreement that aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. An important issue refers to the distribution of benefits or, in other words, benefit sharing mechanisms. In this paper, I examine the degree of local participation in benefit-sharing mechanisms in the case of the Juma Sustainable Development Reserve in the State of Amazonas, Brazil, and assess how local participation - or lack of it - affects the outcomes, particularly with regard to equity. The analysis seeks to address the gap between theory and practice by considering the main concerns regarding equitable benefit sharing for REDD+, namely, the types of benefits to be distributed, eligible beneficiaries, the structure of benefits, and mechanisms for distributing them, and by identifying the possible negative and positive effects of benefit-sharing mechanisms. In doing so, my aim is to contribute to the more effective design and implementation of benefit-sharing mechanisms and to expand debate on the topic. The main research question of this paper is: how important is local participation for achieving equity in benefit-sharing mechanisms for REDD+? The results of this analysis indicate that the adaptation and mitigation goals of REDD+ are more likely to be achieved if the development and implementation of benefit-sharing mechanisms involve democratic and interactive processes for local participation, because such processes will lead to greater flexibility in the definition of benefits and distributional mechanisms. I draw the following conclusions: (1) the criteria for equity should be considered when benefits are defined, rather than when they are distributed and (2) given the complex and diverse relationships and issues involved in deforestation, it is important to adopt a multidimensional approach when identifying beneficiaries and benefits and designing benefit-sharing mechanisms.

AB We investigate cambial growth periodicity in Brachystegia spiciformis, a dominant tree species in the seasonally dry miombo woodland of southern Africa. To better understand how the brevi-deciduous (experiencing a short, drought-induced leaf fall period) leaf phenology of this species can be linked to a distinct period of cambial activity, we applied a bi-weekly pinning to six trees in western Zambia over the course of one year. Our results show that the onset and end of cambial growth was synchronous between trees, but was not concurrent with the onset and end of the rainy season. The relatively short (three to four months maximum) cambial growth season corresponded to the core of the rainy season, when 75% of the annual precipitation fell, and to the period when the trees were at full photosynthetic capacity. Tree-ring studies of this species have found a significant relationship between annual tree growth and precipitation, but we did not observe such a correlation at intra-annual resolution in this study. Furthermore, a substantial rainfall event occurring after the end of the cambial growth season did not induce xylem initiation or false ring formation. Low sample replication should be taken into account when interpreting the results of this study, but our findings can be used to refine the carbon allocation component of process-based terrestrial ecosystem models and can thus contribute to a more detailed estimation of the role of the miombo woodland in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Furthermore, we provide a physiological foundation for the use of Brachystegia spiciformis tree-ring records in paleoclimate research.

AB Canopy gaps created by tree mortality can affect the speed and trajectory of vegetation growth, species' population dynamics, and spatial heterogeneity in mature forests. Most studies focus on plant development within gaps, yet gaps also affect the mortality and growth of surrounding trees, which influence shading and root encroachment into gaps and determine whether, and how quickly, a gap becomes occupied by recovering vegetation. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of canopy gap size on mortality and growth of surrounding trees over a 16-year period in mature and old-growth Douglasfir dominated forests in the coastal Pacific Northwest, USA. Replicates of four sizes of experimental gaps and controls were created in two mature stands (90 and 145-years old) and two old-growth stands (overstory trees 350-525-years old); mortality and diameter of surrounding trees were measured periodically over 16 years. A subset of trees was cored to compare growth increment before and after gap creation. There was no difference between mortality rates of trees within 8 m of gaps and trees in closed-canopy controls, although mortality causes did differ for understory trees. Mortality of understory trees was higher at gap edges than in controls, but lower several meters into the forest, suggesting a shift from negative to positive effects with the gradient in exposure. Diameter growth rates of trees were greater next to gaps than in controls, with the greatest difference ranging from 39% for overstory trees to 111% for understory trees in mature stands. Growth rates of trees in old-growth stands differed by crown class and position around gap, suggesting an effect of direct solar radiation. Growth rates of trees in mature stands were relatively insensitive to gap size and position, suggesting that increased soil moisture drove responses in these stands. Somewhat unexpectedly, there were rapid increases in growth in some old-growth trees, but not in the largest gap sizes. Results suggest canopy gaps can create heterogeneity of ecosystem function through spatial variation in effects on growth and mortality across mature and old-growth stands. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Natural enemies, especially host-specific enemies, are hypothesised to facilitate the coexistence of plant species by disproportionately inflicting more damage at increasing host abundance. However, few studies have assessed such Janzen-Connell mechanisms on a scale relevant for coexistence and no study has evaluated potential top-down influences on the specialized pests. We quantified seed predation by specialist invertebrates and generalist vertebrates, as well as larval predation on these invertebrates, for the Neotropical palm Attalea butyracea across ten 4-ha plots spanning 20-fold variation in palm density. As palm density increased, seed attack by bruchid beetles increased, whereas seed predation by rodents held constant. But because rodent predation on bruchid larvae increased disproportionately with increasing palm density, bruchid emergence rates and total seed predation by rodents and bruchids combined were both density-independent. Our results demonstrate that top-down effects can limit the potential of host-specific insects to induce negative-density dependence in plant populations.

AB Loss of old-growth forests and greatly reduced volumes of coarse dead wood in managed forests are the main reasons for the decline of many wood-inhabiting species in Europe and elsewhere. To assess the habitat requirements and extinction vulnerability of 13 polypore species associated mainly with spruce, their occurrences were recorded on 96 521 dead-wood objects in 331 stands along a regional gradient of forest utilization history across southern-middle boreal Finland. The substrates studied included a variety of tree species and dead-wood qualities investigated in both unmanaged and managed stands at different successional stages. Hierarchical logistic regression models were constructed to analyze the relationships between the occurrence probability of individual species and variables at the substrate, stand and regional scales.

AB Tropical forest ecosystems play an important role in regulating the global climate, yet deforestation and land-use change mean that the tropical carbon sink is increasingly influenced by agroecosystems and pastures. Despite this, it is not yet fully understood how carbon cycling in the tropics responds to land-use change, particularly for pasture and afforestation. Thus, the objectives of our study were: (1) to elucidate the environmental controls and the impact of management on gross primary production (GPP), total ecosystem respiration (TER) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE); (2) to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of tropical pasture compared with afforestation; and (3) to compare eddy covariance-derived carbon budgets with biomass and soil inventory data. We performed comparative measurements of NEE in a tropical C-4 pasture and an adjacent afforestation with native tree species in Sardinilla (Panama) from 2007 to 2009. Pronounced seasonal variation in GPP, TER and NEE were closely related to radiation, soil moisture, and C-3 vs. C-4 plant physiology. The shallow rooting depth of grasses compared with trees resulted in a higher sensitivity of the pasture ecosystem to water limitation and seasonal drought. During 2008, substantial amounts of carbon were sequestered by the afforestation (-442 gCm(-2), negative values denote ecosystem carbon uptake), which was in agreement with biometric observations (-450 gCm(-2)). In contrast, the pasture ecosystem was a strong carbon source in 2008 and 2009 (261 gCm(-2)), associated with seasonal drought and overgrazing. In addition, soil carbon isotope data indicated rapid carbon turnover after conversion from C-4 pasture to C-3 afforestation. Our results clearly show the potential for considerable carbon sequestration of tropical afforestation and highlight the risk of carbon losses from pasture ecosystems in a seasonal tropical climate.

It is the predominant vegetation type throughout eastern part of the range of the golden-headed lion tamarins, Leontopithecus chrysomelas, an endangered primate endemic to Atlantic Forest. Understanding how lion tamarins use this agroforest is a conservation priority. To address this question, we documented the diet, home range size, group sizes and composition, density, number of litters and body condition of lion tamarins living in cabruca, and other habitats. Jackfruit, Artocarpus heterophyllus, was the most used species used by lion tamarins in cabruca and was widely available and used throughout the year. In cabruca, home range size was the smallest (22-28 ha) and density of lion tamarins was the highest (1.7 ind/ha) reported for the species. Group size averaged 7.4 individuals and was not significantly different among the vegetation types. In cabruca, groups produced one or two litters a year, and all litters were twins. Adult males in cabruca were significantly heavier than males in primary forest. Our study is the first to demonstrate that breeding groups of golden-headed lion tamarins can survive and reproduce entirely within cabruca agroforest. Jackfruit proved to be a keystone resource for lion tamarins in cabruca, and bromeliads were important as an animal prey foraging microhabitat. In cases where cabruca contains concentrated resources, such as jackfruit and bromeliads, lion tamarins may not only survive and reproduce but may fare better than in other forest types, at least for body condition and reproduction.

AB P>1. A major goal in community ecology is to identify mechanisms that govern the assembly and maintenance of ecological communities. Current models of metacommunity dynamics differ chiefly in the relative emphasis placed on dispersal limitation and niche differentiation as causal mechanisms structuring ecological communities. Herein we investigate the relative roles of these two mechanisms in structuring primate communities in Africa, South America, Madagascar and Borneo.
   2. We hypothesized that if dispersal limitation is important in structuring communities, then community similarity should depend on geographical proximity even after controlling for ecological similarity. Conversely, if communities are assembled primarily through niche processes, then community similarity should be determined by ecological similarity regardless of geographical proximity.
   3. We performed Mantel and partial Mantel tests to investigate correlations among primate community similarity, ecological distance and geographical distance. Results showed significant and strongly negative relationships between diurnal primate community similarity and both ecological similarity and geographical distance in Madagascar, but significant and stronger negative relationships between community similarity and geographical distance in African, South American and Bornean metacommunities.
   4. We conclude that dispersal limitation is an important determinant of primate community structure and may play a stronger role in shaping the structure of some terrestrial vertebrate communities than niche differentiation. These patterns are consistent with neutral theory. We recommend tests of functional equivalence to determine the extent to which neutral theory may explain primate community composition.

AB The rapid and unplanned expansion of urban areas is a common pattern in neotropical developing countries. Urbanization has eliminated or drastically altered large areas of natural habitats used by the rich neotropical avifauna. In our study area, in Costa Rica's Central Valley, urbanization increased 72% in 33 years with the consequent destruction, fragmentation, and isolation of forest tracts, shade plantations, and other semi-natural habitats used by a rich avifauna. We show that over the last 16 years 32 resident species of birds have disappeared from this area. Species with specialized habitat requirements or particular life history traits (e.g., altitudinal migrants) are disproportionately represented among those birds that have disappeared from the region. Another 34 latitudinal migrants have gone undetected as nearly all habitats these species used as a stopover site during the autumn migration have disappeared; many of these migrants were very abundant 16 years earlier. Relative abundance has also decreased for most resident and migratory species that remained or visited the area. If uncontrolled urban expansion continues, we predict that the rate of extinction of the avifauna that originally inhabited this region would continue possibly increasing.

AB P>1. Traditional approaches to understanding species responses to environmental conditions have focused on the isolated effects of single stressors, despite the fact that in nature organisms experience a variety of conditions.
   2. In tropical monsoonal areas, intertidal animals can face hot desiccating conditions during emersion preceded, or followed by, intense rainfall. The combined effects of these stresses on physiological responses and protein profiles were investigated in a limpet, Cellana grata.
   3. With short exposure (60 min) to single stressors, heat stressed limpets had elevated heart rates and more concentrated haemolymph and mantle water osmolalities than under normal temperatures or awash. Animals under rain had reduced haemolymph and mantle water osmolalities, but similar heart rates to unstressed animals.
   4. After 120 min, unstressed animals did not differ in their physiological responses. Heat stressed limpets, however, had faster heart rates and more concentrated haemolymph and mantle water osmolalities, whilst those under rain had the lowest osmolalities, but similar heart rates to unstressed animals.
   5. Limpets under rain followed by heat stress had faster heart rates, but lower haemolymph and mantle water osmolalities compared to animals under normal temperatures or heat stress. Limpets that were heat stressed, followed by rain, had similar heart rates to animals awash, under rain or normal temperatures but lower haemolymph osmolalities than other treatments, with the exception of limpets under rain.
   6. There was a positive relationship between haemolymph and mantle water osmolalities, except for animals under rain, where mantle water osmolality was lower than the haemolymph, suggesting some isolation of body fluids from the external medium.
   7. Haemolymph protein/peptide mass spectra of heat stressed animals (either before or after rain) were similar, while all other treatments differed, suggesting differential expression and regulation of proteins.
   8. Heat stress invokes a more active physiological and protein level response than rain, but their combination had an interactive effect on limpets' metabolism.
   9. Identifying the effects of multiple stresses at a variety of biological levels highlights the interactive effects which impact species, and provides a more complete understanding of how species may respond to environmental changes in their natural habitats.

AB Each year, a larger proportion of the Earth's surface is urbanized, and a larger proportion of the people on Earth lives in those urban areas. The everyday nature, however, that humans encounter in cities remains poorly understood. Here, we consider perhaps the most urban green habitat, street medians. We sampled ants from forty-four medians along three boulevards in New York City and examined how median properties affect the abundance and species richness of native and introduced ants found on them. Ant species richness varied among streets and increased with area but was independent of the other median attributes measured. Ant assemblages were highly nested, with three numerically dominant species present at all medians and additional species present at a subset of medians. The most common ant species were the introduced Pavement ant (Tetramorium caespitum) and the native Thief ant (Solenopsis molesta) and Cornfield ant (Lasius neoniger). The common introduced species on the medians responded differently to natural and disturbed elements of medians. Tetramorium caespitum was most abundant in small medians, with the greatest edge/area ratio, particularly if those medians had few trees, whereas Nylanderia flavipes was most abundant in the largest medians, particularly if they had more trees. Many of the species encountered in Manhattan were similar to those found in other large North American cities, such that a relatively small subset of ant species probably represent most of the encounters humans have with ants in North America.

AB Basic knowledge of the relationships between tree growth and environmental variables is crucial for understanding forest dynamics and predicting vegetation responses to climate variations. Trees growing in tropical areas with a clear seasonality in rainfall often form annual growth rings. In the understory, however, tree growth is supposed to be mainly affected by interference for access to light and other resources. In the semi-deciduous Mayombe forest of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the evergreen species Aidia ochroleuca, Corynanthe paniculata and Xylopia wilwerthii dominate the understory. We studied their wood to determine whether they form annual growth rings in response to changing climate conditions. Distinct growth rings were proved to be annual and triggered by a common external factor for the three species. Species-specific site chronologies were thus constructed from the cross-dated individual growth-ring series. Correlation analysis with climatic variables revealed that annual radial stem growth is positively related to precipitation during the rainy season but at different months. The growth was found to associate with precipitation during the early rainy season for Aidia but at the end of the rainy season for Corynanthe and Xylopia. Our results suggest that a dendrochronological approach allows the understanding of climate-growth relationships in tropical forests, not only for canopy trees but also for evergreen understory species and thus arguably for the whole tree community. Global climate change influences climatic seasonality in tropical forest areas, which is likely to result in differential responses across species with a possible effect on forest composition over time.

AB Nature conservation may be considered a post-normal science in that the loss of biodiversity and increasing environmental degradation require urgent action but are characterised by uncertainty at every level. An 'extended peer community' with varying skills, perceptions and values are involved in decision-making and implementation of conservation, and the uncertainty involved limits the effectiveness of practice. In this paper we briefly review the key ecological, philosophical and methodological uncertainties associated with conservation, and then highlight the uncertainties and gaps present within the structure and interactions of the conservation community, and which exist mainly between researchers and practitioners, in the context of nature conservation in the UK. We end by concluding that an openly post-normal science framework for conservation, which acknowledges this uncertainty but strives to minimise it, would be a useful progression for nature conservation, and recommend ways in which knowledge transfer between researchers and practitioners can be improved to support robust decision making and conservation enactment.

AB Studies simultaneously evaluating the importance of safe-site and seed limitation for plant establishment are rare, particularly in human-modified landscapes. We used spatially,explicit neighborhood models together with data from 10 0.5-ha mapped census plots in a fragmented landscape spanning 1000 km(2) to (1) evaluate the relative importance of seed production, dispersal, and safe-site limitation for the recruitment of the understory herb Heliconia acuminata; and (2) determine how these processes differ between fragments and continuous forests. Our analyses demonstrated a large degree of variation in seed production, dispersal, and establishment among and within the 10 study plots. Seed production limitation was strong but only at small spatial scales. Average dispersal distance was less than 4 m, leading to severe dispersal limitation at most sites. Overall, safe-site limitation was the most important constraint on seedling establishment. Fragmentation led to a more heterogeneous light environment with negative consequences for seedling establishment but had little effect on seed production or dispersal. These results suggest that the effects of fragmentation on abiotic processes may be more important than the disruption of biotic interactions in driving biodiversity loss in tropical forests, at least for some functional groups. These effects May be common when the matrix surrounding fragments contains enough tree cover to enable movement of dispersers and pollinators.

AB Can a payment for flows of ecosystem goods and services system, following appropriate management and restoration of natural capital produced in rural areas of a developing country, be developed in a way that benefits communities, the commercial sector and the environment? This fundamental question acts as rationale for conducting an in-depth assessment as to whether the development of markets for ecosystems is both appropriate and sufficient when dealing with the restoration of natural capital of two degraded study areas within the Maloti-Drakensberg mountain range in southern Africa, which is a fire-prone grasslands ecosystem. The mountain range is South Africa's most strategic source of fresh water. While occupying less than 5% of South Africa's surface area, it produces 25% of the country's runoff through rivers, major dams, and national and international inter-basin transfers.
   Addressing the question, the study develops an integrated hydrology-ecology-economic model based on the functional relationships between these three aspects in managing and restoring the natural capital of the two study areas. It was found that the benefits of introducing improved management practices exceeds cost in low to medium degraded quinaries, but not in heavily degraded quinaries. The economic return on the water (baseflow) produced by such a system of improved land use management, however, far exceeds that of conventional (construction-based) water development programmes and offers meaningful economic and market development opportunities.

AB To test whether leaf trait relationships vary with plant size, specific leaf area (SLA), area- and mass-based leaf nutrient contents (N-area and N-mass, P-area and P-mass), and area- and mass-based leaf photosynthetic capacities (A(area) and A(mass)) of 127 small individuals (woody plants shorter than 2 m) and 47 large trees (taller than 10 m) were measured in a tropical montane rain forest, China. A standardized major axis (SMA) method was used to scale the mass-based trait relationships. We found that A(mass), P-area, P-mass, and SLA were higher in the small individuals than in the large trees, but the changes of A(area), N-area and N-mass leveled off. Trait pairs of N-mass - A(mass). SLA - A(mass) and N-mass - SLA were positively correlated with slopes in common, but the y-intercept of SLA - N-mass was higher in the large trees than in the small individuals, indicating large trees had a higher N investment at a given SLA. In the pairs of N-mass - A(mass) and SLA - A(mass), small individuals were shifted upwards along a common slope than large trees, corresponding to their large A(mass) and SLA. At a given SLA, the upwards shift along a common slope of small individuals does not mean that they have higher photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) than large trees, since a common slope and homogenous elevations of SLA-PNUE were found between them. Trait pairs of P-mass - A(mass) and N-mass - P-mass were positively correlated and the slopes differed between small and large trees. The slope of P-mass - A(mass) was steeper in the large than in the small individuals, suggesting large trees would have a disproportionally larger return with the same increase in P-mass. However, the pattern of slope of N-mass - P-mass was the reverse of that observed for P-mass - A(mass), indicating a higher N/P ratio in the large than in the small individuals. At a given SLA, large trees had higher photosynthetic phosphorus use efficiency (PPUE) than small individuals, corresponding to their higher elevation of SLA-PPUE. In conclusion, leaf trait relationships can be modified by plant size but the positive correlations among SLA, N-mass, P-mass and A(mass) generally remain invariant. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Conservation biologists use the species-area relationship for a variety of purposes, including upscaling diversity from small plots to regions, predicting species loss, and for identifying biodiversity hotspots and prioritizing actions to protect them. Despite its widespread use, several complications that affect the accuracy of its application are often overlooked. First, interpretation of the species-area relationship is a function of the census design used to construct it. Nested census designs guarantee only that one individual each of a given number of species is within the sampled area, but we are almost always concerned with the loss or protection of more than one individual of each species. Census designs using non-contiguous plots are useful for sampling large regions, but their interpretation is not straightforward because species number is a function of the spatial extent of the landscape and the size of the sample units. Second, power function behavior is often assumed, even though the species-area relationship often displays curvilinearity on log-log plots across scale ranges pertinent to conservation. Finally, applications of the species-area relationship often assume that the area of interest is contiguous while in practice it seldom is, and so calculations using the species-area relationship need to account for beta diversity between disjunctive areas.

AB Ants are used as indicators of environmental change in disturbed landscapes, often without adequate understanding of their response to disturbance. Ant communities in the southeastern United States displayed a hump-backed species richness curve against an index of landscape disturbance. Forty sites at Fort Benning, in west-central Georgia, covered a spectrum of habitat disturbance (military training and fire) in upland forest. Sites disturbed by military training had fewer trees, less canopy cover, more bare ground, and warmer, more compact soils with shallower A-horizons. We sampled ground-dwelling ants with pitfall traps, and measured 15 habitat variables related to vegetation and soil. Ant species richness was greatest with a relative disturbance of 43%, but equitability was greatest with no disturbance. Ant abundance was greatest with a relative disturbance of 85%. High species richness at intermediate disturbance was associated with greater within-site spatial heterogeneity, Species richness was also associated with intermediate values of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a correlate of net primary productivity (NPP). Available NPP (the product of NDVI and the fraction of days that soil temperature exceeded 25 degrees C), however, was positively correlated with species richness, though not with ant abundance. Species richness was unrelated to soil texture, total ground cover, and fire frequency. Ant species richness and equitability are potential state indicators of the soil arthropod community. Moreover, equitability can be used to monitor ecosystem change. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A quantitative ethnobotanical study was conducted in the semi-arid Bolivian Andes community of Apillapampa to evaluate the impact of site accessibility on the diversity and perceived usefulness of (sub-)woody plants. Vegetation was sampled in thirty-six transects of 50 x 2 m(2), whereas data on plant uses were obtained from 13 local Quechua participants. Accessibility of sample sites correlated negatively with plant diversity, but positively with perceived usefulness. Hence, in spite of being less diverse, vegetation of more accessible sites was perceived as more useful to people than vegetation of more remote and also more diverse sites. This result contributes to the validity of the widely accepted notion that "more accessible plant resources are more useful to people", not only at the level of individual plant species, but also for entire vegetation communities. In this respect, our finding that people attribute an equal usefulness to the vegetation of two local ecological zones (i.e. prepuna and puna) most likely reflects their similar accessibility from the village centre, which is located on the edge between both zones.

AB The phenological behavior of many tropical plant species is highly dependent on rainfall, but these plants may also respond to changes in photoperiod. Without a better knowledge of the proportion of species responding to different factors, it is difficult to predict how global climate change may affect natural ecosystem processes. The aim of this study was to describe flowering patterns for more than 100 species in Tinigua Park, Colombia, and to propose which factors may trigger flower production (e.g., rainfall, temperature, cloud cover, and photoperiod). Data gathered in 5.6 km of phenological transects during 4 yr and complementary information indicated that the vast majority of species showed intraspecific synchronization, and annual production was the most common pattern, followed by episodic frequency. The annual patterns were common in tree species, while episodic patterns were common in lianas. Simple and multiple regression analyses suggested several aspects of photoperiod as the most likely triggers for flowering in most species. However, the fact that many of these species produce flowers in different periods each year, suggests that the proportion of species responding to photoperiodic cues is less that 23 percent in this community. The flowering times of taxonomically related species seldom showed significantly staggered distributions; however they do not necessarily occur at the same time, suggesting that flowering patterns are not strongly constrained by phylogeny.

AB The floristic diversity of Mexican tropical deciduous forests (TDF) is of critical importance given the high species richness (alpha diversity), species turnover (beta diversity), and the intense deforestation rates. Currently, most TDF landscapes are mosaics of agricultural land, secondary vegetation, and patches of relatively undisturbed primary vegetation. Here we illustrate how both primary forest remnants and secondary vegetation patches contribute to the floristic diversity of TDF in a landscape of volcanic origin in central Veracruz, Mexico. Our objectives were to assess sampling efficiency and inventory completeness, to compare mean and cumulative species richness between primary forest and secondary vegetation sites, and to analyze beta diversity between vegetation types. In an area of 12,300 m(2) we recorded 105 families, 390 genera, and 682 species. Species inventories for both vegetation types were about 80% complete. Secondary vegetation is more alpha diverse than primary forest, both in terms of cumulative and mean species richness. We found a remarkably high beta diversity between vegetation types (75% of complementarity, 91.60% of mean dissimilarity). We also identified the species that contribute the most to similarity within vegetation types and to dissimilarity between vegetation types. Our results support the idea that assessing biodiversity on the landscape scale is an appropriate way to ascertain the impact of human activities. For this land mosaic, conservation of the flora would not be possible by focusing solely on primary forest remnants. We propose the implementation of a network of small conservation areas with a flexible structure, following the "archipelago reserve" model.

AB Background: The Janzen-Connell model states that plant-specific natural enemies may have a disproportionately large negative effect on progeny close to maternal trees. The majority of experimental and theoretical studies addressing the Janzen-Connell model have explored how it can explain existing patterns of species diversity in tropical mainland areas. Very few studies have investigated how the model's predictions apply to isolated oceanic islands, or to the conservation management of endangered plants. Here, we provide the first experimental investigation of the predictions of the Janzen-Connell model on an oceanic island, in a conservation context. In addition, we experimentally evaluate the use of ecological analogue animals to resurrect the functional component of extinct frugivores that could have dispersed seeds away from maternal trees.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In Mauritius, we investigated seed germination and seedling survival patterns of the critically endangered endemic plant Syzygium mamillatum (Myrtaceae) in relation to proximity to maternal trees. We found strong negative effects of proximity to maternal trees on growth and survival of seedlings. We successfully used giant Aldabran tortoises as ecological analogues for extinct Mauritian frugivores. Effects of gut-passage were negative at the seed germination stage, but seedlings from gut-passed seeds grew taller, had more leaves, and suffered less damage from natural enemies than any of the other seedlings.
   Conclusions/Significance: We provide the first experimental evidence of a distance-dependent Janzen-Connell effect on an oceanic island. Our results potentially have serious implications for the conservation management of rare plant species on oceanic islands, which harbour a disproportionately large fraction of the world's endemic and endangered plants. Furthermore, in contrast to recent controversy about the use of non-indigenous extant megafauna for re-wilding projects in North America and elsewhere, we argue that Mauritius and other oceanic islands are ideal study systems in which to empirically explore the use of ecological analogue species in restoration ecology.

AB In view of the continued decline in tropical forest cover around the globe, forest restoration has become a key tool in tropical rainforest conservation. One of the main - and least expensive - restoration strategies is natural forest regeneration. By aiding forest seed influx both into disturbed and undisturbed habitats, frugivorous birds facilitate forest regeneration. This study focuses on the tolerance of a frugivorous bird community to anthropogenic habitat disturbance within the broader context of natural forest regeneration with conservation purposes. It was carried out in the tropical cloud forest of Costa Rica's Talamanca Mountains. Bird community response and tolerance to habitat disturbance was assessed by comparing bird presence and densities along a disturbance gradient, ranging from open pastures to closed mature forests. Birds were censused along nine transects applying the variable width line transect procedure. Forty relevant frugivorous bird species were observed during 102 h of survey time. Densities were calculated for 33 species; nine species responded negatively to increasing level of disturbance and nine others positively. Results indicate that large frugivores are generally moderately tolerant to intermediate, but intolerant to severe habitat disturbance, and that tolerance is often higher for medium and small frugivores. It appears that moderately disturbed habitats in tropical cloud forests are highly suitable for restoration through natural regeneration aided by frugivorous birds. Due to a lack of large forest seed dispersers, severely disturbed habitats appear less suitable. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wood ants (Formica rufa group) are dominating ecosystem elements of the boreal region due to their wide and abundant occurrence. They collect and concentrate organic material from the surrounding forest floor by building large above-ground mounds. These mounds have higher temperature and lower water content than the surrounding forest floor. We studied how these peculiar environmental conditions affected mass loss and carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) mineralisation of organic matter in boreal Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.)-dominated mixed forest stands of four different age classes (5-, 30-, 60-, and 100-year-old) situated in eastern Finland using the litter bag technique. Norway spruce needle litter was incubated in inhabited and abandoned wood ant mounds as well as on the surrounding forest floor. We expected decomposition to be extremely slow due to the dryness of the mounds. Mass losses inside inhabited mounds were lower compared to the surrounding forest floor (on average 30 vs 50% after 2 years) but not as low as we expected, which might be a result of ant and microbial activity in the mounds. Decomposition in the abandoned mounds proceeded similarly as on the forest floor. Nutrient mineralisation proceeded more slowly in the ant mounds than on the surrounding forest floor. Mineralisation occurred for all studied nutrients in the ant mounds, except for N, which net amount remained stable during the years of the experiment. When wood ant mounds are abandoned and their porous and dry structure is no longer maintained by the ants, their decomposition is accelerated, and nutrients may be available for uptake by plants, although the nutrient mineralisation seems still to remain lower compared to the surrounding forest floor. However, eventually the mound material will be decomposed and nutrients mineralised, thus providing a nutrient hot spot increasing the heterogeneity of forest floor nutrient availability.

AB The binary classification of landscapes into suitable vs. unsuitable areas underlies several prominent theories in conservation biogeography. However, a binary classification is not always appropriate. The textural discontinuity hypothesis provides an alternative theoretical framework to examine the geographical distribution of species, and does not rely on a binary classification scheme. The texture of a given landscape is the combination of its vertical structural complexity and horizontal spatial grain. The textural discontinuity hypothesis states that biophysical features in the environment are scaled in a discontinuous way, and that discontinuities in the body size distribution of animals mirror these biophysical discontinuities. As a result of this relationship, a complex landscape texture should be associated with small-bodied animals, whereas a simple landscape texture should be associated with larger-bodied animals. We examined this hypothesis for birds in five landscapes in south-eastern Australia that represented a gradient from simple to complex landscape texture. In landscapes with a complex texture, the number of detections of small birds was higher than expected, and the number of detections of larger-bodied birds was lower than expected. The opposite pattern was found in landscapes with a simple texture. The pattern remained significant when only bird species found in each of the five landscapes were considered, which demonstrated that the association of landscape texture with body size was not an artefact of landscapes differing in their species pools. Understanding the effects of landscape texture on species distribution patterns may be a promising research frontier for conservation biogeography. We hypothesize that the active management of landscape texture may be used to attract or deter animals of certain body sizes. Consistent with other theories, the textural discontinuity hypothesis therefore suggests that managing entire landscapes, rather than only predefined patches, is an important conservation strategy.

AB We analyzed changes in land cover in the Sierra de San Javier and its surroundings, an area of ca. 70 000 ha near San Miguel de Tucuman, an urban center of ca. 1 million people in subtropical Argentina. The analysis covered two periods: 1949-1972 and 1972-2006 using remote sensing techniques. For the year 2001, we mapped the patterns of distribution of secondary forests dominated by the most abundant exotic tree species (Ligustrum lucidum). Based on land-cover maps, we estimated sediment yield as an index of watershed condition. Urban area was growing during the whole study period. Between 1949 and 2006, forest area increased approximately 1400 ha, mostly over abandoned agriculture and grasslands; this expansion was accelerated between 1972 and 2006. Increased forest cover resulted in a reduction in erosion and sediment yield that was disproportionately large, as most new forests are located in areas of steep slopes and high rainfall. By 2001, Ligustum-dominated forests had expanded to more than 500 ha, in the southern portion of the sierra only. Overall, the analysis quantifies a process of Neotropical peri-urban forest transition, likely associated with socioeconomic changes related to population urbanization, that promotes improvements of some environmental services, such as watershed and biodiversity conservation. However, natural communities are strongly affected by past land use and neighboring urban areas, which have promoted a growing importance of exotic species with mostly unknown ecological consequences.

AB We present the first tree-ring chronologies of total ring width (RW), earlywood width (EWW) and latewood width (LWW) from Lao P.D.R., from 52 core samples from 26 mature pines (Pinus merkusii Junghuhn & De Vriese), from Phu Khao Khouay National Biodiversity Conservation Area northeast of Vientiane. The chronologies span the 262-year period from 1743 to 2005 A.D., and at least for RW and LWW exhibit strong signal strength back to the late 1700s. Correlation analyses with climate data from a composite of 13 nearby stations in Thailand indicate statistically significant (p <= 0.05) negative correlation with prior year June rainfall, and positive correlation with August-September maximum temperature. Annual radial increment is also significantly negatively correlated with percent cloud fraction, leading us to believe that growth may be adversely affected by light availability (i.e., reduced growth during periods of low light) and not positively affected by high temperature per se. Spatial correlation with sea surface temperature fields highlights the influence of the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, particularly for EWW. Wavelet analysis reveals multi-decadal scale variability between 30 and 60 years for all three indices, and higher frequency power for RW and LWW between 2 and 7 years, the typical range of ENSO. While RW, EWW and LWW all appear to respond to monsoon climate, we highlight the need for far more detailed ecophysiological response studies for this species, particularly with regard to the role of light availability and temperature during the peak monsoon.

AB Phyllomedusa tarsius is a hylid frog that breeds in ponds located in a range of habitats from continuous forests to severely disturbed matrix habitats in Central Amazon. During three reproductive seasons, we followed the movement patterns, measured body size and registered abundance and residency time of this species in five habitats: pasture, Vismia regrowth, Cecropia regrowth, 1 and 10 ha forest fragments, and continuous forest. The frog captures were strongly correlated with rainfall in all disturbed habitats, but not in continuous forest, probably because individuals respond more directly to rainfall patterns in more open habitats. Males in disturbed habitats were smaller than those found in continuous forest, perhaps as a result of differences in habitat quality. Males remained at sites for longer periods in fragments and continuous forest compared to matrix habitats. Here again, the quality and suitability of breeding sites in matrix habitats may be lower than in continuous forest resulting in the need for more movement. We found bigger subpopulations in matrix habitat ponds and a higher percentage of individuals moving among them when compared to continuous forest ponds. Constant movement of individuals among disturbed subpopulations decreases population isolation and increases interbreeding among different subpopulations. No movement between individuals from continuous forest ponds and disturbed habitats was observed. This suggests that the disturbed habitat subpopulations are not acting as sink subpopulations for continuous forest populations. The maintenance of individuals in fragments is more dependent on local conditions for reproduction and on subpopulations in the matrix habitat than on recruitment of individuals from populations in continuous forest.

AB Numerous ecological studies have demonstrated the dramatic effects that humans have on coastal marine ecosystems. Consequently, marine reserves have been established to preserve biodiversity. Recent reviews show that this strategy has paid off because inside reserves, most species have rapidly increased in size and abundance. Even though these studies focused on free-living organisms and paid little attention to parasite populations, numerous authors support the hypothesis that parasitism levels could be good indicators of ecosystem stability. We examined harvesting effects on the dynamics of a parasitic trematode (Proctoeces lintoni) that completes its life cycle in intertidal mussels (Perumytilus purpuratus), keyhole limpets (Fissurella crassa), and clingfish ( Sicyases sanguineus). All of these species are directly or indirectly affected by humans. Prevalence and abundance of the trematode P. lintoni in the three host species were compared in four study sites that differed in the intensity of human harvest. Parasitism infection in limpets and mussels was significantly higher in areas protected from human harvesting than in open-access areas, which suggests a significant change in parasite dynamics inside reserves. Yet the average parasitic biomass found in the gonads of F. crassa did not differ between protected and open-access areas. These results show, then, that the parasite system responded by increasing infection rates in marine protected areas without implication for reproductive success of the intermediate host. Our findings show that the indirect effects of harvesting by humans on the embedded parasite communities of littoral ecosystems require further scientific investigation.

AB Ant communities were investigated in brown coal mining spoil. dumps, and in the surrounding landscape by hand collecting in 100 m(2) quadrats, during spring 2001. Two transects of pitfall traps were also set up, from the base to the peak of spoil mounds (one each in forest and open habitats), and were sampled from May 1998 to May 2001 in order to investigate the composition of resident (workers) and colonizing (virgin queen) ants in the community. The overall numbers of species recorded on the dumps and in the surrounding landscape were comparable, which may result from both the higher number of sites sampled, as well as the higher diversity of sites in dump habitats. The dumps were mostly colonized by species common to the surrounding semi-natural habitats. However, two mountain species, absent from the surrounding landscape, Formica lemani and Manica rubida, were recorded on the dumps. Ant communities in forest plantations on spoil dumps were dominated by Myrmica rubra and Myrmica ruginodis. Lasius niger was locally abundant in the forest plantation and was the most common species of the non-forest dump habitats. Lasius flavus, Myrmica rubra, M. ruginodis and M. scabrinodis were common species in surrounding meadows but rare on the spoil. We postulate that the absence of Lasius flavus on spoil results from its low migration and colonization abilities. In the case of Myrmica rubra, its absence from open dumps probably resulted from environmental constrains of the habitat. The redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated two groups of factors critical for ant community composition. The first group (plot age, depth of humus and fermentation layers, cover of bare soil and soil substrate) corresponded to the successional age of the plot and to the development of the soil. The second group of parameters (tree cover and presence of Salix caprea shrubs) characterized a gradient between forests and open habitats. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Estimates of roosting habitat availability and population size using unbiased sampling regimes are completely lacking for any bat species. The use of conspicuous and accessible roosts in the developing, rolled leaves of Heliconia and Calathea plants by Thyroptera tricolor (Spix's disc-winged bat) provided an ideal opportunity to address this need. To assess roost availability and population size. the number of occupied and unoccupied leaves and bats in known areas in an area of lowland rain forest in north-eastern Costa Rica were quantified in 1998-99. A high density of leaves was available on any given day (mean: 43 leaves ha(-1)). but the density of roost leaves was low (mean: 2.5 leaves ha(-1)). corresponding with a low occupancy rate of 5.7 or 12% based on different methods of estimation. Developing leaves were available for 8-16 h in the preferred size range of leaves used by T. tricolor, and a maximum of 28-60 h, depending on the plant species. Using closed-population mark-recapture models, the 5.69-ha study area supported 261 individuals over a 4-mo period in 1998, corresponding to a density 7 of 43 bats ha(-1). These results have important implications for the results of studies on bat community structure and rarity, and for the behaviour and ecology of T. tricolor.

AB The edge effect is one of the main phenomena studied by landscape ecology, since it plays a decisive role in determining the structure and dynamics of ecological patches. Most conservation issues involving spatial considerations (design of reserves, land use planning, etc.) require- implicitly or explicitly-an analysis of the edge effects under operation and of their consequences. These are classically analyzed through empirical measurements of linear gradients referenced to the patch border, which yield models of edge effects that: (i) wrongly assume a simple spatial relationship to a single point of the border (the nearest one), (ii) provide flawed predictions on the effect fields generated in ecological patches. Malcolm (1994) has recently addressed these problems by considering an alternative approach that formally integrates the edge effect of every point along a patch border (point edge effect'), to generate edge effect fields. In this paper, we deepen the analysis of this concept of addition of multiple point edge effects to generate total effect fields, revealing some important restrictions of Malcolm's method. These restrictions are: (i) linear point edge effects, and (ii) homogeneity of the point edge effect along the patch border. Here we carry out an extended application of this method to patch borders (homogeneous or heterogeneous in their point edge effects) of any geometry and to point edge effects of any kind, no matter how irregular or complex these might be. We provide a general numerical solution for the calculation of edge effect fields by means of a topological parameterization, which has been implemented in a program that can be easily run in MATHEMATICA software. We further show how patch shape and size can interfere with the point edge effect, giving rise to complex effect fields within the patches, which cannot be explained by edge effect penetration alone.

AB A census of the prey captured by seven common web-building spiders (Cyclosacaroli, Gasteracantha cancriformis, Leucauge mariana, L. venusta, Anelosimus jucundus, Achaearanea tesselata, and an undetermined species of Linyphiidae) and two dominant ponerine ant species (Ectatomma ruidum and E. tuberculatum) was carried out over a two-year period in different coffee plantations, in the Mexican state of Chiapas. A total of 4,334 prey items were recovered, of which near to 70% were identified to family level and classified according to their feeding habits. For each of the predators, the bulk of the prey belonged to the four most abundant orders of insects (Hymenoptera, Diptera, Homoptera and Coleoptera) known to be associated with Neotropical coffee plantations.
   The comparison by computed coefficients of both diet breath and diet overlap indicated some degree of similarity between the two ant species, and between the six spider species. Moreover, spiders that used webs that function in a similar manner as insect traps (both araneids and the tetragnathid on one side, both theridiids and the linyphiid on the other side) showed more similar diets. Each predator appeared to have an unique feeding niche within the coffee agroecosystem for all of the 28 comparisons made between pairs of species, diet overlap (C) values were far lower than the theoretical Value of +1 corresponding to complete overlap. Each species also differed in its response to prey availability although the frequency of predation on most types of prey appeared to be positively correlated with their relative abundance in the biotope. This correlation was especially obvious within the Hymenoptera.
   Of the 159 families identified, 30 (38.1% of all the identified prey) were recognized as containing species known to be pests of coffee plants. Herbivores, detritivores and polyphagous arthropods constituted the major part of prey for ants and spiders alike (82.9% of all identified prey for the web-building spiders against 89.9% for the ponerine ants), while only 11.9% of all identified prey corresponded to families that are beneficial (from an agricultural view point) as predators, parasitoids, or possible pollinators. These results, along with the absence of serious native coffee pests in the study area, confirm the beneficial economic impact of web-building spiders and carnivorous ants as generalist predators in Neotropical coffee agroecosystem.

ID POLLINATION; PLANTS
AB The flowering phenology of 27 taxa of palms in a lowland moist forest in the central Amazon was recorded over a 40 month period. Phenological data were transformed into measures of synchrony, regularity, and duration. Flowering was observed at all times of year and there was no correlation with rainfall either for the current month or for any monthly lag interval. The 27 taxa were divided into three pollination groups-weevil, bee/fly, or beetle-based on their behavior at anthesis. Phenology was significantly correlated with pollination groups. Weevil-pollinated palms had higher synchrony and shorter duration of flowering than other groups. Bee/fly-pollinated palms had lower synchrony and longer duration of flowering. The beetle-pollinated palms were intermediate between the two other groups. Seasonal regularity of flowering was similar in all three groups. We suggest that, at least in Bactris, taxa exhibit staggered flowering.

AB Gap dynamics theory suggests that spatial and temporal patterns of species recruitment within canopy gaps may be due to differences in shade tolerance. Although this theory has been developed in low latitude forests, we suggest that it is also applicable in boreal forests. This study investigates temporal and spatial patterns of seedling and sapling regeneration in canopy,gaps caused by spruce budworm. Tree seedlings, saplings, and shrubs were mapped, measured, and aged in five gaps in a 234-year-old conifer stand in the southern part of the boreal forest. Shade-tolerant fir and cedar seedlings and saplings were found in the southern part of the gaps, whereas intolerant aspen root suckers were associated with the northern part of the gaps. Within gaps, fir seedling and sapling density at the quadrat scale was negatively related to mountain maple cover. A temporal partitioning of seedlings and saplings into pre- and post-gap formation also showed a gradient of species establishment related to shade tolerance. The zone of high tight in the northern part of large gaps may permit the maintenance of shade-intolerant species in these forests. However, the small area of this zone and the slowness of gap formation will limit shade-intolerant species abundance.

AB The dynamics of fungal and bacterial potential physiological activities during leaf branch, and bark litter decomposition along a gap size gradient in a subtropical forest was determined using substrate-induced respiration (SIR) with antibiotics selective for fungi and bacteria, respectively. A gap size gradient (1) was under closed canopy; (2) had small gaps with a diameter (less than or equal to 5m); (3) had small to intermediate gaps (5-15 m diameter); (4) had intermediate to large gaps (15-30 m diameter);and (5) had large gaps (greater than or equal to 30 m diameter). Litter decomposition was studied using a litter bag technique. Fungi had higher SIR than bacteria for each type of litter in any size class of gaps. Gaps 1, 2, and 3 had higher fungal and bacterial SIRs than gaps 4 and 5. Moreover, decomposing leaf litter exhibited higher fungal and bacterial SIRs than branch, and branch higher than bark. Simple correlation analysis indicated that fungal SIR was a reliable index of decomposition rates. Fungal SIR was significantly and positively correlated with soil moisture, whereas bacterial SIR was not significantly correlated with soil moisture. The relationships among microclimatic factors, fungal and bacterial physiological activities, and rates of plant litter decomposition suggest that, in subtropical ecosystems, fungal community activities were strongly and directly regulated by the environmental heterogeneity within gaps, and an important regulator of rates of plant litter decomposition rates.

AB Nelson et al. (1994) report a non-uniform distribution of large (0.33 to 33 km(2)) blowdowns in the rainforests of Amazonia. Occurrence of such large disturbances in the wet, low wind speed regime of the Amazon Basin cannot be explained by conventional mechanisms such as fire or hurricanes. While downdrafts from deep convective clouds are likely candidates, this paper draws upon meteorological observations from the central Amazon Basin to show that the requisite magnitudes of wind speed can be reached but only under conditions which would explain the observed horizontal distributions of the large blowdowns. Outflow velocities due to density driven downdrafts in the convective clouds are shown from observations to reach 15 m/s and correspond to the propagation velocities of long-lived Amazon squall lines. Maintenance over 48 h of these squall lines depends upon the correspondence between the outflow velocity and the propagation velocity. The storms propagate within a basic current moving at 5 m/s, increasing the outflow velocities to 21 m/s. The development of a storm-generated pressure field must be called upon to increase the magnitude of the density and basic currents to more than 30 m/s. Such conditions occur only when the convection is embedded in squall lines which reach their diurnal maximum at locations nearly coincident with the observed locations of the maxima in large blowdowns. The characteristics of the observed blowdowns in terms of orientation, size and shape are consistent with winds derived from the postulated downward moving density currents being deflected and accelerated orthogonally at canopy top and forest floor.
   The causes and distribution of large blowdowns in the wet, low wind regime of the Amazon rainforest are shown to be important in explaining the disturbance regime of that system. Such disturbances are necessary in maintaining diversity of the system by locally disrupting the canopy, altering levels of incident radiation received at the surface and changing patterns of nutrient cycling, carbon uptake and storage.

AB I examined the effects of food availability, shell availability and the presence of adults on survival and duration of the megalopal stage of the intertidal hermit crabs Pagurus maclaughlinae Garcia-Gomez, Paguristes tortugae Schmitt and Clibanarius vittatus (Bose) in the laboratory. I also considered the role of substrate availability on C. vittatus. All species delayed metamorphosis significantly in the absence of empty shells; shells also enhanced megalopal survival in P. maclaughlinae and C. vittatus. Water that had previously housed conspecific adults significantly improved megalopal survival and shortened time to metamorphosis in P. maclaughlinae and P. tortugae. Shell-less megalopae of C. vittatus delayed metamorphosis when kept in adult-conditioned water, but metamorphosed more quickly in the presence of sediment. Food availability did not affect the duration of the megalopal stage in P. maclaughlinae or P. tortugae, whereas starved C. vittatus megalopae died in 8 d or less. Although food availability was associated with somewhat enhanced survival in P. tortugae, the mechanism underlying this effect is unknown, since P, tortugae was not observed to feed as either megalopae or zoeae. As in other species of Pagurus, megalopae of P. maclaughlinae were not observed to feed, whereas zoeae and juveniles did feed. The differences and similarities in the nature and extent of the delay capabilities of P. maclaughlinae, P. tortugae and C. vittatus appear to reflect the interaction among various aspects of the ecology of the adults and energetic constraints on the megalopae.

AB The Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm), launched in 2004, promoted a drastic conservation reform in Brazil. To date, the plan has been through four distinct phases: PPCDAm-I (2004-2008), II (2009-2011), III (2012-2015), and IV (2016-2020). A substantial decline from historically high deforestation rates in the Amazon occurred from 2004 to 2012, part of which (particularly after 2007) can be attributed to the PPCDAm, and part to economic factors such as commodity prices and the currency exchange rates that affect the profitability of agricultural exports. After 2012 deforestation has trended upward despite control efforts. The PPCDAm evolved through its four phases, consequently changing the patterns of deforestation in Amazonia. Here, we review the conservation instruments and strategies promoted under the PPCDAm umbrella and, when possible, provide estimates of their impacts on deforestation based on rigorous, counterfactual evaluations. While the literature emphasizes some of the most well-known PPCDAm actions, e.g., improved satellite-based monitoring, the "blacklist" of municipalities, expansion of protected areas, land tenure regularization, credit access restrictions, and moratoria, we highlight a number of other PPCDAm activities that, along with the previous examples, are arguably also responsible for a significant share of the reduction of deforestation in the region.

AB The classification of tree species can significantly benefit from high spatial and spectral information acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) associated with advanced classification methods. This study investigated the following topics concerning the classification of 16 tree species in two subtropical forest fragments of Southern Brazil: i) the potential integration of UAV-borne hyperspectral images with 3D information derived from their photogrammetric point cloud (PPC); ii) the performance of two machine learning methods (support vector machine - SVM and random forest - RF) when employing different datasets at a pixel and individual tree crown (ITC) levels; iii) the potential of two methods for dealing with the imbalanced sample set problem: a new weighted SVM (wSVM) approach, which attributes different weights to each sample and class, and a deep learning classifier (convolutional neural network - CNN), associated with a previous step to balance the sample set; and finally, iv) the potential of this last classifier for tree species classification as compared to the above mentioned machine learning methods. Results showed that the inclusion of the PPC features to the hyperspectral data provided a great accuracy increase in tree species classification results when conventional machine learning methods were applied, between 13 and 17% depending on the classifier and the study area characteristics. When using the PPC features and the canopy height model (CHM), associated with the majority vote (MV) rule, the SVM, wSVM and RF classifiers reached accuracies similar to the CNN, which outperformed these classifiers for both areas when considering the pixel-based classifications (overall accuracy of 84.4% in Area 1, and 74.95% in Area 2). The CNN was between 22% and 26% more accurate than the SVM and RF when only the hyperspectral bands were employed. The wSVM provided a slight increase in accuracy not only for some lesser represented classes, but also some major classes in Area 2. While conventional machine learning methods are faster, they demonstrated to be less stable to changes in datasets, depending on prior segmentation and hand-engineered features to reach similar accuracies to those attained by the CNN. To date, CNNs have been barely explored for the classification of tree species, and CNN-based classifications in the literature have not dealt with hyperspectral data specifically focusing on tropical environments. This paper thus presents innovative strategies for classifying tree species in subtropical forest areas at a refined legend level, integrating UAV-borne 2D hyperspectral and 3D photogrammetric data and relying on both deep and conventional machine learning approaches.

AB The livestock sector provides more than one-third of human protein needs and is a major provider of livelihood in almost all developing countries. While providing such immense benefits to the population, poor livestock management can potentially provide harmful environmental impacts at local, regional, and national levels which have not been adequately addressed in many countries with emerging economies. Twenty-six percent of global land area is used for livestock production and forest lands are continuously being lost to such activities. Land degradation through soil erosion and nutrient depletion is very common across pastures and rangelands. The intensification of livestock production led to large surpluses of on-farm nitrogen and phosphorus inputs that can potentially contribute to nonpoint source pollution of water resources in many parts of the world. The sector is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributing around 14.5% of all human-induced GHG emissions, a major driver of use and pollution of freshwater (accounting 10% anthropogenic water use) and a contributor to the loss of biodiversity. About 60% of global biomass harvested annually to support all human activity is consumed by livestock industry, undermining the sustainability of allocating such large resource to the industry. Despite the negative impacts of livestock production, opportunities exist to balance the competing demands of livestock production and the environment. These include (1) improved technologies and practices that increase livestock productivity with optimal use of land and water, (2) reorienting grazing systems to provide environmental services for water, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and resource conservation, (3) reducing GHG emission from livestock production, and (4) an effective management strategy for efficient and sustainable use of manure in livestock production. Further research, appropriate policy development, and institutional support are important to ensure the competitiveness of the industry. Integration of crops with livestock production provides opportunities for increasing resource use efficiencies and reducing environmental pollution, making the system resilient to impacts of climate change, reducing GHG emissions from the system, enhancing soil quality and fertility, and improving water quantity and quality. Appropriate techniques for assessing and monitoring impacts of livestock production are necessary for developing strategies and making the system profitable, sustainable, and resilient. Isotopic and nuclear techniques play an important role in such assessment and monitoring.

AB Tropical rainforests support the greatest diversity of small mammals in the world, yet we have little understanding about the mechanisms that promote the coexistence of species. Diet partitioning can favor coexistence by lessening competition, and interspecific differences in body size and habitat use are usually proposed to be associated with trophic divergence. However, the use of classic dietary methods (e.g. stomach contents) is challenging in small mammals, particularly in community-level studies, thus we used stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to infer about trophic niche. We investigated i) how trophic niche is partitioned among rodent and marsupial species in three Atlantic forest sites and ii) if interspecific body size and locomotor habit inequalities can constitute mechanisms underlying the isotopic niche partitioning. We found that rodents occupied a broad isotopic niche space with species distributed in different trophic levels and relying on diverse basal carbon sources (C3 and C4 plants). Surprisingly, on the other hand, marsupials showed a narrow isotopic niche, both in delta C-13 and delta N-15 dimensions, which is partially overlapped with rodents, contradicting their description as omnivores and generalists proposed classic dietary studies. Although body mass differences did not explained the divergence in isotopic values among species, groups of species with different locomotor habit presented clear differences in the position of the isotopic niche space, indicating that the use of different forest strata can favor trophic niche partitioning in small mammals communities. We suggest that anthropogenic impacts, such as habitat modification (logging, harvesting), can simplify the vertical structure of ecosystems and collapse the diversity of basal resources, which might affect negatively small mammals communities in Atlantic forests.

AB Despite broad recognition that habitat loss represents the greatest threat to the world's biodiversity, a mechanistic understanding of how habitat loss and associated fragmentation affect ecological systems has proven remarkably challenging. The challenge stems from the multiple interdependent ways that landscapes change following fragmentation and the ensuing complex impacts on populations and communities of interacting species. We confronted these challenges by evaluating how fragmentation affects individual plants through interactions with animals, across five herbaceous species native to longleaf pine savannas. We created a replicated landscape experiment that provides controlled tests of three major fragmentation effects (patch isolation, patch shape [i.e., edge-to-area ratio], and distance to edge), established experimental founder populations of the five species to control for spatial distributions and densities of individual plants, and employed structural equation modeling to evaluate the effects of fragmentation on plant reproductive output and the degree to which these impacts are mediated through altered herbivory, pollination, or pre-dispersal seed predation. Across species, the most consistent response to fragmentation was a reduction in herbivory. Herbivory, however, had little impact on plant reproductive output, and thus we found little evidence for any resulting benefit to plants in fragments. In contrast, fragmentation rarely impacted pollination or pre-dispersal seed predation, but both of these interactions had strong and consistent impacts on plant reproductive output. As a result, our models robustly predicted plant reproductive output (r(2) = 0.52-0.70), yet due to the weak effects of fragmentation on pollination and pre-dispersal seed predation, coupled with the weak effect of herbivory on plant reproduction, the effects of fragmentation on reproductive output were generally small in magnitude and inconsistent. This work provides mechanistic insight into landscape-scale variation in plant reproductive success, the relative importance of plant-animal interactions for structuring these dynamics, and the nuanced nature of how habitat fragmentation can affect populations and communities of interacting species.

AB Australia's urban landscapes offer opportunities to marry socio-economic and biodiversity conservation objectives. Yet, information is needed on what urban landscape and habitat features are important for wildlife. In this article, we draw together our research from southeastern Australia to describe key lessons for biodiversity-sensitive cities and towns. Lesson 1: The effects of urbanization on wildlife extend into adjacent habitats. We recommend retaining large, undisturbed areas of habitat away from development, avoiding intensive development adjacent to important conservation areas, prioritizing areas of ecological and social significance, screening light and noise pollution at the urban fringe and around large nature reserves, and planting appropriately provenanced locally native species for public streetscapes, parks and gardens. Lesson 2: Strategic enhancement of urban greenspace offers biodiversity gains. We recommend increasing the total amount of greenspace cover, maintaining ecological structures as habitat islands, using landscaping techniques to minimize risks to human safety, and gardening with low-flowering native shrubs. Lesson 3: Large old trees need to be managed for long-term sustainability. We recommend retaining large old trees in new developments, increasing the maximum standing life of urban trees, protecting regenerating areas and planting more seedlings, supplementing habitat features associated with large trees, and ensuring that young trees have space to grow through time. Lesson 4: Education and engagement connects residents with nature and raises awareness. We recommend education programs to enhance opportunities for residents to experience and learn about biodiversity, engaging residents in the establishment and maintenance of wildlife habitat, providing 'cues to care', facilitating access to garden plants that benefit wildlife, and encouraging cat containment. These lessons provide an evidence-base for implementing conservation and management actions to improve the capacity of our cities and towns to support a diverse and abundant biota.

AB Many forested headwater streams are heterotrophic ecosystems in which allochthonous inputs of plant litter are a major source of energy. Leaves of riparian vegetation entering the stream are broken down by a combination of biotic and abiotic processes and, in most temperate and boreal streams, provide food and habitat for dense populations of detritivorous invertebrates. However, tropical streams in different parts of the world show substantial variability in the number and diversity of leaf-shredding detritivores (hereafter detritivores). We used data obtained with standardized methods from multiple streams in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Australia to test the hypothesis that this variability would lead to differences in the relative role of detritivores and microorganisms in the breakdown process. We also tested the hypotheses that variability in litter breakdown rates changes with litter type (native litter mixtures vs nonnative alder [Alnus glutinosa]) and is higher across regions within than outside the tropics. We found that litter breakdown rates were highly variable across sites, with no consistent pattern within geographic areas, although litter consumption by detritivores was negligible at several sites, all in America. Geographic patterns of litter breakdown also varied between litter types, with higher breakdown rates for alder than for native litter in most but not all regions. When litter breakdown rates at the tropical sites were compared to previously reported values from temperate and boreal regions, we found that differences in variability between tropical and temperate sites were inconsistent, with great differences among studies. Further global-scale studies will be needed to assess the extent to which latitudinal changes in the diversity and composition of microbial and detritivore assemblages contribute to variability in litter breakdown rates.

AB In plant-pollinator networks, the floral morphology of food plants is an important determinant of the interaction niche of pollinators. Studies on foraging preferences of pollinators combining experimental and observational approaches may help to understand the mechanisms behind patterns of interactions and niche partitioning within pollinator communities. In this study, we tested whether morphological floral traits were associated with foraging preferences of hummingbirds for artificial and natural flower types in Costa Rica. We performed field experiments with artificial feeders, differing in length and curvature of flower types, to quantify the hummingbirds' interaction niche under unlimited nectar resources. To quantify the interaction niche under real-world conditions of limited nectar resources, we measured foraging preferences of hummingbirds for a total of 34 plant species. Artificial feeders were visited by Eupherusa nigriventris and Phaethornis guy in the pre-montane forest, and Lampornis calolaemus in the lower montane forest. Under experimental conditions, all three hummingbird species overlapped their interaction niches and showed a preference for the short artificial flower type over the long-straight and the long-curved flower types. Under natural conditions, the two co-occurring hummingbird species preferred to feed on plant species with floral traits corresponding to their bill morphology. The short-billed hummingbird E.nigriventris preferred to feed on short and straight flowers, whereas the long- and curved-billed P.guy preferred long and curved natural flowers. The medium-size billed species L.calolaemus preferred to feed on flowers of medium length and did not show preferences for plant species with specific corolla curvature. Our results show that floral morphological traits constrain access by short-billed hummingbird species to nectar resources. Morphological constraints, therefore, represent one important mechanism structuring trophic networks. In addition, other factors, such as competition and differences in resource quantity or quality, define the interaction niches of consumer species in real-world communities, enforcing patterns of niche segregation between co-occurring consumer species. This suggests that experimental studies are needed to disentangle effects of morphological constraints from those of competition for resources in plant-pollinator interactions and other types of trophic interactions.

AB Climate change modulates the effects of solar UV radiation on biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, particularly for carbon cycling, resulting in UV-mediated positive or negative feedbacks on climate. Possible positive feedbacks discussed in this assessment include: (i) enhanced UV-induced mineralisation of above ground litter due to aridification; (ii) enhanced UV-induced mineralisation of photoreactive dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic ecosystems due to changes in continental runoff and ice melting; (iii) reduced efficiency of the biological pump due to UV-induced bleaching of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in stratified aquatic ecosystems, where CDOM protects phytoplankton from the damaging solar UV-B radiation. Mineralisation of organic matter results in the production and release of CO2, whereas the biological pump is the main biological process for CO2 removal by aquatic ecosystems. This paper also assesses the interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on the biogeochemical cycling of aerosols and trace gases other than CO2, as well as of chemical and biological contaminants. Interacting effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycles are particularly pronounced at terrestrial-aquatic interfaces.

   DYNAMICS; HYPOTHESIS
AB In community ecology, broad-scale spatial replication can accommodate contingencies in patterns within species groups, but contingencies in processes across species groups remain problematic. Here, based on a focused review of grazing and browsing by large mammals, we use one trophic guild as a "control" for the other to identify generalities that are not contingent upon specific consumer-resource interactions. An example of such a generality is the Jarman-Bell principle, which explains how allometries of metabolism and digestion influence dietary tolerance and thereby enable resource partitioning within both guilds at multiple scales. By comparing the grazing succession with browsing stratification we show how competition from smaller herbivores, rather than facilitation from larger ones, is the underlying process structuring ungulate assemblages when shared resources become limiting. Also, grazing lawns and browsing hedges are functionally similar. In each case, plants expressing tolerance traits can withstand chronic grazing or browsing in sites where the nutritive value of the local food resource is enhanced in positive feedback to the actions of its consumers. The debate over whether ungulates accelerate or decelerate nutrient cycling can be resolved by comparing grazing and browsing effects in the same ecosystem type. Evidence from African savannas points to the rate of nutrient cycling being controlled by the mix of tolerance and resistance traits in plants; not the relative dominance of grazing or browsing by local herbivores. We recommend this across-guild comparative approach as a novel solution with widespread utility for resolving contingencies in community processes.

AB Many woody bamboo species are forest understory plants that become invasive after disturbance. They can grow rapidly forming a dense, nearly monospecific understory that inhibits tree regeneration. The principal aim of this study was to understand what functional traits of bamboos allow them to outcompete tree seedlings and saplings and become successful species in the semideciduous Atlantic Forests of northeastern Argentina. We studied leaf and whole-plant functional traits of two bamboo species of the genus Chusquea and five co-occurring saplings of common tree species growing under similar solar radiation and soil nutrient availabilities. Nutrient addition had no effect on bamboo or tree sapling survival and growth after two years. Tree species with high-light requirements had higher growth rates and developed relatively thin leaves with high photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area and short leaf life-span when growing in gaps, but had lower survival rates in the understory. The opposite pattern was observed in shade-tolerant species that were able to survive in the understory but had lower photosynthetic capacity and growth than light-requiring species in gaps. Bamboos exhibited a high plasticity in functional traits and leaf characteristics that enabled them to grow rapidly in gaps (e.g., higher photosynthetic capacity per unit dry mass and clonal reproduction in gaps than in the understory) but at the same time to tolerate closed-canopy conditions (they had thinner leaves and a relatively longer leaf life-span in the understory compared to gaps). Photosynthetic capacity per unit dry mass was higher in bamboos than in trees. Bamboo plasticity in key functional traits, such as clonal reproduction at the plant level and leaves with a relatively low C cost and high photosynthesis rates, allows them to colonize disturbed forests with consequences at the community and ecosystem levels. Increasing disturbance in some forests worldwide will likely enhance bamboo invasion resulting in profound negative impacts on forest diversity, structure and function in the long term.

AB Unassisted secondary succession in abandoned tropical pastures often results in species-poor forests of pioneer trees that persist for decades. We characterize recruitment rates of woody vegetation in planting treatments during the first 60 months of experimental restoration on thin, eroded soils at Los Tuxtlas, southern Mexico. We test the hypothesis that recruitment of later-successional trees is greater in fenced plots planted with native trees than in fenced controls that simulate natural succession, and further that recruitment of such species would be greater in plots planted with animal-dispersed trees than in those planted with wind-dispersed trees.
   Results indicated much greater recruitment of later-successional animal-dispersed trees in planted plots as compared with controls. Three censuses per year recorded 960 recruited individuals of 44 species of trees and shrubs from 20-60 months after cattle exclusion. Ninety-six percent of recruits were not of planted species. Repeated-measures analyses of variance indicated that recruited communities included more species of pioneers than of later-successional trees and shrubs, with more individuals and species dispersed by animals than by wind. Recruitment of pioneers did not differ between control and planted plots. Later-successional recruits dispersed by animals accumulated >10 times faster in planted than control plots, with apparent acceleration after planted Cecropia obtusifolia and Ficus yoponensis first produced fleshy fruits 48 months after cattle exclusion. Sparse later-successional wind-dispersed recruits did not differ by treatment. Our preliminary results over the first five years after cattle exclusion indicate that planted stands clearly accelerate succession through accumulation of later-successional trees and shrubs dispersed by animals.

AB Background: Large-scale forest conservation projects are underway in the Brazilian Amazon but little is known regarding their public health impact. Current literature emphasizes how land clearing increases malaria incidence, leading to the conclusion that forest conservation decreases malaria burden. Yet, there is also evidence that proximity to forest fringes increases malaria incidence, which implies the opposite relationship between forest conservation and malaria. We compare the effect of these environmental factors on malaria and explore its implications.
   Methods and Findings: Using a large malaria dataset (similar to 1,300,000 positive malaria tests collected over similar to 4.5 million km(2)), satellite imagery, permutation tests, and hierarchical Bayesian regressions, we show that greater forest cover (as a proxy for proximity to forest fringes) tends to be associated with higher malaria incidence, and that forest cover effect was 25 times greater than the land clearing effect, the often cited culprit of malaria in the region. These findings have important implications for land use/land cover (LULC) policies in the region. We find that cities close to protected areas (PA's) tend to have higher malaria incidence than cities far from PA's. Using future LULC scenarios, we show that avoiding 10% of deforestation through better governance might result in an average 2-fold increase in malaria incidence by 2050 in urban health posts.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that cost analysis of reduced carbon emissions from conservation efforts in the region should account for increased malaria morbidity, and that conservation initiatives should consider adopting malaria mitigation strategies. Coordinated actions from disparate science fields, government ministries, and global initiatives (e. g., Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation; Millenium Development Goals; Roll Back Malaria; and Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria), will be required to decrease malaria toll in the region while preserving these important ecosystems.

AB A major challenge of ecological research is to assess the functional consequences of species richness loss over time and space in global biodiversity hotspots, where extinctions are happening at an unprecedented rate. To address this issue, greater realism needs to be incorporated into both conceptual and experimental approaches. Here we propose a conceptual model that incorporates body size as a critical aspect of community responses to environmental change, which we tested in the Western Amazonian rain forest, one of the most speciose ecosystems on the planet. We employed an exclosure removal experiment (replicated under 10 microhabitats and four climatic conditions) in which we manipulated access to two types of resource by the whole community of dung and carrion beetles (>60 species), depending on their size. Our 400 independent measurements revealed that changes in the number of species and functional groups, and temporal patterns in community composition, all affected resource burial rates, a key ecosystem process. Further, the functional contribution of species diversity in each size class was tightly dependent on beetle abundance, and while the role of large species could be performed by abundant smaller ones, and other naturally occurring decomposers, this was not the case when environmental conditions were harsher. These results demonstrate, for the first time in an animal assemblage in a tropical ecosystem, that although species may appear functionally redundant under one set of environmental conditions, many species would be needed to maintain ecosystem functioning at multiple temporal and spatial scales. This highlights the potential fragility of these systems to the ongoing global "Sixth Great Extinction,'' whose effects are likely to be especially pronounced in the Tropics.

AB It has been assumed that plant biomass partitioning to stems and roots at the ecosystem level follows a single strategy according to which the stem biomass scales isometrically with root biomass, a hypothesis known as 'isometric scaling'. In this study, we examined an alternative theory used for plants: plant biomass is allocated preferentially to the plant organ that harvests the limiting growth resource, a theory known as the 'balanced growth hypothesis'. Our objective was to test these two alternative hypotheses across a water availability gradient. We quantified the stem and root biomass in a seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) in three regions of the Yucatan peninsula along a precipitation gradient. Reduced major axis analysis showed that the slopes of the relationship between stem and root biomass across the study regions were statistically similar and significantly different from 1.0 (common slope = 2.5), which contrasts with the 'isometric scaling' hypothesis. The allometric coefficient was different between regions along the precipitation gradient, which showed that plant biomass allocation to stems is higher in high than in low water availability regions where biomass is allocated in greater proportions to roots. The stem:root ratio increases following the low to high water availability gradient. Our results showed that plant biomass allocation in the SDTF follows a simple allometric strategy in which greater plant biomass is allocated to stems irrespective of water availability, suggesting to the forest level that plant biomass allocation strategy is invariant across the water availability gradient.

AB Studying the spatial pattern and interspecific associations of plant species may provide valuable insights into processes and mechanisms that maintain species coexistence. Point pattern analysis was used to analyze the spatial distribution patterns of twenty dominant tree species, their interspecific spatial associations and changes across life stages in a 20-ha permanent plot of seasonal tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna, China, to test mechanisms maintaining species coexistence. Torus-translation tests were used to quantify positive or negative associations of the species to topographic habitats. The results showed: (1) fourteen of the twenty tree species were negatively (or positively) associated with one or two of the topographic variables, which evidences that the niche contributes to the spatial pattern of these species. (2) Most saplings of the study species showed a significantly clumped distribution at small scales (0-10 m) which was lost at larger scales (10-30 m). (3) The degree of spatial clumping deceases from saplings, to poles, to adults indicates that density-dependent mortality of the offspring is ubiquitous in species. (4) It is notable that a high number of positive small-scale interactions were found among the twenty species. For saplings, 42.6% of all combinations of species pairs showed positive associations at neighborhood scales up to five meters, but only 38.4% were negative. For poles and adults, positive associations at these distances still made up 45.5% and 29.5%, respectively. In conclusion, there is considerable evidence for the presence of positive interactions among the tree species, which suggests that species herd protection may occur in our plot. In addition, niche assembly and limited dispersal (likely) contribute to the spatial patterns of tree species in the tropical seasonal rain forest in Xishuangbanna, China.

AB Tropical plant diversity is extraordinarily high at both local and regional scales. Many studies have demonstrated that natural enemies maintain local diversity via negative density dependence, but we know little about how natural enemies influence beta-diversity across habitats and/or regions. One way herbivores could influence plant beta-diversity is by driving allocation trade-offs that promote habitat specialization across resource gradients. We therefore predicted that increasing resource availability should be accompanied by increasing herbivory rates and decreasing plant allocation to defense. Second, relative abundances within plant lineages are predicted to reflect patterns of habitat specialization and allocation trade-offs. A phylogenetic context is vital not only to compare homologous plant traits (including defense strategies) across habitat types, but also to connect evolutionary trade-offs to patterns of species diversification in each phylogenetic lineage.
   We tested these predictions for trees in white-sand, clay terra firme, and seasonally flooded forests in Peru and French Guiana that represent the range of soil fertility, forest structure, and floristic compositions found throughout the Amazon region. We established 74 0.5-ha plots in these habitats and sampled all trees. Within 12 representative plots we marked newly expanding leaves of 394 saplings representing 68 species, including the most abundant species in each plot in addition to species from five focal lineages: Swartzia and Inga (Fabaceae), Protieae (Burseracaeae), Bombacoideae (Malvaceae), and Micropholis (Sapotaceae). We measured total leaf production rates for each sapling and calculated relative herbivory impact as the ratio between herbivory rate and leaf production rate.
   Herbivory rates averaged 2.1% per month, did not correlate with leaf production rate, and were similar across habitats. Relative herbivore impacts exceeded leaf production rates for most species. Leaf production rate averaged 2.8%, was significantly higher in seasonally flooded forests than the other two habitats, and exhibited significant correlations with specific leaf area. Species with high herbivory rates exhibited significantly lower relative abundances in terra firme forests. Overall, focal species within lineages present contrasting patterns regarding their herbivory rates and leaf production rate within habitats. These results highlight why a lineage-based approach is necessary when attempting to connect hypotheses regarding evolutionary trade-offs to community assembly patterns.

In addition, the gastrointestinal tract microbiota is often exposed to antibiotics, and may be an important reservoir of resistant strains and of transferable resistance genes from early infancy. We are investigating by means of diverse metagenomic approaches several areas of microbiota development in infants, including the deployment of functional capabilities at the community level, the presence of antibiotic resistances and the population dynamics of the most abundant genera.

AB Habitat heterogeneity and dispersal limitation are widely considered to be the two major mechanisms in determining tree species distributions. However, few studies have quantified the relative importance of these two mechanisms at different life stages of trees. Moreover, rigorous quantification of the effects of dominant tree species in determining species distributions has seldom been explored. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the distribution of tree species is regulated by different mechanisms at different life history stages. In particular, we hypothesised that dispersal limitation regulates the distribution of trees at early life stages and that environmental factors control the distribution of trees as they grow, because of niche differentiation resulting from environmental filtering. To test this, trees in 400-m2 quadrats in a 20-ha plot in Xishuangbanna, southwest China were grouped into four classes on the basis of the diameter at breast height (DBH) that roughly represent different stages in the life history of trees. A neighbourhood index was computed to represent a neutral spatial autocorrelation effect. We used both biotic (dominant species) and abiotic (topography and soil) predictor variables to model the distribution of each target species while controlling for spatial autocorrelation within each of the DBH classes. To determine which factors played the largest role in regulating target species distribution, the simulated annealing method was used in model selection based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) values. The results showed that the relative importance of neutral and niche processes in regulating species distribution varied across life stages. The neutral neighbourhood index played the most important role in determining the distributions of small trees (1 cm = DBH = 10 cm), and dominant species, as biotic environmental predictor variables, were the next most important regulators for trees of this size. Environmental predictor variables played the most important role in determining the distributions of large trees (10 cm = DBH). This finding builds on previous research into the relative importance of neutral and niche processes in determining species distributions regardless of life stages or DBH classes.

AB In the present context of global climate changes and the continuous development of forest management strategies based on the concept of sustainable use, it is important to develop a better understanding of the climatic factors controlling the growth of boreal forests. In this study, we report the results of a five-year field research within which day-to-day balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L) Mill.) stem diameter variation was measured with dendrometers and examined in relation with various daily climatic variables. A model built with data from three growing seasons that included solar radiation, relative humidity, temperature and precipitation explained 84% of the variance in day-to-day stem diameter variation from June to September. The model has approximately the same predictive capability when validated with independent daily data from two other growing seasons. The model captured both the cumulative increment associated with the irreversible growth and the high frequency variation of day-to-day fluctuations associated to changes in the stem water content. In general, rainy days during which relative humidity was high and solar radiation was low favored stem diameter expansion (growth and swelling) while stem diameter decreased during periods of low relative humidity and high solar radiation. Similar models were obtained when the June-September period was divided into two parts (June-July and August-September) to better represent the period during which most of the cumulative annual stem increment is observed (June-July). Inter-annual variation in stem growth computed from the modeled day-to-day variation in stem diameter was significantly correlated to the inter-annual variation in annual growth determined from tree core measurements over a 10 year period (p = 0.023). The model was notably able to capture a particularly poor growing year (2006) presumably due to a short-term heat stress period. Results suggest that the inclusion of daily data in growth-climate models may contribute to improve predictions of the potential tree growth response to climate by identifying particular climatic events that may escape to a classical dendroclimatic approach.

AB Tropical montane cloud forest has been undergoing a drastic reduction because of its widespread conversion to pastures. Once these forests have been cleared exotic grasses are deliberately introduced for forage production. Exotic grass species commonly form monodominant stands and produce more biomass than native grass species, resulting in the inhibition of secondary succession and tree regeneration. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of native vs. exotic grass species on the early establishment of two native tree seedlings (Mexican alder, Alnus acuminata and Jalapa oak, Quercus xalapensis) on an abandoned farm in central Veracruz, Mexico. Seedling survival and growth were monitored (over 46 weeks) in relation to grass cover and height, and available photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). More seedlings survived in the presence of the native grass Panicum glutinosum than those growing with the exotic grass Cynodon plectostachyus (92% vs. 48%). The causes of seedling mortality varied between species; Q. xalapensis was affected by herbivory by voles but mainly in the exotic grass-dominated stands, whereas A. acuminata seedlings died due to competition with the exotic grass. A. acuminata seedlings increased more in height in the exotic grass-dominated stands (102 +/- 7.8 cm) compared to native grass-dominated stands (51 +/- 4.7 cm). Grass layer height, cover and available PAR were correlated (Pearson: p < 0.05). In the exotic grass dominated plots, grass layer height was correlated with the relative height growth rates of Q. xalapensis (Pearson: p < 0.05). These results indicate that the exotic grass may be affecting tree regeneration directly (grass competition) and indirectly (higher herbivory). Passive restoration may occur once P. glutinosum dominated pastures are abandoned. However, when C plectostachyus dominates, introduction of early and mid successional tree seedlings protected against vole damage is needed. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge on juvenile tree growth is crucial to understand how trees reach the canopy in tropical forests. However, long-term data on juvenile tree growth are usually unavailable. Annual tree rings provide growth information for the entire life of trees and their analysis has become more popular in tropical forest regions over the past decades. Nonetheless, tree ring studies mainly deal with adult rings as the annual character of juvenile rings has been questioned. We evaluated whether juvenile tree rings can be used for three Bolivian rainforest species. First, we characterized the rings of juvenile and adult trees anatomically. We then evaluated the annual nature of tree rings by a combination of three indirect methods: evaluation of synchronous growth patterns in the tree- ring series, C-14 bomb peak dating and correlations with rainfall. Our results indicate that rings of juvenile and adult trees are defined by similar ring-boundary elements. We built juvenile tree-ring chronologies and verified the ring age of several samples using C-14 bomb peak dating. We found that ring width was correlated with rainfall in all species, but in different ways. In all, the chronology, rainfall correlations and C-14 dating suggest that rings in our study species are formed annually.

AB There is a lack of understanding on factors influencing the occurrence of high species heterogeneity at fine scale in the Brazilian cerrado. Soil is a major determinant of vegetation in the Brazilian cerrado and an important candidate to influence species distribution at fine scales, since soil features vary at very small distances, whereas many environmental variables are relatively homogeneous at such scale. We tested plant soil relationships at fine scales in a cerrado site. We placed 100 contiguous 25 m(2) plots, where we identified all woody individuals and measured several soil features. We did partial redundancy analysis, controlling for spatial autocorrelation, to test for relationships between soil features and floristic composition. We also did multiple regressions or spatial autoregressive models to test for relationships between soil features and: (1) the abundance of the five most common species, (2) total abundance, (3) richness, (4) evenness, and (5) diversity. We found weak relationships between soil and floristic composition, richness, and total abundance, which, coupled with also weak relationship found in another study with plant available water, indicate there is no major environmental variable influencing vegetation at fine scales, but several of them interacting. Organic matter was positively related with the abundance of Myrsine umbellata and was negatively related to evenness. Although a causal relationship cannot be inferred with certainty, the dominance of Myrsine umbellata seems to be related to a positive feedback with soil. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB An international payment for ecosystem service (IPES) schemes may be one of the only mechanisms available to stimulate the provision of vital non-marketed ecosystem services at the global level, as those nations that benefit from global ecosystem services (GES) cannot readily force other sovereign nations to provide them. Currently, international trade offers trillions of dollars in incentives for countries to convert natural capital into marketable goods and services, and few payments to entice countries to conserve natural capital in order to sustain critical non-marketed ecosystem services. We examine the biophysical characteristics of climate change and biodiversity to understand the obstacles to developing effective IPES schemes. We find that none of the existing schemes for providing GES are adequate, given the scale of the problem. A cap and auction scheme for CO2 emissions among wealthy nations could fund IPES and simultaneously deter carbon emissions. To disburse funds, we should adapt Brazil's ICMS ecologic, and apportion available funds to targeted countries in proportion to how well they meet specific criteria designed to measure the provision of GES. Individual countries can then develop their own policies for increasing provision of these services, ensured of compensation if they do so. Indirect IPES should include funding for freely available technologies that protect or provide GES, such as the low carbon energy alternatives that will be essential for curbing climate change. Markets rely on the price mechanism to generate profits, which rations technology to those who can afford it, reducing adoption rates, innovation and total value. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Differential herbivory and/or differential plant resistance or tolerance in sun and shade environments may influence plant distribution along the light gradient. Embothrium coccineum is one of the few light-demanding tree species in the temperate rainforest of southern South America, and seedlings are frequently attacked by insects and snails. Herbivory may contribute to the exclusion of E. coccineum from the shade if 1) herbivory pressure is greater in the shade, which in turn can result from shade plants being less resistant or from habitat preferences of herbivores, and/or 2) consequences of damage are more detrimental in the shade, i.e., shade plants are less tolerant. We tested this in a field study with naturally established seedlings in treefall gaps (sun) and forest understory (shade) in a temperate rainforest of southern Chile. Seedlings growing in the sun sustained nearly 40% more herbivore damage and displayed half of the specific leaf area than those growing in the shade. A palatability test showed that a generalist snail consumed ten times more leaf area when fed on shade leaves compared to sun leaves, i.e., plant resistance was greater in sun-grown seedlings. Herbivore abundance (total biomass) was two-fold greater in treefall gaps compared to the forest understory. Undamaged seedlings survived better and showed a slightly higher growth rate in the sun. Whereas simulated herbivory in the shade decreased seedling survival and growth by 34% and 19%, respectively, damaged and undamaged seedlings showed similar survival and growth in the sun. Leaf tissue lost to herbivores in the shade appears to be too expensive to replace under the limiting light conditions of forest understory. Following evaluations of herbivore abundance and plant resistance and tolerance in contrasting light environments, we have shown how herbivory on a light-demanding tree species may contribute to its exclusion from shade sites. Thus, in the shaded forest understory, where the seedlings of some tree species are close to their physiological tolerance limit, herbivory could play an important role in plant establishment.

AB The Atacama Desert, located in northern Chile, is one of the driest deserts on the Earth. However, in some years, short and sporadic rainfall in the southern end of this desert has increased the soil moisture that produces ephemeral "desert bloom". Our goal was to assess the composition of the bacterial community and determine variations in the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria guild diversity from soils collected during the course of the "desert bloom" event. The bacterial composition from this arid soil was determined by cloning and sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. A relatively high diversity of clones belonging to 14 bacterial groups was detected. The ammonia-oxidizers showed a significantly higher diversity of amoA gene clones after the "desert bloom" than during or at the beginning of this event. All sequences obtained were related to Nitrosospira genera and environmental clones. These results suggest that the diversity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in this arid soil can be affected by the occurrence of "desert bloom". (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although previous studies have demonstrated high use of shade coffee plantations by Neotropical migratory birds, we still have a poor understanding of the suitability of shade coffee plantations as habitat on the wintering grounds. We studied density, body condition, and survivorship of Neotropical migrants, with emphasis on cerulean warbler (Dendroica cerulea), in primary forest and shade coffee plantations in Venezuela. We worked in three primary forest sites and three shade coffee plantations on the western slope of the Cordillera de Merida of the Andes Mountains. At each site, we surveyed migrants with distance-based line transects and mist-netted and banded migrants during November-February 2005/06 and 2006/07. In addition, we estimated apparent monthly survival for cerulean warbler based on 29 color-banded individuals. Densities of migrants were 3-14x higher in shade coffee plantations than primary forest sites, even after accounting for differences in detectability. Apparent monthly survival of cerulean warblers was estimated at 97% and overwinter persistence was similarly high. in addition, cerulean warblers demonstrated high between-season fidelity, with 65% of the birds banded the first year being resighted during the second year. Interestingly, immature birds returned at nearly half the rate as did adults. Banding data indicated that body condition increased significantly as the season progressed for cerulean warblers, Tennessee warblers (Vermivora peregrina), and American redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla). Collectively, these data provide evidence that shade coffee plantations offer high quality wintering habitat for Neotropical migrants, including cerulean warblers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB 1. As human population size increases, demand for natural resources will increase. Logging pressure related to increasing demands continues to threaten remote areas of Amazonian forest. A harvest protocol is required to provide renewable timber resources that meet consumer needs while minimizing negative effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Reduced-impact logging (RIL) may be a viable option to achieve these goals.
   2. Effects of RIL (18 m(3) ha(-1)) and forest physiognomy were assessed for populations of bats from Amazonian terra firme forest in Brazil at 20-42 months postharvest.
   3. Based on 64 512 meter-hours of netting, 1468 bats were captured representing 47 species, 30 genera, four families and five feeding ensembles. Five species (one nectarivore and four frugivores) responded to management in a consistent manner: four were more abundant in logged forest and one was more abundant in undisturbed forest. Ten species (one nectarivore, two gleaning animalivores and seven frugivores) responded to forest physiognomy in a consistent manner: nine were more abundant in closed-canopy sites and one was more abundant in gaps. Three species (all frugivores) exhibited idiosyncratic responses to management that were contingent on physiognomy.
   4. Using qualitative measures (changes in status from common to rare, or from present to absent), RIL elicited negative responses from 16 species, mostly rare taxa. After accounting for differences in total number of collected individuals, control forest harboured seven to 15 more rare species than did forest subjected to RIL.
   5. Synthesis and applications. In the short term, RIL generally did not negatively affect populations of abundant bats. In contrast, reductions in abundance or local extirpation in response to RIL generally characterized uncommon or rare species. Arrangement of RIL sites in a matrix of undisturbed forest may allow source-sink dynamics to mitigate effects of RIL on rare or sensitive species and enhance sustainability at a regional scale.

AB Current forestry practices in Chile largely rely on exotic tree plantations, and limited management experiences are available for the species-rich native evergreen rain forests. Yet, conservationists and forest scientists call for sustainable management of native forests as an alternative to plantations so as to maintain important ecosystem services. We parameterised the process-based forest growth model FORMIND for a Valdivian coastal temperate rain forest in Chiloe Island, Chile, to assess the ecological implications of different logging practices including selective logging and strip-cutting. We tested the model by comparing simulation results with field data from the study site and carried out an extensive sensitivity analysis to explore the impacts of parameter values on model results. Simulated logging practices were compared in regard to expected timber harvest and long-term impacts on forest structure and composition.
   Results showed that highest harvests could be achieved when strip-cutting was applied, because it promoted the regeneration of the relatively light-demanding and fast-growing Eucryphia cordifolia. However, forest structure and composition were severely altered by this practice. In contrast. selective logging, although providing lower harvests, better conserved old-growth forest structure and composition. Canopy gaps created by selective logging were not large enough to ensure regeneration of E. cordifolia, but favoured the shade-tolerant Laureliopsis philippiana. Overall, the similarity of logged stands to undisturbed forest decreased linearly with increasing harvesting intensity. Management strategies that rely on native species and keep an uneven-aged forest structure ensure the maintenance of native biodiversity, protect ecosystems from exotic species invasions. and promote the conservation of biotic interactions essential for tree reproduction.

AB Following habitat fragmentation, species are predicted to go locally extinct from remnant patches in a predictable order due to differential extinction vulnerabilities. This selective species loss will result in nested distributions of species such that species found in depauperate patches will also tend to be found in larger, more speciose patches. Therefore, it should be possible to determine the relationship between species-specific characteristics and extinction vulnerability by comparing the order in which species are nested [i.e. nestedness ranking (NR)] with various natural history characteristics available from the literature and/or collected in the field. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the NRs of 41 resident forest-interior bird species inhabiting recently isolated landbridge islands in Lago Guri, Venezuela, with a large number of natural history characteristics collected from the literature (regional abundance, body length, habitat specificity, trophic guild, sensitivity to disturbance, range size) and from the field (local population density). In a comparison of the best regression models generated using just variables available through the literature (i.e. no local population density) with the best model generated using all possible variables, we found that the inclusion of field-based data significantly improved the amount of variation explained. The best overall model (r(2)=0.40, P<0.001) included body size, habitat specificity, zoogeographic distribution (a measure of range size) and local population density as predictors of NR. Understanding the factors that influence extinction vulnerability has important implications for conservation and could be used to help direct management efforts.

AB Unlike other species of the genus Blechnum, the fern Blechnum chilense occurs in a wide range of habitats in Chilean temperate rainforest, from shaded forest understories to abandoned clearings and large gaps. We asked if contrasting light environments can exert differential selection on ecophysiological traits of B. chilense. We measured phenotypic selection on functional traits related to carbon gain: photosynthetic capacity (A (max)), dark respiration rate (R (d)), water use efficiency (WUE), leaf size and leaf thickness in populations growing in gaps and understorey environments. We assessed survival until reproductive stage and fecundity (sporangia production) as fitness components. In order to determine the potential evolutionary response of traits under selection, we estimated the genetic variation of these traits from clonally propagated individuals in common garden experiments. In gaps, survival of B. chilense was positively correlated with WUE and negatively correlated with leaf size. In contrast, survival in shaded understories was positively correlated with leaf size. We found positive directional fecundity selection on WUE in gaps population. In understories, ferns of lower R (d) and greater leaf size showed greater fecundity. Thus, whereas control of water loss was optimized in gaps, light capture and net carbon balance were optimized in shaded understories. We found a significant genetic component of variation in WUE, R (d) and leaf size. This study shows the potential for evolutionary responses to heterogeneous light environments in functional traits of B. chilense, a unique fern species able to occupy a broad successional niche in Chilean temperate rainforest.

AB Ficus insipida Willd. (Moraceae) is a fast growing tree species of early successional stages in the Amazonian nutrient-rich white-water floodplains (varzea). The species is one of the most economically important low-density wood species in the community-based forest management project in the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve (MSDR) in Central Amazonia, where timber species are managed using a polycyclic selection system with a minimum logging diameter (MLD) of 50 cm and a cutting cycle of 25 years. In this study we analyze the floristic composition, stand structure and forest regeneration of a natural 20 year-old stand at an early successional stage and we model tree growth of diameter, height and volume of F. inspida based on tree-ring analysis to define management criteria. The volume growth model indicates that the preferred period for logging should be at a tree age of 17 years when the current annual volume increment peaks. This age corresponds to a diameter of 55 cm, which would be an appropriate MLD.

AB Roads and powerline corridors destroy canopy connectivity in the rainforest of north- east Australia. We tested the hypotheses that linear barriers affect ( a) the alignment of home ranges, ( b) use of habitat either side of linear barriers, and ( c) the crossing of them by the strictly arboreal lemuroid ringtail possum ( Hemibelideus lemuroides), which is known to be vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. Radio- tracking and a translocation experiment were conducted at a narrow 7- m- wide road and an 80- m- wide powerline. Homes ranges of lemuroid ringtails ranged from 0.15 to 1.67 ha ( minimum convex polygon) and were aligned with the road but not powerline corridors. When lemuroid ringtails were experimentally translocated, wider canopy clearings over roads reduced their capacity to return to their original home range, and the powerline corridor was a nearly insurmountable barrier. No possums were observed crossing roads or the powerline corridor at ground level or residing in the intervening matrix, indicating that loss of canopy connectivity has a negative impact on their movements.

AB The main aim of this paper is to examine and discuss the global pattern of woodpecker diversity from a conservation perspective. In addition, I review ecological traits and the conservation status of the entire family Picidae, and relate these factors to the human driven change in their habitats. Finally, I present a global overview of the research on woodpeckers in order to identify the major gaps in our knowledge which render the management of populations of these species difficult. The hotspots of woodpecker species richness identified by GIS were found in tropical and subtropical forests of South-East Asia, South and Central America, and equatorial Africa. Most of these hotspots were located in developing countries. However, almost 90% of articles published in 1985-2004 encompassed studies performed in North America and Europe, that is, in geographic areas harbouring only 17% of the global number of Picidae species.

AB An hypothesized advantage of seed dispersal is avoidance of high per capita mortality (i.e. density-dependent mortality) associated with dense populations of seeds and seedlings beneath parent trees. This hypothesis, inherent in nearly all seed dispersal studies, assumes that density effects are species-specific. Yet because many tree species exhibit overlapping fruiting phenologies and share dispersers, seeds may be deposited preferentially under synchronously fruiting heterospecific trees, another location where they may be particularly vulnerable to mortality, in this case by generalist seed predators. We demonstrate that frugivores disperse higher densities of Cornusflorida seeds under fruiting (female) Ilexopaca trees than under non-fruiting (male) Ilex trees in temperate hardwood forest settings in South Carolina, USA. To determine if density of Cornus and/or Ilex seeds influences survivorship of dispersed Cornus seeds, we followed the fates of experimentally dispersed Cornus seeds in neighborhoods of differing, manipulated background densities of Cornus and Ilex seeds. We found that the probability of predation on dispersed Cornus seeds was a function of both Cornus and Ilex background seed densities. Higher densities of Ilex seeds negatively affected Cornus seed survivorship, and this was particularly evident as background densities of dispersed Cornus seeds increased. These results illustrate the importance of viewing seed dispersal and predation in a community context, as the pattern and intensity of density-dependent mortality may not be solely a function of conspecific densities.

AB 1. One proposed mechanism by which tree species coexist is through partitioning gradients of light availability. We performed a pot experiment in which seedlings of 12 pioneer species were established in 30% light, then transplanted to six light treatments designed to simulate natural gaps ranging from 25 m(2) (approximate to10% full sun) to 800 m(2) (60% full sun). Plants were harvested after 56-117 days, and comparisons were made of allocation patterns and growth and carbon assimilation rates.
   2. Species varied strongly in their maximum relative growth rate (RGR, range 15.4-83.6 mg g(-1) day(-1)). However, we found little evidence for gap-size partitioning based on growth rate, as species RGR in large and small simulated gaps was strongly correlated (r = 0.83, P < 0.001).
   3. Species differences in growth reflected variation in both physiology and allocation. Net assimilation rate was a strong determinant of RGR across all simulated gap sizes (r(2) = 0.60-0.71, P < 0.001). Leaf area ratio was a poor predictor of growth rate under all gap sizes (r(2) = 0.04-0.08, NS).
   4. The maximum rate of net C assimilation (A(max)) increased significantly with simulated gap size for all but one pioneer species, but only when measured on a per area basis. Among species variation in A(max) was only weakly related to RGR. Foliar nitrogen concentration varied widely among species (range 2.2-4.7% dry mass), but was only weakly correlated with RGR (r(2) = 0.04-0.30).
   5. Previous growth analyses of tropical seedlings have identified both specific leaf area (SLA) and seed mass as key traits correlated with growth rate. Although SLA varied twofold and seed mass more than a thousand-fold among the pioneer species in this study, neither trait was significantly correlated with among-species variation in RGR. Although these traits underlie major differences in life history between shade-tolerant and pioneer species, they contribute little to variation in growth performance within the pioneer functional group.

AB Although forest stands represent 47% of the total land area in Europe, alterations to the forest habitat through logging and plantation of exotic trees has led to significant changes in forest biocenoses. Due to their peculiar biology and life history, epiphytic bryophytes, which include a number of species of high conservation value, are especially concerned. Ordinal logit regression was used to test whether trends in diversity and abundance of obligate epiphytic bryophytes are explained by forest cover and spruce plantation and determine specific optima and degree of reliance to these factors at the landscape scale. Spruce plantations had a negative impact on both species diversity and abundance. Although large forest patches were important for a set of species exclusively or more frequently occurring under the forest cover, the abundance of a number of species previously identified as woodland bryophytes decreased or was uncorrelated with increasing forest cover. Furthermore, the species pool adapted to edge-related abiotic conditions was important. The global epiphytic diversity did consequently not decrease with decreasing forest cover at the landscape scale. If large forest patches are important for the conservation of a set of species exclusively or more frequently occurring under the forest cover, the conservation of epiphytic bryophytes thus also involves the conservation of pioneer trees in open landscapes. A series of management measures, which may help maximize the species diversity and probability of occurrence of key-species of high conservation interest, are proposed.

AB Before Bwindi Impenetrable forest, Uganda, became a national park in 1991, there was a high level of human activity in much of the forest, especially cutting of large trees for timber by pitsawyers. This created extensive gaps in this tropical Afromontane rain forest. We quantified and compared tree regeneration in three sites that were logged at different intensities. Gap sizes in Bwindi, even under fairly natural conditions are very large ( mean = 4460.1 m(2)). Logging further enlarged the gap sizes and had a negative impact on tree regeneration. The study shows the strong role of logging disturbance in promoting an alternative successional pathway, where the large gaps created by logging are in a low-canopy state dominated by a dense tangle of herbs, shrubs, and herbaceous or semiwoody climbers. We recommend periodic monitoring of gap size and tree regeneration in the gaps to ascertain the trend of recovery from past logging disturbance.

AB We studied the effect of forest fragmentation on the nesting biology and reproductive success of three species of tapaculos (Rhinocryptidae) in relation to forest size, edge effects, and disturbance from livestock or logging over a 6-year period (1993-1999) in Chilean temperate rainforest. Overall, Mayfield nest success (n = 360) among the three species ranged from 64% to 85%, and predation accounted for 64% of nest losses. Considering all types of losses, nest mortality was similar in fragmented and unfragmented forest, but predation was higher in fragmented forest. Successful nest sites of the Chucao Tapaculo (Sclerochilus rubecula; the species with the largest sample size) were nearer forest edges, better concealed, closer to the ground, and had longer entrance tunnels, on average, than depredated nests. Reuse of nest sites by chucaos was more common in forest fragments with livestock or logging than in undisturbed forests, but reuse was independent of forest size. Success of second broods was lower in reused nest sites than in new nest sites. Nestling growth in fragmented forest and forest with livestock or logging activity was similar to that in unfragmented and undisturbed forest. Clutch size was typically two, but birds nesting at low densities in forest fragments often laid three-egg clutches following a nest failure. In addition to negative effects of forest fragmentation during nesting (greater use of less-successful nest sites, higher nest predation), there was an indication that early juvenile survival was lower in forest fragments.

AB The objectives of the present study are to describe and compare the brachyuran community of rocky shores within the Central Portuguese coast and to examine the zonation patterns of the most representative species. For this, randomly placed transects were surveyed to obtain crab counts according to microhabitat and intertidal level. Repeated sampling in two different shores during two different seasons provided spatial and temporal replication for zonation analyses. Seven species were registered: Pachygrapsus marmoratus, Eriphia verrucosa, Xantho incisus, Carcinus maenas, Necora puber, Pirimela denticulata and Pilumnus hirtellus. Species density rankings are the same at both localities, but the less exposed shore presents higher diversity. While most species are mainly confined to specific microhabitats in the lower level, P. marmoratus and E. verrucosa can exploit the whole intertidal range. Regardless of shore and season, E. verrucosa is more abundant in the lower intertidal levels, while no such zonation patterns were recorded for P. marmoratus. Initial predictions concerning the effect of wave exposure and temperature on the zonation of those species are not validated after analysing the factorial model proposed. Between-shore contrasts were found instead, with higher densities recorded in the more exposed locality for both species. Possible causes of the observed patterns are discussed.

AB The environment of the habitat is important in the organization of the intertidal community. In a boulder shore habitat, accumulation of boulder layers increases shade and the number of interstices. This study examined whether experimental shade increased the density of mobile animals and modified the community structure at 2 intertidal zones on a moderately sheltered boulder shore in Amakusa, Japan. Artificial shade reduced Light intensity and surface temperature of boulders, and subsequently increased microalgal abundance. Mobile animals were sampled quanitatively at 2 zones (high and mid) for 4 treatments: single layer boulders without a roof as a control, double layer boulders without a roof, single layer boulders shaded by a roof for 6 wk and for 2 wk. Statistical analyses (MANOVA and ANOVA) showed strong effects of treatments on community diversity and the density of 15 abundant species in both tidal zones. Generally, the diversity was lower in the single layer boulders than the double layer boulders and increased with the experimental shade. Two carnivorous species (Hemigrapsus sanguineus and Japeuthria cingulata) and some herbivorous species (e.g. Nerita japonica and Nipponacmea nigrans) increased in density with the shade, while other herbivores (e.g. Monodonta labio and Littorina brevicula) were unaffected. In conclusion, a reduction of environmental stress produced by the shade increased community diversity on the boulder shore, but the responses of mobile animals were species specific. As these responses to a change in the environment occurred within a very short period (<2 wk), migration may play an important role in the short-term variation of community structure on boulder shores.

TI Failure of brown oak (Quercus semecarpifolia) to regenerate in central
   Himalaya: A case of environmental semisurprise
SO CURRENT SCIENCE

DT Article
AB The brown oak (Quercus semecarpifolia Sm.), a late successional species is the greatest forest-forming species above 2400 m altitude in the Himalaya. The failure of brown oak to regenerate in central Himalaya is a case of environmental semisurprise. Presence of saplings along roadsides and their absence in shaded habitat of forest interior suggest that this oak requires not only canopy gaps but also exposed soil for regeneration. It seems that in the current chronic form of disturbance, gags formed are too small to enable brown oak to establish seedlings, and in large gaps grazing/browsing does not allow regeneration to progress up to tree size.

AB Studies of predation on propagules of the mangroves Avicennia marina, Bruguiera exaristata, Ceriops tagal and Rhizophora stylosa were made in a forest in northern Australia to test the generality of the dominance-predation model. This model states that an inverse relationship exists between the dominance of a species in the canopy of mangrove forests and the rate of predation on the propagules of that species. Significant differences in predation were found among the four species, and among patches of forest dominated by the different species. Predators attacked more than 50% of the propagules of all species except R. stylosa, so are likely to significantly affect forest structure. The intensity of predation did not, however, vary as the dominance-predation model predicted. Instead, predation on the propagules of a species appeared to depend on the availability of propagules of other, more highly preferred, species.

AB Line intersect sampling (LIS) is commonly used to measure the fraction of forest area under canopy gaps (gap fraction) and the size distribution of gaps. The typical application of this technique makes assumptions about the shape of the gaps. Potential errors associated with these assumptions were quantified. To measure the gap regime in an old-growth, subalpine spruce-fir forest, regression equations were used to describe empirically gap area and perimeter. Most gaps in the spruce-fir forest were shaped like nonconvex polygons. Mapped gap areas were 22% less than estimates based on an elliptical model of gap shape and 22% more than area estimates based on a rhomboidal model of gap shape. An LIS method was developed that works for nonconvex shapes and was used to assess gap fraction in a subalpine, spruce-fir forest. The LIS approach for irregularly shaped gaps provided an estimate of gap fraction that was significantly smaller (35%) than the one based on an elliptical model of gap shape. The modifications in the application of LIS to the study of gap regimes seemed to preserve the efficiency and power of LIS while improving the accuracy of the results.

AB Woody encroachment is occurring in all tropical savannas of the world. However, in the Brazilian savanna (the Cerrado), the extent of this phenomenon is still poorly documented. Here woody encroachment was quantified throughout the Cerrado biome and transitional ecotones using a trend analysis of the annual maximum of enhanced vegetation index obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The associations with potential local drivers, such as fire and land use regime, were assessed using satellite data of land cover and fire regime. We found that 19% of the remaining native vegetation showed significant evidence of woody encroachment in the last 15 years and 7% exhibited degradation processes. The local factors that favored woody expansion in 19% of the biome were a decrease of fire (34%) and land use abandonment (26%). Our study highlights that local human-associated drivers are playing a major role in woody encroachment and savanna degradation.

AB The nitrogen (N) cycle in terrestrial ecosystems is strongly influenced by resorption before litter fall and by mineralization after litter fall. Although both resorption and mineralization make N available to plants and are influenced by climate, their linkage in a changing environment remains largely unknown. Here, our synthesis study shows that, at the global scale, increasing N-resorption efficiency negatively affects the N-mineralization rate. As temperature and precipitation increase, the increasing rates of N cycling closely correspond to a shift from the more conservative resorption pathway to the mineralization pathway. Furthermore, ecosystems with faster N-cycle rates support plant species that have higher foliar N:P ratios and microbial communities with lower fungi:bacteria ratios. Our study shows an ecosystem scale trade-off in N-acquisition pathways. We propose that incorporating the dynamic interaction between N resorption and N mineralization into Earth system models will improve the simulation of nutrient constraints on ecosystem productivity.

AB Plant functional traits offer insights into the plant-environment relationship and may help to understand how plants influence ecosystem functions. Applying trait-based models on climate and land-use change to forests is often hindered by poor data quality, as many data are estimates and traits are often parameterized for juvenile and not adult trees. For advancing theory building and improving the quality of trait data with relevance for adult trees, we compiled a unique trait database for the complete tree flora of Central Europe (42 species from 11 families), covering 38 morphological and physiological traits mostly parameterized with sun and shade crown and root data from adult trees. Despite only small variation in climate, several traits vary largely in this tree species sample, likely reflecting regional edaphic variation, while the influence of phylogenetic diversity is low and restricted to the angiosperm-gymnosperm divergence. The well-established shade tolerance-drought tolerance and wood density-drought sensitivity trade-offs are not supported by our data set, possibly due to the explicit consideration of adult trees and the absence of extended climatic gradients. For the 11 major tree species with high information density, a principal components analysis (PCA) identified three key functional traits, (i) minimum light demand of the adult trees' shade leaves, (ii) stand leaf area index (LAI), and (iii) maximum tree height, which allows distinguishing five tree functional groups, among them a mid-successional tree group. Only a small minority of traits changes significantly along the early-to-late successional axis, contradicting a main paradigm in forest succession research. The functional contrast between early-and late-successional trees is smaller in the sun canopy of adults than in seedlings or saplings, suggesting that trait data from juveniles cannot simply be extrapolated to adults. Focusing on adult trees and on traits with a more direct link to the underlying processes may significantly improve tree functional classification and trait-based models in forest ecology and biogeochemistry.

AB Collective payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs make payments to groups, conditional on specified aggregate land-management outcomes. Such collective contracting may be well suited to settings with communal land tenure or decision-making. Given that collective contracting does not require costly individual-level information on outcomes, it may also facilitate conditioning on additionality (i.e., conditioning payments upon clearly improved outcomes relative to baseline). Yet collective contracting often suffers from free riding, which undermines group outcomes and may be exacerbated or ameliorated by PES designs. We study impacts of conditioning on additionality within a number of collective PES designs. We use a framed field-laboratory experiment with participants from a new PES program in Mexico. Because social interactions are critical within collective processes, we assess the impacts from conditioning on additionality given: (1) group participation in contract design, and (2) a group coordination mechanism. Conditioning on above-baseline outcomes raised contributions, particularly among initially lower contributors. Group participation in contract design increased impact, as did the coordination mechanism. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Extreme climatic events affecting the Amazon region are expected to become more frequent under ongoing climate change. In this study, we assessed the responses to the 2010 drought of over 14,000 trees >= 10 cm dbh in a 25 ha lowland forest plot in the Colombian Amazon and how these responses varied among topographically defined habitats, with tree size, and with species wood density. Tree mortality was significantly higher during the 2010-2013 period immediately after the drought than in 2007-2010. The post-drought increase in mortality was stronger for trees located in valleys (+243%) than for those located on slopes (+67%) and ridges (+57%). Tree-based generalized linear mixed models showed a significant negative effect of species wood density on mortality and no effect of tree size. Despite the elevated post-drought mortality, aboveground biomass increased from 2007 to 2013 by 1.62 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (95% CI 0.80-2.43 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Biomass change varied among habitats, with no significant increase on the slopes (1.05, 95% CI -0.76 to 2.85 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)), a significant increase in the valleys (1.33, 95% CI 0.37-2.34 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)), and a strong increase on the ridges (2.79, 95% CI 1.20-4.21 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). These results indicate a high carbon resilience of this forest to the 2010 drought due to habitat-associated and interspecific heterogeneity in responses including directional changes in functional composition driven by enhanced performance of drought-tolerant species that inhabit the drier ridges.

TI Phosphorus resource partitioning shapes phosphorus acquisition and plant

AB Species diversity is commonly hypothesized to result from trade-offs for different limiting resources, providing separate niches for coexisting species(1-4). As soil nutrients occur in multiple chemical forms, plant differences in acquisition of the same element derived from different compounds may represent unique niche dimensions(5,6). Because plant productivity of ecosystems is often limited by phosphorus(7), and because plants have evolved diverse adaptations to acquire soil phosphorus(6,8), a promising yet untested hypothesis is phosphorus resource partitioning(6,9,10). Here, we provided two different chemical forms of phosphorus to sown grassland mesocosms to investigate phosphorus acquisition of eight plant species that are common in European grasslands, and to identify subsequent patterns of plant abundance. For the first time, we show that the relative abundance of grassland plant species can be influenced by soil phosphorus forms, as higher abundance was linked to higher acquisition of a specific form of phosphorus. These results were supported by a subsequent isotope dilution experiment using intact grassland sods that were treated with different inorganic or organic phosphorus forms. Here, 5 out of 14 species showed greater phosphorus acquisition in the inorganic phosphorus treatment, and 4 in the organic phosphorus treatments. Furthermore, for the species used in both experiments we found similar acquisition patterns. Our results support the hypothesis of phosphorus resource partitioning and may provide a new mechanistic framework to explain high plant diversity in phosphorus-poor ecosystems(6,11-13). As world biodiversity hotspots are almost invariably related to phosphorus limitation(8,11,12), our results may thus also be key to understanding biodiversity loss in an era of ever-increasing nutrient enrichment(14).

AB This paper aims to advance our understanding of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) as 'political projects' by offering an analytical tool for investigating power relations, political decisions, place specific ideas and social norms in the construction and operation of PES schemes. This proposed analytic tool is based on a revised version of the 'ecosystem service cascade', which we propose to transform into an ecosystem service stairway model as a device to analyse political processes in ecosystem service construction and provision. We show that the key to understanding the politics of PES lies in the antagonistic processes between the different steps of the stairway. In particular, we show that the definition and mobilisation of the ecosystem service potential (ESP) is the stage where the most fundamental political decisions are made. Here, the role of intermediaries is particularly significant as they introduce their own conceptions of society-nature relations, which function as 'epistemic selectivities' in further defining and mobilising the ESP and in generating the resulting Ecosystem Services (ESS). We illustrate our main conceptual insights and evaluate the usefulness of our political ecosystem stairway model by applying it to two Latin American cases, one in Brazil and the other in Bolivia.

AB Community ecologists have strived to find mechanisms that mediate the assembly of natural communities. Recent evidence suggests that natural enemies could play an important role in the assembly of hyper-diverse tropical plant systems. Classic ecological theory predicts that in order for coexistence to occur, species differences must be maximized across biologically important niche dimensions. For plant-herbivore interactions, it has been recently suggested that, within a particular community, plant species that maximize the difference in chemical defense profiles compared to neighboring taxa will have a relative competitive advantage. Here we tested the hypothesis that plant chemical diversity can affect local community composition in the hyper-diverse genus Piper at a lowland wet forest location in Costa Rica. We first characterized the chemical composition of 27 of the most locally abundant species of Piper. We then tested whether species with different chemical compositions were more likely to coexist. Finally, we assessed the degree to which Piper phylogenetic relationships are related to differences in secondary chemical composition and community assembly. We found that, on average, co-occurring species were more likely to differ in chemical composition than expected by chance. Contrary to expectations, there was no phylogenetic signal for overall secondary chemical composition. In addition we found that species in local communities were, on average, more phylogenetically closely related than expected by chance, suggesting that functional traits other than those measured here also influence local assembly. We propose that selection by herbivores for divergent chemistries between closely related species facilitates the coexistence of a high diversity of congeneric taxa via apparent competition.

AB Throughout the Amazon region, the age of forests regenerating on previously deforested land is determined, in part, by the periods of active land use prior to abandonment and the frequency of reclearance of regrowth, both of which can be quantified by comparing time-series of Landsat sensor data. Using these time-series of near annual data from 1973-2011 for an area north of Manaus (in Amazonas state), from 1984-2010 for south of Santarem (Parastate) and 1984-2011 near Machadinho d'Oeste (Rondonia state), the changes in the area of primary forest, non-forest and secondary forest were documented from which the age of regenerating forests, periods of active land use and the frequency of forest reclearance were derived. At Manaus, and at the end of the time-series, over 50% of regenerating forests were older than 16 years, whilst at Santarem and Machadinho d'Oeste, 57% and 41% of forests respectively were aged 6-15 years, with the remainder being mostly younger forests. These differences were attributed to the time since deforestation commenced but also the greater frequencies of reclearance of forests at the latter two sites with short periods of use in the intervening periods. The majority of clearance for agriculture was also found outside of protected areas. The study suggested that a) the history of clearance and land use should be taken into account when protecting deforested land for the purpose of restoring both tree species diversity and biomass through natural regeneration and b) a greater proportion of the forested landscape should be placed under protection, including areas of regrowth.

AB Ecosystem science increasingly relies on highly derived metrics to synthesize across large datasets. However, full uncertainty associated with these metrics is seldom quantified. Our objective was to evaluate measurement error and model uncertainty in plot-based estimates of carbon stock and carbon change. We quantified the measurement error associated with live stems, deadwood and plot-level variables in temperate rainforest in New Zealand. We also quantified model uncertainty for height-diameter allometry, stem volume equations and wood-density estimates. We used Monte Carlo simulation to assess the net effects on carbon stock and carbon change estimated using data from 227 plots from throughout New Zealand. Plot-to-plot variation was the greatest source of uncertainty, amounting to 9.1% of mean aboveground carbon stock estimates (201.11 MgC ha(-1)). Propagation of the measurement error and model uncertainty resulted in a 1% increase in uncertainty (0.1% of mean stock estimate). Carbon change estimates (mean -0.86 MgC ha(-1) y(-1)) were more uncertain, with sampling error equating to 56% of the mean, and when measurement error and model uncertainty were included this uncertainty increased by 35% (22.1% of the mean change estimate). For carbon change, the largest sources of measurement error were missed/double counted stems and fallen coarse woody debris. Overall, our findings show that national-scale plot-based estimates of carbon stock and carbon change in New Zealand are robust to measurement error and model uncertainty. We recommend that calculations of carbon stock and carbon change incorporate both these sources of uncertainty so that management implications and policy decisions can be assessed with the appropriate level of confidence.

AB For tropical lowland rain forests, Denslow (1987) hypothesized that in areas with large-scale disturbances tree species with a high demand for light make up a larger proportion of the flora; results of tests have been inconsistent. There has been no test for warm temperate rain forests (WTRFs), but they offer a promising testing ground because they differ widely in the extent of disturbance. WTRF is dominated by microphylls sensu Raunkiaer and has a simpler structure and range of physiognomy than tropical or subtropical rain forests. It occurs in six parts of the world: eastern Asia, New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, SE Australia and the Azores. On the Azores it has been mostly destroyed, so we studied instead the subtropical montane rain forest (STMRF) on the Canary Islands which also represents a relict of the kind of WTRF that once stretched across southern Eurasia. We sought to find whether in these six regions the proportion of tree species needing canopy gaps for establishment reflects the frequency and/or extent of canopy disturbance by wind, landslide, volcanic eruptions (lava flow and ash fall), flood or fire. We used standard floras and ecological accounts to draw up lists of core tree species commonly reaching 5m height. We excluded species which are very rare, very localized in distribution, or confined to special habitats, e.g. coastal forests or rocky sites. We used published accounts and our own experience to classify species into three groups: (1) needing canopy gaps for establishment; (2) needing either light shade throughout or a canopy gap relatively soon (a few months or years) after establishment; and (3) variously more shade-tolerant. Group 1 species were divided according the kind of canopy opening needed: tree-fall gap, landslide, lava flow, flood or fire. Only some of the significant differences in proportion of Group 1 species were consistent with differences in the extent of disturbance; even in some of those cases other factors seem likely to have had a major determining influence during evolution. We also sought to determine whether the species that are at least short-term persistent' in the soil seed bank (lasting 2-4years) are all species needing canopy gaps for establishment. The answer was negative; large numbers of seeds of some shade-tolerants accumulate in the soil, and these species are able to benefit from soil disturbance in deep shade. We found a significant and strong positive relationship in Japan between mean seed mass and mature tree height, a weak positive relationship in New Zealand and no relationship in any of the other four regions. When comparing the seed mass values of Group 1 and Group 3 species we obtained different answers depending on whether or not we confined ourselves to taxonomically controlled contrasts. In only two of the four regions with an appreciable number of species in Group 1 is the mean seed mass of such species significantly lower than that of Group 3 species when taxonomic relatedness is ignored.

AB This paper reviews histological studies of cambium activity in South American woody species and provides future research prospects. The majority of the studies almost exclusively describe radial increment and/or its periodicity. There are 15 papers concerning the cambial activity of 17 woody species from the South American flora and 3 exotic species in 4 countries that were published to date. Despite endogenous factors affecting the radial meristem, the seasonality of rains has been identified as the main factor influencing cambial activity in the tropics and subtropics. There is a lack of standardization and a need for improvement and discussion concerning the methods used. Moreover, radial growth studies conducted by monitoring cambium cell production are still scarce in South America, especially when considering the high diversity of the continent's flora and ecosystems.

AB 1. A small number of species-rich plant genera make a substantial contribution to the a diversity of tropical forests. These species swarms (Gentry 1982) challenge a view of community assembly that maintains that niche overlap, and hence, the likelihood of competitive exclusion should increase with phylogenetic affinity. Related species may, however, occupy different microhabitats within a forest stand or, alternatively, differ ecologically in ways that allow them to coexist syntopically. 2. To explore the relationship between phylogenetic history and niche differentiation among sympatric, congeneric species, we performed phylogenetic analyses of microhabitat preferences, photosynthetic and hydraulic traits, and experimental responses to light and water availability for 20 species of Psychotria (Rubiaceae) from Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. 3. The Psychotria present in small (3-m radius), circular plots were more closely related than expected by chance. Photosynthetic and hydraulic traits were both associated with species habitat distributions, but only hydraulic traits were conserved phylogenetically. Experimental responses to water availability were also conserved phylogenetically. Functional trait analyses revealed little or no evidence of niche partitioning within sites. 4. We conclude that Psychotria species responses to both light and moisture availability determine their microhabitat distributions on BCI and that evolutionarily conserved hydraulic traits lead to phylogenetic clustering of co-occurring species. 5. Synthesis. The evolutionary conservation of hydraulic traits related to soil moisture tolerance largely explains phylogenetic clustering in the local assembly of the hyperdiverse genus Psychotria. We suggest that close relatives are unlikely to exclude one another from shared habitats because resource availability is determined largely by asymmetric competition with the overstorey, rather than by competition with neighbouring understorey plants. In light of the recent biogeographic admixture in central Panama, the phylogenetic niche conservatism exhibited by Psychotria on BCI raises the possibility of an association between local microhabitats and the ancestral climatic regimes under which major Psychotria lineages evolved before arriving in sympatry.

AB Case studies of land use change have suggested that deforestation across Southern Mexico is accelerating. However, forest transition theory predicts that trajectories of change can be modified by economic factors, leading to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in rates of change that may take the form of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). This study aimed to assess the evidence regarding potential forest transition in Southern Mexico by classifying regional forest cover change using Landsat imagery from 1990 through to 2006. Patterns of forest cover change were found to be complex and nonlinear. When rates of forest loss were averaged over 342 municipalities using mixed-effects modelling the results showed a significant (p< 0.001) overall reduction of the mean rate of forest loss from 0.85% per year in the 1990-2000 period to 0.67% in the 2000-2006 period. The overall regional annual rate of deforestation has fallen from 0.33% to 0.28% from the 1990s to 2000s. A high proportion of the spatial variability in forest cover change cannot be explained statistically. However analysis using spline based general additive models detected underlying relationships between forest cover and income or population density of a form consistent with the EKC. The incipient forest transition has not, as yet, resulted in widespread reforestation. Forest recovery remains below 0.20% per year. Reforestation is mostly the result of passive processes associated with reductions in the intensity of land use. Deforestation continues to occur at high rates in some focal areas. A transition could be accelerated if there were a broader recognition among policy makers that the regional rate of forest loss has now begun to fall. The changing trajectory provides an opportunity to actively restore forest cover through stimulating afforestation and stimulating more sustainable land use practices. The results have clear implications for policy aimed at carbon sequestration through reducing deforestation and enhancing forest growth.

AB Questions: What are the main short- term changes in vegetation structure after fire and mowing in Campos grasslands? Are there differences in functional vegetation group responses between sites with diverse fire histories and different treatments (fire andmowing)? Location: Subtropical grasslands in Porto Alegre, Brazil, 30 03' S, 51 07' W. Methods: In two sites with different fire histories: FB - frequently burned grasslands and E - exclusion of fire for 6 yr, seven pairs of plots were examined. In each pair, fire and mowing treatments were established. Bare soil and litter cover were estimated. Vegetation releve ' s were conducted, plants identified, their cover estimated and stems counted (except for graminoids). Later, plants were grouped according to their functional group (graminoids, forbs and shrubs) for statistical analyses. Observations were conducted 30, 90 and 360 d after treatments. Results: Burned plots always showed a higher percentage of bare soil, whilst mowed plots had higher litter cover. Fire enhanced graminoid and forb cover, but did not affect shrubs. Species turnover was very high, mainly in burned plots in site FB and in mowed plots in site E. Species diversity in burned plots was the same in sites FB and E 1 yr after treatments, contrary to our hypothesis. However, in mowed plots, the number of species tended to decrease 1 yr after treatments for both sites FB and E. Conclusions: The most important short- term effect was the removal of litter and consequent opening of gaps, mostly by fire. This stimulated vegetation regeneration and provided microsites for the establishment of new species. However, fire did not enhance plant diversity, as we had hypothesized. Moreover, the disturbance history of sites should be considered, since vegetation in these sites responded differently to fire andmowing.

AB We measured the growth responses of individual shoots and branches of Betula pendula when growing next to trees of the same species or Pinus sylvestris, Larix sibirica or Alnus glutinosa. We used the three-dimensionally digitized response variables and the size and distance of trees growing within a 5-m radius of the study trees to establish a relationship between tree performance and the effect of competing neighbouring tree species on crown architecture. B. pendula was able to modify its crown architecture and thus alter its strategy to compete with different neighbours. Trees of B. pendula growing beside species counterparts had the highest growth of new long shoots in relation to the already existing branch length [growth vigour (GV)], while GV was the lowest next to L. sibirica. With B. pendula or P. sylvestris as its main neighbour, B. pendula invested in short shoots by growing them rather densely in short branches with limited numbers, whereas with L. sibirica the number, length and angle of the branches were high. The competitive response was also strongly dependent on tree ontogeny and the shoot and branch characteristics were significantly affected by their location inside the crown. B. pendula was able to respond to the challenges posed by its neighbours, which was also reflected in the GV. The ability to maintain steady growth with alternative crown designs in different neighbourhoods reflects plasticity in the crown responses.

AB Marine coastal habitats are being increasingly impacted by human activities. In addition, there are dramatic climatic disruptions that could generate important and irreversible shifts in coastal ecosystems. Long-term monitoring plays a fundamental and irreplaceable role to establish general baselines from which we can better address current and future impacts and distinguish between natural and anthropogenic changes and fluctuations. Here we highlight how over 25 years of monitoring the coastal marine ecosystem within the no-take marine protected area of Las Cruces has provided critical information to understand ecological baselines and build the necessary ecological literacy for marine management and conservation. We argue that this understanding can only be gained with simultaneous monitoring of reserves and human-impacted areas, and the development of complementary experimental studies that test alternative hypothesis about driving processes and mechanisms. In this contribution we selected four examples to illustrate long-term temporal fluctuations at all trophic levels including taxa from algae to sea birds. From these examples we draw a few general lessons: a) there is co-occurrence of rapid- and slowly- unfolding ecological responses to the exclusion of humans within the same rocky shore community. The sharp differences in the pace at which depleted populations recover is at least partly related to differences in life history (dispersal capabilities) of the targeted species. b) Long-term monitoring of the supply-side of marine communities is critical to evaluate the potential feedback effects of local changes in abundance into the arrival of new individuals and to correctly evaluate environmental and human-induced perturbations. c) Unexpected changes in local population dynamics can occur in "independent" and apparently non-interactive modules of the marine ecosystem, such as roosting sea birds inside the reserve. In addition we discuss the way in which ecological data generated from long-term monitoring at marine reserves was institutionalized in a national marine management policy. At the same time, we highlight the mismatch between the gained scientific information and principles from these studies and the current concept of marine protected areas that is being implemented by some government agencies in Chile. Information from long term monitoring programs has proved essential to understand how marine environments respond to anthropogenic and/or natural disturbances, however funding these schemes, which generally have no short term gains for funding agencies in both developing and developed countries, still remain a major challenge.

AB We censused butterflies flying across the Panama Canal at Barro Colorado Island (BCI) for 16 years and butterfly hostplants for 8 years to address the question: What environmental factors influence the timing and magnitude of migrating Aphrissa statira butterflies? The peak migration date was earlier when the wet season began earlier and when soil moisture content in the dry season preceding the migration was higher. The peak migration date was also positively associated with peak leaf flushing of one hostplant (Callichlamys latifolia) but not another (Xylophragma seemannianum). The quantity of migrants was correlated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation, which influenced April soil moisture on BCI and total rainfall in the dry season. Both hostplant species responded to El Nino with greater leaf flushing, and the number of adults deriving from or laying eggs on those new leaves was greatest during El Nino years. The year 1993 was exceptional in that the number of butterflies migrating was lower than predicted by the El Nino event, yet the dry season was unusually wet for an El Nino year as well. Thus, dry season rainfall appears to be a primary driver of larval food production and population outbreaks for A. statira. Understanding how global climate cycles and local weather influence tropical insect migrations improves the predictability of ecological effects of climate change.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation can have severe negative and irreversible effects on biodiversity. We investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on frog diversity in Singapore because of its high rates of deforestation and the demonstration that frogs are some of the most sensitive species to habitat degradation. We surveyed frog species in 12 forest fragments varying from 11 to 935 ha. We compared differences in species richness, abundance, and Shannon's index in relation to forest fragment size, connectivity (distance between fragments), and breeding habitat heterogeneity. A total of 20 species from 12 genera and five families were encountered in 12 fragments. Larger fragments and those closer to larger fragments had higher species richness. Abundance, however, was not correlated with forest area or connectivity, but we found fewer individual frogs in the larger fragments. We also found that breeding habitat heterogeneity best explained frog species diversity and abundance in forest fragments. Fragments with a high diversity of breeding habitats had more species. We found no evidence to suggest that abundance and diversity are strongly correlated, particularly in disturbed areas, but that breeding habitat heterogeneity is an under-appreciated factor that should be considered when prioritizing areas for anuran conservation. Enriching breeding habitat heterogeneity, creating corridors between fragments, and reforesting degraded areas are some of the most beneficial strategies for preserving urban frog biodiversity.

AB Habitat loss is one of the most important causes of biodiversity loss in South American temperate rainforests, where many endemic species exist. Among these is the monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides), an arboreal marsupial with restricted distribution, and the only extant species of the order Microbiotheria. Current knowledge about monito del monte habitat use and its responses to human disturbances is scarce. To help fill this gap we investigated its habitat use and selection patterns in a fragmented landscape in southern Chile. Monito del monte Individuals were abundant in a large and a small fragment, but rare or undetected in forest strips. Using telemetry data from 12 neighboring individuals in a large fragment and 2 individuals in a small fragment, we estimated their mean home range size of 1.6 ha+/-0.6 (ISD). Monitos del monte had a spatial overlap among Individuals of 50+4%. Tracked Individuals used old- and second-growth habitats as available, did not use the prairie habitats, and strongly avoided the scrublands. In the large fragment we estimated a relative population density of 21 +/- 5 individuals/ha (mean +/- 1 SD) whereas in the small fragment it was of 19+/-6 individuals/ha. This is, to our knowledge, the first Study of the spatial ecology of the monito del monte based on telemetry data, and evidence presented here could have conservation and planning implications, not only for the target species but also its habitat.

AB Old-growth forests are ecologically relevant reservoirs of biodiversity and provide valuable and unique ecosystem functions in the landscape. However, what constitutes an old-growth stand is confusing because the definition depends largely on the forest type under study. Despite the ecological importance of old-growth temperate rainforests in southern Chile in comparison to other global forests, no attempts have been made to characterize them as a way to assess their structural variability. Here, we characterized old-growth stands of Valdivian and North Patagonian rain forest types located in Chiloe Island (Chile, 42 degrees 30'S) using inventory data from 23 permanent plots (0.1 ha each) located in rural landscapes and protected areas of northern Chiloe Island. For each stand, its age (average age of the oldest trees present in each stand) and disturbance regimes (evidence of recent human impact, e.g. cuttings or fires, and tree growth rates) were used as defining old-growth criteria. We characterized the structure (tree species richness, size-density distributions, vertical stratification and presence of snags) and floristic composition of each stand. Environmental variables (i.e. temperature, distance to coastline and elevation) were related to stand structure using multivariate constrained correspondence analysis. Old-growth forests were commonly characterized by (a) tree basal areas >80 m(2)/ha; (b) density of shade-tolerant tree species in the emergent and dominant canopy layer >36%; (c) higher tree species richness (>7 tree species) than successional stands; (d) presence of large canopy emergents (>80 cm dbh, >25 m tall); (e) high vertical heterogeneity: and (f) minimum stand ages older than 200 years. Old-growth forests showed a distinctive structural variability and floristic diversity influenced both by stand age and disturbance history of the stands. Structural variability was also related to environmental differences among sites (e.g. air temperature, distance to coastline, soil types). Old-growth forest features described here can offer a baseline for managers interested in maintaining and restoring old-growth forest structure in southern temperate rain forests.

AB 1. Rank reversals in species performance are theoretically important for structuring communities, maintaining diversity and determining the course of forest succession. Species growth ranks can change with ontogeny or in different microenvironments, but interactions between ontogeny and the environment are not well-understood because of the lack of long-term forest competition studies. While early differences in growth among species may reflect intrinsic differences in shade-tolerance and physiology, ontogenetic trends in growth and variation in neighbourhood density and composition may change or even reverse early patterns of growth rankings.
   2. We experimentally studied spatial and temporal patterns of species interactions and growth for three northern tree species: Larix laricina, Picea mariana and Pinus strobus. We compared species size and growth rankings over an 11-year period, for different species mixtures planted at four density levels in north-eastern Minnesota, USA.
   3. The benefits of different growth strategies changed with ontogeny and density leading to reversals in the size rank of competing species over time and space. High-density stands promoted dominance and resource pre-emption by L. laricina, whereas lower-density stands favoured gradual accumulation of biomass and eventual dominance by P. strobus. In the absence of strong neighbour competition, ontogenetic trends in growth had greater influence on growth patterns.
   4. Species interactions affected the productivity of mixed stands vs. monocultures. Species generally grew more in monoculture than when planted with P. strobus at low density, or with L. laricina at high density. Only L. laricina and P. mariana showed potential for greater overall productivity, or over-yielding, when planted together than alone, probably because of improved resource uptake by the highly stratified canopy.
   5. Synthesis. Density predictably determined whether size-asymmetric growth or ontogenetic growth trends would drive early establishment and growth patterns. Variation in vertical and horizontal structure that results from early competitive dynamics can influence the successional trajectory or character of the mature forest. This study extends previous efforts to identify the causes of rank reversals in communities and understand the importance of temporal changes beyond the early years of seedling establishment.

AB Studies of tropical secondary forest succession face strong limitations due to the slow pace of succession and the time-consuming task of monitoring processes. The occurrence of tree rings in secondary forest trees may help expand our knowledge on succession in these systems and may be useful for fallow dating in chronosequence studies. We examine here the potential of tree rings to study forest succession by sampling 70 species along chronosequences of dry and wet forests in southern Mexico. Based on wood anatomical features, we estimated that about 37 percent of the species presented distinct growth rings useful for ring studies. Overall, maximum number of rings matched well the interview-based fallow ages but, at some sites, trees had consistently higher numbers of rings, probably due to errors in fallow ages derived from interviews. Best fallow age estimations were obtained by examining rings in both pioneer and nonpioneer species. Reconstruction of species' establishment dates revealed that pioneer and nonpioneer species establish early during succession, and that species of both groups continue to recruit after many years. Our study clearly shows that tree ring analysis is a promising tool for studies on secondary forest succession in the tropics.

AB 1. The Enemy Release Hypothesis proposes that exotic species gain an advantage in new regions because their natural enemies are lost during invasion; however, enemy release could also occur as a result of much smaller scale movements within an invasive plant's native range, i.e. if it escapes enemies while colonizing new sites. Few studies have considered this possibility, and none has compared escape from multiple guilds of enemies.
   2. We studied an invasive North American weed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed), to determine whether it escapes above-ground or below-ground enemies at a local scale in its native range. Exotic populations of this plant are known to have escaped above-ground enemies in Europe.
   3. Experimental populations of ragweed isolated from existing populations by just 100 m experienced reduced levels of damage by invertebrate folivores and seed predators; however, there was no clear evidence that this escape led to improved performance.
   4. Plants inoculated with unsterilized soil grew better than plants in sterile soil, likely reflecting a need for mycorrhizal colonization. Inoculum from ragweed populations was as beneficial as inoculum from nearby ragweed-free sites, suggesting only a small initial role for site-specific pathogens.
   5. Performance declined over time when plants were serially inoculated with non-sterile soil, indicating negative feedback with the soil biota. This feedback was stronger for inocula derived from ragweed populations vs. those from nearby ragweed-free sites.
   6. Seeds buried in ragweed populations were less likely to germinate subsequently than seeds buried in nearby ragweed-free sites. This difference was not reduced by treatment with fungicide; consequently, the mechanism is unclear.
   7. Synthesis. These results indicate that ragweed can escape both above-ground and below-ground enemies by dispersing to new sites, resulting in reduced levels of folivory, seed predation, soil feedback and perhaps losses to seed pathogens. Although consequences often may be small, this demonstrates that enemy release can occur for native as well as exotic populations of this species, linking possible mechanisms of local spread with long-distance invasion.

AB We explored different treatments to enhance the probability of sowed seeds of two early successional (ES, Cecropia obtusifolia and Ochroma pyramidale) and two late successional (LS, Brosimum costaricanum and Dialium guianense) species to escape predation and germinate in abandoned cattle-raising pasture fields in Southeastern Mexico. ES species were sown in groups of 50 seeds under three treatments: invertebrate exclusion, burial, and exposition to seedeaters. LS species were sown in groups of 10 seeds under three treatments: vertebrate exclusion, burial, and exposition to seedeaters. We registered seed predation and germination 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 days after the initial sowing. Overall, ES showed higher predation rates (mean +/- SE = 0.45 +/- 0.07 seed seed(-1) day(-1); n = 3) than LS species (0.09 +/- 0.02 seed seed(-1) day(-1)). Cecropia obtusifolia was completely predated in all treatments after 8 days. Burial and exclusion treatments reduced final predation in circa 6% for O. pyramidale, relative to that of exposed seeds (85% after 8 days); most germination occurred in buried seeds (3.7%). In B. costaricanum, burial enabled germination by 10%; exposed and excluded seeds were removed 100%. Dialium guianense showed 12% germination in buried seeds and circa 20% of the seeds were not removed after 64 days. Direct sowing would be a recommended rainforest restoration practice for species with relatively large seeds if deposited in groups and buried. Studies which address variation across numerous sites are necessary in order to generate more consistent seed predation patterns and rainforest restoration principles in tropical pastures.

AB Tropical rain forests are rapidly cleared, fragmented, and degraded in sub-Saharan Africa; however, little is known about the response of species and even of key ecological groups to these processes. One of the most intriguing (but often neglected) ecological phenomena in African rain forests is the interaction between swarm-raiding army ants and ant-following birds. Similar to their well-known Neotropical representatives, ant-following birds in Africa track the massive swarm raids of army ants and feed on arthropods flushed by the ants. In this study we analyzed the effect of habitat fragmentation and degradation of a mid-altitude Congo-Guinean rain forest in western Kenya on the structure of ant-following bird flocks. Significant numbers of swarm raids were located in all forest fragments and in both undegraded and degraded forest. Fifty-six different species of birds followed army ant raids, forming bird flocks of one to 15 species. We quantitatively differentiated the bird community into five species of specialized ant-followers and 51 species of opportunistic ant-followers. Species richness and size of bird blocks decreased with decreasing size of forest fragments and was higher in undegraded than in degraded habitat. This was caused by the decrease of the species richness and number of specialized ant-followers at swarms, while the group of opportunistic ant-followers was affected little by habitat fragmentation and degradation. The composition of bird flocks was more variable in small fragments and degraded forest, compared to undegraded habitat in large fragments. The effect of habitat fragmentation on flock structure was best explained by the strong decline of the abundance of specialized ant-followers in small forest fragments. To conserve the association of army ants and ant-following birds in its natural state, vast areas of unfragmented and undegraded tropical rain forest are necessary.

AB Large-scale inventories of forest biomass and structure are necessary for both understanding carbon dynamics and conserving biodiversity. High-resolution satellite imagery is starting to enable structural analysis of tropical forests over large areas, but we lack an understanding of how tropical forest biomass links to remote sensing. We quantified the spatial distribution of biomass and tree species diversity over 4 ha in a Bolivian lowland moist tropical forest, and then linked our field measurements to high-resolution Quickbird satellite imagery. Our field measurements showed that emergent and canopy dominant trees, being those directly visible from nadir remote sensors, comprised the highest diversity of tree species, represented 86% of all tree species found in our study plots, and contained the majority of forest biomass. Emergent trees obscured 1-15 trees with trunk diameters (at 1.3 m, diameter at breast height (DBH)) >= 20 cm, thus hiding 30-50% of forest biomass from nadir viewing. Allometric equations were developed to link remotely visible crown features to stand parameters, showing that the maximum tree crown length explains 50-70% of the individual tree biomass. We then developed correction equations to derive aboveground forest biomass, basal area, and tree density from tree crowns visible to nadir satellites. We applied an automated tree crown delineation procedure to a high-resolution panchromatic Quickbird image of our study area, which showed promise for identification of forest biomass at community scales, but which also highlighted the difficulties of remotely sensing forest structure at the individual tree level.

AB Big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King, Meliaceae) is the most valuable widely traded timber species from the Neotropics. Mahogany has been severely overexploited throughout its natural range, which stretches from southern Mexico through Central and South America as far south as the Bolivian Amazon. We investigated effects of selective logging on the genetic diversity of a mahogany population in eastern Amazonia. Using eight hypervariable microsatellite loci, we estimated the number of alleles per locus (A), mean expected and observed heterozygosity (H-e, H-o), the number of distinct multilocus genotypes (G(o)), and the inbreeding coefficient (f) for pre- and post-logging cohorts (adults and seedlings) collected over identical spatial scales. We found a significant reduction in the number of alleles, observed heterozygosity, and distinct multilocus genotype number in the post- compared to the pre-logging cohort. The loss of genetic diversity is likely to have occurred due to a reduction in the effective population size as a consequence of logging, which leads to the loss of alleles and limits mating possibilities. The results raise concerns about the conservation genetics of logged mahogany populations where a high proportion of adults are removed from the system. We suggest initiatives to promote the maintenance of genetic diversity as an integral part of the production system, allowing genetically sustainable use of this valuable timber resource.

AB Although the potential contribution to tropical tree species coexistence of niche differentiation along light gradients has received much attention, the degree to which species perform differentially along soil resource gradients remains unclear. To examine differential growth response to soil resources, we grew seedlings of nine tropical tree species at 6.0% of full sun for 12 mo in a factorial design of two soil types (clay and white sand), two phosphate fertilization treatments (control and addition of 100 mg P kg(-1)) and two watering treatments (field capacity and water limitation to one-third field capacity). Species differed markedly in biomass growth rate, but this hierarchy was almost completely conserved across all eight treatments. All species grew more slowly in sand than clay soils. and no species grew faster with phosphate additions. Only Eperua grandiflora and E. falcata showed significant growth increases in the absence of water limitation. Faster-growing species were characterized by high specific leaf area, high leaf allocation and high net assimilation rate but not lower root allocation. Slower-growing species exhibited greater plasticity in net assimilation rate. suggesting that tolerance of edaphic stress in these species is related more to stomatal control than to whole-plant carbon allocation. Although relative growth rate for biomass was correlated with both its physiological and morphological components. interspecific differences were best explained by differences in net assimilation rate across six of the eight treatments. A suite of traits including high assimilation and high specific leaf area maintains rapid growth rate of faster-growing species across a wide gradient of soil resources, but the lack of plasticity they exhibit may compromise their survival in the poorest soil environments.

AB The ecology of the fungus-gardening ant Trachymyrmex septentrionalis McCook (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) was investigated in a northern Florida longleaf pine, Pinus palustris Mill., forest. This ant is extremely abundant in pine sandhill in the Apalachicola National Forest, in north Florida; a hectare contains on average > 1,000 nests, 235,000 T septentrionalis workers, and 3.5 kg of fungus garden. When colony size and performance were estimated from excavations and the weight of sand in the tumulus, nests were larger and produced the most offspring in open, treeless habitats, whereas the smallest and least productive nests occurred in wooded areas. Our data suggest that the warm soils of open sites stimulate worker activity and colony growth, and cool soils of shaded, wooded sites depress performance. Moreover soils with extremely warm temperatures may have an inhibitory effect because the ants and fungus are susceptible to desiccation and excessive warmth, respectively. This suggests that T septentrionalis is an indicator ant species of habitat quality in longleaf pine sandhills because its performance seems to be positively related to the natural disturbance regime-frequent fires occurring in the summer. Soil displacement is possibly a major effect that this ant has on the forest ecosystems: colonies may excavate over I metric ton of soil each year in a typical hectare of pine forest. The effect of this soil turnover is probably considerable in these nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Experiments are needed to determine the role of this highly abundant ant in longleaf pine forests.

Five orders numerically dominated the Arthropoda assemblage. These were Coleoptera, Diptera, Psocoptera, Collembola and Hymenoptera. Tenebrionidae, represented by 14 genera, was the most diverse and abundant family of the epigean arthropod-fauna. Gyriosomus Guerin-Meneville, 1834 was the most specious genus ill that family. Some of its species showed a narrow distribution in the study area, and may be indicators of endemisms. The species richness of Tenebrionidae did not follow the latitudinal pluviometric pattern of the transect. Carrizal Bajo, a site with xeric conditions, provided a higher number than expected. in accordance with the pattern shown by the flora, mainly geophytes and hemicryptophytes.

AB We describe Scytalopus stilesi, an overlooked species of tapaculo endemic to Colombia, on the basis of a series of eight specimens taken in 2002 and comparative analyses of its vocalizations, mitochondrial DNA sequences, and distribution. The new species ranges in the northern half of the Cordillera Central of the Colombian Andes in the Departments of Antioquia, Caldas, and Risaralda, in cloud forests between 1,420 and 2,130 m above sea level. The song, calls, and female song of the new species differ distinctly from those of all other known Scytalopus taxa. Phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of the cytochrome-b gene strongly suggest affinities with S. robbinsi of southwestern Ecuador and with two as-yet-undescribed tapaculos from the Colombian Andes. Scytalopus stilesi coexists locally with, though it is ecologically segregated from, S. atratus, S. latrans, and S. spillmanni. The mid-elevation premontane wet forests to which the new species is restricted have been subject to severe deforestation and fragmentation. The species is, however, relatively common in continuous mature-forest remnants, large primary-forest fragments, riparian forests, and tall secondary-forest patches. We employed a geographic information system (GIS) approach to model the potential distribution of the new species and assess its conservation status under the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria. Scytalopus stilesi does not qualify as threatened according to those criteria, but it should be regarded as near threatened. The new species coexists with numerous threatened bird species that are in need of more effective conservation.

AB Aim Madagascar's lowland forests are both rich in endemic taxa and considered to be seriously threatened by deforestation and habitat fragmentation. However, very little is known about how these processes affect biodiversity on the island. Herein, we examine how forest bird communities and functional groups have been affected by fragmentation at both patch and landscape scales, by determining relationships between species richness and individual species abundance and patch and landscape mosaic metrics.
   Location Littoral forest remnants within south-eastern Madagascar.
   Methods We sampled 30 littoral forest remnants in south-eastern Madagascar, within a landscape mosaic dominated by Erica spp. heathland. We quantified bird community composition within remnants of differing size, shape and isolation, by conducting point counts in November-December in 2001 and October-November 2002. Each remnant was characterized by measures of remnant area, remnant shape, isolation, and surrounding landscape complexity. We used step-wise regression to test the relationship between bird species richness and landscape structural elements, after correcting for sampling effort. Relationships between bird species abundances and the landscape variables were investigated with Canonical Correspondence Analysis and binomial logistic regression modelling.
   Results Bird species richness and forest-dependent bird species richness were significantly (P < 0.01) explained by remnant area but not by any measure of isolation or landscape complexity. The majority of forest-dependent species had significant relationships with remnant area. Minimum area requirements for area-sensitive species ranged from 15 to 150 ha, with the majority of species having area requirements > 30 ha. Surprisingly, there was no relationship between bird body size and minimum area requirement. Forest-dependent canopy insectivorous species and large canopy frugivorous species were the most sensitive functional groups, with > 90% species sensitivity within each group. The distribution of four forest-dependent species also appeared to be related to remnant shape where remnant area was < 100 ha.
   Main conclusions The majority of forest-dependent species, including many that are considered widespread and common, were found to have significant relationships with fragment size, indicating that they are sensitive to processes associated with habitat loss and fragmentation. As deforestation and habitat fragmentation remain serious problems on the island, it follows that many forest-dependent bird species will decline in abundance and become locally extinct. At the regional scale, we urge that large (> 200 ha) blocks of littoral forest are awarded protected status to preserve their unique bird community.

AB The floristic composition and structure of vegetation in natural regeneration were studied in a degraded area in Matupa County, Mato Grosso State, Brazil, originally occupied by Tropical Rain Forest. Three plots were used in the shape of a 20 m x 160 m transect, divided into 10 m x 20 m sub-plots, placed parallel to a remnant fragment. Transect 1 was 0-20 m from the fragment; Transect 2, 20-40 m, and Transect 3, 40-60 m from the forest fragment. The total height and diameter at soil height of all the shrubs and tree individuals (height greater than or equal to 0.50 m) were measured to the 5, 13 and 18 months after the area had been systematized and abandoned. Floristic and structural alterations occurred in space and time. The number of individuals, species, families and diversity increased during the time interval studied and decreased with distance from the remnant fragment. These floristic and structural alterations in the community as a whole and in the populations of the most important species, Trema micrantha (L.) Blume and Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke, showed the tendency of a succession model by facilitation, where these pioneers would be improving the ecological conditions and thus easing the regeneration of late species. The conservation of the forest fragment in the surroundings was essential for the natural regeneration process of the forest in the degraded area. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The rate and scale of human-driven changes can exert profound impacts on ecosystems, the species that make them up and the services they provide that sustain humanity. Given the speed at which these changes are occurring, one of society's major challenges is to coexist within ecosystems and to manage ecosystem services in a sustainable way. The effect of possible scenarios of global change on ecosystem services can be explored using ecosystem models. Such models should adequately represent ecosystem processes above and below the soil surface (aboveground and belowground) and the interactions between them. We explore possibilities to include such interactions into ecosystem models at scales that range from global to local. At the regional to global scale we suggest to expand the plant functional type concept (aggregating plants into groups according to their physiological attributes) to include functional types of aboveground-belowground interactions. At the scale of discrete plant communities, process-based and organism-oriented models could be combined into "hybrid approaches" that include organism-oriented mechanistic representation of a limited number of trophic interactions in an otherwise process - oriented approach. Under global change the density and activity of organisms determining the processes may change non-linearly and therefore explicit knowledge of the organisms and their responses should ideally be included. At the individual plant scale a common organism-based conceptual model of aboveground-belowground interactions has emerged. This conceptual model facilitates the formulation of research questions to guide experiments aiming to identify patterns that are common within, but differ between, ecosystem types and biomes. Such experiments inform modelling approaches at larger scales. Future ecosystem models should better include this evolving knowledge of common patterns of aboveground-belowground interactions. Improved ecosystem models are necessary toots to reduce the uncertainty in the information that assists us in the sustainable management of our environment in a changing world.

AB Shoot herbivory by the sapling specialist shoot-borer Cromarcha stroudagnesia (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae, Chrysauginae) is shown to have large direct and indirect effects on the rates of height increment and mortality of saplings of its host tree, Tabebuia ochracea (Bignoniaceae), in the secondary successional tropical dry forests of the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Experiments and field observations over 3-4 years show a substantial reduction in sapling height increments due to C. stroudagnesia herbivory, of equivalent magnitude to the difference in height increments between undamaged saplings in canopy gaps and full understorey shade. Extrapolating this data at average amounts of C. stroudagnesia herbivory increases the duration of the pre-reproductive sapling life stage by about 40% relative to undamaged plants. This is an underestimate, as top shoot herbivory by C. stroudagnesia also increased the probability of canopy gap saplings being overtopped and shaded by surrounding vegetation. Sapling mortality was increased by C. stroudagnesia herbivory, with 11.8% of the most heavily damaged young saplings dying in 3 years while no undamaged saplings died. Cromarcha stroudagnesia herbivory strongly increases with the number of conspecific T. ochracea saplings and the number of conspecific shoots within 50 m of focal saplings. It is therefore likely to disproportionately decrease the number of saplings and rate of recruitment to reproductive age in areas of high conspecific sapling density. These results suggest that sapling herbivory, especially herbivory of terminal meristems, has an important but largely unexplored influence on the population dynamics of tropical tree species. They further demonstrate that sapling herbivory by insects, in addition to the well-studied insect predation and herbivory of seedlings, is likely to influence tree species coexistence in tropical forests.

AB There is much interest in ways to exploit tropical timber without greatly changing forest processes and diversity. To achieve this, it is necessary to know the maximum logging intensity that can be used and how long the forest takes to recover from logging. Because little is known about the effects of selective logging on non-timber plant species, we examined the effects of logging intensity and time after logging on the diversity and abundance of flowering and fruiting understory plants in a Central Amazonian forest near Manaus, Brazil. Logging was carried out experimentally at varying intensities in eight 4 ha plots in 1987 and three plots in 1993. Logging intensity ranged between 14 and 45 m(3)/ha of extracted timber. Three plots were left as controls. Each month, from October 1996 to September 1998, we recorded the number of individuals and species of herbs, shrubs, small trees, and small palms that were flowering and fruiting in six transects per plot. We found 107 species flowering and 111 species fruiting. The abundance of flowering plants was affected by time after logging, but not by the intensity of logging. The abundance of fruiting plants was not related either to time after logging or logging intensity Richness of flowering and fruiting plants was related to time after logging, but not to the intensity of logging. The results indicate that selective logging, at the intensities and scale analyzed, does not cause reductions in flower and fruit production by the understory community. Both quantity and quality of resources for animals are maintained and possibly even increased in logged areas, shortly after logging takes place. As the levels of reproduction in plots logged 11 years before remained close to those in controls, maintenance of the understory community does not seem to be problematical.

AB The post-dispersal fate of Chrysophyllum lucentifolium (a canopy tree; Sapotaceae) seeds was analyzed in French Guiana over three consecutive years. Experiments using 750 thread-marked seeds were performed to investigate seed removal, predation, and caching by terrestrial vertebrates on howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus) defecation sites, where clumps of intact C lucentifolium seeds were observed. Year-to-year variations in seed fare during the peak fruiting period were considered in relation to overall fruit and seed resource availability estimated by a raked-trail survey. The effect of two forest areas, which differed in soil and floristic composition, was examined with conspecific fruiting tree density as a covariant. Exclosure versus open treatment was used to discriminate small rodents (not larger than a spiny rat) from other vertebrates. The presence of fresh howler dung did not affect seed fate after 20 days as shown by comparisons between defecation sites and control during the first year. There was a significant effect of year on the percentage of seeds remaining after 20 days. Low seed removal in 1995 and 1996 (compared to 1997) corresponded to higher overall fruiting and higher fruiting of C lucentifolium, or the presence of alternative resources for rodents. All effect of forest area was observed on the seed removal rate, which varied with years and protection. Comparatively, an effect of forest area on the percentage of seeds lost was observed in 1996 and an effect of treatment on the percentage of seeds eaten was seen in 1995. The mode of seed caching Suggested that spiny rats were the main seed remover. Results of this study suggest that greater seedling recruitment may Occur when large fruit crop and high howler dispersal co-occur with a lower impact of rodents (i.e., when rodents are saturated by abundant and diversified fruit resources such as in 1995). Such event synchrony, however, is highly unpredictable after only three years of study.

AB We used a variety of modeling approaches to assess the effects of fire on the demography and population viability of scrub buckwheat (Eriogonum longifolium var. gnaphalifolium), a threatened herb endemic to periodically burned xeric uplands in central Florida, USA. We compared the management implications of different approaches. Using demographic data from ten years including five fires, we constructed Lefkovitch matrix models of scrub buckwheat populations in unburned habitats for populations experiencing a burn and for populations one year after burning. Deterministic analysis of the unburned matrices predicted relatively stable populations in unburned habitats using optimistic fertility estimates (lambda = 1.002, 95% CI 0.975-1.033), but almost certain decline given pessimistic fertility estimates (lambda = 0.981, 0.962-1.003). Burned populations are always predicted to increase (CI on lambda > 1.08). Numerical calculations of single-year growth rates based on the expected stable stage distribution of an unburned population yielded positive, but lower, growth rates. The Vs calculated for periodically burned populations had confidence intervals entirely above I for fire return intervals shorter than 20 yr (optimistic) or 5 yr (pessimistic). Stochastic simulations yielded highly uncertain estimates of the probability of quasi-extinction over 250 yr, with only fire return intervals shorter than 20 yr (optimistic) or 5 yr (pessimistic) yielding quasi-extinction confidence intervals entirely below 1. Population growth rates in partially burned areas increased linearly with the proportion burned. The results of these density-independent simulations remained virtually unchanged (maximum difference of 5.2%) by introducing plausible population ceilings. Regression and stasis transitions had the highest elasticities for unburned populations, while fecundity elasticities were relatively greater for burn years. Transient elasticity analysis on total population size of simulated single-year post-fire growth and on the population vector five years in the future showed broadly similar patterns to standard elasticities, although the standard analysis assigned higher elasticity values to transitions contributing to future reproductive potential. Fire management is important to encouraging viable populations. Our analysis suggests minimum fire return intervals of 20 yr (optimistic) or 5 yr (pessimistic). These fire return intervals are consistent with those often used in the sandhill and oak-hickory scrub habitats of scrub buckwheat.

AB Populations of the ant Camponotus punctulatus undergo demographic explosions after agricultural activities, building conspicuous, vegetation-covered soil mounds. We investigated the effects of C. punctulatus on floristic composition and soil properties along a gradient of agricultural disturbance in Northeastern Argentina. We sampled vegetation and soil "on" and "off" anthills in, at least, three replicate plots of each of the following situations that represent an increasing gradient of soil disturbance: natural grasslands, sown pastures of Digitaria decumbens, sown pastures of Setaria sphacelata, and recently abandoned rice fields. Sets of characteristic plant species for each of the land use histories, for "on" and "off" anthills as well as for anthills of different sizes were identified through Indicator Species Analysis. 64% of the variation in plant community composition was mainly explained by land-use history which was associated to the first 2 axes of a Correspondence Analysis based on the frequency of 126 species across all sites. At the replicate scale, Correspondence Analyses revealed patterns of plant species composition related to the presence and size of anthills. Larger mounds became enriched in species, especially herb weeds, in comparison to smaller mounds or samples gathered outside the anthills. A Principal Component Analysis of soil data revealed that 71% of the variation in soil properties was explained by the presence of anthills. Soils from "on" anthills were more fertile than soils from "off" anthills, independent of land-use history. The fertility effect of C. punctulatus mounds in addition with the vegetation patterns observed along the gradient of anthill-sizes highlights the importance of these ants at the landscape and local scales.

AB Species are identified as bioindicators when their presence or abundance within sites of a particular habitat or a conservation area are high. Dufrene and Legendre (1997), Ecological Monographs 67: 345-366, proposed the use of a flexible asymmetrical approach to detect indicator species and species assemblages characterizing groups of sites, the indicator value for each species being subsequently tested by randomization. Although the advantages of these methods in comparison to other multivariate or two-way indicator species analyses have been demonstrated, relatively few ecological studies have made use of them. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the advantages of the indicator species test using a data set generate by traditional fisheries activities at four areas in the Bonifacio Strait Marine Reserve, Corsica, France. ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis and another randomization test were also performed on the same data set. the 54 species caught in the fishing nets, the indicator species analyses identified 19 species for which the indicator value was significant for a given area, whereas the a posteriori Tukey test for ANOVA detected only 12 species for which the mass capture per unit effort was significantly greater for a given area. The efficiency of this new approach within the framework of conservation and marine reserve studies is demonstrated by focusing on three species (Sciaena umbra, Palinurus elephas and Maja verrucosa).

AB Variable seed production may have important consequences for recruitment but is poorly documented for frugivore-dispersed tropical trees. Recruitment limitation may also be a critical spatial process affecting forest dynamics, but it is rarely assessed at the scale of individual trees. Over an 11-yr period, we studied the consequences of variable seed production for initial seedling recruitment in three shade-tolerant tree species (Quararibea asterolepis, Tetragastris panamensis, and Trichilia tuberculata) on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We measured annual seed production for a permanent sample of focal trees and censused annual new seedling establishment within a restricted dispersal neighborhood of each tree. We analyzed temporal and spatial variability in recruitment and compared recruitment limitations among species.
   Annual seed production in Quararibea and Tetragastris fluctuated widely, whereas Trichilia had more, consistent seed production across years. Within species, trees were synchronized in seed production, and synchrony appeared partly influenced by El Nino climatic events. Seedling recruitment varied temporally and spatially. At the population scale, all species had greater recruitment in productive seed years, and individual trees had differing contributions to this temporal pattern. At the focal-tree scale, recruitment patterns differed among species. Quararibea and Tetragastris trees with higher average seed production recruited more seedlings in their local neighborhoods than did less fecund trees. In contrast, Trichilia seedling recruitment did not increase with seed crop size, suggesting negative density dependence. At the tree neighborhood scale, no species showed evidence of density dependence in first-year survival. Comparatively, recruitment was more seed-limited in Quararibea and Tetragastris and more establishment-limited in Trichilia. Overall, our results indicated that: (1) variable seed production influenced seedling recruitment both temporally and spatially, and (2) species differed in limitations to recruitment.

AB The periodic growing of a certain set of crops in a prescribed order, called a crop rotation, is considered to be an important tool for managing weed populations. Nevertheless. the effects of crop rotations on weed population dynamics are [lot well understood. Explanations for rotation effects on weed populations usually invoke the diversity of environments caused by different crops that a weed population encounters. Using a periodic matrix model, we show that the number of different crops is not the sole factor, and that the sequence of a given set of crops can play an important role, In the model the weed population is structured by seed depth in the soil. and plowing moves seeds between layers, For illustration of concepts, we use parameter values thought to be characteristic for Polygonum persicaria growing in carrots (crop A) and spring wheat (crop B) in the Netherlands. We systematically examine the population growth rates for P. persicaria and their sensitivity to changes for all rotations of 2-6 years based on crops A and B. We include eight scenarios that differ in the effects of plowing and seed survival over winter. Differences between rotations can be striking. For example the weed population growth rate in the baseline rotation AABB assuming 100% winter survival) is nearly 25% lower than in rotation ABAB. The elasticity (a measure to quantify the effect of proportional changes in model parameters on population growth) to seedling survival is nearly 75% higher in the B years of rotation ABAB than in the B years of rotation AABB. Changing parameter values changes the relation between population dynamics and rotation organization, but not the conclusion that there are consequences for population dynamics and management due to choice of a rotation. While our example is an agronomic one, the question "Does sequence matter'?" and the methods applied should be of interest to researchers and managers concerned with the periodic management of other ecosystems.

AB Banner-tailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis) are prominent ecosystem engineers that build large mounds that influence the spatial structuring of fungi, plants, and some ground-dwelling animals. Ants are diverse and functionally important components of arid ecosystems; some species are also ecosystem engineers. We investigated the effects of patch disturbances created by D. spectabilis mounds on ant assemblages in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland in southern New Mexico by using pitfall traps in a paired design (mound vs. matrix). Although the disturbances did not alter species richness or harbor unique ant communities relative to the matrix, they did alter species composition; the abundances of 6 of 26 species were affected. The disturbances might also act to disrupt spatial patterning of ants caused by other environmental gradients. In contrast to previous investigations of larger-scale disturbances, we detected no effects of the disturbances on ants at the functional-group level. Whether ant communities respond to disturbance at a functional-group or within-functional-group level may depend on the size and intensity of the disturbance. Useful functional-group schemes also may be scale-dependent, however, or species may respond idiosyncratically. Interactions between disturbance-generating mammals and ants may produce a nested spatial structure of patches.

AB Species composition and the pattern of shell utilization by hermit crabs were studied in five areas of Sao Sebastiao Channel. Habitat characteristics were evaluated and related to the presence and relative abundance of crabs. Nine species of hermit crab were found: Clibanarius antillensis, Clibanarius vittatus, Clibanarius sclopetarius, Calcinus tibicen, Paguristes tortugae, Paguristes erythrops, Petrochirus diogenes, Pagurus criniticornis and Pagurus brevidactylus. Habitat complexity, moisture, rocky shore slope and hydrodynamism were the major characteristics influencing hermit crab presence, relative abundance and distribution in these areas. Shell utilization and availability varied among sites and shell utilization seemed to be dependent on differences in local shell supply (size and abundance of living snails) and preferences of the hermit crabs for certain shell types.

ID RAIN-FOREST; PRIMATES
AB Population surveys of Sulawesi crested black macaques (Macaca nigra) were conducted on the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi and Bacan in 1992-1994 to assess the status of natural populations and determine habitat and anthropogenic factors affecting their population densities. We surveyed five sites for primates, including undisturbed and disturbed habitats. Data were collected on habitat structure and composition at two undisturbed and one disturbed forest site in which the primates were surveyed. The highest density of macaques was found in primary forest at Gunung Sibela Nature Reserve on Bacan (170.3 individuals/km(2)). Population density in logged forest on Bacan was high but significantly less than primary forest (133.4 individuals/km(2)). The high density of crested black macaques in primary forest on Bacan is best explained by the high carrying capacity found in primary forest. The lower food quantity and quality of food resources found in logged forest correlated with lower primate densities compared to primary forest. However, the large population of macaques in logged forest demonstrates the conservation value of such forest. Densities on Sulawesi at Tangkoko-Batuangas-DuaSudara Nature Reserve (TBDS) showed a continuing decline since earlier surveys. Primate densities were highest near the protected center of Tangkoko Reserve (66.7 individuals/km(2)). The peripheral areas of Batuangas and DuaSudara, even though adjacent and continuous, showed lower population densities of 46.4 and 23.5 individuals/km(2), respectively. The best explanation for the continued decline of Macaca nigra populations at TBDS is hunting. Unless conservation measures are implemented immediately, M. nigra on Sulawesi risks extinction in the near future. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB The effects of different gap definitions on gap size and concomitant changes in turnover time were investigated. In a tropical rain forest in French Guiana, 18 canopy gaps were measured using 3 different gap definitions. Gap size was significantly affected by gap definitions. Strong positive correlations were found between gap sizes according to the different definitions. Based on one of these linear relations, effects of gap definitions on turnover time calculations were evaluated. It was found that in the studied forest, the turnover time at the forest floor is much lower (some 4 to 8 times) than the turnover time at the forest canopy. It is concluded that it is doubtful whether it is valid to compare gap- and turnover time studies which have been carried out so far. To be able to make valid comparisons between different studies on forest dynamics in the future, it is important to reach a consensus on the choice and application of one or more clearly defined gap definitions.

AB Calliostoma ligatum shells inhabited by hermit crabs were weaker than shells inhabited by snails collected at the same locality. When shells of C. ligatum were loaded repetitively to 80% of their predicted failure load, hermit crab-inhabited shells showed an immediate drop in shell strength followed by a progressive further loss of shell strength over the next 18 days. Snail-inhabited C. ligatum shells exhibited a decrease in strength after 9 days, but returned to initial values within 18 days of loading.
   Hermit crabs thus bear shells significantly weaker than they were when borne by the gastropods that produced them. Reported similarities in vulnerability of gastropods and hermit crabs to shell-crushing predators may be artifacts of the metric (critical size) used to compare vulnerabilities. Hermit crabs probably were a significant factor in the diversification of durophagous predators in the Mesozoic, supplying a prey base identical in size and shape to gastropods but with significantly lower resistance to crushing. The unpredictability of strength in hermit-crab inhabited shells may maintain the apparently inefficient indiscriminate attacks common among durophagous predators.

AB Species interactions lie at the heart of many theories of macroevolution, from adaptive radiation to the Red Queen. Although some theories describe the imprint that interactions will have over long timescales, we are still missing a comprehensive understanding of the effects of interactions on macroevolution. Current research shows strong evidence for the impact of interactions on macroevolutionary patterns of trait evolution and diversification, yet many macroevolutionary studies have only a tenuous relationship to ecological studies of interactions over shorter timescales. We review current research in this area, highlighting approaches that explicitly model species interactions and connect them to broad-scale macroevolutionary patterns. We also suggest that progress has been made by taking an integrative interdisciplinary look at individual clades. We focus on African cichlids as a case study of how this approach can be fruitful. Overall, although the evidence for species interactions shaping macroevolution is strong, further work using integrative and model-based approaches is needed to spur progress towards understanding the complex dynamics that structure communities over time and space.

AB Hydraulic traits are important for woody plant functioning and distribution. Associations among hydraulic traits, other leaf and stem traits, and species' performance are relatively well understood for trees, but remain poorly studied for lianas. We evaluated the coordination among hydraulic efficiency (i.e., maximum hydraulic conductivity), hydraulic safety (i.e., cavitation resistance), a suite of eight morphological and physiological traits, and species' abundances for saplings of 24 liana species and 27 tree species in wet tropical forests in Panama. Trees showed a strong trade-off between hydraulic efficiency and hydraulic safety, whereas efficiency and safety were decoupled in lianas. Hydraulic efficiency was strongly and similarly correlated with acquisitive traits for lianas and trees (e.g., positively with gas exchange rates and negatively with wood density). Hydraulic safety, however, showed no correlations with other traits in lianas, but with several in trees (e.g., positively with leaf dry matter content and wood density and negatively with gas exchange rates), indicating that in lianas hydraulic efficiency is an anchor trait because it is correlated with many other traits, while in trees both efficiency and safety are anchor traits. Traits related to shade tolerance (e.g., low specific leaf area and high wood density) were associated with high local tree sapling abundance, but not with liana abundance. Our results suggest that different, yet unknown mechanisms determine hydraulic safety and local-scale abundance for lianas compared to trees. For trees, the trade-off between efficiency and safety will provide less possibilities for ecological strategies. For lianas, however, the uncoupling of efficiency and safety could allow them to have high hydraulic efficiency, and hence high growth rates, without compromising resistance to cavitation under drought, thus allowing them to thrive and outperform trees under drier conditions.

AB Individual-based models (IBMs) of complex systems emerged in the 1960s and early 1970s, across diverse disciplines from astronomy to zoology. Ecological IBMs arose with seemingly independent origins out of the tradition of understanding the ecosystems dynamics of ecosystems from a 'bottom-up' accounting of the interactions of the parts. Individual trees are principal among the parts of forests. Because these models are computationally demanding, they have prospered as the power of digital computers has increased exponentially over the decades following the 1970s.
   This review will focus on a class of forest IBMs called gap models. Gap models simulate the changes in forests by simulating the birth, growth and death of each individual tree on a small plot of land. The summation of these plots comprise a forest (or set of sample plots on a forested landscape or region). Other, more aggregated forest IBMs have been used in global applications including cohort-based models, ecosystem demography models, etc. Gap models have been used to provide the parameters for these bulk models. Currently, gap models have grown from local-scale to continental-scale and even global-scale applications to assess the potential consequences of climate change on natural forests. Modifications to the models have enabled simulation of disturbances including fire, insect outbreak and harvest.
   Our objective in this review is to provide the reader with an overview of the history, motivation and applications, including theoretical applications, of these models. In a time of concern over global changes, gap models are essential tools to understand forest responses to climate change, modified disturbance regimes and other change agents. Development of forest surveys to provide the starting points for simulations and better estimates of the behavior of the diversity of tree species in response to the environment are continuing needs for improvement for these and other IBMs.

AB Understanding the soil phosphorus (P) cycle is a prerequisite for predicting how environmental changes may influence the dynamics and availability of P in soil. We compiled a database of P fractions sequentially extracted by the Hedley procedure and its modification in 626 unfertilized and uncultivated soils worldwide. With this database, we applied structural equation modeling to test hypothetical soil P transformation models and to quantify the importance of different soil P pools and P transformation pathways in shaping soil P availability at a global scale. Our models revealed that soluble inorganic P (Pi, a readily available P pool) was positively and directly influenced by labile Pi, labile organic P (Po), and primary mineral P and negatively and directly influenced by secondary mineral P; soluble Pi was not directly influenced by moderately labile Po or occluded P. The overall effect on soluble Pi was greatest for labile Pi followed by the organic P pools, occluded P, and then primary mineral P; the overall influence from secondary mineral P was small. Labile Pi was directly linked to all other soil P pools and was more strongly linked than soluble Pi to labile Po and primary mineral P. Our study highlights the important roles of labile Pi in mediating P transformations and in determining overall P availability in soils throughout the world.

AB Fragmentation and habitat loss contribute considerably to global declines of amphibians and reptiles. However, few studies focus on forest edges, created during the fragmentation process, as proximate drivers of the local demographic structure of populations. Here, we use abundance data of amphibians and reptiles to study their responses to forest edges in nine fragmented forested landscapes of the Neotropics. Species-specific abundance data were collected in plots established at varying distances from their respective nearest forest edge. We tested for edge effects on the abundance of species, and used curve clustering techniques to group species with similar edge responses, i.e. species with either increasing or decreasing abundance from the matrix towards the forest interior. We also grouped species that showed no change in abundance with respect to the nearest forest edge and those whose abundance response was unimodal, peaking in either forest habitat or the surrounding matrix habitat. We found that 96% of all amphibians and 90% of all reptiles showed an edge response, with the abundance of 74.5% of amphibians and 57.3% of reptiles decreasing with increasing proximity to forest edges. However, species-specific edge effects were not always consistent, with some species having opposite edge responses when measured in different landscapes. The depth of edge effects exhibited by forest species, i.e. species that increased in abundance in the forest interior, extended up to one kilometre away from forest edges. We show that the median edge effect on forest species extends to 250 m within the forest interior, indicating that tropical forest patches with a mean diameter < 500 m (minimum area approximate to 78 ha) are unsuitable for half of forest-dependent species considered in this study.

AB Many animals and plants that colonize hard surfaces in the sea are sessile and either bore into, or cement themselves permanently to the substrate surface. Because they retain their life positions after fossilization, these sclerobionts offer scope for studying biotic interactions in the fossil record. Encrusting sclerobionts compete actively for living space, with dominant competitors overgrowing the edges of subordinates. In addition to such marginal overgrowths, spatial competition may also occur through fouling in which larvae recruit directly onto the living surfaces of established sclerobionts. Spatial competition has been studied extensively in modern marine communities but there has been little research on competition between encrusters in ancient communities. This reflects poor knowledge of the taxonomy of the sclerobionts involved, as well as problems in distinguishing between overgrowth in vivo and post-mortem. Nevertheless, if carefully interpreted, the fossil record of sclerobionts can provide an as yet largely unexploited resource for studying the long-term ecological and evolutionary dynamics of competition.

AB Spatial patterns in community structure are known to exist at a range of spatial scales. By understanding the relative importance of spatial and environmental variation in shaping community structure, it is possible to gain insight into the complexity of the underlying mechanisms driving community assembly. Here, we investigated how fungal community assembly is impacted by species sorting across a strong environmental filter in the same geographic space. Using a spatially explicit sampling design, root and soil associated fungal communities were sampled from eight study sites over a 500 km transect along the south-east coast of Australia. The relative importance of spatial and environmental factors in shaping fungal beta diversity was determined across a range of scales, along with the importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping fungal beta diversity changes for each community type. Fungal community composition patterns were found to be generally similar in both root and soil associated communities, across the scales included in the sampling design (40 m-500 km). However, the mechanisms responsible for driving community assembly differed in the root and soil associated communities. Niche-based processes were found to be influential in shaping soil fungal community assembly, while the patterns in root-associated community structure were consistent with neutral assembly. This may be due to factors such as niche breadth, environmental heterogeneity, dispersal, and immigration differing in importance among the two environments. Our results indicate that both niche and neutral processes can be active in fungal community assembly and provide insight into the conditions under which each class of processes dominate.

AB Human land use legacies have significant and long-lasting ecological impacts across landscapes. Investigating ancient (>400 years) legacy effects can be problematic due to the difficulty in detecting specific, historic land uses, especially those hidden beneath dense canopies. Caracol, the largest (similar to 200 km(2)) Maya archaeological site in Belize, was abandoned ca. A.D. 900, leaving behind myriad structures, causeways, and an extensive network of agricultural terraces that persist beneath the architecturally complex tropical forest canopy. Airborne LiDAR enables the detection of these below-canopy archaeological features while simultaneously providing a detailed record of the aboveground 3-dimensional canopy organization, which is indicative of a forest's ecological function. Here, this remote sensing technology is used to determine the effects of ancient land use legacies on contemporary forest structure. Canopy morphology was assessed by extracting LiDAR point clouds (0.25 ha plots) from LiDAR-identified terraced (n = 150) and non-terraced (n = 150) areas on low (0 degrees-10 degrees), medium (10 degrees-20 degrees), and high (>20 degrees) slopes. We calculated the average canopy height, canopy openness, and vertical diversity from the LiDAR returns, with topographic features (i.e., slope, elevation, and aspect) as covariates. Using a PerMANOVA procedure, we determined that forests growing on agricultural terraces exhibited significantly different canopy structure from those growing on non-terraced land. Terraces appear to mediate the effect of slope, resulting in less structural variation between slope and non-sloped land and yielding taller, more closed, more vertically diverse forests. These human land uses abandoned >1000 years ago continue to impact contemporary tropical rainforests having implications related to arboreal habitat and carbon storage.

AB This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of deforestation processes of moist evergreen Afrmontane forests by disentangling the role of biophysical and socio-economic factors. Hitherto deforestation patterns between 1957 and 2007 were mapped for 9 villages in the Jimma zone of the Oromia regional state in Southwest Ethiopia on the basis of aerial photographs and high- resolution satellite images. The results show a 19% decline in forest cover since 1957. A spatial analysis of the observed deforestation patterns showed that the way of living and the accessibility to markets has controlled to a large extent the spatial pattern of deforestation during the past 50 years. Forest was lost mainly at remote locations away from the main roads where market integration is difficult. Farmers in these locations are relatively poor and self-subsistent which implies that population increase automatically led to new deforestation. Places very nearby to market places were spared from deforestation because of the presence of off-farm jobs in the towns. Significantly less deforestation was observed in areas that are suitable for the growth of shaded coffee. The areas above 2000 m.a.s.l that are not suited for shaded coffee are typically inhabited by relatively poor households who are living far from roadsides and thus are less integrated to the surrounding major markets. As a result, they depend more on subsistence farming causing more deforestation than other households. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two main theories have attempted to explain variation in plant species composition (beta-diversity). Niche theory proposes that most of the variation is related to environment (environmental filtering), whereas neutral theory posits that dispersal limitation is the main driver of beta-diversity. In this study, we first explored how alpha- and beta-diversity of plant functional groups defined by growth form (trees, shrubs and lianas, which represent different strategies of resource partitioning), and dispersal syndrome (autochory, anemochory and zoochory, which represent differences in dispersal limitation) vary with successional age and topographic position in a tropical dry forest. Second, we examined the effects of environmental, spatial, and spatially-structured environmental factors on beta-diversity of functional groups; we used the spatial structure of sampling sites as a proxy for dispersal limitation, and elevation, soil properties and forest stand age as indicators of environmental filtering. We recorded 200 species and 22,245 individuals in 276 plots; 120 species were trees, 41 shrubs and 39 lianas. We found that beta-diversity was highest for shrubs, intermediate for lianas and lowest for trees, and was slightly higher for zoochorous than for autochorous and anemochorous species. All three dispersal syndromes, trees and shrubs varied in composition among vegetation classes (successional age and topographic position), whilst lianas did not. beta-diversity was influenced mostly by proxies of environmental filtering, except for shrubs, for which the influence of dispersal limitation was more important. Stand age and topography significantly influenced alpha-diversity across functional groups, but showed a low influence on beta-diversity-possibly due to the counterbalancing effect of resprouting on plant distribution and composition. Our results show that considering different plant functional groups reveals important differences in both alpha- and beta-diversity patterns and correlates that are not apparent when focusing on overall woody plant diversity, and that have important implications for ecological theory and biodiversity conservation.

AB Understanding the factors that limit species distributions along environmental gradients is a central question of ecology. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that the traits that result in performance trade-offs between habitats contribute to the turnover of woody species along a rainfall gradient in the Isthmus of Panama. We studied 24 plant species with contrasting distributions along this rainfall gradient. We measured 18 morphological and physiological traits, and three performance variables in seedlings planted in common garden experiments in two contrasting sites across the Isthmus. We found evidence for a trade-off suggesting that better survival during the dry season corresponded to a lower growth rate in the forest understorey. This trade-off correlated well with the distribution of the species along the rainfall gradient and was explained mostly by variation in photosynthetic capacity. While not all species fit into this trade-off, most dry-distribution species, which we had previously reported to have higher drought survival, were associated with higher stem hydraulic conductance and higher capacity for CO2 assimilation. Our interpretation is that this combination of traits may be associated mostly with desiccation avoidance (deep roots) or desiccation delay (deciduousness) rather than desiccation tolerance. Despite their higher photosynthetic capacity, these species had lower growth in the low-light understorey, probably because of higher maintenance costs (dark respiration rates). Wet-distribution species, on the other hand, had lower photosynthetic capacity and higher leaf area ratio. This strategy is typical of shade-tolerant species and may explain their higher growth rates in the low-light understorey. In conclusion, our results suggest that habitat associations along the rainfall gradient in the Isthmus of Panama may result in part from a trade-off between traits that are favourable to species that avoid or delay desiccation but that otherwise limit shade tolerance. This trade-off may limit the capacity of some dry-distribution species to colonize wet forests.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a primary policy instrument for managing and protecting coral reefs. Successful MPAs ultimately depend on knowledge-based decision making, where scientific research is integrated into management actions. Fourteen coral reef MPA managers and sixteen academics from eleven research, state and federal government institutions each outlined at least five pertinent research needs for improving the management of MPAs situated in Australian coral reefs. From this list of 173 key questions, we asked members of each group to rank questions in order of urgency, redundancy and importance, which allowed us to explore the extent of perceptional mismatch and overlap among the two groups. Our results suggest the mismatch among MPA managers and academics is small, with no significant difference among the groups in terms of their respective research interests, or the type of questions they pose. However, managers prioritised spatial management and monitoring as research themes, whilst academics identified climate change, resilience, spatial management, fishing and connectivity as the most important topics. Ranking of the posed questions by the two groups was also similar, although managers were less confident about the achievability of the posed research questions and whether questions represented a knowledge gap. We conclude that improved collaboration and knowledge transfer among management and academic groups can be used to achieve similar objectives and enhance the knowledge-based management of MPAs.

AB Some plant families show a striking imbalance in species diversity between the Neotropics and the Palaeotropics. The woody plant family Chrysobalanaceae is a typical example of this pattern, with 80% of the 531 species in the Neotropics. In order to test alternative interpretations for this pattern, we generated a dated phylogenetic hypothesis for Chrysobalanaceae, using DNA sequence data from one nuclear and six plastid markers. Using a maximum likelihood approach, we jointly inferred ancestral areas and diversification rates in the Neotropics and Palaeotropics. We found that Chrysobalanaceae most probably originated in the Palaeotropics about 80?Mya. The family dispersed into the Neotropics at least four times beginning 4060?Mya, with at least one back-dispersal to the Palaeotropics. Members of Chrysobalanaceae have experienced higher extinction, speciation and net diversification rates in the Neotropics. Hence, the high species diversity of Chrysobalanaceae in the Neotropics appears to be primarily caused by a higher speciation rate in this region. Several recent studies have shown high diversification rates in Neotropical plant families, but have focused on Andean-centred taxa. Ours is the first study to find a similar pattern in a family for which the centre of diversity is in eastern and central Amazonia.

AB We use a recently developed computerized modeling technique to explore the long-term impacts of indigenous Amazonian hunting in the past, present, and future. The model redefines sustainability in spatial and temporal terms, a major advance over the static "sustainability indices" currently used to study hunting in tropical forests. We validate the model's projections against actual field data from two sites in contemporary Amazonia and use the model to assess various management scenarios for the future of Manu National Park in Peru. We then apply the model to two archaeological contexts, show how its results may resolve long-standing enigmas regarding native food taboos and primate biogeography, and reflect on the ancient history and future of indigenous people in the Amazon.

AB Functional trade-offs have long been recognised as important mechanisms of species coexistence, but direct experimental evidence for such mechanisms is extremely rare. Here, we test the effect of one classical trade-off a negative correlation between seed size and seed number by establishing microcosm plant communities with positive, negative and no correlation between seed size and seed number and analysing the effect of the seed size/number correlation on species richness. Consistent with theory, a negative correlation between seed size and seed number led to a higher number of species in the communities and a corresponding wider range of seed size (a measure of functional richness) by promoting coexistence of large- and small-seeded species. Our study provides the first direct evidence that a seed size/number trade-off may contribute to species coexistence, and at a wider context, demonstrates the potential role of functional trade-offs in maintaining species diversity.

AB Seedling dynamics are crucial for understanding spatial plant distribution patterns, yet little is known about seedling establishment in Neotropical savannas because empirical studies at the community level are scarce. Over 2 years, we studied the recruitment and survival of an initial seedling assemblage and three cohorts of recruits of woody plants within 216 plots of 1 m2 located along a tree density gradient in the savannas of central Brazil. These savannas differ in tree density and canopy cover, from closed (high canopy cover) to open savannas (low canopy cover), and are located along shallow topographic gradients. We measured community-wide seedling limitation (i.e. proportion of 1-m2 plots without seedlings of any woody species), photosynthetic photon flux density, litter cover, soil moisture and soil nutrients in each savanna type. Because closed savannas had lower PPFD and higher leaf litter cover than open savannas, we evaluated the effects of light level and litter cover on seedling emergence of nine dominant savanna woody species under controlled conditions in a glasshouse. Density, recruitment and survival of seedlings decreased over time because of mortality in all savanna types, but they were consistently higher in closed than in open savannas. Community-wide seedling limitation was significantly lower in closed (0.16 +/- 0.03) than in open (0.30 +/- 0.05) savannas. In the glasshouse, high litter cover and very low light levels reduced seedling emergence of most species, suggesting an adaptation to delay seed germination until the wet season when soil water availability is high and leaf litter rapidly decomposes. Synthesis: In Neotropical savannas, tree canopy cover facilitates seedling establishment of woody species by reducing stressful environmental conditions. In particular, low irradiance and high litter cover in closed savannas enhance the recruitment and survival of woody seedlings relative to open savannas by reducing soil water deficits and increasing nutrient availability in the upper soil layers. The higher seedling limitation of tree species in open than in closed savannas contributes to maintain relatively different balances between trees and herbaceous plants along topographic gradients in Neotropical savannas and helps to explain spatial distribution patterns of woody species in these ecosystems.

AB 1. Plant plastic responses to herbivore damage may include rapid, active reallocation of plant resources to reduce the impact of herbivory on future plant fitness. However, whether these inducible tolerance responses can be extended to pine trees and how these responses could be modulated by genetic and environmental factors remains unclear.
   2. Biomass allocation and phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations in above-and below-ground tissues were measured in Pinus pinaster juveniles belonging to 33 open-pollinated families grown under two P availabilities (P-deficient and complete fertilization). Measurements were taken 15 days after half of the plants received a foliar spray treatment of 22 mmol L-1 methyl jasmonate (MJ) to simulate above-ground herbivore attack.
   3. Simulated above-ground herbivory promoted a strong preferential allocation of biomass below ground in the form of fine roots, leading to an almost two-fold increase in fine root biomass in MJ-treated plants and a significant reduction in above-ground tissues and coarse roots. In addition, MJ signalling increased P and N concentrations in the shoots while reducing (P) or maintaining (N) concentrations in the roots. These results suggest that induced resource sequestration is not a generalized strategy in this pine species. Fine root biomass and concentration of N and P in plant tissues showed additive genetic variation, but responses to MJ signalling did not vary among families. Allocation of biomass to fine roots was not affected by P availability, whereas allocation of P to the shoot was more intense under complete fertilization.
   4. Synthesis: Two new putative tolerance mechanisms inducible by MJ signalling may help to minimize the impact of above-ground herbivore damage on the future fitness of young pine trees by (i) allocation of carbon to fine roots, this appeared to be a generalized strategy with weak environmental modulation and (ii) reallocation of P and N from roots to shoots, which was largely affected by P availability, and thus susceptible to greater phenotypic variation in heterogeneous environments. We provide evidence that changes in tolerance-related traits are rapidly inducible by herbivory cues in this pine species. These results should be integrated with induced resistance responses to fully understand the costs and benefits associated with induced responses to herbivory.

AB Sampling ground-dwelling ants in the field is relatively fast, but sorting and identifying in the laboratory is costly and time-consuming. Using sub-samples collected in 25 km(2) grids, we surveyed ant assemblages using sardine baits, pitfall traps and Winkler extraction in three Amazonian vegetation types. Combining all three techniques detects the greatest number of species, but may be inefficient. Therefore, we compared the pooled results from the three techniques to results using one or two techniques combined. We evaluated whether the extra information acquired by adding a sampling technique compensates for the time and money associated with the extra processing. We also evaluated the consequences of the reduced effort on the retention of ecological information captured by the three techniques, using soil clay content, terrain slope and altitude as predictor variables in an ecological analysis. Pitfall traps captured the largest number of species and had the highest congruence with ant assemblages recorded by other techniques. Redundancy analysis indicated that pitfall-trapping is the most efficient technique, allowing reduction of 48% in cost and 43% in time. The loss of information about species richness when using only pitfall traps is apparently compensated by the saving of cost and time in the field and laboratory, because use of this technique alone was sufficient to detect all the responses of the ant assemblage to environmental variables that were detected by other techniques. These results indicate that considerable gains in efficiency can be obtained in most Amazonian-forest monitoring programs for ants by using only pitfall traps. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Payments for environmental services (PES) aim to improve the supply of environmental services by making payments to service providers, which are conditional on the provision of those services. Payments cannot be conditional unless the service can be effectively monitored, making monitoring of service provision a central feature of PES. We introduce a framework for designing monitoring programmes in PES schemes for biodiversity conservation. We suggest that decisions must be made concerning the indicators to be used (e.g. species, threats or positive actions), how they will be monitored (e.g. using ground-based or remote-sensed data) and how the monitoring information will be used to differentiate payments (e.g. trends over time, performance relative to neighbouring sites, performance against a target). We then use this framework to examine the feasibility of monitoring species and threat indicators in a community-based biodiversity payment scheme in Menabe, Madagascar. We find that detecting population changes, differences between sites, or whether a target has been met is only feasible for the most common indicators, suggesting that it may not be possible to base payments on the species conservationists are most interested in. If payments need to be based on relatively common indicators, threat indicators may be more appropriate than common species indicators due to a stronger relationship to the service of interest (presence of a rare species). It is, however, possible to incorporate information from rare indicators using accumulation curves to compare between sites. This study highlights the impact of indicator choice on the monitoring effort required in a biodiversity PES. We urge caution in the design of payment schemes and suggest it can be detrimental to structure a scheme around an indicator that cannot be effectively monitored. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Human actions have altered the structure and function of coastal ecosystems worldwide. In many locations, the overall portfolio of goods, cultural amenities, and supporting services provided by the marine environment has deteriorated. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) offers significant promise for addressing these issues because it is a comprehensive and integrated approach designed to reconcile conflicts and trade-offs among users of marine resources. A key step in the implementation of EBM is the establishment of target reference levels, or desired states, for indicators that reflect the status of the ecosystem. This paper reviews five approaches, borrowed from a variety of disciplines, to establish target reference levels for EBM. The approaches include the use of existing reference levels, reference directions, and reference levels based on nonlinear functional relationships, baselines, or social norms. Each approach is particularly suitable for EBM because it can be used alone or in combination with others to contextualize status for a diverse suite of ecosystem goals influenced by a wide variety of human activities. Perhaps most importantly, these approaches offer a prospectus for moving forward with EBM by using readily available information, motivating existing scientific capacity, and addressing trade-offs implicit to the setting of targets. This last point is articulated via examples of how each type of reference level might be applied in Puget Sound, WA, USA, where the efforts of scientists, managers, and policy makers have aligned recently in the interest of EBM implementation.

AB P>1. Herbivores exert significant selection on plants, and plants have evolved a variety of constitutive and inducible defences to resist and tolerate herbivory. Assessing the genetic mechanisms that influence defences against herbivores will deepen our understanding of the evolution of essential phenotypic traits.
   2. Ecogenomics is a powerful interdisciplinary approach that can address fundamental questions about the ecology and evolutionary biology of species, such as: which evolutionary forces maintain variation within a population? and What is the genetic architecture of adaptation? This field seeks to identify gene regions that influence ecologically important traits, assess the fitness consequences under natural conditions of alleles at key quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and test how the abiotic and biotic environment affects gene expression.
   3. Here, we review ecogenomics techniques and emphasize how this framework can address long-standing and emerging questions relating to anti-herbivore defences in plants. For example, ecogenomics tools can be used to investigate: inducible vs. constitutive defences; tradeoffs between resistance and tolerance; adaptation to the local herbivore community; selection on alleles that confer resistance and tolerance in natural populations; and whether different genes are activated in response to specialist vs. generalist herbivores and to different types of damage.
   4. Ecogenomic studies can be conducted with model species, such as Arabidopsis, or their relatives, in which case myriad molecular tools are already available. Burgeoning sequence data will also facilitate ecogenomic studies of non-model species. Throughout this paper, we highlight approaches that are particularly suitable for ecological studies of non-model organisms, discuss the benefits and disadvantages of specific techniques and review bioinformatic tools for analysing data.
   5. We focus on established and promising techniques, such as QTL mapping with pedigreed populations, genome wide association studies, transcription profiling strategies, population genomics and transgenic methodologies. Many of these techniques are complementary and can be used jointly to investigate the genetic architecture of defence traits and selection on alleles in nature.

AB Aim
   Using dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) in a tropical land-bridge island system, we test for the small island effect (SIE) in the species-area relationship and evaluate its effects on species richness and community composition. We also examine the determinants of species richness across island size and investigate the traits of dung beetle species in relation to their local extinction vulnerability following forest fragmentation.
   Location
   Lake Kenyir, a hydroelectric reservoir in north-eastern Peninsular Malaysia.
   Methods
   We sampled dung beetles using human dung baited pitfall traps on 24 land-bridge islands and three mainland sites. We used regression tree analyses to test for the SIE, as well as species traits related to local rarity, as an indication of extinction vulnerability. We employed generalized linear models (GLMs) to examine determinants for species richness at different scales and compared the results with those from conventional linear and breakpoint regressions. Community analyses included non-metric multidimensional scaling, partial Mantel tests, nestedness analysis and abundance spectra.
   Results
   Regression tree analysis revealed an area threshold at 35.8 ha indicating an SIE. Tree basal area was the most important predictor of species richness on small islands (< 35.8 ha). Results from GLMs supported these findings, with isolation and edge index also being important for small islands. The SIE also manifested in patterns of dung beetle community composition where communities on small islands (< 35.8 ha) departed from those on the mainland and larger islands, and were highly variable with no significant nestedness, probably as a result of unexpected species occurrences on several small islands. The communities exhibited a low degree of spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that dispersal limitation plays a part in structuring dung beetle assemblages. Species with lower baseline density and an inability to forage on the forest edge were found to be rarer among sites and hence more prone to local extinction.
   Main conclusions
   We highlight the stochastic nature of dung beetle community composition on small islands and argue that this results in reduced ecosystem functionality. A better understanding of the minimum fragment size required for retaining functional ecological communities will be important for effective conservation management and the maintenance of tropical forest ecosystem stability.

TI Coexistence of Insect Species Competing for a Pulsed Resource: Toward a

AB Background: One major challenge in understanding how biodiversity is organized is finding out whether communities of competing species are shaped exclusively by species-level differences in ecological traits (niche theory), exclusively by random processes (neutral theory of biodiversity), or by both processes simultaneously. Communities of species competing for a pulsed resource are a suitable system for testing these theories: due to marked fluctuations in resource availability, the theories yield very different predictions about the timing of resource use and the synchronization of the population dynamics between the competing species. Accordingly, we explored mechanisms that might promote the local coexistence of phytophagous insects (four sister species of the genus Curculio) competing for oak acorns, a pulsed resource.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed the time partitioning of the exploitation of oak acorns by the four weevil species in two independent communities, and we assessed the level of synchronization in their population dynamics. In accordance with the niche theory, overall these species exhibited marked time partitioning of resource use, both within a given year and between different years owing to different dormancy strategies between species, as well as distinct demographic patterns. Two of the four weevil species, however, consistently exploited the resource during the same period of the year, exhibited a similar dormancy pattern, and did not show any significant difference in their population dynamics.
   Conclusions/Significance: The marked time partitioning of the resource use appears as a keystone of the coexistence of these competing insect species, except for two of them which are demographically nearly equivalent. Communities of consumers of pulsed resources thus seem to offer a promising avenue for developing a unifying theory of biodiversity in fluctuating environments which might predict the co-occurrence, within the same community, of species that are ecologically either very similar, or very different.

AB Questions
   Do spatial and temporal patterns of encroachment of Pinus contorta and Abies grandis in a montane meadow suggest strong biotic controls on the invasion process?
   Location
   Forest-meadow mosaic, 1350 m a.s.l., Cascade Range, Oregon, US.
   Methods
   We combined spatial point pattern analysis, population age structures, and a time-series of stem maps to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of conifer invasion over a 200-yr period in three plots totaling 4 ha.
   Results
   Trees established during two broad, but distinct periods (late 1800s, then at much greater density in the mid-1900s). Recent invasion was not correlated with climatic variation. Abies grandis dominated both periods; P. contorta established at lower density, peaking before A. grandis. Spatially, older (>= 90 yr) P. contorta were randomly distributed, but older A. grandis were strongly clumped (0.2-20 m). Younger (< 90 yr) stems were positively associated at small distances (both within and between species), but were spatially displaced from older A. grandis, suggesting a temporal shift from facilitation to competition. Establishment during the 1800s resulted in widely scattered P. contorta and clumps of A. grandis that placed most areas of meadow close to seed sources permitting more rapid invasion during the mid-1900s. Rapid conversion to forest occurred via colonization of larger meadow openings - first by shade-intolerant P. contorta, then by shade-tolerant A. grandis - and by direct infilling of smaller openings by A. grandis.
   Conclusions
   In combination, spatial and temporal patterns of establishment suggest an invasion process shaped by biotic interactions, with facilitation promoting expansion of trees into meadows and competition influencing subsequent forest development. Once invasion is initiated, tree species with different life histories and functional traits can interact synergistically to promote rapid conversion of meadow to forest under a broad range of climatic conditions.

AB Global change includes multiple stressors to natural ecosystems ranging from direct climate and land-use impacts to indirect degradation processes resulting from fire. Humid tropical forests are vulnerable to projected climate change and possible synergistic interactions with deforestation and fire, which may initiate a positive feedback to rising atmospheric CO2. Here, we present results from a multifactorial impact analysis that combined an ensemble of climate change models with feedbacks from deforestation and accidental fires to quantify changes in Amazon Basin carbon cycling. Using the LPJmL Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, we modelled spatio-temporal changes in net biome production (NBP); the difference between carbon fluxes from fire, deforestation, soil respiration and net primary production. By 2050, deforestation and fire (with no CO2 increase or climate change) resulted in carbon losses of 7.4-20.3 Pg C with the range of uncertainty depending on socio-economic storyline. During the same time period, interactions between climate and land use either compensated for carbon losses due to wetter climate and CO2 fertilization or exacerbated carbon losses from drought-induced forest mortality (-20.1 to +4.3 Pg C). By the end of the 21st century, depending on climate projection and the rate of deforestation (including its interaction with fire), carbon stocks either increased (+12.6 Pg C) or decreased (-40.6 Pg C). The synergistic effect of deforestation and fire with climate change contributed up to 26-36 Pg C of the overall decrease in carbon stocks. Agreement between climate projections (n=9), not accounting for deforestation and fire, in 2050 and 2098 was relatively low for the directional change in basin-wide NBP (19-37%) and aboveground live biomass (13-24%). The largest uncertainty resulted from climate projections, followed by implementation of ecosystem dynamics and deforestation. Our analysis partitions the drivers of tropical ecosystem change and is relevant for guiding mitigation and adaptation policy related to global change.

AB (Spatial patter is of tree community dynamics are detectable in a small (4 ha) and disturbed fragment of the Brazilian Atlantic forest) The dynamics of the tree community of a fragment of tropical semideciduous forest was investigated in south-eastern Brazil. Surveys were carried out in 2000 and 2005 in 29 20 a 20 m plots. The main purpose was to assess the possibility of detecting spatial patterns of dynamics that could be related to the heterogeneity of both the environment and disturbance history in a small forest area (4.0 ha). Rates of mortality and recruitment of trees and gain and loss of basal area were obtained for the whole sample, four pre-defined soil habitats. diameter classes and twelve tree populations. The tree community was rather unstable in the period, once mortality rates surpassed recruitment rates and loss rates of basal area surpassed gain rates all-over the area denoting the prevalence of a degradation process, possibly triggered by a clear felling in 1985 that reduced the area of the fragment in 26%. The tree community dynamics showed no spatial autocorrelation but was not evenly distributed throughout the fragment. This spatial heterogeneity was chiefly determined by the disturbance history of each site while environmental heterogeneity played a secondary but significant role. The main causes of disturbance heterogeneity were the extension of the adjacent felled area, cattle trampling and selective logging. The environmental variables that most strongly correlated with the variations of the dynamics rates were those related to the availability of light, water and mineral nutrients. In contrast with the overall trends. three understory species expanded in the period, possibly at the expense of the steeply declining density of mid-sized trees.

AB We compared forest canopy heights and nitrogen concentrations in long-term research sites and in 2 x 2 km landscapes surrounding these sites along a substrate age gradient in the Hawaiian Islands. Both remote airborne and ground-based measurements were used to characterize processes that control landscape-level variation in canopy properties. We integrated a waveform light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system, a high-resolution imaging spectrometer, and a global positioning system/inertial measurement unit to provide highly resolved images of ground topography, canopy heights, and canopy nitrogen concentrations (1) within a circle 50 m in radius focused on a long-term study site in the center of each landscape; (2) for the entire 2 x 2 km landscape regardless of land cover; and (3) after stratification, for our target cover class, native-dominated vegetation on constructional geomorphic surfaces throughout each landscape. Remote measurements at all scales yielded the same overall patterns as did ground-based measurements in the long-term sites. The two younger landscapes supported taller trees than did older landscapes, while the two intermediate-aged landscapes had higher canopy nitrogen (N) concentrations than did either young or old landscapes. However, aircraft-based analyses detected substantial variability in canopy characteristics on the landscape level, even within the target cover class. Canopy heights were more heterogeneous on the older landscapes, with coefficients of variation increasing from 23-41% to 69-78% with increasing substrate age. This increasing heterogeneity was associated with a larger patch size of canopy turnover and with dominance of most secondary successional stands by the mat-forming fern Dicranopteris linearis in the older landscapes.

AB We document the dendroclimatological potential of Polylepis tarapacana to estimate past temporal and spatial variations in precipitation across the Bolivian Altiplano (17-23 degrees S). The P tarapacana chronologies, which presently range between 110 and 705 years in length, represent the highest altitude tree-ring records worldwide. Interannual variations in fourteen tree-ring chronologies located between 3900 and 4850 m elevation were compared using correlation and principal component analyses. There is a strong common signal among the chronologies. For the common interval AD 1890-1999, three dominant patterns of tree growth across the Bolivian Altiplano were identified. The first pattern which explains 52% of the total variance in tree growth is associated with years of above- or below-average tree growth across the whole region. The second and third patterns, which are related to significantly lower common variance (13 and 8%, respectively), are associated with contrasting positive and negative anomalies of growth between the northern and southern sectors, and between the central-western sector and the rest of the region, respectively. In order to determine the climatic significance of the spatial variations of P tarapacana growth, the interannual patterns in tree growth were compared with spatial anomalies in precipitation across the region. Uniform patterns of above (below) average tree growth are associated with positive (negative) precipitation anomalies in the preceding year that are uniformly distributed across the whole Altiplano. In the westernmost areas of the Altiplano, summer rainfall accounts for more than 80% of total annual precipitation. Therefore, relationships between tree growth and summer or annual precipitation are, in most cases, similar. Contrasting patterns of tree growth are related to opposite anomalies in precipitation during the preceding year in the different sub-regions in the Altiplano (north versus south, central versus north and south). Climatic preconditioning of tree growth was also identified for individual years. For instance, extremely reduced growth in the year 1967 reflects dry conditions in the two preceding years (1965-1966). Long-term intervals (3 or more years) with reduced tree growth resulted from several consecutive years with low precipitation. Our results indicate that the network of tree-ring chronologies of P. tarapacana in the Bolivian Altiplano has the potential to provide annually-resolved precipitation reconstructions in this region for the past 5-7 centuries. This is a valuable source to document decadal-to-century-scale precipitation variability in the Altiplano and its relation to large-scale ocean-atmosphere circulation features. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Litter-nesting ants are diverse and abundant in tropical forests, but the factors structuring their communities are poorly known. Here we present results of the first study to examine the impact of natural variation in flooding on a highly diverse (21 genera, 77 species) litter-nesting ant community in a primary Amazonian forest. Fifty-six 3 x 3 m plots experiencing strong variation in flooding and twenty-eight 3 x 3 m terra firme plots were exhaustively searched for litter-nesting ants to determine patterns of density, species richness and species composition. In each plot, flooding, litter depth, twig availability, canopy cover, plant density, percent soil nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus were measured. Degree of flooding, measured as flood frequency and flood interval, had the strongest impact on ant density in flooded forest. Flooding caused a linear decrease in ant abundance, potentially due to a reduction of suitable nesting sites. However, its influence on species richness varied: low-disturbance habitat had species richness equal to terra firme forest after adjusting for differences in density. The composition of ant genera and species varied among flood categories; some groups known to contain specialist predators were particularly intolerant to flooding. Hypoponera STD10 appeared to be well-adapted to highly flooded habitat. Although flooding did not appear to increase species richness or abundance at the habitat scale, low-flooding habitat contained a mixture of species found in the significantly distinct ant communities of terra firme and highly flooded habitat.

AB Aim
   It is increasingly accepted that the mean wood density of trees within a forest is tightly coupled to above-ground forest biomass. It is unknown, however, if a positive relationship between forest biomass and mean community wood density is a general phenomenon across forests. Understanding spatial variation in biomass as a function of wood density both within and among forests is important for predicting changes in stored carbon in response to global change, and here we evaluated the generality of a positive biomass-wood density relationship within and among six tropical forests.
   Location
   Costa Rica, Panama, Puerto Rico and Ecuador.
   Methods
   Individual stem data, including diameter at breast height and spatial position, for six forest dynamics plots were merged with an extensive wood density database. Individual stem biomass values were calculated from these data using published statistical models. Total above ground biomass, total basal area and mean community wood density were also quantified across a range of subcommunity plot sizes within each forest.
   Results
   Among forests, biomass did not vary with mean community wood density. The relationship between subcommunity biomass and mean wood density within a forest varied from negative to null to positive depending on the size of subcommunities and forest identity. The direction of correlation was determined by the associated total basal area-mean wood density correlation, the slope of which increased strongly with whole forest mean wood density.
   Main conclusions
   There is no general relationship between forest biomass and wood density, and in some forests, stored carbon is highest where wood density is lowest. Our results suggest that declining wood density, due to global change, will result in decreased or increased stored carbon in forests with high or low mean wood density, respectively.

AB This study focuses on the 17 Neotropical species described in Cedrela (Meliaceae; Cedreleae), in particular C. odorata, which has been shown in past population genetic studies to be more variable than other tree species. We sampled two sets of molecular markers, nuclear ribosomal spacers (nrITS), and several plastid regions (the psbB, psbN, psbT exons and the trnS-trnG spacer). Both sets of markers produced congruent results using parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods for a set of taxa that include outgroups (outside Cedreleae) as well as other members of the related genera within Cedreleae. All results confirm current delimitation of Cedreleae and genetic distinctiveness for four new species with divergent morphologies. Our study also provides evidence that there are several genetic entities among the accessions of C. odorata that have distinct ranges or habitat preferences. These entities may constitute new species, are morphologically cryptic and require a great deal more investigation to delimit their ranges. Our results have important implications for conservation of Cedrela odorata, which is heavily harvested throughout its range in the American tropics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a theoretical framework to describe stochastic, size-structured community assembly, and use this framework to make community-level ecological predictions. Our model can be thought of as adding biological realism to Neutral Biodiversity Theory by incorporating size variation and growth dynamics, and allowing demographic rates to depend on the sizes of individuals. We find that the species abundance distribution (SAD) is insensitive to the details of the size structure in our model, demonstrating that the SAD is a poor indicator of size-dependent processes. We also derive the species biomass distribution (SBD) and find that the form of the SBD depends on the underlying size structure. This leads to a prescription for testing multiple, intertwined ecological predictions of the model, and provides evidence that alternatives to the traditional SAD are more closely tied to certain ecological processes. Finally, we describe how our framework may be extended to make predictions for more general types of community structure.

AB To mitigate extinction of tropical forest biota, it is becoming increasingly important to focus on the role of agriculture-dominated landscapes in preserving biodiversity. Previous studies have focused on the importance of native trees for improving forest species conservation in the agroecological matrix, but we show that a cultivated crop (coffee) may also be important. In Ethiopia, coffee's place of origin, home garden coffee shrubs functioned as a substrate for a large number of epiphytic rainforest bryophytes and vascular plants and were of the same or higher importance in terms of harboring forest biota than shade trees in the same system. Our results highlight the potential for shade-coffee agroecosystems to serve as a conservation and restoration tool for both tree and shrub-layer biodiversity in densely populated and heavily deforested regions.

AB Aim A major question with regard to the ecology of temperate rain forests in south-central Chile is how pioneer and shade-tolerant tree species coexist in old-growth forests. We explored the correspondence between tree regeneration dynamics and life-history traits to explain the coexistence of these two functional types in stands apparently representing a non-equilibrium mixture.
   Location This study was conducted in northern Chiloe Island, Chile (41.6 degrees S, 73.9 degrees W) in a temperate coastal rain forest with no evidence of stand disruption by human impact.
   Methods We assessed stand structure by sampling all stems within two 50 x 20 m and four 5 x 100 m plots. A 600-m long transect, with 20 uniformly spaced sampling points, was used to quantify seedling and sapling densities, obtain increment cores, and randomly select 10 tree-fall gaps. We used tree-ring analysis to assess establishment periods and to relate the influences of disturbances to the regeneration dynamics of the main canopy species.
   Results Canopy emergent tree species were the long-lived pioneer Eucryphia cordifolia and the shade-tolerant Aextoxicon punctatum. Shade-tolerant species such as Laureliopsis philippiana and several species of Myrtaceae occupied the main canopy. The stem diameter distribution for E. cordifolia was distinctly unimodal, while for A. punctatum it was multi-modal, with all age classes represented. Myrtaceae accounted for most of the small trees. Most tree seedlings and saplings occurred beneath canopy gaps. Based on tree-ring counts, the largest individuals of A. punctatum and E. cordifolia had minimum ages estimated to be > 350 years and > 286 years, respectively. Shade-tolerant Myrtaceae species and L. philippiana had shorter life spans (< 200 years). Most growth releases, regardless of tree species, were moderate and have occurred continuously since 1750.
   Main conclusions We suggest that this coastal forest has remained largely free of stand-disrupting disturbances for at least 450 years, without substantial changes in canopy composition. Release patterns are consistent with this hypothesis and suggest that the disturbance regime is dominated by individual tree-fall gaps, with sporadic multiple tree falls. Long life spans, maximum height and differences in shade tolerance provide a basis for understanding the long-term coexistence of pioneer and shade-tolerant tree species in this coastal, old-growth rain forest, despite the rarity of major disturbances.

AB The responses of tropical forests to global anthropogenic disturbances remain poorly understood. Above-ground woody biomass in some tropical forest plots has increased over the past several decades, potentially reflecting a widespread response to increased resource availability, for example, due to elevated atmospheric CO2 and/or nutrient deposition. However, previous studies of biomass dynamics have not accounted for natural patterns of disturbance and gap phase regeneration, making it difficult to quantify the importance of environmental changes. Using spatially explicit census data from large (50 ha) inventory plots, we investigated the influence of gap phase processes on the biomass dynamics of four 'old-growth' tropical forests (Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama; Pasoh and Lambir, Malaysia; and Huai Kha Khaeng (HKK), Thailand). We show that biomass increases were gradual and concentrated in earlier-phase forest patches, while biomass losses were generally of greater magnitude but concentrated in rarer later-phase patches. We then estimate the rate of biomass change at each site independent of gap phase dynamics using reduced major axis regressions and ANCOVA tests. Above-ground woody biomass increased significantly at Pasoh (+0.72% yr(-1)) and decreased at HKK (-0.56% yr(-1)) independent of changes in gap phase but remained stable at both BCI and Lambir. We conclude that gap phase processes play an important role in the biomass dynamics of tropical forests, and that quantifying the role of gap phase processes will help improve our understanding of the factors driving changes in forest biomass as well as their place in the global carbon budget.

AB 1. The idea that sets of species may have similar effects on population, community or ecosystem processes is a prevalent theme in many areas of ecology, especially in the context of biodiversity and ecosystem function. If indeed species are functionally equivalent, limiting similarity suggests that it should be closely related, morphologically similar species using similar resources in a similar manner.
   2. We assayed the functional equivalence of three congeneric, morphologically similar predatory fish species (genus Enneacanthus). Functional equivalence was evaluated using aspects of both effects of fish on a variety of prey responses and the growth responses of the fish themselves as a measure of energy consumption. Fish were matched by initial size to control for effects of body size. A strict definition of functional equivalence based on niche theory was used to delineate it from the alternative of functional diversity.
   3. Based on observed effects on larval anurans, only a single species pair could roughly be judged functionally equivalent, but these two species showed the greatest differences in growth rate and, hence, metabolic demand. Using the criterion of relative yield total, again, only a single pair could roughly be judged equivalent, however, members of this alternative species pair were dramatically different in their effects on larval anurans. Thus, as previously shown for a more diverse set of species, grouping of species by similarity in effects depends upon the specific response variable.
   4. Overall range of effects produced on a variety of response variables was surprising, given the similarity in morphology and autecology, strong phylogenetic affinity, and the fact that neither predator size nor growth explained significant variation. Each species appears to be interacting with the environment in a different manner, either as a consequence of differences in metabolic demand or differences in preferences or efficiency with regard to prey types.
   5. Observed responses are consistent with the predictions of niche theory and support an alternative explanation for observed relationships between diversity and ecosystem function. Our work suggests that functional equivalence may be uncommon, difficult to predict a priori, and that functional diversity, not functional equivalence, may underlie observed diversity-ecosystem function relationships.

AB Changes in land use/land cover have important consequences on the management of natural resources including soil and water quality, global climatic systems and biodiversity. This study analysed the spatial and temporal pattern of land use/land cover change in the Camili forest planning unit that includes the Camili Biosphere Reserve Area within the Caucasian hotspot, in the northeast corner of Turkey. To assess the patterns during a 33-year period, the necessary data were obtained from forest stand maps and evaluated with Geographic Information Systems and FRAGSTATS. Results showed that the total forested areas increased from 19 946 center dot 5 ha (78 center dot 6% of the study area) in 1972 to 20 797 center dot 3 ha (81 center dot 9 per cent) in 2005 with a slight net increase of 851 ha. Softwood cover types (411 center dot 8 ha) completely transitioned to other cover types over 33-year period. In terms of spatial configuration, the total number of forest fragments increased from 172 to 608, and mean size of forest patch (NIPS) decreased from 147 center dot 7 ha to 41 center dot 8 ha during the period. Nearly 84 per cent of the patches in 1972 and 93 per cent of them in 2005 generally seem to concentrate into 0-100 ha patch size class, indicating more fragmented landscape over time that might create a risk for the maintenance of biodiversity of the area. There were apparent trends in the temporal structure of forest landscape, some of which may issue from mismanagement of the area, social conflict, and illegal utilization of forest resources due to ineffective forest protection measurements. The study revealed that it is important to understand both spatial and temporal changes of land use/land cover and their effects on landscape pattern to disclose the implications for land use planning and management.

AB Fire has often been shown to promote invasion by non-native plant species, but few studies have examined the process in temperate-zone deciduous forests. To examine the potential of prescribed fire to facilitate invasions in the Central Hardwoods ecosystem, we experimentally burned small plots and simulated aspects of fire at a forested site in southeastern Ohio, USA. Treatments included high and low burn intensity, lime addition, and litter removal to test hypotheses of population limitation by fire intensity, fire-caused nutrient release, and removal of leaf litter, respectively. Treatments were arranged in a randomized block design in two landscape positions (dry upland, moist lowland) and two canopy conditions (gap, no gap). The experimental sites were not significantly different from randomly chosen forest sites in any of 12 environmental variables. Seeds of two problematic non-native species (Microstegium vimineum and Rosa multiflora) were sown into plots following treatment to test the possibility of seed limitation. We recorded germination and height growth at three dates 1, 4, and 14 months following burning. Germination was promoted by litter removal and high- and low-intensity fire treatments in M. vimineum, and by high-intensity fire in R. multiflora. Seedling growth of both species was greatest following high-intensity fire under canopy gaps. Germination in the second year showed treatment effects similar to the first year indicating persistence of fire effects. Both species showed stronger recruitment in valleys and in canopy gaps, reflecting an interaction of fire and landscape position. We infer that prescribed burning and canopy-opening management practices have the potential to facilitate invasion of the study area by creating conditions promoting establishment and growth of at least two non-native species. The absence of these species in previous studies appears to be due to a lack of propagules rather than the unsuitability of forest sites for germination or growth. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and Aims Crown structure and above-ground biomass investment was studied in relation to light interception of trees and lianas growing in a 6-month-old regenerating forest.
   Methods The vertical distribution of total above-ground biomass, height, diameter, stem density, leaf angles and crown depth were measured for individual plants of three short-lived pioneers (SLPs), four long-lived pioneers (LLPs) and three lianas. Daily light interception per individual Phi(d) was calculated with a canopy model. The model was then used to estimate light interception per unit of leaf mass (Phi(leaf mass)), total above-ground mass (Phi(mass)) and crown structure efficiency (E-a, the ratio of absorbed vs. available light).
   Key Results The SLPs Trema and Ochroma intercepted higher amounts of light per unit leaf mass (Phi(leaf mass)) because they had shallower crowns, resulting in higher crown use efficiency (E-a) than the other species. These SLPs (but not Cecropia) were also taller and intercepted more light per unit leaf area (Phi(area)). LLPs and lianas had considerably higher amounts of leaf mass and area per unit above-ground mass (LMR and LAR, respectively) and thus attained (Phi(msas) values similar to the SLPs (Phi(mass) = Phi(area) x LAR). Lianas, which were mostly self-supporting, had light interception efficiencies similar to those of the trees.
   Conclusions These results show how, due to the trade-off between crown structure and biomass allocation, SLPs, and LLPs and lianas intercept similar amount of light per unit mass which may contribute to the ability of the latter two groups to persist.

AB The interrelationship between phenological events, climatic factors, periodicity of cambial activity and seasonal production of xylem was examined in Dillenia indica L. (Dilleniaceae) growing in sub-tropical wet forest of Meghalaya state, India. The reactivation of cambial activity was seen in the first week of May, 15 days after sprouting of new leaves and buds. The activity of cambium and xylem production gradually declined toward December and ceased from January to April end. There was correlation between leaf fall and cambial dormancy. It was evident from the correlation and regression analysis, the relationship between cambial activity, xylem production with climatic factors, the monthly mean minimum temperature plays an important role for the cambial activity and xylem production rather than influence by rainfall and relative humidity in D. indica L. The data were discussed in the light of cambial activity, xylem production and phenological events.

AB High African elephant stocking rates in nature reserves in southern Africa have been shown to have significant impacts on vegetation structure and diversity. However, the direct and indirect effects of elephants on fauna, particularly invertebrates, remain poorly known. The Maputaland Centre of Endemism, an area of southern Mozambique and northern KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, is undergoing rapid rates of habitat conversion. Sand Forest, the rarest vegetation type in the Centre, is threatened by human disturbance outside of protected areas and by elephant browsing pressure in Tembe Elephant Park, one of the few protected areas for Sand Forest. Here we examine the effects of elephant- and human-induced disturbance to Sand Forest on a functionally important component of invertebrate diversity, i.e. the dung beetle fauna. The dung beetle assemblage associated with elephant- disturbed Sand Forest was transitional between undisturbed Sand Forest and Mixed Woodland, whereas that associated with human disturbance was markedly different to either habitat type. Differences are attributed to a change in habitat structure under both disturbance types, as well as to changes in the quality and distribution of dung under human disturbance. Therefore, grazing impacts by elephant not only affect plant diversity, but also implement changes in invertebrate fauna. The maintenance of the integrity of the Sand Forest-Mixed Woodland matrix is considered critical for biodiversity conservation in the Maputaland Centre of Endemism. Management of elephant populations, as well as the protection of sufficient Sand Forest inside conservation areas must, therefore, necessarily form part of the conservation strategy for the Centre.

AB Analysis was performed of the richness and abundance of woody species, forbs, and annual grasses in the easily germinating soil seed bank (henceforth seed bank) in a mediterranean shrubland of central Chile. The effects of successional development after fire and by microsite type (underneath or outside shrubs) on the density of seeds in the soil, and the relationship of species abundance in the seed bank with its abundance in the aboveground vegetation was examined. A total of 64 plant species were recorded in the seed bank, of which 44 were annual or biannual. Eight species were woody and another eight were perennial herbs. Four could not be identified to species level. The highest richness of established herbaceous species was recorded in late spring, with 31 species. The regeneration of the herbaceous vegetation was driven by the annual production of seeds and by a reserve of short-lived propagules in the soil. Density of all germinating seeds was significantly higher during late spring and late summer. Density of grass seeds was greater during late spring, while that of all other species was greater during late summer. Annual grass seeds accumulated in higher proportion at exposed microsites rather than under woody canopy, and in young (< 5 years old) and intermediate-age patches (10-20 years old) rather than in mature vegetation (30-50 years old). The abundance of established woody and herb species was uncorrelated with that of the seed bank.

AB Plants often modify microsite conditions important for seedling establishment. In tropical moist forest, advance regeneration in the form of shade-suppressed seedlings is a major component of regrowth in new gaps. Tree seedlings may be filtered by the composition and structure of the forest understorey. In a lowland forest in Central Panama, we examined light availability, litter accumulation and the seedling community (abundance, diversity and composition) under and away from the canopies of a common subcanopy, clonal palm, Oenocarpus mapora, and tested whether seedling abundance varies as a function of changes in understorey light conditions and leaf litter depth. We found evidence that leaf litter was five times deeper and light availability 27% lower under O. mapora canopy than where it was absent. The probability of finding a seedling in plots under O. mapora canopies was 33% lower than in plots without the palm. Plots under O. mapora canopies also had 49% fewer species of seedlings and those seedlings came from significantly larger seeds than seedlings in plots not under the palm. Overall, seedling density was positively correlated with light availability and negatively correlated with leaf litter depth. A transplant experiment confirmed that for at least one large-seeded species of dicot, seedlings are negatively affected by the reduction in light availability and increase in leaf litter. Under O. mapora, seedlings of Gustavia superba (Lecythidaceae) had lower survivorship and biomass accumulation than away from the palm. Thus, site conditions produced by large, clonal, multi-layered palms such as O. mapora may reduce establishment of small-seeded and shad e-in tolerant species, potentially affecting species composition in the understorey seedling pool.

AB Four native tree species (Liquidambar styraciflua, Juglans pyriformis, Podocarpus matudae, and Carpinus caroliniana) were evaluated for their suitability in rehabilitating degraded areas of Mexican cloud forest. Plant survival and growth in height and diameter were determined in three mixed-experimental plantations with different land use histories; their performance was compared with two on-farm plantations started by landowners for forest restoration. Nearby forest fragments were controls for soil compaction. An experimental plantation with remnant trees had the highest plant survival (82%), height, basal diameter and relative growth rate. The plantation with the steepest slope had high plant survival (63%) and growth. The plantation characterized by dominance of grasses and compacted soils had the lowest survival (22%) and growth. On-farm plantations had good establishment of planted trees (5-10 species planted), and facilitated the recruitment of 9-11 woody species. Carpinus and Liquidambar appear to be suitable species for reforestation in all these areas. Podocarpus grew relatively slowly, although it performed well in two experimental sites. Juglans had high survival (76%) under the stressful conditions of the most adverse site, and therefore may be useful for rehabilitation of degraded sites. Differences among species and sites strongly suggest that species success depends on plantation site quality.

AB In order to determine the suitability of ants as indicator organisms for habitat disruption in tropical forests, we studied the effects of both high and low impact logging on ant communities in northeastern Para State, in the Brazilian Amazon. We collected ants from logged forests and unlogged forest sites with Winkler bags throughout the 1998 rainy season (January and April) and the following dry season (July and September). Both methods of timber harvesting showed impacts on ant community composition when compared with unlogged forest, although these impacts did not include modifications in total species richness or the relative contribution of each ant subfamily to the total number of species. Instead, logging induced alterations took place at the level of species and genera. A 2-fold reduction in the dominance of ants of the highly diverse genus Pheidole was associated with forest alterations in high-impact logging sites. Thus, logging in Amazonia can be seen to promote species shifts in ant communities, without, however, altering species richness. Ants of the genus Pheidole are potentially useful indicators for forest disturbances resulting from timber extraction.

AB Temporal and spatial distribution of the chiton Acanthopleura japonica and associated molluscs were recorded on a semi-exposed tropical rocky shore in Hong Kong over 24 months. Most molluscs showed a clear vertical distribution pattern which varied with season. Many mobile gastropods, e.g. Monodonta labio, Cellana toreuma, Nerita albicilla and Thais clavigera, were found lower on the shore in summer (June-September), presumably as a response to the hot, desiccating conditions, but extended their range during winter (December-March). Acanthopleura, was distributed throughout the eulittoral and did not show such strong seasonal patterns, possibly due to the ability to use spatial refuges (specifically crevices) as a result of its flexible body-plan. Chitons exposed on horizontal rocks lost more body water during periods of emersion as compared to those in vertical or crevice habitats and, in summer, all animals on horizontal surfaces died. It is suggested that A. japonica uses cracks and crevices, which are not available to hard-shelled molluscs, throughout the year to reduce the impact of heat and desiccation stress during periods of emersion. This ability may explain the slight seasonal changes seen in Acanthopleura as compared to other species, and the dominance of chitons as herbivores on tropical shores.

AB Coastlines have long been used as a principal example of a natural feature that exhibits fractal structure. With the advent of large digitized databases, it has become possible to examine in detail large regions of coast and to examine differences in complexity, as measured by the fractal dimension, among regions. In this study, we have determined the fractal dimension of the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines of the conterminous United States. The traditional divider method was used in obtaining the fractal dimension of each coastline arc from the NOAA Medium-Resolution Shoreline Data Set. On average, the Atlantic coast has much higher fractal dimension than the Pacific coast. The results also indicate that the complexity of the Atlantic coast increases toward low latitudes. These results have implications for the interpretation of species distributions and diversity patterns along the coast and for the understanding of the dynamics of biotic recovery from mass extinctions.

   PATTERNS
AB We conducted a study in the laurel forest of Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) to describe the characteristics of natural gaps and to assess the role of treefall gaps in forest dynamics. Very little is left of the natural laurel forest with i.a. Laurus azorica, Ilex canariensis and Prunus lusitanica. We looked for treefall gaps in 80 randomly located 2500 m(2) plots. These plots represented ca. 1 % of the remaining and protected laurel forest of Tenerife. We recorded the characteristics of the species causing the gaps, gap architecture and gap age in all observed gaps larger than 10 m(2). We inventoried the regeneration in each gap and in a neighbouring control plot with the same topography. Large gaps (> 75 m(2)) were not common in the laurel forest. The absence of large gaps could be due to the physiognomy of the vegetation, the mild weather or the rarity of disturbances. Instead of forming gaps, many trees decompose in place and branches from neighbouring trees and suckers from the decomposed trees occupy the free space. Also, the high rate of asexual regeneration could contribute to the fast closing of the gap.
   The number of gaps created by Prunus lusitanica was higher than expected (based on canopy composition) while Ilex canariensis and Laurus azorica created fewer gaps. In this evergreen forest, differences between gap and non-gap conditions are not as distinct as in other forest types. Only 0.4 % of the canopy is in the gap phase (0.6 % including gaps smaller than 10 m(2)). No differences were found in patterns of regeneration between gap and non-gap phases in the forest. Gaps do not explain the persistence of pioneer species in the laurel forest.

AB Since the exotic Eurasian milfoil Myriophyllum spicatum (L.) was first reported in the Lake Pontchartrain estuary in 1978, it has become established as a dominant species of submerged macrophyte, but its distribution and abundance have varied considerably. We compared fish assemblages among two native macrophytes, Vallisneria americana (Michx) and Ruppia maritima (L.), the exotic M. spicatum, and unvegetated substratum to determine if milfoil influenced assemblage structure and microhabitat use by common littoral fishes. We used a modified Wegener ring to quantitatively assess fish densities. In monthly sampling from March 1991 to January 1993, we collected 3564 fishes of 29 species, but four dominant species, rainwater killifish Lucania parva (Baird), naked goby Gobiosoma bose (Lacepede), gulf pipefish Syngnathus scovelli (Evermann and Kendall), and clown goby Microgobius gulosus (Girard) accounted for over 87% of the fishes. Community diversity was highest in V. americana, intermediate in unvegetated areas, and lowest in R. maritima and M. spicatum. The patterns for evenness and richness differed from that of diversity among the four habitat types. Analyses of percent similarity and rank correlation of community structure showed no significant differences between M. spicatum and native macrophytes. The common fishes were significantly more abundant in vegetated areas than on adjacent unvegetated substratum, and total abundances were higher in M. spicatum and R. maritima than in V. americana. Only three fishes showed significant differences among macrophyte species: rainwater killifish and clown goby were more abundant in M. spicatum and R. maritima, and bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli (Valenciennes) was more abundant in M. spicatum than in V. americana. Additionally, fish abundances were related to environmental variables in a factor analysis that resolved nine variables into four axes, characterized in order of importance as: a large-scale spatial (salinity) axis, a seasonal axis, a turbidity axis, and a plant surface area axis. The different patterns of fish species in environmental space revealed spatial and temporal differences in resource utilization. The exotic macrophyte M. spicatum may not have had a detectable influence on fish assemblages or abundances relative to the native macrophytes because high wave energy in the open system may prevent it from growing densely enough to strongly alter microhabitat characteristics.

AB The diet of the mulgara, Dasycercus cristicauda, from the Simpson Desert in Queensland, was analysed using seats collected between 1990 and 1995. Insects, arachnids and rodents were the main classes of prey of D. cristicauda, but reptiles, centipedes and small marsupials were also consumed. Insects represented 92% by percentage frequency of occurrence in seats, while rodents represented 33% by percentage frequency. Invertebrate prey greater than or equal to 6 mm in length and vertebrate prey occurred frequently in seats, but small prey (1-5 mm), when present, occurred in large numbers. D. cristicauda ate more individual prey items in spring and winter than in autumn, and more large-sized prey in spring than in autumn. In autumn, D. cristicauda consumed mostly insects (100% by frequency) and few rodents (8%), but in winter and spring, switched to rodents (38% and 47% respectively) and insects (88% and 93% respectively). Seasonal shifts in diet may reflect changes in the availability of different groups of prey, or changes in prey selectivity by D. cristicauda in response to costs imposed by seasonal reproduction. The dietary flexibility of D. cristicauda may allow individuals to occupy stable ranges, and has perhaps also promoted the persistence of the species in arid areas that have been subjected to changes in land use since European settlement.

AB Acclimation potential of seedlings of six non-pioneer, North Queensland rainforest tree species (Diploglottis diphyllostegia, Flindersia brayleyana, Dysoxylum schiffneri, Prunus turnerana, Neisosperma poweri and Castanospora alphandii) were evaluated in three different light regimes. The seedlings were grown from seeds and raised in 37, 10 and 2.5% photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of full sunlight in a shade house. Plants were harvested at 1, 4, and 15 months after germination. At 4 months, for each species, one-third of the seedlings in each light environment were transferred to each of the two other light environments. The remaining one-third stayed in the same light environment and formed the control. The control seedlings of all species showed a marked response to increasing PAR: relative growth rate (RGR) and total biomass were low in the 2.5% PAR level, increased in the 10% PAR level and were maximal in the 37% PAR level, except for Neisosperma. The seedlings in the 2.5% PAR level showed a typical shade plant morphology with a high leaf area ratio, low root-shoot ratio and low specific leaf weight. For seedlings of Dysoxylum and Prunus, a change in light regime from 37% PAR to 2.5% PAR resulted in negative relative growth rates. Eleven months after transfer, many growth characteristics still showed significant initial X final light environment interactions, an indication of incomplete adjustment. Acclimation to increasing light availability was faster than acclimation to decreasing light availability. On the basis of biomass allocation patterns (root-shoot ratio, leaf area ratio and specific leaf weight), the six species could not be differentiated under the three light regimes and their dynamics. However, using RGR as a relative measure of carbon economy, it was possible to differentiate the species in their acclimation ability to decreased but not to increased irradiance. It was concluded that, for non-pioneer species, acclimation potential may be more related to physiological than to morphological plasticity.

AB Global warming, extreme climate events, earthquakes and their accompanying socioeconomic disasters pose significant risks to humanity. Yet due to the nonlinear feedbacks, multiple interactions and complex structures of the Earth system, the understanding and, in particular, the prediction of such disruptive events represent formidable challenges to both scientific and policy communities. During the past years, the emergence and evolution of Earth system science has attracted much attention and produced new concepts and frameworks. Especially, novel statistical physics and complex networks based techniques have been developed and implemented to substantially advance our knowledge of the Earth system, including climate extreme events, earthquakes and geological relief features, leading to substantially improved predictive performances. We present here a comprehensive review on the recent scientific progress in the development and application of how combined statistical physics and complex systems science approaches such as critical phenomena, network theory, percolation, tipping points analysis, and entropy can be applied to complex Earth systems. Notably, these integrating tools and approaches provide new insights and perspectives for understanding the dynamics of the Earth systems. The overall aim of this review is to offer readers the knowledge on how statistical physics concepts and theories can be useful in the field of Earth system science. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

AB Ants play a fundamental role in coffee pest control. Despite this, there is a lack of understanding about how landscape configuration and composition regulate the ecosystem service provided by ants in sun coffee farms within highly fragmented landscapes. We measured whether landscape structure influences ants' ability to regulate coffee berry borer (CBB) in sun coffee farms in Southeastern Brazil. Considering the ecological interactions between ants and CBB at three different stages of pest control (reduction of CBB presence, CBB infestation, and CBB bean damage), we measured pest control among 10 landscapes that represented a gradual difference in forest and coffee cover. We manipulated ants through exclusion experiments and tested whether interactions between ants and different landscape structure metrics (distance to forest fragments, 2-km-level forest cover, and 300-m-level forest and coffee cover) influenced pest control. The presence of ants reduced CBB presence and CBB damage by up to 40%. We show how pest control service indicators change depending on the landscape level. The probability of CBB presence increased with expanding coffee and forest cover at the 300-m-level but decreased at the 2-km-level. CBB infestation reduced further after 25 m from forest edges, suggesting ants that provide these ecosystem services are adapted to matrix conditions in sun coffee farms. Ants reduced CBB presence, CBB infestation, and CBB damage in landscapes with at least 40% 2-km-level forest cover. Beyond this threshold, there is a turning point for ecological processes involved in pest control. Synthesis and applications. This is the first long-term branch-level exclusion experiment to present strong evidence of ants as efficient providers of pest control in sun coffee farms. We show how landscape structure modulates key ecological processes involved in three different ant-CBB interactions that regulate CBB populations. Forest cover measured at different landscape levels yielded different results for CBB presence, emphasizing the importance of multi-scale studies for landscape management. Considering surrounding forest cover and crop proximity to forest fragments in planning the spatial arrangement of coffee farms can thus both improve pest control as well as contribute to biodiversity conservation.

AB African tropical forests are generally considered less diverse than their Neotropical and Asian counterparts. By contrast, the Detarioideae is much more diverse in Africa than in South America and Asia. To better understand the evolution of this contrasting diversity pattern, we investigated the biogeographical and ecological origin of this subfamily, testing whether they originated in dry biomes surrounding the Tethys Seaway as currently hypothesized for many groups of Leguminosae.
   We constructed the largest time-calibrated phylogeny for the subfamily to date, reconstructed ancestral states for geography and biome/habitat, estimated diversification and extinction rates, and evaluated biome/habitat and geographic shifts in Detarioideae.
   The ancestral habitat of Detarioideae is postulated to be a primary forest (terra firme) originated in Africa-South America, in the early Palaeocene, after which several biome/habitat and geographic shifts occurred.
   The origin of Detarioideae is older than previous estimates, which postulated a dry (succulent) biome origin according to the Tethys Seaway hypothesis, and instead we reveal a post Gondwana and terra firme origin for this early branching clade of legumes. Detarioideae include some of the most dominant trees in evergreen forests and have likely played a pivotal role in shaping continental African forest diversity.

AB Higher interannual precipitation variability is predicted for Southern California's shrub-dominated systems, promoting soil moisture variation and changing community composition. We asked if soil microbial responses to rainfall regime will depend on litter inputs; showing direct effects of altered precipitation through soil moisture and indirect effects resulting from shifting litter inputs.
   Soils were collected from a 2-year field rainfall manipulation experiment. Under lab conditions soils were subjected to high or low moisture pulses with litter amendments from native and exotic species in all combinations.
   Soil respiration was higher with larger water pulses, but rose over time in low pulse treatments (direct response). Litter additions from exotic species promoted greater respiration, and results were stronger under higher soil moisture (indirect response). Extracellular enzyme activities generally were higher with exotic litter and under high moisture pulses. Those involved in N-cycling had much larger increases activity for the exotic litter addition - high moisture pulse scenarios compared to other treatments.
   Our results indicate the potential for microbial acclimation to drought conditions over short timescales and that below-ground processes are sensitive to direct and indirect effects of shifting rainfall regimes, especially where invasion is promoted by future climate change.

AB Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) is a powerful economic tool that gives positive conditional incentives for the provision of additional ecosystem services over the status quo, which has been used widely in terrestrial conservation. Interest in the concept of marine PES has recently emerged, but the fluid, transboundary and often common pool nature of marine ecosystems presents challenges for PES design and implementation. Here, we consider the potential role of PES in addressing current gaps in fisheries management. Used in combination with conventional regulatory approaches, PES may increase private sector engagement and generate more sustainable financing for fisheries management whilst spreading accountability throughout the supply chain. The approach is most likely to be feasible and effective in commercially valuable fisheries with: (i) demand for one or more ecosystem service and a threat to supply; (ii) suitable baseline data available and potential management actions underpinned by robust science; (iii) clarity and security of property rights; (iv) capacity for hybrid multi-level governance; (v) capacity for rigorous monitoring, control and surveillance; and (vi) potential for financial sustainability of the scheme. An examination of four contrasting fisheries - Namibian hake, Mozambican shallow-water shrimp, Western and Central Pacific skipjack tuna and Bangladesh hilsa - demonstrates that a developing world fishery will rarely fulfil each of these preconditions a priori, but that the potential for successful application of PES still exists. In practice, PES design will depend on the institutional context and require creative and innovative approaches to the maintenance of conditionality and additionality.

AB Subtropical forests across south China have been extensively affected by anthropogenic disturbances with potential profound effects on plant biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF). However, whether and to what degree biodiversity influences biomass of subtropical forests remains uncertain. In this study, we analyzed the effects of tree biodiversity (species diversity, functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity) on stand biomass at three stages (early, mid and late) of succession in subtropical forests. As forest succession progressed, we found that the changes in species diversity were different compared with those of functional and phylogenetic diversity. Most of the indices of species and functional and phylogenetic diversity were not significantly correlated with stand biomass at two spatial grains (plot sizes of 10 m x 10 m and 20 m x 30 m). However, when other abiotic and biotic factors (i.e., altitude, canopy light, stem density and forest phase) were included with diversity indices in mixed models to explain biomass, the effect of functional diversity on biomass was significant at both resolution. For species diversity indices, the effect was significant at the 20 m x 30 m resolution, and phylogenetic diversity had no significant effect. Our results indicate that biodiversity affects forest biomass during the succession of a subtropical forest and suggest that functional diversity may provide a better metric than species or phylogenetic diversity for determining the biodiversity effect on biomass. Moreover, our results indicate that the diverse conclusions reached in other BEF analyses might be explained by differences in the plot size examined and the diversity metrics selected. Because the bivariate relationship between biodiversity and biomass can be strongly confounded by covarying abiotic and biotic factors, we suggest that the effects of abiotic factors, succession stage, and management practices on BEF should be carefully considered in future research.

AB One of the ongoing debates around metacommunity ecology is to what extent stochastic and deterministic processes act on community assembly. We explored the influence of both determinism, mediated by environmental filters, and stochasticity, mediated by dispersal and ecological drift, on phytoplankton assembly in a floodplain river. A probabilistic co-occurrence model revealed the presence of 94.1% random and 5.9% non-random species pairwise associations. The latter were higher at both hydrologically isolated (4.42%) and connected environments (2.2%). Variation partitioning analysis showed similar significant explanations by the unique environmental (7.7%, Secchi, conductivity, vegetation, phosphorous) and spatial (7.2%, watercourse distance, longitude) components. Temporal variability was poorly represented (2.4%) because we only considered two low-water periods. Species co-occurrence patterns showed that most taxa coexist randomly. The environmental explanation is in line with niche-assembly models (species sorting), but the similar proportion explained by spatial organisation related to random dispersal guides the evidence to both deterministic and stochastic processes. The higher percentage of random co-occurrence and the larger assemblage variability observed in isolated environments suggests that random dispersal, ecological drift, and priority effects could promote stochasticity. We concluded that both processes affect the structure of phytoplankton metacommunities in a floodplain system and suggest the preponderance of stochastic organisation.

AB There has been an explosion of research on host-associated microbial communities (i.e., microbiomes). Much of this research has focused on surveys of microbial diversities across a variety of host species, including humans, with a view to understanding how these microbiomes are distributed across space and time, and how they correlate with host health, disease, phenotype, physiology and ecology. Fewer studies have focused on how these microbiomes may have evolved. In this paper, we develop an agent-based framework to study the dynamics of microbiome evolution. Our framework incorporates neutral models of how hosts acquire their microbiomes, and how the environmental microbial community that is available to the hosts is assembled. Most importantly, our framework also incorporates a Wright-Fisher genealogical model of hosts, so that the dynamics of microbiome evolution is studied on an evolutionary timescale. Our results indicate that the extent of parental contribution to microbial availability from one generation to the next significantly impacts the diversity of microbiomes: the greater the parental contribution, the less diverse the microbiomes. In contrast, even when there is only a very small contribution from a constant environmental pool, microbial communities can remain highly diverse. Finally, we show that our models may be used to construct hypotheses about the types of processes that operate to assemble microbiomes over evolutionary time.

AB The south-eastern Amazon rainforest is subject to ongoing deforestation and is expected to become drier due to climate change. Recent analyses of the distribution of tree cover in the tropics show three modes that have been interpreted as representing alternative stable states: forest, savanna and treeless states. This situation implies that a change in environmental conditions, such as in the climate, could cause critical transitions from a forest towards a savanna ecosystem. Shifts to savanna might also occur if perturbations such as deforestation exceed a critical threshold. Recovering the forest would be difficult as the savanna will be stabilized by a feedback between tree cover and fire. Here we explore how environmental changes and perturbations affect the forest by using a simple model with alternative tree-cover states. We focus on the synergistic effects of precipitation reduction and deforestation on the probability of regime shifts in the south-eastern Amazon rainforest. The analysis indicated that in a large part of the south-eastern Amazon basin rainforest and savanna could be two alternative states, although massive forest dieback caused by mean-precipitation reduction alone is unlikely. However, combinations of deforestation and climate change triggered up to 6.6 times as many local regime shifts than the two did separately, causing large permanent forest losses in the studied region. The results emphasize the importance of reducing deforestation rates in order to prevent a climate-induced dieback of the south-eastern Amazon rainforest. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We estimate the effects on deforestation that have resulted from policy interactions between parks and payments and between park buffers and payments in Costa Rica between 2000 and 2005. We show that the characteristics of the areas where protected and unprotected lands are located differ significantly. Additionally, we find that land characteristics of each of the policies and of the places where they interact also differ significantly. To adequately estimate the effects of the policies and their interactions, we use matching methods. Matching is implemented not only to define adequate control groups, as in previous research, but also to define those groups of locations under the influence of policies that are comparable to each other. We find that it is more effective to locate parks and payments away from each other, rather than in the same location or near each other. The high levels of enforcement inside both parks and lands with payments, and the presence of conservation spillovers that reduce deforestation near parks, significantly reduce the potential impact of combining these two policies.

AB Rapid biological changes are expected to occur on tropical elevational gradients as species migrate upslope or go extinct in the face of global warming. We established a series of 9 1-ha plots in old-growth tropical rainforest in Costa Rica along a 2700 m relief elevational gradient to carry out long-term monitoring of tropical rain forest structure, dynamics and tree growth. Within each plot we mapped, identified, and annually measured diameter for all woody individuals with stem diameters >10 cm for periods of 3-10 years. Wood species diversity peaked at 400-600 m and decreased substantially at higher elevations. Basal area and stem number varied by less than two-fold, with the exception of the 2800 m cloud forest summit, where basal area and stem number were approximately double that of lower sites. Canopy gaps extending to the forest floor accounted for <3% of microsites at all elevations. Height of highest crowns and the coefficient of variation of crown height both decreased with increasing elevation. Rates of turnover of individuals and of stand basal area decreased with elevation, but rates of diameter growth and stand basal area showed no simple relation to elevation. We discuss issues encountered in the design and implementation of this network of plots, including biased sampling, missing key meteorological and biomass data, and strategies for improving species-level research. Taking full advantage of the major research potential of tropical forest elevational transects will require sustaining and extending ground based studies, incorporation of new remotely-sensed data and data-acquisition platforms, and new funding models to support decadal research on these rapidly-changing systems.

AB Tropical canopies are known for their high abundance and diversity of ants. However, the factors which enable coexistence of so many species in trees, and in particular, the role of foragers in determining local diversity, are not well understood. We censused nesting and foraging arboreal ant communities in two 0.32 ha plots of primary and secondary lowland rainforest in New Guinea and explored their species diversity and composition. Null models were used to test if the records of species foraging (but not nesting) in a tree were dependent on the spatial distribution of nests in surrounding trees. In total, 102 ant species from 389 trees occurred in the primary plot compared with only 50 species from 295 trees in the secondary forest plot. However, there was only a small difference in mean ant richness per tree between primary and secondary forest (3.8 and 3.3 sp. respectively) and considerably lower richness per tree was found only when nests were considered (1.5 sp. in both forests). About half of foraging individuals collected in a tree belonged to species which were not nesting in that tree. Null models showed that the ants foraging but not nesting in a tree are more likely to nest in nearby trees than would be expected at random. The effects of both forest stage and tree size traits were similar regardless of whether only foragers, only nests, or both datasets combined were considered. However, relative abundance distributions of species differed between foraging and nesting communities. The primary forest plot was dominated by native ant species, whereas invasive species were common in secondary forest. This study demonstrates the high contribution of foragers to arboreal ant diversity, indicating an important role of connectivity between trees, and also highlights the importance of primary vegetation for the conservation of native ant communities.

AB A life-history trade-off between low mortality in the dark and rapid growth in the light is one of the most widely accepted mechanisms underlying plant ecological strategies in tropical forests. Differences in plant functional traits are thought to underlie these distinct ecological strategies; however, very few studies have shown relationships between functional traits and demographic rates within a functional group. We present 8years of growth and mortality data from saplings of 15 species of Dipterocarpaceae planted into logged-over forest in Malaysian Borneo, and the relationships between these demographic rates and four key functional traits: wood density, specific leaf area (SLA), seed mass, and leaf C:N ratio. Species-specific differences in growth rates were separated from seedling size effects by fitting nonlinear mixed-effects models, to repeated measurements taken on individuals at multiple time points. Mortality data were analyzed using binary logistic regressions in a mixed-effects models framework. Growth increased and mortality decreased with increasing light availability. Species differed in both their growth and mortality rates, yet there was little evidence for a statistical interaction between species and light for either response. There was a positive relationship between growth rate and the predicted probability of mortality regardless of light environment, suggesting that this relationship may be driven by a general trade-off between traits that maximize growth and traits that minimize mortality, rather than through differential species responses to light. Our results indicate that wood density is an important trait that indicates both the ability of species to grow and resistance to mortality, but no other trait was correlated with either growth or mortality. Therefore, the growth mortality trade-off among species of dipterocarp appears to be general in being independent of species crossovers in performance in different light environments.

AB Deforestation has led to ecosystem degradation in many tropical regions. Re-establishment of native tree species on degraded land presents challenges due to environmental stressors such as water and nutrient limitations, particularly from weed competition. Ecophysiological studies can help assess responses of native tree species to silvicultural practices and improve our understanding of processes that influence their establishment and growth. Silvicultural treatments borrowed from commercial tree plantations such as greater nutrient applications and complete weed control can improve best silvicultural practices in forest restoration. Two contrasting silvicultural treatments, "traditional" based on common management practices for reforestation of native trees and "intensive" based on commercial plantation silviculture, were evaluated based on tree mortality, biomass, photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, soluble proteins, and nutritional status of 20 native Brazilian species, 2.5 years after planting. Intensive silviculture increased tree survival by 20%, showed higher aboveground biomass from 13% to 7-fold and increased photosynthesis of similar to 20% from 15.8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) to 18.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), compared to traditional silviculture. Total soluble proteins were 14% higher with 6.7 mu g cm(-2) in intensive silviculture compared to 5.9 mu g cm(-2) under traditional silviculture. Eighty percent of trees showed greater N content, with a 13% higher average than under traditional silviculture (2.60 g m(-2) versus 2.92 g m(-2)). Average values of chlorophyll A, B, and total were similar to 8% higher under intensive silviculture, but not significantly different between treatments. Overall, intensive silviculture provided a positive impact on the restoration plantation. During the initial years of plantation establishment, intensive silviculture methods were effective in leading to significant increases in growth and survival. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Tropical soils are often characterised by low phosphorus availability and tropical forest trees typically exhibit lower area-based rates of photosynthesis (A(a)) for a given area-based leaf nitrogen concentration ([N](a)) compared with plants growing in higher-latitude, N-limited ecosystems. Nevertheless, to date, very few studies have assessed the effects of P deprivation per se on A(a)[N](a) relationships in tropical trees. Our study investigated the effect of reduced soil P availability on light-saturated A(a) and related leaf traits of seven Australian tropical tree species. We addressed the following questions: (1) Do contrasting species exhibit inherent differences in nutrient partitioning and morphology? (2) Does P deprivation lead to a change in the nature of the A(a)[N](a) relationship? (3) Does P deprivation lead to an alteration in leaf nitrogen levels or N allocation within the leaf? Applying a mixed effects model, we found that for these Australian tropical tree species, removal of P from the nutrient solution decreased area-based photosynthetic capacity (A(max,a)) by 18% and reduced the slope of the A(max,a)[N](a) relationship and differences among species accounted for around 30% of response variation. Despite greater N allocation to chlorophyll, photosynthetic N use efficiency was significantly reduced in low-P plants. Collectively, our results support the view that low soil P availability can alter photosynthesis-nitrogen relationships in tropical trees.

AB Recent efforts to understand global patterns of ant diversity have largely neglected the canopy which harbours a diverse ant fauna, particularly in tropical lowland forests. We comprehensively sampled ant diversity and abundance by canopy-fogging in South-East Asian lowland rain forests (99 trees fogged, 151,396 ant individuals, 328 morphotypes) and in Central European temperate forests (375 trees fogged, 9,232 ant individuals, 12 species). We found large differences in taxonomic composition, diversity, and overall abundance of the canopy ant communities in both biomes. Our data suggest that in the tropics approximately 50% of all ant species are at least partially associated with the canopy. Taxonomic work on selected groups of ants suggests that a substantial proportion of these species are new to science. Due to high habitat specificity canopy ants previously were out of reach for ant collectors and have thus largely remained unrecorded. Canopy ants therefore have been neglected in ecosystem analyses or global diversity modelling. In contrast, in temperate forests only 12% of the species are known to be arboreal and ants rarely achieve dominance in the canopy. The large difference in abundance and species numbers in the canopy of temperate and tropical forests suggests major differences in the ecological and functional impact of canopy ants.

AB Many habitat patches in tropical landscapes have become less suitable for wildlife due to an increase in anthropogenic disturbances. An index of habitat suitability based on the ecological factors that collectively determine the suitability of an organism's habitat is important for conservation planning. However, a widely accepted and comprehensive multi-criteria habitat suitability index for umbrella species is still lacking, particularly in areas where information related to the biology and ecology of the species of interest is not available. Therefore we develop preliminary habitat maps and measure the degree of habitat suitability for large mammals, focusing on four umbrella species in the State of Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia: Panthera tigris jacksoni (Malayan tiger), Tapirus indicus (Malayan tapir), Helarctos malayanus malayanus (Malayan sun bear), and Rusa unicolor cambojensis (sambar deer). The former two are endangered and the latter two are vulnerable according to the IUCN Red List. The suitability of habitat patches for each species was measured across the entire study area as well as in nine wildlife protected areas by integrating GIS data and expert opinion. Expert opinions were used as the source of information regarding the stresses faced by the species because there was insufficient information available from ground surveys.
   We developed an index and maps of habitat suitability for each species, which were then integrated to represent a combined index (ranging from 0 to 27) and spatially explicit maps of the area's habitat suitability for large mammals. The average large mammal habitat suitability index value of the State of Selangor (9) indicates that many habitat patches have become unsuitable for such species. Of the nine wildlife protected areas, Fraser's Hill (22), Sungai Dusun (22), and Bukit Kutu (21) are very suitable; Klang Gate (20) and Templers Park (17) are suitable; and the remaining four are unsuitable for large mammals. We assume that this preliminary habitat suitability index and mapping are useful for conservation planning of wildlife habitats at both landscape and regional scales, as well as providing an initial foundation for revision by future research with significant new information.

TI It's Not Just Conflict That Motivates Killing of Orangutans
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PRIMATES; FORESTS; CONSERVATION; WILDLIFE; SUMATRA
AB We investigated why orangutans are being killed in Kalimantan, Indonesia, and the role of conflict in these killings. Based on an analysis of interview data from over 5,000 respondents in over 450 villages, we also assessed the socio-ecological factors associated with conflict and non-conflict killings. Most respondents never kill orangutans. Those who reported having personally killed an orangutan primarily did so for non-conflict reasons; for example, 56% of these respondents said that the reason they had killed an orangutan was to eat it. Of the conflict-related reasons for killing, the most common reasons orangutans were killed was fear of orangutans or in self-defence. A similar pattern was evident among reports of orangutan killing by other people in the villages. Regression analyses indicated that religion and the percentage of intact forest around villages were the strongest socio-ecological predictors of whether orangutans were killed for conflict or non-conflict related reasons. Our data indicate that between 44,170 and 66,570 orangutans were killed in Kalimantan within the respondents' active hunting lifetimes: between 12,690 and 29,024 for conflict reasons (95% CI) and between 26,361 and 41,688 for non-conflict reasons (95% CI). These findings confirm that habitat protection alone will not ensure the survival of orangutans in Indonesian Borneo, and that effective reduction of orangutan killings is urgently needed.

AB Tropical lowland forests are characterized by humid climate conditions with interannual variations in amount of precipitation, length of dry season, and relative humidity. The African tree species, Terminalia superba Engl. & Diels has a large distribution area and potentially incorporates these variations in its tree rings. Tree ring analysis was performed on 60 plantation trees (increment cores) and 41 natural trees (stem disks) from Ivory Coast and the Congolese Mayombe Forest. Natural forests and old plantations (50-55 years) showed similar growth patterns. Regional chronologies were developed for the two sample regions and showed a long-distance relationship for the period 1959-2008. Growth in the Mayombe was associated with early rainy season precipitation, but no relation was found between tree growth and precipitation in Ivory Coast. Congolese trees possibly show a higher climate-sensitivity than Ivorian trees, because precipitation in the Mayombe is more limiting, and Congolese T. superba trees are found closer to the margins of their distribution. Likewise, tree growth in the Mayombe was also influenced by the SSTs of the Gulf of Guinea and the South Atlantic Ocean during the early rainy season. However, tree growth was influenced by ENSO in both regions. In the Mayombe, La Nia years were associated with stronger tree growth whereas in Ivory Coast, El Nio years corresponded with stronger tree growth. The presented relation between ENSO, precipitation and tree growth is original for equatorial African forests, suggesting an influence of global climate variability on tree growth.

AB Boswellia papyrifera (Burseraceae) trees grow in dry woodlands south of the Sahara and produce frankincense, the economically important olio-gum resin used for cultural and religious ceremonies throughout the world and as raw material in several industries. Across its distribution area, this species is threatened by farmland expansion, fire, improper tapping and overgrazing. Most of its populations lack saplings and small-sized trees (e.g. <10 cm). It is unknown whether the older, adult trees represent a single or several cohorts, representing single or plural regeneration and survival waves. To understand such long-term population dynamics, it is imperative to evaluate the age structure of the current populations. We used tree ring analysis to determine the age-diameter relationship. This study, (1) determines radial growth dynamics and age-diameter relationship of B. papyrifera, including verification of annual growth-ring formation, and (2) constructs the population age structure and discusses consequences thereof for population maintenance and long-term frankincense production. We could prove that B. papyrifera forms annual growth rings. The average radial annual growth rate of B. papyrifera is 1.15 mm (s.d. = 0.22) and varies significantly among the sampled trees. Age and diameter of B. papyrifera trees are significantly correlated. From the population-age structure, it becomes obvious that the current B. papyrifera populations lack successful recruitment since 1955, which we attribute to intensive grazing and fire associated with the escalating increase of human settlement in the area. Lack of recruitment leads to rapidly declining populations resulting in strongly reduced frankincense production. Management aimed at seedling survival and sustainable use of relic trees is urgent.

AB In natural environments, predation risk varies over time. The risk allocation hypothesis predicts that prey is expected to adjust key anti-predator behaviours such as vigilance to temporal variation in risk. We tested the predictions of the risk allocation hypothesis in a natural environment where both a species-rich natural predator community and human hunters are abundant and where the differences in seasonal and circadian activity between natural and anthropogenic predators provided a unique opportunity to quantify the contributions of different predator classes to anti-predator behaviour. Whereas natural predators were expected to show similar levels of activity throughout the seasons, hunter activity was high during the daytime during a clearly defined hunting season. According to the risk allocation hypothesis, vigilance should then be higher during the hunting season and during daytime hours than during the non-hunting season and night-time hours. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) on the edge of Biaowiea Primeval Forest in Eastern Poland displayed vigilance behaviour consistent with these predictions. The behavioural response of roe deer to temporarily varying predation risks emphasises the behavioural plasticity of this species and suggests that future studies of anti-predator behaviour need to incorporate circadian variation in predation pressure as well as risk gradients of both natural and anthropogenic predators.

AB Previous studies have shown that collective property rights offer higher flexibility than individual property and improve sustainable community-based forest management. Our case study, carried out in the Beni department of Bolivia, does not contradict this assertion, but shows that collective rights have been granted in areas where ecological contexts and market facilities were less favourable to intensive land use. Previous experiences suggest investigating political processes in order to understand the criteria according to which access rights were distributed. Based on remote sensing and on a multi-level land governance framework, our research confirms that land placed under collective rights, compared to individual property, is less affected by deforestation among Andean settlements. However, analysis of the historical process of land distribution in the area shows that the distribution of property rights is the result of a political process based on economic, spatial, and environmental strategies that are defined by multiple stakeholders. Collective titles were established in the more remote areas and distributed to communities with lower productive potentialities. Land rights are thus a secondary factor of forest cover change which results from diverse political compromises based on population distribution, accessibility, environmental perceptions, and expected production or extraction incomes.

AB Direct payments for the protection of biodiversity (a type of payment for environmental services) have been proposed as an effective tool for delivering conservation outcomes, in a way that also delivers development benefits to local people. Using an impact evaluation framework, this paper analyses the effectiveness of a direct payment program that was established for nine globally threatened bird species in the Northern Plains of Cambodia. The program provided conditional payments to local people to protect nests, since most of the species were highly threatened by the collection of eggs and chicks. Since the program's inception in 2003 it has protected >2700 nests over >2000 km(2) of habitat at a cost of $30,000 annually, with 71-78% of the costs paid directly to local people. Payments significantly improved the success rates of protected nests in comparison with control sites, leading to population increases for at least three species. However, payments did not influence other threats to species, such as land clearance, and have failed to arrest declines in at least one species' population. The average payment per protector was a significant contribution to incomes in remote rural villages. However, the program only benefited a small proportion of people, causing some local jealousies and deliberate disturbance of nesting birds. The program demonstrates that direct payments can be a highly effective conservation tool in those cases where payments correctly target the cause of biodiversity loss. The results also suggest that it is important to consider how decisions over beneficiaries are made, especially in situations where property rights over biodiversity are unclear, if payments are to be socially acceptable. This has important implications for the design of payment schemes in conservation more generally. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Variations of tree species composition and community structure and their relationship with environmental variables are described for five sites of the Atlantic rain forest in Picinguaba, southeastern Brazil, distributed along an elevation gradient sampled by plots located at the altitudes of 2, 100, 300, 600 and 1000 m a.s.l. Sampled trees with DBH >= 5 cm were identified to species level and their diameter and height were measured. Environmental variables obtained for each plot included 11 topsoil variables and altitude. The residuals of all linear models were tested for spatial structure and multivariate analyses were performed to seek for relationships between the overall species' abundances and selected environmental variables. Although both forest physiognomy and species' abundances did change with altitude, this was clearly sharp only from the coastal plain (2 m) to 100 m, and from 600 m to the summit (1000 m). The three mid-slope sites (100, 300 and 600m) were rather undifferentiated, though they were richer in species and had taller canopy trees. The altitude and the edaphic variables silt, clay, pH and total exchangeable bases (TEB) presented significant correlations with the variations in species' abundances, while only pH and TEB were significantly correlated with species richness. The present study demonstrates for the first time that the composition and structure of Atlantic Forest can change accompanying the soil and altitude variations over short distances.

AB We evaluated the effects of different land-use systems on the ability of dung beetles to control the population of detritus-feeding flies. We tested the hypotheses that intensification of land use will reduce dung beetles richness, abundance and biomass and, consequently, their dung burial ability, affecting the interaction between dung beetles and flies and reducing its effectiveness as a natural biological control. In the Brazilian Amazon we sampled dung beetles, fly larvae and adults; and recorded the rate of dung removal by dung beetles across a gradient of land-use intensity from primary forest, secondary forest, agroforestry, agriculture to pasture. Our results provide evidence that land-use intensification results in a reduction of the richness, abundance and biomass of dung beetles, and this in turn results in lower rates of dung removal in the most simplified systems. We found no significant differences in the abundance of fly larvae between the different systems of land use. However, the number of adult flies differed significantly between land-use systems, presenting higher abundance in those sites with greater intensity of use (pasture and agriculture) and a lower abundance of adult flies in forested systems (primary and secondary forests, and agroforestry). Information-theoretic model selection based on AICc revealed strong support for the influence of land-use systems, dung removal rates and dung beetle abundance, biomass and richness on adult dung-fly abundance. Our results also reveal that dung beetles are not solely responsible for fly control and that other factors linked to land use are influencing the populations of these detritus-feeding insects.

ID NEUTRAL THEORY; DIVERSITY; COMPETITION; SIMILARITY; MODEL
AB It has been suggested that both niche-based and neutral mechanisms are important for biological communities to evolve and persist. For communities in extreme and isolated environments such as caves, theoretical and empirical considerations (low species turnover, high stress, strong convergence owing to strong directional selection) predict neutral mechanisms and functional equivalence of species. We tested this prediction using subterranean amphipod communities from caves and interstitial groundwater. Contrary to expectations, functional morphological diversity within communities in both habitats turned out to be significantly higher than the null model of randomly assembled communities. This suggests that even the most extreme, energy-poor environments still maintain the potential for diversification via differentiation of niches.

AB Pulses of metabolic activity are a common ecological response to intermittently available resources, and in soils these pulses often occur in response to wetting. To better understand variation in soil pulses, we conducted a distributed field experiment at seven sites along a 2200-m elevation transect in southern California, USA. Treatments included both water and water + substrate additions and two measurements of soil respiration within one hour. These experiments were repeated 11 times throughout 2009-2010. Additions of substrate led to consistently higher pulse fluxes, exceeding 10 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1), than additions of water alone. These results support a sequential limitation by two resources where an initial limiting resource acts as a switch and, after activation, processes are regulated by a second resource. In contrast to general expectations of increasing pulses with higher soil organic matter (SOM), pulses exhibited strong scale dependencies. Pulses during the summer period and SOM were correlated positively within sites and negatively between sites. This cross-scale divergence implies that, at low elevations, the proportion of SOM available for pulse metabolism was a much larger fraction than at higher elevations. With expected climate changes leading to more frequent drying-wetting cycles, regulation of metabolic pulses will increasingly influence long-term biogeochemical dynamics.

AB Ant assemblages were studied in Warsaw in the context of the effects of urban pressure. Four types of urban greenery were selected: (1) green areas bordering streets, (2) in housing estates, and (3) in parks, and (4) patches of urban woodland. In total, there were 27 species of ants. In terms of the total ant activity density, Lash's niger predominated in all the the lawn biotopes (1-3) and Myrmica rubra in the wooded areas. Ant species diversity was highest in parks and wooded areas and lowest in green areas bordering streets. In contrast, activity density was highest in green areas bordering streets and lowest in wooded areas. Some species are found only in a few habitats. Stenamma debile, Lasius brunneus, L. fuliginosus and Temnothorax crassispinus almost exclusively occurred in wooded areas, whereas L. niger was most often found in lawn biotopes. Myrmica rugulosa and Tetramorium caespitum were most abundant in green areas bordering streets, while in parks Lasius flavus, Formica cunicularia and Solenopsis fugax were most abundant. In general, the ant assemblages recorded showed a significantly nested pattern, with biotope type being a significant determinant of nestedness. The assemblages found in green areas in housing estates and bordering streets constituted a subsample of the assemblages in parks and wooded areas. Ant species were non-randomly distributed in this urbanized landscape and the species recorded in the most transformed biotopes constitute subsamples of those inhabiting less transformed biotopes. This finding emphasizes the importance of wooded areas for the maintenance of biodiversity in urban areas.

AB There are three key drivers of the biodiversity crisis: (1) the well known existing threats to biodiversity such as habitat loss, invasive pest species and resource exploitation; (2) direct effects of climate-change, such as on coastal and high elevation communities and coral reefs; and (3) the interaction between existing threats and climate-change. The third driver is set to accelerate the biodiversity crisis beyond the impacts of the first and second drivers in isolation. In this review we assess these interactions, and suggest the policy and management responses that are needed to minimise their impacts. Renewed management and policy action that address known threats to biodiversity could substantially diminish the impacts of future climate-change. An appropriate response to climate-change will include a reduction of land clearing, increased habitat restoration using indigenous species, a reduction in the number of exotic species transported between continents or between major regions of endemism, and a reduction in the unsustainable use of natural resources. Achieving these measures requires substantial reform of international, national and regional policy, and the development of new or more effective alliances between scientists, government agencies, non-government organisations and land managers. Furthermore, new management practices and policy are needed that consider shifts in the geographic range of species, and that are responsive to new information acquired from improved research and monitoring programs. The interactions of climate-change with existing threats to biodiversity have the potential to drive many species to extinction, but there is much that can be done now to reduce this risk.

AB Context dependence in the effects of landscape matrix structure on habitat patch dynamics is rapidly becoming the modern paradigm for landscape ecology and the study of habitat fragmentation. Most of these studies have focused on the influence of matrix structure on between-patch processes, or the influence of matrix structure on patch-level dynamics, whereas matrix effects on within-patch processes (such as edge effects) have been largely ignored. Here, we tested whether matrix contrast (the difference in vegetation structure and environmental conditions between the habitat patch and the adjacent matrix) alters ''two-sided'' patch-to-matrix edge response functions in invertebrate diversity and community composition across native forest boundaries. In a severely fragmented landscape in southeastern New Zealand, we selected paired native forest-vs.-pasture and native forest-vs.-plantation edge gradients within four catchments. We sampled invertebrates with flight intercept traps at nine distances across each of the patch-to-matrix gradients (giving a total of 72 sampling sites). We show unequivocally that, in historically forested landscapes such as these, conversion from a high-contrast pasture matrix to a low-contrast plantation matrix can mitigate, nullify, or even reverse edge response functions across whole invertebrate orders and across multiple species within diverse beetle assemblages. Variation in adjacent production land use altered the edge response functions for over 80% of all beetle species tested, predominantly through the provision of supplementary habitat in the adjacent forestry matrix, but also through the buffering effect of the plantation matrix compared to the pasture matrix on the relative abundances of some species within native remnants. These findings raise real prospects for active management intervention at the landscape scale, not only to mitigate edge effects on remnant communities, but to simultaneously address both production goals and biodiversity goals in modified landscapes.

AB Despite nearly 100 years of edge studies, there has been little effort to document how edge responses 'cascade' to impact multi-trophic food webs. We examined changes within two, four-tiered food webs located on opposite sides of a habitat edge. Based on a 'bottom-up' resource-based model, we predicted plant resources would decline near edges, causing similar declines in specialist herbivores and their associated predators, while a generalist predator was predicted to increase due to complementary resource use. As predicted, we found declines in both specialist herbivores and predators near edges, but, contrary to expectations, this was not driven by gradients in plant resources. Instead, the increase in generalist predators near edges offers one alternative explanation for the observed declines. Furthermore, our results suggest how recent advances in food web theory could improve resource-based edge models, and vice versa.

AB Payment for ecosystem services (PES) has attracted considerable attention as an economic incentive for promoting natural resource management recently. As emphasis has been placed on using the incentive-based mechanism by the central government, rapid progress on PES research and practice has been achieved. However PES still faces many difficulties. A key issue is the lack of a fully-fledged theory and method to clearly define the design scope, accounting and feasibility of PES criteria. An improved watershed criteria model was developed in light of research on PES practices in China, investigations on the water source area for the Middle Route Project of South-to-North Water Diversion and ecosystem services outflows theory. The basic principle of assessment is the direct and opportunity cost for ecological conservation and environmental protection in the water source area deduct nationally-financed PES and internal effect. Then the scope and the criteria methods were determined, and internal effect was put forward to define benefits brought from water source area. Finally, Shiyan City, which is the main water source area for the Project of Water Diversion, was analyzed by this model and its payment was calculated. The results showed that: (1) during 2003-2050, the total direct cost and opportunity cost would reach up 10 262.70 billion and 256.33 billion Chinese Yuan (CNY, 2000 constant prices), i.e., 50.61% and 49.38% of total cost, respectively; (2) Shiyan City would gain 0.23, 0.06 and 0.03 CNY/m(3) in 2014-2020, 2011-2030, and 2031-2050, respectively.

AB Live fences may act as tools for biodiversity conservation by providing habitat for native species and increasing connectivity in the landscape. We studied the influence of live fence characteristics on species richness and fence use by birds by examining both local and landscape factors. We studied three types of live fences: planted fences of a native tree, planted fences of an exotic, and spontaneous. They were either connected to forest fragments or isolated, and were all within a pasture matrix. Spontaneous and planted live fences maintain a diverse plant (77 shrub and tree species) and bird communities (98 species). Fence types strongly differed in vegetation composition and structure. We found that by analyzing each fence characteristic independently, there was no difference in bird richness or abundance. However, there was a significant correlation when plant richness, structure, and connectivity were analyzed together. This could be the result of some variables counterbalancing each other. Birds used fences for a variety of purposes including foraging, breeding, and moving across the landscape. Native birds and plants used live fences as habitat and refuge in a landscape where large forest tracts have been lost for decades. Live fences in conjunction with small forest fragments maintain a diverse array of plant and birds species that are a subsample of the species originally found in the landscape before extensive deforestation. We recommend the establishment of live fences, allowing growth of spontaneous understory.

AB The increasing rate of urban sprawl continues to fragment European landscapes threatening the persistence of native woodland plant communities. The dynamics of woodland edges depend on the characteristics of woodland patches and also on landscape context. Our aim was to assess the extent of edge influences on the understorey vegetation of small native woodlands in rural and urban landscapes. The study was carried out in two cities of north-western France. Ten comparable woodlands, each of about 1.5 ha, were surveyed; five were situated adjacent to crops and five adjacent to built-up land. Vascular plant species were recorded in 420 3 x 3 m plots placed at seven different distances from the edge (from 0 to about 45 m from the edge). Soil pH, light levels, level of disturbance and tree and shrub cover were also recorded. Plant species were first classified as non-indigenous or indigenous and then three groups of indigenous species were distinguished according to their affinity for forest habitat (forest specialists, forest generalists and non-forest species). We inferred certain ecological characteristics of understorey vegetation by using Ellenberg values. An inter-class correspondence analysis was carried out to detect patterns of variation in plant community composition. Linear mixed models were used to test the effects of adjacent land use, distance from the edge and their interactions on the species richness of the different groups and on the ecological characteristics of vegetation. Total species richness, richness of forest generalists and of non-forest species decreased from edge to interior in both urban and rural woodlands. The number of non-indigenous species depended mainly on urban-rural landscape context. Urban woodland edges were not as rich in forest specialists as rural edges. More surprisingly, the number of forest specialists was higher in rural edges than in rural interiors. Community composition was mainly affected by urban-rural context and to a lesser degree by the edge effect: the community composition of urban edges resembled that of urban interiors whereas in rural woodlands vegetation near edges (up to 10 m) strongly differed from interiors with a pool of species specific to edges. Urban woodland vegetation was more nitrophilous than rural vegetation in both edges and interiors. A major difference between urban and rural vegetation was the distribution of basiphilous species according to distance from the edge. Generally edge vegetation was more basiphilous than interior vegetation however the presence of basiphilous species fell off quickly with distance from the edge in rural woodlands (in the first 10-15 m) and more slowly (from 25 m onwards) in urban woodlands. This pattern was linked to variation in measured soil pH. As regards the conservation of flora in small native woodlands, it appeared that invasion of exotic and non-forest species was currently limited in both urban and rural landscape contexts but might pose problems in the future, especially in urban woodlands. Forest species were not negatively affected by the edge effect and indeed edges seemed to provide important habitats for this group. Hence conservationists should pay particular attention to the protection of edges in urban woodlands.

AB Background: Local plant-soil associations are commonly studied at the species-level, while associations at the level of nodes within a phylogeny have been less well explored. Understanding associations within a phylogenetic context, however, can improve our ability to make predictions across systems and can advance our understanding of the role of evolutionary history in structuring communities.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we quantified evolutionary signal in plant-soil associations using a DNA sequence-based community phylogeny and several soil variables (e. g., extractable phosphorus, aluminum and manganese, pH, and slope as a proxy for soil water). We used published plant distributional data from the 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Republic of Panama. Our results suggest some groups of closely related species do share similar soil associations. Most notably, the node shared by Myrtaceae and Vochysiaceae was associated with high levels of aluminum, a potentially toxic element. The node shared by Apocynaceae was associated with high extractable phosphorus, a nutrient that could be limiting on a taxon specific level. The node shared by the large group of Laurales and Magnoliales was associated with both low extractable phosphorus and with steeper slope. Despite significant node-specific associations, this study detected little to no phylogeny-wide signal. We consider the majority of the 'traits' (i.e., soil variables) evaluated to fall within the category of ecological traits. We suggest that, given this category of traits, phylogeny-wide signal might not be expected while node-specific signals can still indicate phylogenetic structure with respect to the variable of interest.
   Conclusions: Within the BCI forest dynamics plot, distributions of some plant taxa are associated with local-scale differences in soil variables when evaluated at individual nodes within the phylogenetic tree, but they are not detectable by phylogeny-wide signal. Trends highlighted in this analysis suggest how plant-soil associations may drive plant distributions and diversity at the local-scale.

AB In tropical regions, the effects of land-cover change on nutrient and pollutant inputs to ecosystems remain poorly documented and may be pronounced, especially in montane areas exposed to elevated atmospheric deposition. We examined atmospheric deposition and canopy interactions of sulfate-sulfur (SO42--S), chloride (Cl-), and nitratenitrogen (NO3--N) in three extensive tropical montane land-cover types: clearings, forest, and coffee agroforest. Bulk and fog deposition to clearings was measured as well as throughfall (water that falls through plant canopies) ion fluxes in seven forest and five coffee sites. Sampling was conducted from 2005 to 2008 across two regions in the Sierra Madre Oriental, Veracruz, Mexico.
   Annual throughfall fluxes to forest and coffee sites ranged over 6-27 kg SO42--S/ha, 12-69 kg Cl-/ha, and 2-6 kg NO3--N/ha. Sulfate-S in forest and coffee throughfall was higher or similar to bulk S deposition measured in clearings. Throughfall Cl- inputs, however, were consistently higher than Cl- amounts deposited to cleared areas, with net Cl- fluxes enhanced in evergreen coffee relative to semi-deciduous forest plots. Compared to bulk nitrate-N deposition, forest and coffee canopies retained 1-4 kg NO3--N/ha annually, reducing NO3--N inputs to soils. Overall, throughfall fluxes were similar to values reported for Neotropical sites influenced by anthropogenic emissions, while bulk S and N deposition were nine-and eightfold greater, respectively, than background wet deposition rates for remote tropical areas.
   Our results demonstrate that land-cover type significantly alters the magnitude and spatial distribution of atmospheric inputs to tropical ecosystems, primarily through canopy-induced changes in fog and dry deposition. However, we found that land cover interacts with topography and climate in significant ways to produce spatially heterogeneous patterns of anion fluxes, and that these factors can converge to create deposition hotspots. For land managers, this finding suggests that there is potential to identify species and ecosystems at risk of excess and increasing deposition in montane watersheds undergoing rapid transformation. Our data further indicate that montane ecosystems are vulnerable to air pollution impacts in this and similar tropical regions downwind of urban, industrial, and agricultural emission sources.

AB Attention to human-environment relationships in the central Andes has a long history. Although the area is not a neat microcosm of the globe, wholly representative of worldwide trends in the archaeology of human-environment interactions, it has been the site of both seminal investigations in archaeology and a substantial body of recent work that investigates themes of broad archaeological relevance. Specifically, central Andean environments have been variously conceived as structuring, modified, and sacred. These approaches to some extent reflect broad trends in archaeology, while also suggesting directions in which the archaeology of human-environment interactions is moving and highlighting archaeology's relevance to discussions of contemporary human-environment interactions. This article characterizes concepts that are key for describing central Andean environments and considers the ways in which the particular ecology of the central Andes has informed archaeological research in the region. The example of the central Andes highlights the importance of understanding environments as dynamic, considering both geomorphic and anthropogenic contributors to that dynamism, and examining both ecological ("environment") and ideological ("landscape") implications of archaeological landscapes.

AB Large seasonal variation in the rate of change in girth of tropical rain-forest tree species has been described, but its origin is still under debate. We tested whether this variation might be related to variation in atmospheric relative humidity through its influence on bark water content and thickness. Variation in trunk circumference of 182 adult trees was measured about twice a month in an undisturbed tropical rain forest over 18 mo using dendrometers. Furthermore, a laboratory experiment was conducted to test the direct influence of relative air humidity on bark water content and thickness. in the field, most trees displayed highly positive rates of change in girth at the onset of the wet season, while a quarter of the trees displayed negative changes during long dry seasons, whatever their total annual growth. This variation was correlated with environmental conditions, particularly with atmospheric relative humidity. Trees with high bark water content and thickness displayed a stronger decrease in girth during the dry season. in the chamber experiment, desiccation induced a decrease in the diameter of the trunk sections in tandem with a decrease in bark water content. As a result, seasonal variation in the rate of change in girth of tropical rain-forest trees reflects variation in trunk biophysical properties, through the influence of relative humidity on bark properties. but not directly variation in secondary growth.

AB P>This study explores Norman Myers's concept of the "hamburger connection" as a form of ecologically unequal exchange, where more-developed nations are able to transfer the environmental costs of beef consumption to less-developed nations. I used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to test whether deforestation in less-developed nations is associated with the vertical flow of beef exports to more-developed nations. An interaction term also examines whether this relationship is more pronounced in Latin American nations, as posited by Myers. The sample includes all nondesert, less-developed nations for which there are available data across all indicators (N = 48). Overall, the results confirm the tested hypotheses. The findings also provide unique contextual support for ecologically unequal exchange theory by demonstrating that unequal trade relationships can operate at the level of a single commodity type.

AB In order to differentiate between mechanisms of species coexistence, we examined the relative importance of local biotic neighbourhood, abiotic habitat factors and species differences as factors influencing the survival of 2330 spatially mapped tropical tree seedlings of 15 species of Myristicaceae in two separate analyses in which individuals were identified first to species and then to genus. Using likelihood methods, we selected the most parsimonious candidate models as predictors of 3 year seedling survival in both sets of analyses. We found evidence for differential effects of abiotic niche and neighbourhood processes on individual survival between analyses at the genus and species levels. Niche partitioning ( defined as an interaction of taxonomic identity and abiotic neighbourhood) was significant in analyses at the genus level, but did not differentiate among species in models of individual seedling survival. By contrast, conspecific and congeneric seedling and adult density were retained in the minimum adequate models of seedling survival at species and genus levels, respectively. We conclude that abiotic niche effects express differences in seedling survival among genera but not among species, and that, within genera, community and/or local variation in adult and seedling abundance drives variation in seedling survival. These data suggest that different mechanisms of coexistence among tropical tree taxa may function at different taxonomic or phylogenetic scales. This perspective helps to reconcile perceived differences of importance in the various non-mutually exclusive mechanisms of species coexistence in hyper-diverse tropical forests.

AB We examined a complete list of South American mussels (Mytilidae) to identify species with current or potential needs for management and conservation actions. Based on ecological/ecosystem (aggregations, beds or banks affecting ecosystem functioning) and socio-economic (artisanal fisheries or aquaculture systems) attributes species with high relevance were identified. At least 14 species exhibited large ecosystem level effects at local scales. Further, most of them also sustain important fisheries: nearly one/third of these fisheries showed characteristics that may contribute to their lack of sustainability and overexploitation, while half are either in the initial exploitation phase or in the stabilization of extraction and institutionalization phase. Invading species are modifying the structure of mussel habitats. Allocation of spatially explicit management tools, notably Territorial User Rights in Fisheries and Marine Reserves, together with co-management initiatives, are suggested as relevant tools to fulfill management and conservation objectives for these key bioengineering species.

AB The Atlantic forests of southern Bahia in Brazil present great species richness and a high degree of endemism. A large part of these native forests were transformed into cacao plantations in an agroforestry system known locally as cabrucas, where native trees were culled and cacao was planted under the shade of remaining trees. The present study analyzed the influence of time of implantation ( age) and time of abandonment of management practices on tree species diversity of cabruca plantations to evaluate the capacity for conservation and recovery of species richness of native Atlantic Forest trees in cabrucas. Phytosociological surveys were conducted in five cabrucas with different conditions of age and state of abandonment. All trees, including hemiepiphytes and excluding the cacao plants, with a minimum stem diameter of 10 cm at breast height, were surveyed within a 3- ha sampling area in each plantation. A total of 2514 individual trees belonging to 293 species and 52 families were recorded in the five cabrucas. The Shannon diversity index varied from 3.31 to 4.22 among the cabrucas and was positively correlated with the time of abandonment ( r = 0.97). The new cabrucas showed the highest values of estimated total richness ( Chao) and the highest proportion of late successional species than the old ones. All areas preserved a very high proportion of native forest species while the three old cabrucas showed a higher proportion of exotic species than the two new ones. Thus the exotic species seem to replace more of the native species in the long run because of management practices and local preferences. The cabrucas presented also a high capacity for the regeneration of tree species richness after abandonment. Simple alterations in management practices could improve the recruitment of late successional species in these areas. Economic incentives may be necessary for the farmers to adopt management practices to retain native species which bring no economic returns.

AB Aglaia bourdillonii is a plant narrowly endemic to the southern portion of the Western Ghats (WG), in peninsular India. To understand its ecological and geographic distribution, we used ecological niche modeling (ENM) based on detailed distributional information recently gathered, in relation to detailed climatic data sets. The ENMs successfully reconstructed key features of the species' geographic distribution, focusing almost entirely on the southern WG. Much of the species' distributional potential is already under protection, but our analysis allows identification of key zones for additional protection, all of which are adjacent to existing protected areas. ENM provides a useful tool for understanding the natural history of such rare and endangered species.

AB 1. Ant nuptial flights are central to understanding ant life history and ecology but have been little studied. This study examined the timing of nuptial flights, the synchronicity of nuptial flights (as a potential index of mating strategy), and variation in nuptial flights with elevation and among years in a diverse temperate ant fauna.
   2. Flights occurred throughout the year, but were concentrated in the beginning of summer and in early fall (autumn). Relative to the entire flight season, closely related species tended to be more likely than expected by chance to fly at similar times, perhaps because of phylogenetic constraints on life history evolution.
   3. Flights were relatively synchronous within species for nearly all species considered, but synchronicity did not appear to be a robust estimate of overall mating strategy.
   4. Overall patterns in nuptial flights among species and the timing of flights for individual species varied with elevation, but did not vary greatly among years.
   5. Although this study is one of the most comprehensive on the reproductive flight phenologies of ants, much remains to be learned about the causes and consequences of such spatial and temporal variation in flight phenology.

AB Nearly 40% of the remaining Atlantic Forest in southern Bahia state, Brazil, is a rustic agroforest of cacao (Theobroma cacao). These traditional shade plantations, locally known as 'cabrucas', are habitats for forest dwelling species. Here we investigated the potential role of this traditional crop as a support for bat assemblages in southern Bahia, establishing the extent to which the bat community structure found in this agricultural system is influenced by the proximity of forest tracts. We compared the bat community attributes (richness, diversity and dominance) and species-level response (capture frequency) between native forest tracts and shade cacao plantations located in two distinct landscapes, which varied in total amount of forest (patch sizes and total forested area) and in their proximity to forest tracts. The cabrucas contiguous to forest tracts showed a rich and abundant bat community, with samples showing capture rates, species richness, diversity and evenness significantly higher than those reported for forest tracts. This situation changes, however, when shade plantations are located at some distance from forest tracts (> 1000 m). Bat communities in these isolated cabrucas are less diverse than those found in forests and nearby cabrucas, but in both cases, species usually associated with pristine habitats were found. These findings suggest that cabrucas per se are not forest surrogates, and their potential to harbor forest dwelling bat species is closely linked with the existence of nearby forest tracts that may act as a source for species populations. Therefore, the entire landscape should be considered for management, taking into account that maintenance of cabrucas together with the preservation and restoration of forest patches is probably direly needed if one wishes to conserve the bat diversity in southern Bahia for the long term.

AB Each tropical and subtropical forest canopy species may create specific microsite conditions below its crown, which works as a filter for those species that attempt to regenerate below it. In function of the permeability or impermeability level, each canopy species could partially determine a plant community structure and composition beneath its crown projection. Therefore, present and future forest plant community biodiversity could be partially determined by the present structure of the canopy tree species community (filter effect). Some theoretical and practical aftermaths are suggested.

AB Epiphytes need to balance the trade-off between long-term survival and colonizing new branches in their resource-limited and high-risk canopy habitats. We censused populations of five bromeliad species over two years and calculated matrix population models to determine the key factors influencing population growth rates. Additionally, logistic regression models were applied to study how demographic features change with microsite characteristics and disturbance.
   The bromeliads studied are slow-growing, with species preferring thinner branches maturing faster. Population growth rates were below unity in all species except for the drought-resistant Tillandsia juncea. Population growth rates depended almost exclusively on survival, above all of adult plants. Fecundity had only little impact, even in species of the outer canopy where branchfall-related disturbance and mortality are frequent.
   Survival rates and the probability to become reproductive increased with light availability in most species. Microsite characteristics had the greatest impact on seedling survival, although this contributed very little to population growth rates.
   We conclude that branchfall-related mortality is a key factor for population persistence of epiphytes dwelling in the outer canopy, and that resource availability constrains the possibitity to counteract disturbance with higher fecundity. For species of the outer canopy an increased disturbance by more frequent strong winds could further constrain population growth. Because population persistence strongly relies on the survival of adult plants, harvesting bromeliads for ornamental or other purposes should be restricted to immature individuals. In the future, better models of epiphyte populations in a habitat with highly patchily dynamics should be based on a metapopulation approach. (c) 2006 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB Studies of seed dispersal mutualisms typically test for adaptive relationships between fruits and frugivores. Here, I take the opposite approach, and ask what relationships would be expected based on chance encounters between mutualists. I derived a simple null model to predict pair-wise relationships between fruit and frugivore species. I assumed that all frugivores had identical fruit preferences, but allowed for interspecific variation in plant abundances, frugivore abundances and fruit phenologies. Under these conditions, the number of visits each frugivore species makes to each plant species results from the product of plant abundances and frugivore abundances when each plant species produces fruit. I then tested null model predictions with observations in a temperate rainforest in British Columbia, Canada. I measured the abundance and phenology of seven bird-dispersed plant species, seasonal changes in the abundances of six avian frugivore species and 212 interactions between them. Empirical results were generally consistent with predictions, suggesting that relationships between birds and fruits are structured randomly. However, some variation in relationships between observations and predictions was observed, suggesting deterministic processes may also be important. Overall results illustrate that predictable relationships between fruit and frugivore species can result from random encounters between mutualists.

AB Species diversity-environmental heterogeneity (D-EH) and species diversity-productivity (D-P) relationships have seldom been analyzed simultaneously even though such analyses could help to understand the processes underlying contrasts in species diversity among sites. Here we analyzed both relationships at a local scale for a highly diverse tropical dry forest of Mexico. We posed the following questions: (1) are environmental heterogeneity and productivity related ?; (2) what are the shapes of D-EH and D-P relationships ?; (3) what are individual, and interactive, contributions of these two variables to the observed variance in species diversity ?; and (4) are patterns affected by sample size, or by partitioning into average local diversity and spatial species turnover ? All trees (diameter at breast height >= 5 cm) within twenty-six 0.2-ha transects were censused; four environmental variables associated with water availability were combined into an environmental heterogeneity index; aboveground standing biomass was used as a productivity estimator. Simple and multiple linear and nonlinear regression models were run. Environmental heterogeneity and productivity were not correlated. We found consistently positive log-linear D-EH and D-P relationships. Productivity explained a larger fraction of among-transect variance in species diversity than did environmental heterogeneity. No effects of sample size were found. Different components of diversity varied in sensitivity to environmental heterogeneity and productivity. Our results suggest that species' differentiation along water availability gradients and species exclusion at the lowest productivity (driest) sites occur simultaneously, independently, and in a scale-dependent fashion on the tree community of this forest.

AB Background and Aims The phenotypic plasticity of leaf life span in response to low resource conditions has a potentially large impact on the plant carbon budget, notably in evergreen species not subject to seasonal leaf shedding, but has rarely been well documented. This study evaluates the plasticity of leaf longevity, in terms of its quantitative importance to the plant carbon balance under limiting light.
   Methods Seedlings of four tropical tree species with contrasting light requirements (Alstonia scholaris, Hevea brasiliensis, Durio zibethinus and Lansium domesticum) were grown under three light regimes (full sunlight, 45% sunlight and 12% sunlight). Their leaf dynamics were monitored over 18 months.
   Results All species showed a considerable level of plasticity with regard to leaf life span: over the range of light levels explored, the ratio of the range to the mean value of life span varied from 29%, for the least plastic species, to 84%, for the most. The common trend was for leaf life span to increase with decreasing light intensity. The plasticity apparent in leaf life span was similar in magnitude to the plasticity observed in specific leaf area and photosynthetic rate, implying that it has a significant impact on carbon gain efficiency when plants acclimate to different light regimes. In all species, median survival time was negatively correlated with leaf photosynthetic capacity (or its proxy, the nitrogen content per unit area) and leaf emergence rate.
   Conclusions Longer leaf life spans under low light are likely to be a consequence of slower ageing as a result of a slower photosynthetic metabolism.

AB We examined effects of experimental manipulations of vegetation cover on recruitment, mortality and density of seedlings (20-100cm tall) and saplings (>= 100cm tall) of woody growth forms over a 2.5-y period. We created four treatments in each of three 15-20-y-old tropical forest stands in Costa Rica: a large canopy gap (270-350 m(2)) a small canopy gap (50-1 ()() m(2)), understorey vegetation removal, and an unmanipulated control treatment. Creation of canopy gaps, especially large ones, increased first-year recruitment and density, as well as overall mortality of seedlings. Saplings experienced lower mortality and more prolonged gap-enhanced recruitment and density than seedlings. Removal of understorey vegetation had little or no effect on tree seedling and sapling dynamics. Recruitment and density of lianas responded only to large gaps, whereas understorey species responded to both gap treatments and to spatial heterogeneity within gaps. Tree species exhibited diverse regeneration requirements. whereas liana and understorey species were more specialized to the high and low ends of the light availability gradient, respectively. Canopy gaps provide a critical mechanism for regeneration of lianas, and canopy tree species that dominate during the early stages of secondary forest succession. The choice of management system for these secondary forests can determine the direction and rate of succession.

AB Large data requirements may restrict the use of matrix population models for analysis of population dynamics. Less data are required for a small population matrix than for a large matrix because the smaller matrix contains fewer vital rates that need to be estimated. Smaller matrices, however, tend to have a lower precision. Based on 37 plant species, we studied the effects of matrix dimensionality on the long-term population growth rate (lambda) and the elasticity of lambda in herbaceous and woody species. We found that when matrix dimensionality was reduced, changes in lambda were significantly larger for herbaceous than for woody species. In many cases, lambda of woody species remained virtually the same after a substantial decrease in matrix dimensionality, suggesting that woody species are less susceptible to matrix dimensionality. We demonstrated that when adjacent stages of a transition matrix are combined, the magnitude of a change in lambda depends on the distance of the population structure from a stable stage distribution, and the difference in the combined vital rates weighted by their reproductive values. Elasticity of lambda to survival and fecundity usually increased, whereas elasticity to growth decreased both in herbaceous and in woody species with reduced matrix dimensionality. Changes in elasticity values tended to be larger for herbaceous than for woody species. Our results show that by reducing matrix dimensionality, the amount of demographic data can be decreased to save time, money, and field effort. We recommend the use of a small matrix dimensionality especially when a limited amount of data is available, and for slow-growing species having a simple matrix structure that mainly consists of stasis and growth to the next stage.

AB Clear-cutting can greatly impact red wood ant (Formica rufa group) colonies by changing microclimate, altering forage routes and eliminating aphid colonies as a food source. However, changed forestry practices in Finland, such as smaller clear-cut areas, leaving residual trees, and less intensive site preparation methods used during the last decade may result in less detrimental effects on red wood ants. Therefore, we studied how the number and size of red wood ant mounds varied between mature, 140-year-old, Norway spruce, Picea abies (L.) Karst., dominated mixed stands, and in 20-year-old and 5-year-old stands planted with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in eastern Finland, all originating from similar mature forest stands. No red wood ant mounds were found in the 20-year-old Scots pine stands, which seems to be due to the cutting practices and heavy site preparation used at that time. The mound density in the 5-year-old stands (2.7 mounds per ha) was not different from that in the mature stands (2.9 mounds per ha), which could be a result of lighter harvesting and site preparation practices. However, the mounds in the 5-year-old clear cut areas were smaller in volume and flatter in shape than those in the mature stands. This could be due to accelerated organic matter decomposition in the mounds after timber harvest, or large mounds may have split into smaller ones as a result of changed environmental or food supply conditions. However, five years after clear-cutting and site preparation could be too short a time period to observe the degeneration and eventual disappearance of the still existing red wood ant mounds.

AB We investigated how vegetation features and temporal variation influenced web spider richness, abundance and composition along an edge between Araucaria forest and pasture in southern Brazil. Web spiders and vegetation were surveyed four times over a 1-year period, in five 5 x 5 m plots randomised in four locations: 50 m into the pasture, 0, 50 and 250 m into the forest. We collected a total of 836 web spiders (33 morphospecies and six families). We found different web spider assemblages occurring at the pasture edge and forest interior. The richness and abundance of web spiders decreased up to 50 m towards the forest interior in all seasons, and we found a positive influence of vegetation richness on web spider abundance. In conclusion, web spider assemblages are influenced by an edge gradient, this pattern is consistent throughout the year and is strongly related to vegetation features. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Variation in post-dispersal seed predation between mature forest and fallow swidden agriculture sites (young forest) was examined for 26 tree and liana species in Peruvian lowland tropical forest. Exclosures were also used to determine the relative importance of vertebrate and invertebrate seed predators. Although species differed significantly in levels of predation, predation of seeds exposed to vertebrates was high (>75%) for all species, while seed predation by invertebrates was lower and more variable. Seed and seedling predation by insects was significantly higher in mature forest, while seed predation by rodents was higher in fallow areas. Other sources of mortality (primarily desiccation) were higher for seeds in fallow areas. The percentage of seeds moved was significantly different among species bur not between forests.

AB 1 The Mediterranean perennial grass Ampelodesmos mauritanica may have the potential to expand its range. We analysed temporal variability of its reproductive components (seedfall, seed bank, seed predation, seed germination, seedling emergence, survival and growth) in three microsites (open areas, beneath Ampelodesmos and beneath shrubs) at two sites.
   2 Reproductive components prior to seedling emergence were both closely linked and very similar between microsites within a site. Seedling survival and growth differed between microsites, being lowest in open areas. Recruitment patterns cannot therefore be predicted from seedfall.
   3 Abundant seed production in 1996 was followed by successful germination and high seedling survival. In the following (non-masting) year, although Ampelodesmos has a low-density persistent seed bank, recruitment was much lower because germination was low and post-dispersal seed predation was high.
   4 Our results suggest that Ampelodesmos reproduction is episodic. Expansion of its distribution may be triggered by intermittent seedling recruitment following masting, but is otherwise constrained by seed limitation, post-dispersal seed predation and a loss of viability in the seed bank.

AB The competitive interactions and recolonization processes of two Caribbean zoanthids, Palythoa caribaeorum and Zoanthus sociatus, were studied in the field. Their competitive abilities (i.e., overgrowth capacity or growth inhibition) were evaluated by means of periodical observations of naturally occurring contact margins in 64-cm(2) non-disturbed areas. Recolonization and growth rates were assessed through experimental removal (64-cm(2) clearings) of different proportions of the zoanthid's initial cover of both species. Interactions were observed during 8 months, whereas a 10-month period was allowed for recolonization. Results showed that contact margins between both species remained unchanged along time, suggesting that stand-off or growth inhibition was the main strategy used. For the removal experiments, the initial proportion cleared for each species within the experimental patches was important for the final cover achieved. For P. caribaeorum, the greater the initial cover removed, the greater the final cover achieved. This tendency was not as evident for Z. sociatus. Growth rates were highly variable, ranging from 0.08 +/- 0.20 to 0.12 +/- 0.06 cm(2) . cm border(-1). month(-1) for P. caribaeorum, and from 0.05 +/- 0.15 to 0.14 +/- 0.51 cm(2) . cm border(-1). month(-1) for Z. sociatus. In general, we found a reduction of the growth rates through time, and P. caribaeorum exhibits a faster initial growth rate. Because the kind of disturbance applied in this study (cover removal) did not favor Z. sociatus, considered as a weaker competitor compared to P. caribaeorum, another compensatory mechanism that allows the coexistence of these species in this reef platform must exist. Several alternatives are proposed. The importance attributed to disturbances as a mechanism that explains the coexistence of species was not evident in our study, providing the disturbance intensity (patch size and proportion of initial cover removed) did not exceed that tested.

AB Seed demography of three co-occurring Acei species in an old-growth mixed deciduous forest in Japan was studied. Almost all of the seeds of A. mono germinated in the first spring, while those of A. palmatum var. amoenum showed a delay in germination of almost one year. A. rufinerve showed a rather opportunistic germination habit. Both A. palmatum var. amoenum and A. rufinerve form short-term persistent seed banks, but without input of newly dispersed seeds they may become extinct in about one year. The seed bank for these two species is not as significant as for a typical pioneer species, and the seedling bank is important for all three species. Only a small proportion of the dispersed propagules contained viable embryos, mainly due to pollination failure or abortion (A. mono and A. palmatum var. amoenum), and invertebrate pre dation (A. rufinerve). For all three species, larger seed crops had a higher percentage of viable seeds. Even for these relatively small, wind-dispersed seeds, the predation pressure was very high. A large part of the dispersed seeds was eaten by wood mice during the first winter (30 - 80 %). Estimation from the 5-yr average of seed dispersal and seedling emergence showed that only 7 - 16 % of the dispersed viable seeds succeeded in germinating.

AB This paper documents horizontal and vertical dispersion patterns of a Texas population of the salt-marsh periwinkle, Littoraria irrorata, over a 15-month period. The study was conducted within a tidal marsh on the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge in Galveston Bay. Two mark-recapture experiments demonstrated that L. irrorata rarely move more than 2 m from their release point over long periods of time and do not home to individual Spartina plants. Adult L. irrorata forage farther away from the base of Spartina stalks at low tide than do juvenile snails. Remaining near the plant base may decrease both temperature and desiccation stress on juveniles. During warm months, L. irrorata climb grass stalks with tidal inundation and forage on the substratum at low tide. Snails are inactive and aggregate in detrital debris at the base of Spartina clumps during the winter.

Nevertheless, few studies have comprehensively examined the impacts of existing PES programs. Grassland Ecological Compensation Policy (GECP) is one of the few pastorally focused PES programs with large investments and long duration, which aim to improve grassland quality and increase herder income. Here we present empirical evidence of the effects of GECP on grassland quality and herder income. Through a thorough and in-depth econometric analysis of remote sensing and household survey data, we find that, although GECP improves grassland quality (albeit to only a small extent) and has a large positive effect on income, it exacerbates existing income inequality among herders within their local communities. The analysis demonstrates that the program has induced herders to change their livestock production behavior. Heterogeneity analysis emphasizes the importance of making sure the programs are flexible and are adapted to local resource circumstances.

AB Fire has been a natural force modulating the vegetation of the Brazilian Cerrado since long before the first humans arrived in this region about 12 thousand years BP. Cerrado plants are, therefore, adapted to fire and some of them depend on fire to maintain their reproduction and survival. However, after the use of fire as a tool to destroy vast extents of forests in the last centuries, Brazilians in general formed a very negative opinion about the use of fire and burning native vegetation was prohibited in the country. Although this decision was effective in protecting tropical forests, the zero-fire policy has been quite negative in the Cerrado. Fire suppression in Cerrado reserves has caused a dramatic loss of biodiversity at landscape level (homogenizing the vegetation structure), at species level (leading non-tree species to local extinction) and likely at population level (sexual reproduction impaired). Furthermore, fuel accumulation over several years without fire increases the risks of catastrophic firestorms that will inevitably occur. Such negative consequences of fire suppression in the Cerrado have not been noticed even among ecologists, including myself in early career and until recently. The biased tree-and-carbon perspective of environmental campaigns and ecological studies have reinforced the misunderstanding of fire effects in Cerrado vegetation. Both neglect that the absolute majority of Cerrado plant species, as well as associated fauna and ecosystem services, depend upon open vegetation-structures which are mostly maintained by fire.

AB Nearly 20% of tropical forests are within 100 m of a nonforest edge, a consequence of rapid deforestation for agriculture. Despite widespread conversion, roughly 1.2 billion ha of tropical forest remain, constituting the largest terrestrial component of the global carbon budget. Effects of deforestation on carbon dynamics in remnant forests, and spatial variation in underlying changes in structure and function at the plant scale, remain highly uncertain. Using airborne imaging spectroscopy and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, we mapped and quantified changes in forest structure and foliar characteristics along forest/oil palm boundaries in Malaysian Borneo to understand spatial and temporal variation in the influence of edges on aboveground carbon and associated changes in ecosystem structure and function. We uncovered declines in aboveground carbon averaging 22% along edges that extended over 100 m into the forest. Aboveground carbon losses were correlated with significant reductions in canopy height and leaf mass per area and increased foliar phosphorus, three plant traits related to light capture and growth. Carbon declines amplified with edge age. Our results indicate that carbon losses along forest edges can arise from multiple, distinct effects on canopy structure and function that vary with edge age and environmental conditions, pointing to a need for consideration of differences in ecosystem sensitivity when developing land-use and conservation strategies. Our findings reveal that, although edge effects on ecosystem structure and function vary, forests neighboring agricultural plantations are consistently vulnerable to long-lasting negative effects on fundamental ecosystem characteristics controlling primary productivity and carbon storage.

AB Targeted livestock grazing is a proven tool for manipulating rangeland vegetation, and current knowledge about targeted livestock grazing is extensive and expanding rapidly. Targeted grazing prescriptions optimize the timing, frequency, intensity, and selectivity of grazing (or browsing) in combinations that purposely exert grazing/browsing pressure on specific plant species or portions of the landscape. Targeted grazing differs from traditional grazing management in that the goal of targeted grazing is to apply defoliation or trampling to achieve specific vegetation management objectives, whereas the goal of traditional livestock grazing management is generally the production of livestock commodities. A shared aim of targeted livestock grazing and traditional grazing management is to sustain healthy soils, flora, fauna, and water resources that, in turn, can sustain natural ecological processes (e.g., nutrient cycle, water cycle, energy flow). Targeted grazing prescriptions integrate knowledge of plant ecology, livestock nutrition, and livestock foraging behavior. Livestock can be focused on target areas through fencing, herding, or supplement placement. Although practices can be developed to minimize the impact of toxins contained in target plants, the welfare of the animals used in targeted grazing must be a priority. Monitoring is needed to determine if targeted grazing is successful and to refine techniques to improve efficacy and efficiency. Examples of previous research studies and approaches are presented to highlight the ecological benefits that can be achieved when targeted grazing is applied properly. These cases include ways to suppress invasive plants and ways to enhance wildlife habitat and biodiversity. Future research should address the potential to select more adapted and effective livestock for targeted grazing and the associated animal welfare concerns with this practice. Targeted livestock grazing provides land managers a viable alternative to mechanical, chemical, and prescribed fire treatments to manipulate rangeland vegetation. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Not all herbivory is detrimental to plants. In some cases, plants can compensate for herbivory, maintain growth and fitness following damage, or even overcompensate for herbivory and perform better than if left undamaged. Examples of overcompensation to vertebrate herbivory are well known, but here we review the literature for examples of reproductive overcompensation (i.e., increased production of traits associated with fitness) and increased vegetative growth (i.e., vegetative overcompensation) following insect herbivory. We used a meta-analysis to explore the effects of plant growth form, evolutionary history, herbivore feeding guild, and other plant and insect traits on the expression of reproductive and vegetative overcompensation by plants. Our literature search revealed 86 studies documenting examples of overcompensation for insect herbivory by 67 plant species representing 26 families. These plants included monocots and dicots, annuals and perennials, and woody and herbaceous plants. We also found that varied insect herbivores induce overcompensation, including 75 insect species in six orders representing 27 families and myriad feeding guilds. In our meta-analysis, we calculated 53 effect sizes from 21 publications documenting reproductive overcompensation and 89 effect sizes from 40 publications documenting vegetative overcompensation. Variation in reproductive overcompensation was seen among plant growth forms, functional groups, cultivation, herbivore feeding sites, and plant and herbivore families. Variation in vegetative overcompensation was seen among plant families, herbivore families, and latitudinal gradients. We suggest overcompensation for insect herbivory may be far more prevalent than previously thought. Additional research focusing on the mechanisms, patterns, and ecological and evolutionary consequences of overcompensation for insect herbivory is likely to provide exciting new insights into this poorly understood and largely overlooked outcome of plant-insect interactions.

AB Biodiversity conservation interventions often aim to benefit both nature and people; however, the social impacts of these interventions remain poorly understood. We reviewed recent literature on the social impacts of four marine conservation interventions to understand the synergies, tradeoffs, and equity (STE) of these impacts, focusing on the direction, magnitude, and distribution of impacts across domains of human wellbeing and across spatial, temporal, and social scales. STE literature has increased dramatically since 2000, particularly for marine protected areas (MPAs), but remains limited. Few studies use rigorous counterfactual study designs, and significant research gaps remain regarding specific wellbeing domains (culture, education), social groups (gender, age, ethnic groups), and impacts over time. Practitioners and researchers should recognize the role of shifting property rights, power asymmetries, individual capabilities, and resource dependency in shaping STE in conservation outcomes, and utilize multi-consequential frameworks to support the wellbeing of vulnerable and marginalized groups.

AB Tropical dry forests and savannas provide important ecosystem services and harbor high biodiversity, yet are globally under pressure from land-use change. Mapping changes in the condition of dry forests and savannas is therefore critical. This can be challenging given that these ecosystems are characterized by continuous gradients of tree and shrub cover, resulting in considerable structural complexity. We developed a novel approach to map, separately, continuous fields of tree cover and shrub cover across the South American Gran Chaco (1,100,000 km(2)), making full use of the Landsat-8 optical and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image archives. We gathered a large training dataset digitized from very-high resolution imagery and used a gradient-boosting framework to model continuous fields of tree cover and shrub cover at 30-m resolution. Our regression models had high to moderate predictive power (85.5% for tree cover, and 68.5% for shrub cover) and resulted in reliable tree and shrub cover maps (mean squared error of 4.4% and 6.4% for tree- and shrub cover respectively). Models jointly using optical and SAR imagery performed substantially better than models using single-sensor imagery, and model predictors differed strongly in some regions, especially in areas of dense vegetation cover. Mapping tree and shrub cover separately allowed identifying distinct vegetation formations, with shrub-dominated systems mainly in the very dry Chaco, woodlands with large trees mainly in the dry Chaco, and tree-dominated savannas in the wet Chaco. Our tree and shrub cover layers also revealed considerable edge effects in terms of woody cover away from agricultural fields (edge effects extending about 2 km), smallholder ranches (about 1.2 km), and roads and railways (about 1.4 and 0.9 km, respectively). Our analyses highlight both the substantial footprint of land-use on remaining natural vegetation in the Chaco, and the potential of multi-sensoral approaches to monitor forest degradation. More broadly, our approach shows that mapping canopy structure and distinct layers of woody vegetation in dry forest and savannas is possible across large areas, and highlights the value of the growing Landsat and Sentinel archives for doing so.

AB Ecological processes are centered to water availability in drylands; however, less known nutrient stoichiometry can help explain much of their structure and ecological interactions. Here we look to the foliar stoichiometry of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) of 38 dominant plant species from the Sonoran Desert, grouped in four different functional types to describe ecological characteristics and processes. We found that foliar N, C:N, C:P, and N:P stoichiometric ratios, but not P, were higher than those known to most other ecosystems and indicate P but not N limitations in leaves. Biological N fixers (BNF) had even higher leaf N concentrations, but bio-elemental concentrations and stoichiometry ratios were not different to other non-N-fixing legume species which underscores the need to understand the physiological mechanisms for high N, and to how costly BNF can succeed in P-limiting drylands environments. Stoichiometry ratios, and to lesser extent elemental concentrations, were able to characterize BNF and colonizing strategies in the Sonoran Desert, as well as explain leaf attribute differences, ecological processes, and biogeochemical niches in this dryland ecosystem, even when no direct reference is made to other water-limitation strategies.

TI Soy Moratorium in Mato Grosso: Deforestation undermines the agreement
SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE Agriculture; Soybean; Deforestation; Amazon biome
ID AMAZON
AB Brazil is one of the world leaders in replacing forests with agriculture. Agribusiness has responded to international public opinion by introducing the Soy Moratorium, (SoyM), an agreement that aims to inhibit the destruction of forests to plant soy in the Brazilian Amazon. This pressure led to the creation of a joint working group comprised of representatives from the civil society, soy producers, and finally the Brazilian government. In this article, we analyze all the areas that were forested in 2006 and are now planted with soy in the Amazonian municipalities in the state of Mato Grosso. During the period in which we analyzed deforestation between 2009 and 2016, we identified 54 municipalities that were not in compliance with SoyM; a total of 59,972 ha had been converted to soy plantation. These results can be ascribed to several reasons, one of which is, essentially, that SoyM has not been able to reach the offending producers. If we consider deforestation starting in 2006, the amount of soy grown in violation of SoyM would be equivalent to an estimated total of 350,000 tons(-1), or 9700 truckloads, only in the 2016/17 harvest. Nevertheless, even with these less satisfactory results, SoyM, the first voluntary zero-deforestation agreement implemented in the tropics, should be seen as a commendable initiative to engage all segments, including society, the productive sector, and the government, in this process. It merely needs to be refined, with all the groups involved in discussing new strategies in an international forum.

AB Aim: Stacked species distribution models (SDMs) are an important step towards estimating species richness, but frequently overpredict this metric and therefore erroneously predict which species comprise a given community. We test the idea that developing hypotheses about accessible area a priori can greatly improve model performance. By integrating dispersal ability via accessible area into SDM creation, we address an often-overlooked facet of ecological niche modelling.
   Innovation: By limiting the training and transference areas to theoretically accessible areas, we are creating more accurate SDMs on the basis of a taxon's explorable environments. This limitation of space and environment is a more accurate reflection of a taxon's true dispersal properties and more accurately reflects the geographical and environmental space to which a taxon is exposed. Here, we compare the predictive performance of stacked SDMs derived from spatially constrained and unconstrained training areas.
   Main conclusions: Restricting a species' training and transference areas to a theoretically accessible area greatly improves model performance. Stacked SDMs drawn from spatially restricted training areas predicted species richness and community composition more accurately than non-restricted stacked SDMs. These accessible area-based restrictions mimic true dispersal barriers to species and limit training areas to the suite of environments to those which a species is exposed to in nature. Furthermore, these restrictions serve to 'clip' predictions in geographical space, thus removing overpredictions in adjacent geographical regions where the species is known to be absent.

AB Native species that forage in farmland may increase their local abundances thereby affecting adjacent ecosystems within their landscape. We used two decades of ecological data from a protected primary rainforest in Malaysia to illutrate how subsidies from neighboring oil palm plantations triggered powerful secondary 'cascading' effects on natural habitats located >1.3 km away. We found (i) oil palm fruit drove 100-fold increases in crop-raiding native wild boar (Sus scrofa), (ii) wild boar used thousands of understory plants to construct birthing nests in the pristine forest interior, and (iii) nest building caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over the 24-year study period. The long-term, landscape-scale indirect effects from agriculture suggest its full ecological footprint may be larger in extent than is currently recognized. Cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

AB Connectivity losses lead to a reduction of the amount of habitat resources that can be reached and used by species, and hence to a decline in the ranges and abundance of multiple taxa. Despite the recognized important role of small habitat patches for many species inhabiting fragmented landscapes, their potential contribution as stepping stones for maintaining overall landscape connectivity has received less attention. Using connectivity metrics based on a graph-theoretic approach we (i) quantified the connectivity of grassland patches in a sector of the Pampa region in Argentina, using a range of dispersal distances (from 100 to 10,000 m) representative of the scale of dispersal of different species; (ii) identified the most relevant patches for maintaining overall connectivity; and (iii) studied the importance of small patches (defined for different area thresholds of 5, 20, and 50 ha) as connectivity providers in the landscape. Although grassland patches were in general poorly connected at all distances, some of them were critical for overall connectivity and were found to play different crucial roles in the patch network. The location of small patches in the grassland network allowed them to function as stepping stones, yielding significant connectivity gains for species that move large distances (> 5000 m) for the three area thresholds considered. Thus, under the spatial pattern of the studied landscape, species that move long distances would benefit from stepping stones, while less mobile organisms would benefit from, and mostly rely on the largest patches. We recommend that future management activities should (i) aim at preserving the grassland patches with the highest potential as stepping stones to promote landscape-level connectivity; and (ii) pay more attention to the conservation of key small patches, particularly given that usually they are those more vulnerable to land clearing for agriculture.

AB 1. Fungi play critical roles in ecosystem processes and interact with plant communities in mutualistic, pathogenic, and commensal ways. Fungal communities are thought to depend on both associated tree communities and soil properties. However, the relative importance of the biotic and abiotic drivers of soil fungal community structure and diversity in lowland tropical forests remains poorly understood.
   2. We examined the community structure of trees and fungi at different levels of phosphorus (0.17-16.3 mg kg(-1)) in moist tropical forests in Panama. We predicted that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal composition would be more strongly associated with soil properties than with local tree communities while the composition of other fungal clades would be more strongly correlated with local tree communities than soil properties. We also predicted that fungal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness would be negatively correlated with soil fertility and positively correlated with tree species diversity within and among forests.
   3. We characterized soil chemistry, fine root biomass, and sequenced the ITS1 barcode region to describe fungal community composition from 70 soil cores across three 1-ha tropical rainforest sites in Panama. The sites vary in soil chemistry, including P, and in tree species community composition, but experience similar annual rainfall.
   4. AM fungal community composition was partially correlated with soil chemistry (r = 0.32, P = 0.001), but not with local tree communities, while non-AM fungal communities were nearly equally correlated with soil chemistry (Partial Mantel test, r = 0.38, P = 0.001) as with tree communities (r = 0.36, P = 0.001). Linear models showed that AM OTU richness was not explained by any independent variable. For non-AM fungi, phosphorus, pH, and soil moisture better predicted OTU richness across all cores than other biotic and abiotic factors.
   5. Synthesis. Our results show that AM fungal structure is driven primarily by soil chemistry. For non-AM fungi, soil properties and the local tree community can play a joint role in structuring communities. Furthermore, we found that more diverse local tree communities did not harbour more fungal species. Our results suggest that soil properties act as an environmental filter for both trees and fungi, setting the stage for interactions between the two.

AB Effects of plantation forestry on biodiversity are controversially discussed in literature. While some authors stress positive effects, others tend to attribute a largely negative influence to plantations. One important factor steering the influence on biodiversity are management practices. A second important factor is the environmental matrix. Chile offers the option to analyse both factors jointly. The coastal range of central Chile has experienced rapid and widespread replacement of native Nothofagus spp. forests in favour of Pinus radiata plantations. Here, native forests remain limited to small patches surrounded by an environmental matrix of plantations. Management is rather intensive and not designed to maintain biodiversity. While in the coastal range of central Chile the transformation from native forests to non-native tree plantations has almost come to an end, spatial extension of P. contorta and P. ponderosa plantations has just recently begun in Chilean Patagonia. While the management is similar to central Chile, plantations rather exist as small patches surrounded by an environmental matrix of native plant formations (e.g. Nothofagus spp. forests and Nothofagus spp. scrublands). In the framework of this work, effects of the two diametric land usages on biodiversity are assessed and compared. Biodiversity is assessed at the alpha-, beta- and gamma-scale. At the alpha-scale, biodiversity impacts are inferred statistically, using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's PostHoc test. Biodiversity of plants at both sites is significantly reduced in plantations when compared to native forests or scrublands. Plantation forestry lowers alpha-biodiversity and does not provide additional habitats for specialists. At the beta-scale, weak edge effects due to the presence of native forests are observed. In total, plantation forestry tends to promote plant invasions and impairs the survival of endemics. At the gamma-scale, plant species communities where predominantly native and endemic in forests, predominantly introduced in plantations. Positive effects of the more native environmental matrix in Patagonia are not found to be stronger than in central Chile, therefore it is concluded that management imposes a much stronger influence. Results show, that the biodiversity impacts in Central Chile are transferable to Chilean Patagonia, where plantation forestry is increasingly established. (C) 2017 Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

AB Rodent preference for scatter-hoarding large seeds has been widely considered to favor the evolution of large seeds. Previous studies supporting this conclusion were primarily based on observations at earlier stages of seed dispersal, or on a limited sample of successfully established seedlings. Because seed dispersal comprises multiple dispersal stages, we hypothesized that differential foraging preference on seed size by animal dispersers at different dispersal stages would ultimately result in medium-sized seeds having the highest dispersal success rates. In this study, by tracking a large number of seeds for 5yr, we investigated the effects of seed size on seed fates from seed removal to seedling establishment of a dominant plant Pittosporopsis kerrii (Icacinaceae) dispersed by scatter-hoarding rodents in tropical forest in southwest China. We found that small seeds had a lower survival rate at the early dispersal stage where more small seeds were predated at seed stations and after removal; large seeds had a lower survival rate at the late dispersal stage, more large seeds were recovered, predated after being cached, or larder-hoarded. Medium-sized seeds experienced the highest dispersal success. Our study suggests that differential foraging preferences by scatter-hoarding rodents at different stages of seed dispersal could result in conflicting selective pressures on seed size and higher dispersal success of medium-sized seeds.

AB Conflicts between local people's livelihoods and conservation have led to many unsuccessful conservation efforts and have stimulated debates on policies that might simultaneously promote sustainable management of protected areas and improve the living conditions of local people. Many government-sponsored payments-for-ecosystem-services (PES) schemes have been implemented around the world. However, few empirical assessments of their effectiveness have been conducted, and even fewer assessments have directly measured their effects on ecosystem services. We conducted an empirical and spatially explicit assessment of the conservation effectiveness of one of the world's largest PES programs through the use of a long-term empirical data set, a satellite-based habitat model, and spatial autoregressive analyses on direct measures of change in an ecosystem service (i.e., the provision of wildlife species habitat). Giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) habitat improved in Wolong Nature Reserve of China after the implementation of the Natural Forest Conservation Program. The improvement was more pronounced in areas monitored by local residents than those monitored by the local government, but only when a higher payment was provided. Our results suggest that the effectiveness of a PES program depends on who receives the payment and on whether the payment provides sufficient incentives. As engagement of local residents has not been incorporated in many conservation strategies elsewhere in China or around the world, our results also suggest that using an incentive-based strategy as a complement to command-and-control, community- and norm-based strategies may help achieve greater conservation effectiveness and provide a potential solution for the park versus people conflict.
   Efectos de los Pagos por Servicios Ambientales sobre la Recuperacion del Habitat de la Faun Los conflictos entre el bienestar de los habitantes locales y la conservacion han derivado en numerosos esfuerzos de conservacion sin exito y han estimulado los debates sobre las politicas que pueden simultaneamente promover el manejo sustentable de las areas protegidas y mejorar las condiciones de vida de los locales. En todo el mundo se han implementado muchas estrategias de pagos por servicios ambientales (PSA) patrocinados por el gobierno. Sin embargo, se han realizado pocas evaluaciones de su efectividad, y muchas menos se han realizado para medir directamente sus efectos sobre los servicios ambientales. Realizamos una evaluacion empirica y espacialmente explicita de la efectividad de conservacion de uno de los programas de PSA mas grandes del mundo por medio del uso de un conjunto de datos empiricos a largo plazo, un modelo de habitat con base satelital y analisis espaciales auto-regresivos sobre las medidas directas del cambio en un servicio ambiental (es decir, el suministro de habitat para especies de fauna). El habitat del panda gigante (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) mejoro en la Reserva Natural Wolong en China despues de la implementacion del Programa de Conservacion de Bosques Naturales. La mejoria fue mas pronunciada en las areas monitoreadas por los residentes locales que en aquellas monitoreadas por el gobierno local, pero solamente cuando se proporciono un pago mayor. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la efectividad del programa de PSA depende de quien recibe el pago y si el pago proporciona incentivos suficientes. Mientras el compromiso de los residentes locales no se ha incorporado a muchas estrategias de conservacion en otras partes de China o del mundo, nuestros resultados tambien sugieren que el uso de una estrategia basada en incentivos como complemento a estrategias basadas en comando-y-control, comunidad y normas puede ayudar a alcanzar una mayor efectividad de conservacion y a proporcionar una solucion potencial para el conflicto de parque versus personas.

AB International conservation donors have spent at least $3.4 billion to protect biodiversity and stem tropical deforestation in Africa since the early 1990s. Despite more than two decades of experience, however, there is little research on the effect of this aid at a region-wide scale. Numerous case studies exist, but show mixed results. Existing research is usually based on community perception or focused on short-term donor objectives rather than specific conservation outcomes, like deforestation rates. Thus, the impact of billions of dollars of conservation aid on deforestation rates remains an open question. This article uses an original dataset to analyze the effect of international conservation aid on deforestation rates in 42 African countries between 2000 and 2013. We first describe patterns of conservation aid across the continent and then assess its impact (with one to five-year lags), controlling for other factors that may also affect deforestation, including rural population, protected areas (PAs), governance, and other economic and commodity production variables. We find that conservation aid is associated with higher rates of forest loss after one-or two-year lags. A similar result holds for PA extent, suggesting possible displacement of deforestation from PAs. However, governance quality in high forest cover countries moderates these effects such that deforestation rates are reduced. Rural population is the most consistent factor associated with forest loss, confirming previous studies of this driver. Our results suggest that in heavily forested countries, development projects designed to support conservation work initially in conditions of good governance, but that conservation aid alone is insufficient to mitigate larger deforestation drivers.

AB 1. Biotic interactions of plants can have legacy effects mediated by changes in plant traits and soil characteristics. Legacy effects are defined as effects that persist after the causal biotic interaction ceases, because plant traits and soil characteristics are plastic and modifications may be maintained for long time periods. 2. To date, studies on biotic interactions of plants with above- and below-ground organisms and their plant-mediated interactions have mainly focused on short-term effects in the continuous presence of interacting organisms. 3. Little is known about how long the changes in plant traits and soil characteristics persist after the biotic interaction ceases and indirectly affect future biotic interactions and community assembly. Further, since some organisms switch between above- and below-ground compartments during ontogeny, impacts on soil-dwelling larval stages can have direct legacy effects on their above-ground adult stages and vice versa. 4. Elucidating legacy effects of biotic interactions above and below the ground will provide a deeper insight into a better understanding of the importance of plant trait- and soil characteristic-mediated indirect interactions in shaping community assembly, biodiversity and ecosystem function.

AB Although several studies have reported rates of deforestation and spatial patterns of native forest fragmentation, few have focused on the role of natural forest regeneration and exotic tree plantations on landscape dynamics. The objective of this study was to analyze the dynamics of land cover change in order to test the hypothesis that exotic tree plantations have caused a major transformation of temperate forest cover in southern Chile during the last three decades. We used three Landsat satellite images taken in 1985 (TM), 1999 (ETM+), and 2011 (TM) to quantify land cover change, together with a set of landscape indicators to describe the spatial configuration of land cover. Our results showed that the major changes were dynamic conversion among forest, exotic tree plantation and shrubland. During the study period, the area covered by exotic tree plantations increased by 168% (20,896-56,010 ha), at an annual rate of 3.8%, mostly at the expense of native forest and shrubland. There was a total gross loss of native forest of 30% (54,304 ha), but a net loss of initial cover of only 5.1% (9130 ha), at an annual net deforestation rate of 0.2%. The difference between gross and net loss of native forest was mostly the result of conversion of shrubland and agricultural and pasture land to secondary forest following natural regeneration. Over the course of the study period, exotic tree plantations showed a constant increase in patch density, total edge length, nearest-neighbor distance, and largest patch index; maximum mean patch size occurred in the middle of the study period. Native forest exhibited an increase and then a decrease in patch density and total edge length, whereas mean patch size and largest patch index were lowest in the middle of the period. Overall, the observed trends indicate expansion of exotic tree plantations and increase in native forest loss and fragmentation, particularly between 1985 and 1999. Forest loss included both old-growth and secondary forests, while native forest established after secondary succession differed in diversity, structure, and functionality from old-growth and old growth/secondary forests. Since different successional stages influence the provision of ecosystem services, the changes observed in our study are likely to have consequences for humans that extend beyond immediate changes in land use patterns.

AB Processes allowing coexistence of trees and grasses in tropical savannas have long intrigued ecologists. Early theories focused on climatic controls, but a conceptual model has emerged suggesting that savanna trees are subject to a fire-mediated recruitment bottleneck, with frequent fires preventing recruitment of saplings into the tree layer and maintaining biomass well below its climate-determined upper bound. We propose that this conceptual model has been overemphasised in northern Australia, where tree abundance is more strongly controlled by water availability. The dominant trees, eucalypts, have a remarkable capacity to grow through the 'fire trap' to reach fire-resistant sizes. This fire tolerance makes eucalypts relatively unresponsive to management-imposed reductions in fire frequency and intensity. Other trees in these savannas are typically more fire sensitive and respond positively to such management. There are suggestions that savanna fire management could lead to increases in woody biomass, but we contend that if tree biomass is strongly limited by water availability, then potential increases in tree biomass are relatively limited, at least in relation to the dominant eucalypt component. There is potential to increase the biomass of the more fire-sensitive non-eucalypts, but the upper bound of non-eucalypt tree biomass in these eucalypt-dominated systems remains poorly understood.

AB The importance of positive interactions between species within natural ecosystems and species associated with traditional agriculture is well recognized. However, modern agriculture generally depends on monocultures, where positive interactions between cultivated species (ie in which the presence of one species facilitates the survival, growth, or reproduction of other species) are largely ignored. Here, we review recent studies focused on the positive interactions between cultivated species, consider how three traditional agricultural systems (legume-cereal intercropping, rice-fish co-culture, and agroforestry) have benefited from such interactions, and examine how these benefits are affected by climate, planting patterns, and field management. Finally, we propose a framework to illustrate how these interactions may improve modern agriculture through: the selection of species-species partnerships; the development of specialized field machinery (in each case); field structure and configuration; field management; and farmer and societal acceptance.

AB Aim
   The application of island biogeography theory in habitat fragmentation research assumes a simple relationship between species richness and fragment area. However, previous work has suggested that in some cases thresholds can be detected, at which the form of the island species-area relationship (ISAR) changes abruptly. Piecewise regression has been advocated as a suitable statistical technique to model such thresholds. Here we first provide a comparative analysis of piecewise regression models to determine the prevalence and type of thresholds in habitat island ISARs. Second, we evaluate piecewise regression as a method for locating thresholds in the ISAR, with particular emphasis on the implications of data transformation.
   Location
   World-wide.
   Methods
   Seventy-six habitat island datasets were sourced from the literature. An information theoretic approach was employed to compare linear regression ISAR models with piecewise regression models. The models were applied to untransformed (species-area), semi-log (species-log area) and log-log (log species-log area) data. Three types of piecewise regression models were evaluated: continuous, discontinuous and zero slope. Model performance was compared using the Akaike information criterion. We also examined the influence on model performance of taxon, number of habitat islands, and area of smallest island.
   Results
   Linear regression models performed best, although piecewise models were preferred in a number of cases. Cases in which no model was significant were most prevalent in untransformed space relative to the semi-log and log-log transformations. Piecewise fits were more prevalent in datasets with a larger numbers of islands.
   Main conclusions
   Data transformation is a key part of model selection and needs to be explicitly considered, especially in terms of drawing inferences from models. Piecewise models, even if selected as the favoured model in our analyses, were often ecologically unintelligible in relation to area alone. When detected, breakpoint values ranged over five orders of magnitude, although with one exception all were under 50ha. Our findings highlight the limitations of using individual threshold values to inform conservation practice.

AB Emergent neutrality is the idea in community ecology that species interactions may drive a system in a direction where some species become so similar that this similarity will be the primary cause for their coexistence instead of niche differentiation. A recent, widely cited model of emergent neutrality is by Scheffer and van Nes, later applied to species abundance distribution patterns by Vergnon et al. We take issue with the ecological interpretation of this model, demonstrating that it in fact presupposes important differences between superficially similar-looking species. We argue that the temptation to interpret the model as one of emergent neutrality stems from the fact that these differences are unmodeled and therefore hidden, obscuring the underlying coexistence mechanisms. We therefore claim that the model is actually one of hidden niches, and present several alternative ways to make its hidden portions more explicit. These alterations to the model also make its proper interpretation as one of hidden niches more transparent. We also polemize with the claim of Vergnon et al. that multimodality in species abundance distributions is support for their emergent neutrality model: we demonstrate that appropriate stochastic versions of classical resource partitioning or even neutral models can lead to such patterns in a robust way. Observation of these patterns is therefore inconclusive as to the underlying mechanisms that generate them.

AB Studies on climate impacts on tree annual growth are mainly restricted to marginal sites. To date, the climate effects on annual growth of trees in favorable environments remain therefore unclear despite the importance of these sites in terms of forest productivity. Because species respond differently to climate, comparing a multitude of species further enhances our knowledge on climate impacts on tree growth and forest productivity.
   We present a first study that reveals to what extent radial growth is limited by climate and the groundwater table across 10 temperate tree species growing on a uniform, productive soil (i.e. high nutrient and water contents) in the Netherlands. We ranked our study species according to their shade tolerance, which is associated with species' resource requirements and growth rates, and examined their annual growth using tree-ring analysis. This allowed us to investigate how these species with diverse ecological backgrounds differ in their growth response to precipitation, temperature, irradiance, potential evapotranspiration (PET), and the groundwater table, when growing under similar and favorable site conditions.
   Nine out of 10 species had strikingly similar radial growth rates (on average 3.9-4.8 mm yr(-1)), which contradicts the widely established trade-off between shade tolerance and growth. Populus trichocarpa, the least shade-tolerant of our species, however grew much faster (on average 6.8 mm yr(-1)). Trees of all species reduced their growth significantly during dry summers, driven by low rainfall and high PET. Yet, the magnitude of their growth responses to climate conditions and especially the groundwater table differed across species. Receding groundwater tables significantly and strongly reduced radial growth of the shade-intolerant species, but not of the shade-tolerant species. The climate impacts on growth were not associated with variation in shade tolerance across our species.
   Our study demonstrates that even on a productive forest site, summer droughts reduced radial growth across a multitude of common tree species, whereas lower groundwater tables only affected the shade-intolerant species significantly. Thus, the productivity of forests in favorable environments may be seriously affected when summers in north western Europe become hotter and drier as predicted by climate models.

AB Amazonia now contains vast areas of secondary forest because of widespread regeneration following timber harvests, yet the value of secondary forest to wildlife remains poorly understood. Secondary forest becomes structurally similar to primary forest after abandonment, and therefore we predicted that avian movement across the interface of primary and secondary forest (hereafter "the interface") would gradually increase with time since abandonment until recovery to pre-isolation levels. From 1992 to 2011, we captured 2,773 understory birds of 10 foraging guilds along the interface of primary forest fragments and zero- to 30-year-old secondary forest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project near Manaus, Brazil. Our objectives were to understand the differences in land-use history that affect cross-interface movement and to determine how long it takes each guild to recover to pre-isolation capture rates. Across guilds, age of secondary forest within 100 m of the interface was the most important explanatory variable affecting capture rates; rates increased with age of secondary forest for all guilds except non-forest species. Mean recovery to pre-isolation was 26 years (asymmetric SE = 13 years below and 16 years above estimate) after secondary forest abandonment and 9 of 10 guilds recovered within 13 to 34 years. In the slowest guild to recover, terrestrial insectivores, 6 of 12 species were never caught along the interface, and we projected that this guild would recover in 60 years. Our recovery estimates quantify the dynamic permeability of the interface and contribute to a better understanding of the value of secondary forests as corridors among primary forest fragments.

AB Shade tolerance can be defined as the light level at which plants can survive and possibly grow. This light level is referred to as the whole-plant light compensation point (LCP). The LCP depends on multiple leaf and architectural traits. We are still uncertain how often interspecific trait differences allow species to specialize for separate light niches, as observed between shade-tolerant species and light-demanding species. Alternatively, trait plasticity may allow many species to grow in similar light conditions. We measured leaf and architectural traits of up to 1.5-year-old seedlings of 15 sympatric Psychotria shrub species grown at three light levels. We used a 3D plant model to estimate the impacts of leaf traits, architectural traits and plant size on the whole-plant light compensation point (LCPplant). Plant growth rates were estimated from destructive harvests and allometric relationships. At lower light levels, plants of all species achieved a lower leaf light compensation point (LCPleaf). The light interception efficiency (LIE), an index of self-shading, decreased with increasing plant size and was therefore lower in high-light treatments where plants grew more rapidly. When corrected for size, LIE was lower in the low-light treatment, possibly as a result of lower investments in woody support. Species did not show trade-offs in growth under low- and high-light conditions, because species with the greatest plasticity in LCPplant and underlying traits (LCPleaf and LIE) achieved the highest growth rates at lower light levels. Synthesis. The interspecific differences in LCPplant did not result in a growth or survival trade-off between low- and high-light conditions. Instead, these differences were more than offset by the greater plasticity in LCPplant in some species, which was driven by greater plasticity in both leaves and architecture. The most plastic species achieved the fastest growth at different light levels. The results show that plasticity largely neutralizes the separation of light niches amongst species in this forest understorey genus and imply that differential preferences of species for either gaps or forest understorey occur in later life phases or are driven by other stress factors than low light alone.

AB The Matrix model uses transition matrices to predict future plant and animal population structures. Having been used to study the dynamics of forests all over the world, the Matrix model is thriving in forestry, with applications covering a wide array of areas. Despite its extensive application in forestry, the Matrix model is still suffering from a lack of due attention and appropriate understanding, especially on its advantages and limitations in comparison with those of other forest dynamics models. To facilitate further research and applications, a synthetic review of Matrix models is provided here with an emphasis on its mathematical properties and relationship with other forest dynamics models. In this article, we first introduce the general structure of Matrix models and its representation of forest dynamics components, i.e., upgrowth, mortality, and recruitment. Then, we summarize key properties of Matrix models, including basic assumptions, density dependence, size class width and time step, and the estimation of forest dynamics components will be summarized. Next, we evaluate advantages and limitations of the Matrix model and its relationship with other forest dynamics models. Finally, we share our perspective on the major challenges and future outlooks of Matrix models. FOR. SCI. 59(3):359-378.

   GUIDE
AB Functional connectivity, which represents the animal movement responses to landscape elements, should be considered when configuring protected areas. Each habitat patch has a different contribution to functional connectivity. Functional connectivity can be accessed through the Integral Index of Connectivity (IIC), which considers the habitat patch size, the amount of flux arriving to that patch, and the topological position of the patch within the habitat patch network. These four measures can be used as distinct criteria of functional connectivity to prioritise habitat patches. We analyzed how the spatial patterns of habitat patches varied according to these criteria. For each criterion, we ranked all habitat patches within five levels of importance, and identified whether priority habitat patches are protected. We found a positive relationship between the level of importance and the presence of core areas and corridors. Stepping stones presented the opposite relationship. For each criterion, only the highest levels of importance presented more core areas than connector areas (corridors and stepping stones). In the higher level of importance, core areas are mostly under strictly protected areas (IUCN categories I-IV), while connector areas are under the less restrictive category of sustainable use protected areas (SUAs, IUCN category V). Brazilian decision makers must consider the opportunity to protect connector areas under restrictive SUM categories, such as Private Natural Heritage Reserve (IUCN category IV). Combine IIC and spatial patterns of habitat patches proved to be helpful to identify priority habitat patches for conservation and to indicate which class/category of protected areas should be established.

AB This work synthesizes results from the application of land cover classification techniques and probability sampling of satellite imagery for estimating forest extent and deforestation in Lake Maracaibo Basin (Venezuela and Colombia). A forest map was produced using a semi-automated supervised classification routine on MODIS 8-day 500-m imagery acquired in January 2010. Results show that forests occupy 29,710 km(2) which represents 38% of the basin's total terrestrial landmass. From this extent, 61% belongs to Venezuela and 39% falls within the Colombian region. Findings indicate a drastic decrease in forest cover as a result of anthropogenic agricultural and urban expansion, especially when compared to its potential extent within the 'Maracaibo dry forests' and the 'Venezuelan Andean montane forests' ecoregions. Using time series of Landsat imagery, deforestation rates for the 1985-2010 time period were calculated. The analysis was performed on 24 samples blocks of 10 x 10 km(2) randomly allocated within previously defined change probability strata. The general spatial distribution of deforestation rates was predicted by a simple regression model between sample blocks and prior change probabilities at the basin scale. Our results indicate that deforestation was low (<0.5%/y) in 85% of the basin, with highly focalized deforestation fronts (intermediate-to-high rates, <2.5%/y) in three regions: a) the Motatan river sub-basin in the Eastern Cordillera, b) the lower slopes of the Catatumbo river sub-basin and c) the submontane regions of the Apon and Santa Ana river sub-basins. The results of this paper lead the way for understanding current patterns in socioeconomic drivers of forest clearing in Lake Maracaibo Basin. The study also demonstrates the feasibility of using alternatives methods to the time-consuming and financially unsustainable methods traditionally used at national and sub-national scale in Venezuela and other Latin American countries.

AB Understanding the process by which limiting resources are incorporated into populations is a major goal of ecology. While many studies have examined this dynamic process using essential resources like homes, few of these studies have involved homes that can be transported by their occupants. This study introduced over a thousand transportable homes into a population of terrestrial hermit crabs Coenobita compressus, animals that carry their homes with them wherever they travel. These new homes were tracked between years to test key predictions about the temporal dynamics the homes would generate, and the spatial and structural changes the homes would undergo as they were used by the population. When moving into new homes, crabs dropped off their old homes directly at the exchange site, and the number of such traded-in homes peaked rapidly in time. Traded-in homes were under half the diameter of new homes, a difference apparently magnified by social formations involving vacancy chains. After crabs moved into new homes, they carried the homes away from the exchange site. The following year, these homes were displaced a distance four orders of magnitude times their diameter, thus penetrating extensively through the population. Between years, crabs also remodeled the internal architecture of the homes, creating homes that were more spacious and less of a burden to carry. These results suggest that transportable homes generate novel ecological dynamics along temporal, spatial and structural dimensions, which are a direct consequence of their transportability.

AB Despite the great interest in characterizing the functional structure and resilience of functional groups in natural communities, few studies have examined in which way the roles and relationships of coexisting species change during community succession, a fundamental and natural process that follows the release of new resources in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Variation in algal traits that characterize different phases and stages of community succession on rocky shores are likely to influence the magnitude, direction of effects, and the level of redundancy and complementarity in the diverse assemblage of herbivores. Two separate field experiments were conducted to quantify per capita and population effects and the functional relationship (i.e., redundancy or complementarity) of four herbivore species found in central Chile during early and late algal succession. The first experiment examined grazer effects on the colonization and establishment of early-succession algal species. The second experiment examined effects on the late-successional, dominant corticated alga Mazzaella laminarioides. Complementary laboratory experiments with all species and under natural environmental conditions allowed us to further characterize the collective effects of these species. We found that, during early community succession, all herbivore species had similar effects on the ephemeral algae, ulvoids, but only during the phase of colonization. Once these algae were established, only a subset of the species was able to control their abundance. During late succession, only the keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa could control corticated Mazzaella. The functional relationships among these species changed dramatically from redundant effects on ephemeral algae during early colonization, to a more complementary role on established early-successional algae, to a dominant (i.e., keystone) effect on late succession. This study highlights that functional relationship within consumer assemblages can vary at different phases and times of community succession. Differentiation in herbivore roles emphasizes the need to evaluate consumer's impacts through different times of community succession, and through experimental manipulations to make even broad predictions about the resilience or vulnerability of diverse intertidal assemblages to human disturbances.

AB We present a model predicting how the species richness and diversity within benthic functional groups should vary across the full environmental stress gradient across which a regional biota from marine rocky shores can occur. Built upon previous models, our model makes predictions for sessile species (macroalgae and filter feeders), herbivores, and carnivores. We tested some of its predictions by surveying vertical (intertidal elevation) and horizontal (wave exposure and ice scour) stress gradients in northern Nova Scotia, Canada. Because of harsh winter conditions, these coasts only depict approximately intermediate-to-high yearly levels of stress that the cold-temperate, rocky intertidal biota from the northwestern Atlantic can experience. The observed trends matched predictions for sessile species in 75% of the studied gradients, and showed a moderate agreement for herbivores and carnivores only when they were combined as mobile consumers. Agreement meant that both richness and diversity increased from the most stressful to the most benign habitats that can be found in northern Nova Scotia. Also as predicted, sessile species generally showed a faster rate of increase in richness than mobile consumers. Our model also predicted a higher overall richness for sessile species than for mobile consumers, which was true by a factor of 3. Therefore, our model may constitute a useful tool to understanding community composition as a function of abiotic stress, which may in turn facilitate studies on community functioning. Model predictions for lower stress ranges could be tested on more southern shores where the same regional biota occurs.

AB P>1. The long term impacts of historical land use on montane tropical forest tree species composition and structure is unknown. We used old plantation survey maps of 19th century coffee plantations in the Blue and Port Royal Mountains of Jamaica to investigate the effects of land use history on forest tree species composition and structure after 150-170 years of re-growth.
   2. We sampled trees (>= 10 cm d.b.h.) in montane forests along eight 200 m x 5 m transects that ran across old plantation boundaries. We assumed that agriculture had been abandoned for at least 150 years in the old plantations, based on the present forest cover which has now re-grown to resemble old growth forest, and that what was described as forest on old maps remained forested throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Transects were located in montane forests between 1100 and 1500 m elevation, except for one transect which was in lower montane forest at 600 m elevation. For data analysis, transects were divided into three equal lengths, representing three forest types: old plantation, old edge and old growth.
   3. There was no difference between old growth forest and old plantation forest or old edge forest in species density, endemic species richness or basal area. However we found a significantly higher percentage of individuals of endemic species in the old growth forest type.
   4. The species composition of large and medium sized stems (20.1-95.0 cm) in the three forest types was different. The similarity between forest types of species with small stems (10-20 cm) suggests that succession follows an equilibrium model.
   5. Synthesis. Old growth tropical montane forests are still different from forests on adjacent old plantations after 150-170 years of re-growth in having a higher percentage of individuals of endemic tree species, and in the tree species composition of large and medium-sized stems. While these old-secondary forests are not identical to old growth forest, they can have similar species density and basal area to old growth forests after two-centuries.

AB Indirect effects of trophic interactions on biodiversity can be large and common, even in complex communities. Previous experiments with dominant understory Piper shrubs in a Costa Rican rain forest revealed that increases in herbivore densities on these shrubs caused widespread seedling mortality as a result of herbivores moving from Piper to seedlings of many different plant genera. We tested components of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis by conducting focused studies on the effects of specialist and generalist Piper herbivores on local seedling diversity. Whereas specialist herbivores are predicted to increase mortality to neighboring seedlings that are closely related to the source plant, true generalists moving from source plants may cause density-dependent mortality of many species, and possibly increase richness if new species replace abundant species that have been thinned by herbivores. Therefore, we hypothesized that seedling richness would be greater in understory control plots created in patches of Piper that had normal densities of generalist herbivores compared to plots from which we removed generalist herbivores manually from all Piper shrubs. After 15 months, generalist-herbivore-removal plots had >40% fewer seedlings,>40% fewer species, and 40% greater seedling evenness, on average, than control plots with generalist herbivores intact. Using a complementary approach in unmanipulated plots in four forests, we used path analysis to test for a positive association between seedling diversity and herbivore damage on Piper species. In unmanipulated plots, for both generalist and specialist herbivores, our data were significant fits to the causal model that Piper herbivores decrease evenness and increase plant species richness, corroborating the experimental results. Because herbivores changed how individuals were apportioned among the species and families present (lower evenness), one interpretation of these associations between herbivores on Piper shrubs and local seedling richness is that high seedling mortality in dominant families allowed the colonization or survival of less common species. If interspecific or apparent competition allowed for a relative increase in species richness, then the Janzen-Connell hypothesis may extend its predictions to generalist seedling predators. We speculate that apparent competition may explain some of the deviations from neutral model predictions, especially at small scales.

AB Many experimental studies show that a decline in species number has a negative effect on ecosystem function, however less is known about this pattern in natural communities. We examined the relative importance of environment, space, and diversity on ecosystem function, specifically tree carbon storage in four plant types (understory/canopy; trees/palms), in a tropical forest in central Panama. The objectives of this study were to detect the relationship between tree diversity and carbon storage given the environmental and spatial variation that occur in natural forests and to determine which species diversity measure is more important to tree carbon storage: richness or dominance. We used redundancy analyses to partition the effect of these sources of variation on tree carbon storage. We showed that together, environment, space, and diversity accounted for 43 percent of tree carbon storage, where diversity (19%) alone is the most important source of variation and explained more variation than space (13%) and environment (1%) together. Therefore, even in natural forests where substantial environment and spatial variation can be found, it is still possible to detect the effect of diversity on ecosystem function at scales relevant to conservation. Moreover, both richness and dominance are important to explain the variation on tree carbon storage in natural forests suggesting that these two diversity measures are complementary. Thus, tree diversity is important to predict tree carbon storage in hyperdiverse forests.

AB The relationship between wood growth and environmental variability at the tropical treeline of North America was investigated using automated, solar-powered sensors (a meteorological station and two dendrometer clusters) installed on Nevado de Colima, Mexico (19 degrees 35' N, 103 degrees 37' W, 3,760 m a.s.l.). Pure stands of Pinus hartwegii Lindl. (Mexican mountain pine) were targeted because of their suitability for tree-ring analysis in low-latitude, high-elevation, North American Monsoon environments. Stem size and hydroclimatic variables recorded at half-hour intervals were summarized on a daily timescale. Power outages, insect outbreaks, and sensor failures limited the analysis to non-consecutive months during 2001-2003 at one dendrometer site, and during 2002-2005 at the other. Combined data from the two sites showed that maximum radial growth rates occur in late spring ( May), as soil temperature increases, and incoming short-wave radiation reaches its highest values. Early season (April-May) radial increment correlated directly with temperature, especially of the soil, and with solar radiation. Stem expansion at the start of the summer monsoon (June-July) was mostly influenced by moisture, and revealed a drought signal, while late season relationships were more varied.

AB There are many variables within an urban landscape that can be expected to influence faunal diversity. We used a mechanistic approach to observe the relative importance of each of these variables in describing the diversity of avian communities in urban and peri-urban areas of Cape Town, South Africa situated within Cape Floristic Region, a global plant biodiversity hotspot. We expected to find a strong influence of habitat amount and arrangement across a fragmented urban-rural gradient. Birds were sampled in patches of fragmented Cape Flats Sand Fynbos at 39 locations during the middle of summer (November-January 2008/2009). Environmental data included on-site observations, existing GIS layers, and remotely sensed data. Bird community composition was related to habitat amount, arrangement, and quality. Correlations, partial correlations and structural equation analysis showed that habitat amount and arrangement had insignificant effects on species richness across the urban gradient. Changes in urban density and the presence or absence of the invasive alien tree species Acacia saligna (blue wattle) appeared to be the main drivers of avian species richness. Increasing urban density, decreasing A. saligna density and decreasing canopy height correlated with higher avian species richness, with confounding variables corrected for. For the management of urban biodiversity, our results suggest that the most urgent focus should be on retaining the quality remaining areas of native vegetation (and particularly, containing the spread of A salgina) rather than extending current networks with poor quality habitat. More generally, habitat quality appears to be more important than habitat amount or arrangement in this system. We suggest that this observation be encorporated into further research to more effectively predict avian responses to landscape change and that more must be done to adequately capture the critical and complex role of the matrix in terrestrial systems.

AB The most rapidly expanding habitat globally is the urban habitat, yet the origin and life histories of the populations of native species that inhabit this habitat remain poorly understood. We use DNA barcoding of the COI gene in the widespread native pest ant Tapinoma sessile to test two hypotheses regarding the origin of urban populations and traits associated with their success. First, we determine if urban samples of T. sessile have a single origin from natural populations by looking at patterns of haplotype clustering fromacross their range. Second, we examine whether polygynous colony structure - a trait associated with invasion success - is correlated with urban environments, by studying the lineage dependence of colony structure. Our phylogenetic analysis of 49 samples identified four well supported geographic clades. Within clades, Kimura-2 parameter pairwise genetic distances revealed <2.3% variation; however, between clade genetic distances were 7.5-10.0%, suggesting the possibility of the presence of cryptic species. Our results indicate that T. sessile has successfully colonized urban environments multiple times. Additionally, polygynous colony structure is a highly plastic trait across habitat, clade, and haplotype. In short, T. sessile has colonized urban habitats repeatedly and appears to do so using life history strategies already present in more natural populations. Whether similar results hold for other species found in urban habitats has scarcely begun to be considered.

AB When grown in a common light environment, the leaves of shade-tolerant evergreen trees have a larger leaf mass per unit area (LMA) than their light-demanding counterparts, associated with differences in lifespan. Yet plastic responses of LMA run counter to this pattern: shade leaves have smaller LMA than sun leaves, despite often living longer.
   We measured LMA and cell wall content, and conducted punch and shear tests, on sun and shade leaves of 13 rainforest evergreens of differing shade tolerance, in order to understand adaptation vs plastic responses of leaf structure and biomechanics to shade.
   Species shade tolerance and leaf mechanical properties correlated better with cell wall mass per unit area than with LMA. Growth light environment had less effect on leaf mechanics than on LMA: shade leaves had, on average, 40% lower LMA than sun leaves, but differences in work-to-shear, and especially force-to-punch, were smaller. This was associated with a slightly larger cell wall fraction in shade leaves.
   The persistence of shade leaves might reflect unattractiveness to herbivores because they yield smaller benefits (cell contents per area) per unit fracture force than sun leaves. In forest trees, cell wall fraction and force-to-punch are more robust correlates of species light requirements than LMA.

AB Amongst the factors hypothesized to be responsible for high ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity are resource partitioning and niche differentiation. However, functional differences amongst ectomycorrhizal fungi, which are pre-requisites for resource partitioning, are known primarily from lab studies; now realistic field experiments are needed in order to establish that these differences exist under field conditions. In this study, Picea engel-mannii seedlings planted in a subalpine clearcut became naturally colonized over the course of 1 y. Then a defined volume of soil around each seedling was injected with N-15-labelled nitrate, ammonium or aspartate. Seedling biomass and N content increased, but N concentration decreased, with percent colonization of root systems. Accumulation of N-15 per unit dry weight was not affected by the proportion of roots colonized but, rather, was influenced by the primary ectomycorrhizal fungus colonizing the seedling. Seedlings colonized by a Wilcoxina sp. accumulated more N-15 per g than seedlings colonized by a Cenococcum sp. The presence of dark septate hyphae in the mantle was associated with lower accumulation of N-15 by seedlings colonized by Amphinema byssoides. Our results demonstrate that the physiological differences required to support the concept of niche differentiation amongst ectomycorrhizal fungi exist in the field.

AB Roads may affect wildlife populations through habitat loss and disturbances, as they create an abrupt linear edge, increasing the proportion of edge exposed to a different habitat. Three types of edge effects have been recognized: abiotic, direct biotic, and indirect biotic.
   We explored the direct biotic edge effects of 3- to 4-m wide roads, and also a previously unrecognized type of edge effect: social. We live-trapped two threatened endemic rodents from Cozumel Island (Oryzomys couesi cozumelae and Reithrodontomys spectabilis) in 16 plots delimited by roads on two sides, to compare edge effects between two adjacent edges (corners), single-edge and interior forest, on life history and social variables.
   No significant edge effects were observed on the life-history variables, with the exception of differences in body condition between males and females of O. c. cozumelae near edges. Both species showed significant and contrasting effects on their social variables.
   O. c. cozumelae was distributed according to its age and sex: the proportion of adults and males was higher in interior than near edges, while juveniles and females were more abundant near edges. More nonreproductive females were present in corners than in single-edge and interior, while the opposite distribution was observed for nonreproductive males.
   The distribution of R. spectabilis was related to its age and reproductive condition, but not to its sex. The proportion of adults was significantly higher in corners, while juveniles were only caught in single-edge and interior quadrants. The proportion of reproductive individuals was higher in edge than interior quadrants, while reproductive females were only present in edge quadrants.
   We found significant differences between the quadrants with the greatest edge exposure in comparison with other quadrants. The social edge effects we identified complement the typology of edge effects recognized in ecological literature. Our study provides insight into the effects that sharp road edges have on biological and social characteristics of small mammal populations, highlighting how such effects vary among species. Our findings have important conservation implications for these threatened species, but are also applicable in a broader context wherever there are abrupt edges caused by linear landscape features.

AB Agroforestry systems deposit great amounts of plant residues on soil and this leads to high levels of soil organic matter content and has increased soil biodiversity and improved its conservation. This study compares the distribution of meso and macrofaunal communities in soil and litter under cacao agroforestry systems and in a natural forest in the southern Bahia state of Brazil. Soil and litter samples were obtained in September 2003, February 2004, and August 2004 in five cacao agroforestry systems. The systems evaluated included: cacao renewed under Erythrina sp. (Erythrina poeppigiana) (CRE); cacao renewed under natural forest (Cabruca, CRF); an old cacao system under Erythrina sp. (OCE); an old cacao system under a natural forest system (Cabruca, OCF) and a cacao germplasm collection area (CGC). As a reference soil and litter under a natural forest (NF) was included. Organisms were collected over a 15-day period with a Berlese-Tullgren apparatus. The density and richness of total fauna varied distinctly according to sites, sampling time and material sampled (soil and litter). 16,409 of fauna were recovered from soil and litter samples and the density of total fauna was 2,094 individuals m(-2) in the litter and 641 individuals m(-2) in the soil. The richness was 11.8 in the litter and 7.5 in the soil. The cacao agroforestry systems adopted for growing cacao in the southern Bahia region of Brazil have beneficial effects on the soil and litter faunal communities, and such systems of cacao cultivation could be considered as a conservation system for soil fauna. The development of a litter layer resulted in higher abundance and diversity of soil fauna.

AB 1. Habitat boundaries can contain high biodiversity because they potentially combine species from two habitat types plus additional boundary specialists. However, most research on animal communities is focused on uniform habitats.
   2. Here, we assessed the degree to which the community change at a habitat edge is determined by the broad-scale spatial transition from one habitat to the other, or by fine-scale environmental influences. We compared the distribution of ground-dwelling spider species from open land to forest with the distribution around stand-alone trees at the boundary, the alpine timberline (Grisons, Switzerland).
   3. Our results showed that spiders were more strongly influenced by local environmental conditions (40% of explained variation) than by the spatial position within the ecotone (24.5% of explained variation, with 15.6% overlap between the two). Spider communities differentiated according to light availability and corresponding changes in the ground vegetation.
   4. Since the small area around a single tree at the studied timberline offered a similar broad spectrum of environmental conditions as the open land and forest together, it provided both habitats for species from the adjoining open land and forest as well as for some possible timberline specialists.
   5. Accordingly, natural habitat boundaries may maintain very contrasting communities by providing a wide range of habitat conditions.

AB Tropical trees may show positive density dependence in fruit set and maturation due to pollen limitation in low-density populations. However, pollen from closely related individuals in the local neighbourhood might reduce fruit set or increase fruit abortion in self-incompatible tree species. We investigated the role of neighbourhood density and genetic relatedness on individual fruit set and abortion in the neotropical tree Jacaranda copaia in a large forest plot in central Panama. Using nested neighbourhood models, we found a strong positive effect of increased conspecific density on fruit set and maturation. However, high neighbourhood genetic relatedness interacted with density to reduce total fruit set and increase the proportion of aborted fruit. Our results imply a fitness advantage for individuals growing in high densities as measured by fruit set, but realized fruit set is lowered by increased neighbourhood relatedness. We hypothesize that the mechanism involved is increased visitation by density-dependent invertebrate pollinators in high-density populations, which increases pollen quantity and carry-over and increases fruit set and maturation, coupled with self-incompatibility at early and late stages due to biparental inbreeding that lowers fruit set and increases fruit abortion. Implications for the reproductive ecology and conservation of tropical tree communities in continuous and fragmented habitats are discussed.

AB Tropical deforestation is one of the most important components of global change. Rates of deforestation in Brazil, the nation with the single largest concentration of tropical forest on Earth, have fluctuated widely over the last twenty years. Based on local knowledge, such fluctuations have been variously attributed to a wide range of factors such as the expansion of cattle ranching and soybean farming, infrastructural expansion and the proliferation of paved and unpaved roads, macroeconomic shocks to the Brazilian economy and international exchange rates. Many, if not all, of these arguments are plausible explanations for temporal variation in deforestation rates, but have to date not been subjected to rigorous statistical testing; this study investigates the potential impact of these variables on Brazilian tropical deforestation over the period 1990-2005. When analysed at the basin-wide scale, nearly all variables were highly inter-correlated through time and were also closely correlated with deforestation rate, but appropriate time-series analysis found no statistical evidence that any of the variables have systematically caused variation in deforestation rates. Power analysis showed that the variables may exert small or medium influences on deforestation rates, but the impacts, if present, are not strong. Future analyses of time series data at finer spatial scales that exploit spatiotemporal variation in deforestation rates and in the hypothesized predictor variables may find significant causal processes that arc overlooked when analysed at the basin-wide scale.

AB Questions: Is species diversity affected in protected areas where human activities are permitted or tolerated? On plots of a fixed size, does stem density alone predict number of species? Are differences in density related to disturbance and altitude?
   Location: Achanakmar-Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve, central India.
   Methods: 42 sites, each with three replicate 10-m radius plots, were examined. All trees (>= 30 cm GBH) in each plot were measured for firth at breast height, alpha-diversity, species richness and evenness were calculated for each site. The sites were ordinated by Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) using relative importance values of component species. Correspondence Analysis was used to broadly delineate communities. Anthropogenic disturbances, were recorded in terms of percentage of trees lopped, scale of lopping, number of domestic livestock dung piles and foot trails (both livestock and people) for each plot.
   Results: The NMS analysis exhibited a near linear arrangement of sites with no evidence of discrete vegetation zones. NMS axes were significantly related to altitude and disturbance scores. With increasing elevation, basal area increased but number of species. alpha-diversity and its components declined monotonically. The number of species and indices of species diversity were positively associated with free lopping and also with total disturbance. Number of species was controlled by stem density only ill plots not dominated by Shorea robusta.
   Conclusions: Recent levels of human disturbance are associated with higher species diversity in this biosphere reserve. There is some evidence that stands at all altitudes follow the same successional pattern to dominance by Shorea. a successional pattern that also results in decreased diversity without disturbance.

AB Spatial subsidies of energy and nutrients can influence the distribution of consumers in riparian habitats. This study compared the abundance and composition of bird assemblages and the availability of volant insect prey within the riparian zone (<= 30 m from the stream) and further inland (100-250 m away) within a secondary forest in monsoonal Hong Kong. Replicated point-counts of birds and insect light trapping were conducted in each zone during the wet and dry season of 2006-2007. The biomass of adult aquatic insects in the riparian zone was nine to 12 times higher than inland during both seasons, however, total insect biomass (aquatic plus terrestrial insects) in the riparian zone was only 49 percent (wet season) and 18 percent (dry season) greater. More birds (both numbers of individuals and species) were recorded in the riparian zone, and this difference was particularly conspicuous during the wet season. Most of the wet-season difference was due to the greater number of insectivorous birds in the riparian zone (123% greater than inland), and may have reflected the relative availability of adult aquatic insects. These findings confirm the importance of riparian zones as feeding habitats for forest birds, and have implications for conservation planning and setting the boundaries of protected areas.

AB Structural and floristic changes of a fire-protected cerrado sensu stricto are described over a 13-year period. The study site is located in a biological reserve (2,800 ha) surrounded by large Pinus spp. and Eucalyptus spp. plantations (36,000 ha), in southwestern Bahia, Brazil. The region occurs in the outer-core of the Cerrado domain, near the Cerrado-Caatinga ecotone, and is mainly occupied by pasture and cropland. Surveys were carried out in 1991 and 2004 in 13 permanent plots (20 x 50 m). Stems with diameter >= 5 cm at 0.30 m above ground level were identified and measured. Floristic changes were significant (Sorensens index = 0.45). Species number rose from 62 to 84 (35.48%). Alpha diversity increased significantly (P > 0.001). New species migrated to the area, and there was an expansion of many fire-sensitive species. Woody layer expanded, increasing 19.09% in density and 14.93% in basal area. Diameter distributions followed a "reversed-j" pattern on both occasions, but differed (P > 0.05) due to a significant increase in the first two size-classes, indicating a high recruitment. Community dynamics was high and had a positive balance between recruitment (3.72% yr(-1)) and mortality (1.93% yr(-1)). Conversely, mean annual increment was very small, 0.096 cm yr(-1) (SD = 0.14; N = 808). Most species, including many dominant ones, had a positive balance in favor of recruitment and low turnover, indicating that although species immigration rate is high (1.42 spp ha(-1)), structural changes in species composition happens at a much slower pace. The surrounding forest plantations are permeable and do not limit species immigration; and may be connecting the reserve with the larger neighboring natural fragments, providing an abundant source for diaspores, and possibly neutralizing any fragmentation effects. Succession is also influenced by the ecotonal condition. The structure and floristics of the cerrado sensu stricto at this site (under present climatic conditions) is fire-dependent.

AB Reef landscapes dominated by canopy-forming species are often irregular mosaics of habitats, with important influences on associated fauna. This study tested if differences in the ecological patterns of mobile fauna inhabiting interspersed (morphologically distinct) algal habitats were altered by the spatial arrangement of reefs of varying proximity to the shoreline. Specifically, prosobranch gastropods were used as models to test that: (1) there were differences in the ecological patterns (species composition and abundances) between three algal habitats (the kelp Ecklonia radiata, fucalean macroalgae, and erect red algae); (2) the magnitude of these differences depended on the position of reef lines ('in-shore' vs. 'off-shore'); and (3) these effects were regionally consistent across a similar to 4 degrees latitudinal gradient (similar to 600 km of coastline) in Western Australia. The ecological patterns of algal-associated gastropods responded strongly to the presence of algal habitats with different physical structure at small spatial scales. importantly, differences in assemblage structure (e.g. differences in total abundances) between habitats across the latitudinal gradient were especially accentuated on the in-shore reefs compared with the off-shore reefs, where a general amelioration of differences between habitats was observed, probably associated with a more widespread effect of stronger wave forces across habitats. Overall, red algae supported higher total abundances and species richness (per algal weight) compared to the other algal habitats, particularly on inshore reefs. Patterns for individual species were considerably location-dependent, reflecting the natural variability of species across geographical gradients. In contrast, patterns at the assemblage-level were consistent, providing evidence for the existence of general rules underlying the assemblage-level organization of mobile invertebrates on subtidal reefs across this geographical gradient.

AB Measuring the impacts of indigenous hunting on neotropical wildlife populations remains a difficult task. Significant insights can be gained by analyzing the spatial patterns of hunting yields. This paper presents a geographic analysis of game captured by hunters in 59 households belonging to five neighbouring villages in western Panama over a period of 232 days. The locations of 1269 game kill sites within a hunting zone of 131 km(2) were documented with trained local investigators and then entered into a geographic information system with associated attribute data for analysis. Results show a heavy concentration of kill sites around the study communities. Nearly 90% of the total harvest by weight was captured within just 2 km of hunters' homes. Yet, while several species are captured in large numbers close to home, others are caught closer to the outer peripheries of the shared hunting zone, suggesting that some degree of localized depletion may have occurred. The findings demonstrate the value of mapping the boundaries of hunting zones and game kill sites to assess the impacts of hunting on game species in tropical and other ecosystems and to provide an empirical basis for delimiting conservation zones that balance the use and protection of wildlife in tropical forest regions.

AB The article reviews some of the critical issues for including Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) into a new global climate agreement. Four different REDD models (regimes) are discussed based on two dimensions: scale (national vs. project) and funding (market vs. funds). One of the most troublesome issues concerns setting national baselines (= emission quotas). Research provides few definite answers on how to do this, yet it has huge implications for the possible payments to developing Countries. The paper argues that the expectations about (lie magnitude of such transfers are unrealistically high, and may reduce the prospect for reaching an agreement and increase the chances for 'hot air' from the South.

AB As matrices form the major component of landscapes mosaics, assessing regeneration suitability for native species within matrices is relevant for conservation and mandatory if native remnant patches are scarce, small and contain endemic species. In central Chile, we compared in two consecutive years (2001/2002-2002/2003), seed germination and seedling establishment of Cryptocarya alba (Mol.) Looser the most dominant specie in seedling stage, in both the native Coastal Maulino Forest and in the matrix composed of Pinus radiata D. Don plantations. We also tested in the laboratory, whether watering with leachate of soil extract of P. radiata plantations had allelopathic effects on C. alba seed germination, seedling growth and survival compared to leachate from native forests and to pure water. We expected a reduction in germination and seedling establishment in R radiata plantations, due to documented allelopathic inhibition. We only found differences in germination probabilities during the 2001/2002 period, whereas seedling establishment did not vary. In addition, in the laboratory we found that watering with leachate from P. radiata plantations produced an equivalent reduction in C. alba seed germination when compared with watering with native forest litter leachate. We did not find allelopathic effects on seedling survival nor growth. P. radiata plantations might be a suitable habitat where, in some years, C. alba can regenerate. P radiata plantations should be incorporated in the conservation scenario of the Maulino Forest plant species, introducing new procedures to reduce the impact of forest replacement on native plant dynamics.

AB This study evaluates the response of the ant communities along a habitat regeneration gradient in the south Atlantic Forest comparing it with the ant fauna from a mature forest at the same biome. The survey was conducted according to standard collecting protocols, employing sardine baits and mini-Winkler apparatuses. The structure of the ground and litter-foraging ant community was compared in five habitats, representing a regeneration gradient within the Atlantic Forest. Furthermore, the composition of the leaf-litter ant fauna and the species richness were compared between the regeneration gradient and an area of mature forest. The results showed a higher number of leaf-litter ant species in the mature forest in comparison with the regeneration gradient habitat, as well a distinct species composition. There was a significant loss of ant diversity in the regrowth forest, compared to the mature Atlantic Forest. The composition of the ground-dwelling ant fauna does not consistently separate the sites of forest succession; but a gradient of ant species richness and composition was revealed when the leaf-litter ant fauna data set was included in the analysis. In this sense, the leaf-litter ant fauna is an important segment to characterize habitats also playing an important rule as bio-indicators. The data suggest that only primary forests (our data) and old secondary forests (in litt.) are capable of maintaining a substantial proportion of the biodiversity in areas of the Atlantic Forest.

AB Species richness of epigeic ants was surveyed in forest islands named capoes of Brazilian Pantanal and related with their structural complexity. The ants were collected using pitfall traps in 28 capoes from Rio Negro Farm, in Aquidauana municipality, Mato-Grosso do Sul state, Brazil. The structural complexity of capoes was evaluated by measuring vegetation density and litter quantity near the pit-fall traps. Seventy-one species, distributed in 26 genera and seven sub-families were found. Ectatomma edentatum Roger (Formicidae: Ectatomminae) and one species of Pheidole were the most frequent species. Species richness was positively correlated only with herbaceous vegetation density of capoes, supporting the idea that the increase in environmental heterogeneity diminishes species competition, allowing species co-occurrence.

AB Physiological processes and local-scale structural dynamics of mangroves are relatively well studied. Regional-scale processes, however, are not as well understood. Here we provide long-term data on trends in structure and forest turnover at a large scale, following hurricane damage in mangrove ecosystems of South Florida, U.S.A. Twelve mangrove vegetation plots were monitored at periodic intervals, between October 1992 and March 2005. Mangrove forests of this region are defined by a -1.5 scaling relationship between mean stem diameter and stem density, mirroring self-thinning theory for mono-specific stands. This relationship is reflected in tree size frequency scaling exponents which, through time, have exhibited trends toward a community average that is indicative of full spatial resource utilization. These trends, together with an asymptotic standing biomass accumulation, indicate that coastal mangrove ecosystems do adhere to size-structured organizing principles as described for upland tree communities. Regenerative dynamics are different between areas inside and outside of the primary wind-path of Hurricane Andrew which occurred in 1992. Forest dynamic turnover rates, however, are steady through time. This suggests that ecological, more-so than structural factors, control forest productivity. In agreement, the relative mean rate of biomass growth exhibits an inverse relationship with the seasonal range of porewater salinities. The ecosystem average in forest scaling relationships may provide a useful investigative tool of mangrove community biomass relationships, as well as offer a robust indicator of general ecosystem health for use in mangrove forest ecosystem management and restoration.

AB The dependence of tree seedling survival and growth on light availability was evaluated over 15 mo in three second-growth, wet forest stands (15-1.8 y old) in north-eastern Costa Rica. Seedlings of four canopy tree species (Dipteryx panamensis, Hyeronima alchorneoides, Virola koschnyi and Vochysia guatenmalensis) were planted into four canopy treatments in three replicated stands and in a pasture site, spanning a nearly complete gradient of light availability. Survival and growth of all species increased in response to increasing light availability, but species differed in survival in shaded microsites (6-20%, light transmittance) and in growth increments per light increase. Hyeronima showed the highest mortality at low light levels and the highest relative height growth increase per light increase. In contrast, Virola showed high survival at low and moderate light, but showed the lowest leaf area and above-ground biomass per light increase among all species. Dipteryx and Vochysia maintained relatively high rates of survival and growth across the entire light gradient. Hyeronima and Virola showed trade-offs between growth and survival responses to light, unlike Dipteryx and Vochysia. Differences among species in seedling survival at low light may be determined by a variety of physiological and morphological traits that may or may not be mechanistically linked to growth responses.

AB The seasonal savannas dominated by the C-4 grasses of the genus Trachypogon, are widespread in northern South America. In Venezuela, they extend from the central lowland Llanos to intermediate elevations in the Coastal and Andean Mountains and to the Guiana Plateau (Gran Sabana) in the south. This study alms to classify these savannas and to understand the environmental factors that determine their composition and structure. Thirty-seven sites were sampled, plant cover and density were measured in 376 one square meter quadrats and the importance value index (IVI) was calculated. Climate data were obtained from climatological stations and soil properties were analyzed. The results were classified by clustering and TWINSPAN. Floristic and environmental data were ordered with the canonical correspondence analysis (CCA).
   Trachypogon savannas are heterogeneous, both floristically and environmentally. An altitudinal gradient of similar to 2000 in separates the intermediate elevation Coastal Mountains (Type I) and the Guiana savannas (Type II) from the lowland Llanos. In the lowlands, sparsely covered and treeless communities on extremely oligotrophic and sandy soils (Type IV) differ structurally and floristically from woody savannas (Type III). The floristics and structure of the savannas respond directly or indirectly to elevation and water and nutrient availability. These responses were evidenced by: (a) floristic composition, as Neotropical lowland savanna species merged with those of the Andean subparamo in Type I savannas or with those from the Guianan flora in Type II savannas. (b) Species richness, which ranged from an average of 13.8 per site in sandy Type IV savannas to 38.9 per site in Type I intermediate elevation savannas. (c) Community physiognomy, which changes from an homogeneous herbaceous matrix with dispersed trees in Type III savannas to a shrubby Type I savannas to "treeless" Types II and IV savannas. (d) Plant cover which varied from 93.8% in the fertile Type I savannas to around 80% in the sandy oligotrophic savannas of Types II and IV. Each savanna type is related to one of the major geomorphological regions of Venezuela. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Pagurus longicarpus hermit crabs depend on empty gastropod shells for protection against predation. Hermit crabs avoid gastropod shells in which holes have been drilled by naticid gastropods, and hermit crabs forced to occupy drilled shells are more vulnerable to predation by green crabs, Carcinus maenas. In this study, we examined the effect of predator cues on P. longicarpus shell investigation behavior and shell choice. In paired laboratory shell choice trials, we examined hermit crab response to green crab chemical cues. We compared hermit crabs from two sites differing in the percentage of Littorina littorea shells with drill holes. The percentage of time hermit crabs spent occupying intact shells increased significantly in the presence of predator cues. The effect of predator cues on the amount of time hermit crabs spent investigating shells differed between individuals from the two sites. Predator effluent had a marginal effect on the proportion of hermit crabs initially choosing intact shells and within 15 min most hermit crabs in both treatments occupied intact shells due to shell switching. These results indicate that predation cues alter P. longicarpus shell choice behavior favoring intact shells, which provide greater protection. In summary, predation appears to be a key factor influencing hermit crab shell selection behavior.

AB The responses of radial and height growth, plant architecture, and the probability of mortality of saplings to varying light levels were quantified for six tree species in temperate conifer forests of the Bhutan Himalayas. Increases in growth with increasing light were comparable with those of high latitude tree species but lower than those of tropical tree species and temperate species in North America. The shade-tolerant species Tsuga dumosa (D. Don.) Eichler showed the strongest increase in radial growth at low light and reached asymptotic growth early. It had the deepest crowns in low light and a low decrease of leader growth with decreasing light. It represents a continuous growth type, which invests in height rather than lateral growth under low light conditions. Betula utilis D. Don. showed greater increases in radial growth and a higher mortality at low light than the more shade-tolerant Abies densa Griff., in keeping with the trade-off between survivorship and growth at low light. Picea spinulosa Griff, Larix griffithiana Carriere, and Pinus wallichiana A.B. Jackson showed small increases in growth at low light levels. The latter two species showed no capacity to adapt their morphology in response to changing light levels, which resulted in higher probabilities of mortality at lower light levels. Differences in the probability of mortality at different light levels were more pronounced than differences in the light-growth response, underlining the importance of survivorship at low light for successional dynamics.

AB Accelerated natural regeneration (ANR) is a relatively cheap method of reforestation, which encourages natural establishment of indigenous trees and shrubs. It requires a low input of labour, but a high input of ecological information. In this paper, the knowledge required to predict and manipulate the natural regeneration of seasonal tropical forest is reviewed and areas in need of further research are identified. Regeneration will be influenced by five groups of potentially limiting factors; site resources (soil and microclimate); competition with weeds; site disturbance; occurrence of established woody plants or their propagules; seed dispersal by wild animals and birds. This paper considers each of these, their interactions with seasons, and each other. Collation of existing information on these topics, combined with the suggested further research, should facilitate the creation of tools that will enable practitioners to judge the regeneration potential of sites and to select the most appropriate ANR techniques.

AB We investigated the effects of seed size and microhabitat on the dynamics of seedling establishment in Olea europaea. We tested the hypothesis that the type of microhabitat suitable for O. europaea recruitment is influenced by microhabitat-specific relationships between seed size and seedling growth rate. To test this hypothesis we conducted field experiments evaluating seedling growth and survival as a function of seed size, microhabitat (determined by presence/absence of scrub cover), and competition (established by means of seedling density gradients). Our results show that, first, seed size was related to seedling size and to differential growth rate. Second, seedling growth rate was negatively correlated with initial seedling size, although this correlation varied among microhabitats and temporally. Third, seedling survival differed between microhabitats and was positively affected by initial seedling size until the end of the summer drought. Finally, the effect of seedling size on survival was partly mediated by its negative relationship with growth rate. However, the combined effect of size and growth on seedling survival varied between microhabitats. We conclude that establishment depended on microbabitats through facilitation and inhibition processes, and that seed size-related growth rate strongly affected seedling fate. It is noteworthy that the effectiveness of the size-correlated growth depended on microhabitat.

AB The 'molding hypothesis' (Elwood et al. 1979. Anim Behav 27:940-946) predicts that shell-species selection by hermit crabs may be influenced by past experience in shell use through shell-imposed alterations in crab morphology. The present study was designed to test this hypothesis and to further the understanding of plasticity in the shell-species selection in hermit crabs. Shell use was demonstrated to influence crab growth and morphology. Individuals reared in shells of Tegula viridula attained larger sizes than individuals in shells of Morula nodulosa. Crab growth was also dependent on crab sex, since males reached larger sizes and presented longer intermolt periods than females. The most conspicuous influence of shell utilization on crab morphology was in dorso-ventral flattening, which occurred on a decreasing scale with the shell species, as follows: M nodulosa > Cerithium atratum > T. viridula. Crabs from all treatments and those collected in nature in shells of Olivella minuta chose mainly shells of C atratum, but the previous experience of crabs strongly influenced their shell-species selection pattern. Individuals maintained in M. nodulosa shells selected M nodulosa shells more frequently than individuals reared in T viridula or C. atratum. The influence of past experience was demonstrated to depend on shell type, since patterns of shell-species selection of individuals reared in T viridula or C. atratum were identical. These differences in the shell-species selection pattern directly reflected the differences in crab dorso-ventral flattening, i.e. dorso-ventrally compressed individuals (those in shells of M. nodulosa or O. minuta) showed a higher probability of selecting narrow-aperture shells than did 'rounded' individuals (those in shells of T viridula or C. atratum). The weight of the selected shells at the end of the experiment depended on crab size instead of previous experience with different shell architectures.

AB Many organisms overlap in their use of resources in space and time. Where and when resources are restricted, species must compete for them. Living space, often a critical resource controlling food and mate availability, is directly contested by organisms in most habitats. The ensuing animal interactions generally result in a winner gaining space and a loser, which may die. Contact matrices from studies of interference competition in encrusting marine Bryozoa (clonal and colonial animals), spanning at least 60degrees latitude in both hemispheres, were analysed and subjected to a modern transitivity index. Only data for Bryozoa were used because (i) use of a single taxon with restricted ecology simplifies the scope for types of encounters, (and therefore) interpretation; and (ii) ecological bias is reduced because bryozoans are abundant at all latitudes. The analysis shows that assemblage competition is more hierarchical towards both poles. Thus, poorer competitors fail more frequently in interactions with increasing latitude. The cause of this trend is the simplification of overall outcomes between competitors, such as fewer ties, reversals in outcome or competitive loops (where low-ranking competitors beat those of higher ranking). The implication of such a trend is that the maintenance of biological diversity at high latitudes may principally be by physical rather than biological (competition) processes. Certainly, ocean surface energy increases with latitude through wind and wave action (and ice scour in polar regions).

AB In comparison with the effects of the collection of marine intertidal organisms by humans, the effects of human recreational activities on assemblages of marine birds have received scarce attention. We evaluated whether in central Chile the spatial and temporal variation in the composition and abundance of the avian assemblage is affected by the presence of humans on the coast. We studied a 1.5-km stretch of rocky coast, in the center of which is a small marine reserve where no fishing or recreational activities take place. At 15 observation points, we conducted 12 monthly surveys of birds that roost in the supralittoral zone, between the high-tide mark and the terrestrial vegetation, and/or that forage In the intertidal zone. In addition, within the reserve we conducted daily bird surveys over 2 years to evaluate whether abundance or composition changed according to the activity of people outside the reserve. We recorded 19 species of coastal marine birds. Eleven species used the supralittoral zone only for roosting (roosting assemblage), whereas the others foraged on intertidal organisms and roosted in the supralittoral zone (foraging assemblage). Although the largest negative effect of human activity on bird abundance occurred in summer, the period of greatest recreation intensity, the presence of humans negatively affected birds year round, changing both the spatial and temporal distribution of birds along the shore. Bird abundance was higher at observation points inside the marine reserve, although the pattern was stronger for birds roosting on the supralittoral zone than for birds actively foraging in the intertidal zone. Similarly, the number of birds recorded during weekends inside the reserve was higher than during week days. Our results illustrate the important role played by this marine reserve, which offers marine birds safe roosting sites without human interference. Larger marine reserves than the one we studied are needed because the dynamics of birds inside the reserve were strongly influenced by human activities in immediately adjacent areas. Our results emphasize the need to consider human recreational activities along the coast when establishing conservation programs because harvesting refugia or "no-take" zones will not provide protection to coastal bird assemblages unless human access is restricted.

AB I studied the relationship between diurnal raptor diversity, density, and richness, and landscape heterogeneity in continuous primary forests and forests farmed by native Amerindians in the Rio Platano, Biosphere Reserve of northeastern Honduras from January to June 1996 and 1997. I estimated landscape heterogeneity-the variability in naturally occurring and/or anthropogenic habitat mosaics-by mapping the extent and distribution of five human-modified and natural habitats in 24 1 km(2) survey plots. I used the Shannon index to calculate landscape heterogeneity values for the respective plots based on the proportion of total area of each habitat within each plot. Diurnal captor surveys from canopy emergent viewpoints in these plots resulted in 137 observations of 18 species of captors. Four species (Coragyps atratus, Ictinia plumbea, Leucopternis albicollis, and Buteo magnirostris) differed significantly in abundance among heterogeneity classes, Raptor diversity, density, and richness all increased directly with increasing landscape heterogeneity. Landscape heterogeneity was more important in explaining differences in raptor species diversity than the presence or extent of any single habitat or combination of habitats. In contrast to previous studies, my results indicate the importance of indigenous shifting cultivation in altering the naturally occurring patterns of habitat mosaics in lowland rain forest and its effect on bird species abundance and diversity in a rain forest ecosystem.

AB In many areas of the humid tropics, relatively small patches of forest is the habitat most commonly available for forest-dwelling organisms. To assess resident hummingbird use of forest fragments near the Las Cruces Biological Station in southwestern Costa Rica, we mist-netted birds in five fragments (0.3-20 ha; ca 1300 m elev.) and the station's 226-ha forest preserve (Ca 900-1280 m elev.). From January 1994 through mid-March 1999, we recorded 1069 captures of 21 hummingbird species during 49,900 net hours. Species richness, diversity indices, and capture rates increased asymptotically with patch size, as expected. We captured 16 hummingbird species in both the largest fragment (20 ha) and in the nearby forest preserve. Non-forest hummingbirds did not occur more frequently in the fragments than in the preserve, and all fragments supported a mixture of forest-interior and canopy-dwelling hummingbird species, along with a diverse group of hummingbird-pollinated plants. Phaethornis guy was common at all sites and visited >13 plant species in the fragments during the 1998 dry season (based on analyses of pollen collected from the birds' heads). In contrast, Eutoxeres aquila was found at only the largest three sites (10, 20, and 226 ha) and carried pollen from only one plant species during the 1998 dry season. Lampornis castaneoventris, a high-elevation hummingbird species, was far more common in the fragments than in the preserve, while three species typically found at lower elevations were rare in the fragments and common in the preserve. These distribution patterns could be influenced by local climatic differences because the fragments are higher and receive more cloud mist and annual precipitation than the preserve. Our data show that pollen loads on hummingbird species vary, and this has implications for gene flow among hummingbird-pollinated plants. Although our results are consistent with previous reports that hummingbird species may be less affected by deforestation than insectivorous avian species such as army ant followers, it is important to note that from the perspective of the genetics and demographics of hummingbird-pollinated plants, the important issue is whether appropriate pollinator species are able to move plant propagules among subpopulations of plants in fragmented landscapes. We conclude that the biodiversity of tropical forest fragments as small as 10 to 20 ha is high enough to warrant long-term preservation of these areas, especially if they are located near larger tracts of forest.

AB This study documents instabilities in the relationship between Fl Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and climate of the Patagonian-Andean region at spatial and temporal scales directly relevant to biogeographical research. Four temperature and four precipitation regions located south of 38 degreesS were described using homogeneous climate records that were significantly correlated. Correlation function analysis evaluated the response of seasonal temperature and precipitation for each region relative to two indices of ENSO, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Statistically significant correlations were observed for each region, although relationships varied among regions. Climatic responses to Fl Nino events were deduced from these relationships. The 30-year moving correlations of temperature and precipitation against SOI and SST showed substantial temporal instability of the ENSO-climate relationships during this century. These instabilities are explained by documented, multi-decadal variations in ENSO, the southeast Pacific anticyclone, and mean sea-level pressure (SLP) in the southern Atlantic Ocean. Despite significant relationships between ENSO and climate for particular regions and periods, we did not find that such relationships were consistent in space or time. ENSO-climate relationships often are useful for understanding temporal variability in ecological processes, but temporal instability in these relationships limits their predictive ability.

AB The use of gastropod shells by hermit crabs at Quirimba Island, Mozambique, was investigated. Particular attention was paid to the upper shore/supralittoral zone species Clibanarius longitarsus, Coenobita cavipes and Coenobita rugosus. The study area is characterised by a high diversity of gastropod species as well as hermit crabs. Supralittoral hermit crabs were little, if at all, resource restricted due to concentration of empty shells on the strandline and shell middens created by local people. The range of the 3 study species overlaps substantially and each uses a wide range of shell types. Shore habitat, shell abundance and availability were found to have little influence on shell use. With increased tidal emersion/terrestrial nature (for a given crab mass), total diversity of shells used increased, shell mass carried decreased, damaged shell use decreased and carried shell fit increased. The architecture and strength of shells used, however, followed more complex individual species characteristics and behaviour patterns. Species specific differences in behavioural patterns may be important for shell resource partitioning.

AB First ocean-year feeding habits were determined for juvenile salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) collected with purse seines in marine waters of southeastern Alaska in 1983 and 1984 and northern British Columbia in 1984. Associated prey assemblages were sampled with neuston and plankton nets in 1984. Salmon diets included at least 30 taxa of prey. Crustaceans (principally hyperiid amphipods), fish, and tunicates were the most important prey of pink (O. gorbuscha), chum (O. Keta), and sockeye (O. nerka) salmon. Fish were the most important prey of coho (O. kisutch) and chinook (O. tshawytscha) salmon and made up the highest percentage of stomach content weight for all salmon species. Diet shifted from crustaceans in 1983 to fish in 1984 for juvenile pink, sockeye, and chum salmon. Diet overlapped significantly ((C) over cap(lambda)>0.60) between pink and sockeye salmon, pink and chum salmon, and chum and sockeye salmon. Coho salmon diet overlap was <0.60 in all paired comparisons. Nearly all (98.6%) of the 2,210 stomachs examined were at least half full. Although, in general, prey consumed were not very similar to prey observed in the environment, the composition of salmon diets was more similar to neuston collections than to zooplankton collections.

We also evaluated the effects of dispersal on seed survival during the first stages of establishment. Fast and early dispersal should be favored in E. havanense, since propagules have more time to grow and accumulate resources before the beginning of the severe dry season. In general, high rates of fruit removal imply faster and earlier dispersal. Thus, plants producing large crops should benefit from high removal rates, which will increase the probability of successful establishment by their progeny. To characterize both individual and population fruiting patterns, we made daily counts of fruits on 51 plants arranged in six clumps of different sizes. The daily number of fruits removed per plant was higher for plants with larger initial crop sizes and larger numbers of ripe fruits on a given day, but decreased as clump size increased. Additionally, we monitored postdispersal survival and germination in an experiment manipulating seed density, distance from adult plants, and seed predation. Early establishment was independent of density or distance, and vertebrate seed predation was the main agent of seed mortality. Our results indicate that the critical variable with respect to fruit removal is the number of fruits a plant produces, large plants having higher dispersal rates. Large plants are also more likely to have more seeds escaping postdispersal seed predation.

AB Overgrowth interactions between encrusting cyclostome (eight species) and cheilostome (over 50 species) colonies were examined in subtidal communities in the northern Adriatic Sea off Rovinj, Croatia, in May June 1988 and September October 1990. Cheilostome colonies occupied ca. 80% of the available substrate space, whereas the cyclostome colonies occupied < 5 %. Out of 210 recorded interactions, cheilostomes overlapped cyclostomes in 164, while cyclostomes overlapped cheilostomes in only 16;30 encounters resulted in mutual overlap or at least temporary growth termination along the line of contact. Most of the recorded interactions were for the cyclostomes Diplosolen obelia (Johnston) and Plagioecia patina (Lamarck). Both species elevated their colony margins on contact with a cheilostome in some instances, but D. obelia only overgrew competing cheilostomes in 12/120 encounters, and P. patina never prevailed. I propose that the cheilostomes have a key evolutionary innovation, lacking in cyclostomes, consisting of more rapid ontogenetic development of zooids along colony margins so that encrusting cheilostomes have substantially higher colony margins. This results in an outflow of filtered water along the edge of encrusting cheilostome colonies, while cyclostomes take water in at colony margins. These contrasting feeding currents apparently give a competitive advantage to the cheilostomes where colony margins approach and make contact with those of cyclostomes.

AB The mechanisms regulating community composition and local dominance of trees in species-rich forests are poorly resolved, but the importance of interactions with soil microbes is increasingly acknowledged. Here, we show that tree seedlings that interact via root-associated fungal hyphae with soils beneath neighbouring adult trees grow faster and have greater survival than seedlings that are isolated from external fungal mycelia, but these effects are observed for species possessing ectomycorrhizas (ECM) and not arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Moreover, survival of naturally-regenerating AM seedlings over ten years is negatively related to the density of surrounding conspecific plants, while survival of ECM tree seedlings displays positive density dependence over this interval, and AM seedling roots contain greater abundance of pathogenic fungi than roots of ECM seedlings. Our findings show that neighbourhood interactions mediated by beneficial and pathogenic soil fungi regulate plant demography and community structure in hyperdiverse forests. Associations with mycorrhizal fungi can affect the outcome of plant competition in complex ways. Here the authors use a decade-long field survey and two hyphal exclusion experiments to reveal a critical role of underground fungal networks in facilitating seedling growth and fitness of ectomycorrhizal plants but not arbuscular mycorrhizal plants.

AB The importance of large reserves has been long maintained in the scientific literature, often leading to dismissal of the conservation potential of small reserves. However, over half the global protected-area inventory is composed of protected areas that are <100 ha, and the median size of added protected area is decreasing. Studies of the conservation value of small reserves and fragments of natural area are relatively uncommon in the literature. We reviewed SCOPUS and WOK for studies on small reserve and fragment contributions to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, and fifty-eight taxon-specific studies were included in the review. Small reserves harbored substantial portions (upward of 50%) of regional species diversity for many taxa (birds, plants, amphibians, and small mammals) and even some endemic, specialist bird species. Unfortunately, small reserves and fragments almost always harbored more generalist and exotic species than large reserves. Community composition depended on habitat quality, surrounding land use (agricultural vs. urban), and reserve and fragment size, which presents opportunities for management and improvement. Small reserves also provided ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological pest control, and cultural services, such as recreation and improved human health. Limitations associated with small reserves, such as extinction debt and support of area-sensitive species, necessitate a complement of larger reserves. However, we argue that small reserves can make viable and significant contributions to conservation goals directly as habitat and indirectly by increasing landscape connectivity and quality to the benefit of large reserves. To effectively conserve biodiversity for future generations in landscapes fragmented by human development, small reserves and fragments must be included in conservation planning.

AB Extreme droughts in Amazonia cause anomalous increase in fire occurrence, disrupting the stability of environmental, social, and economic systems. Thus, understanding how droughts affect fire patterns in this region is essential for anticipating and planning actions for remediation of possible impacts. Focused on the Brazilian Amazon biome, we investigated fire responses to the 2010 and 2015/2016 Amazonian droughts using remote sensing data. Our results revealed that the 2015/2016 drought surpassed the 2010 drought in intensity and extent. During the 2010 drought, we found a maximum area of 846,800 km(2) (24% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) with significant (p <= 0.05) rainfall decrease in the first trimester, while during the 2015/2016 the maximum area reached 1,702,800 km(2) (47% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) in the last trimester of 2015. On the other hand, the 2010 drought had a maximum area of 840,400 km(2) (23% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) with significant (p <= 0.05) land surface temperature increase in the first trimester, while during the 2015/2016 drought the maximum area was 2,188,800 km(2) (61% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) in the last trimester of 2015. Unlike the 2010 drought, during the 2015/2016 drought, significant positive anomalies of active fire and CO2 emissions occurred mainly during the wet season, between October 2015 and March 2016. During the 2010 drought, positive active fire anomalies resulted from the simultaneous increase of burned forest, non-forest vegetation and productive lands. During the 2015/2016 drought, however, this increase was dominated by burned forests. The two analyzed droughts emitted together 0.47 Pg CO2, with 0.23 Pg CO2 in 2010, 0.15 Tg CO2 in 2015 and 0.09 Tg CO2 in 2016, which represented, respectively, 209%, 136%, 82% of annual Brazil's national target for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation by 2017 (approximately 0.11 Pg CO2 year(-1) from 2006 to 2017). Finally, we anticipate that the increase of fires during the droughts showed here may intensify and can become more frequent in Amazonia due to changes in climatic variability if no regulations on fire use are implemented.

AB 1. Natural habitats adjacent to agricultural areas are often considered sources of species that provide beneficial regulating ecosystem services through cross-habitat spillover. Both inter-habitat matrix and landscape configuration can influence spillover by controlling organismal ability to disperse through landscapes, and affecting the provision of additional or supplementary resources that impact organism survival.
   2. To understand how landscape structure in terms of matrix land use type, forest cover and edge density might facilitate avian cross-habitat spillover, we sampled avian communities in forest patches and adjacent land use types (coffee plantations or cattle pastures) using a well-replicated study design across 92 sampling sites across a landscape-context forest cover gradient (6%-60%).
   3. Land use type was a key factor influencing avian cross-habitat spillover, facilitating species movement into coffee plantations and acting as a barrier to spillover into cattle pastures. We found that 24% of the forest-dependent species pool was capable of spillover into coffee plantations, while spillover was nearly non-existent in cattle pastures.
   4. Forest cover was also the main driver of spillover into coffee plantations. There was a positive relationship between forest cover and spillover, potentially due to processes related with (1) a higher density of organism in-patches, (2) decreased isolation among patches facilitating species movement and (3) higher landscape supplementation processes.
   5. Finally, we found edge density had an additive effect with forest cover on spillover. Spillover was higher in high-forested landscapes with many forest-matrix edges, possibly due to increased structural connectivity for species able to move through edges, and to improved access for forest-dwelling species to different resource types (complementation processes).
   6. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that land use type is a key factor facilitating species spillover into agricultural matrices and that the influence of land use type on spillover is further modulated by a combination of native habitat amount and edge density. These results should be considered in efforts to design or manage sustainable agricultural landscapes in order to enhance both bird persistence and the provision of bird-mediated ecosystem services.

   POPULATION-STRUCTURE
AB Most of the world's ant species rely on flight for reproduction and dispersal, during a solitary phase in which colony fitness depends only on the survival of individual queens. Flight-related selection shapes ant physiology, such that queens and males fly for short durations but carry heavy loads due to the nutrient demands of mating and colony founding. Ants vary by four orders of magnitude in flight distance, with larger ants or those with lighter abdomens flying farther than smaller or heavier ones. Flight tradeoffs explain much variation in ant life history, including the temporal segregation of flight and egg production, the continuum of ant mating systems from male aggregation to female calling syndromes, and the evolution of alternate colony founding strategies. Flight performance also constrains range expansions or shifts in response to invasions or climate change. Flying queens and males act as dispersal vectors for pathogenic or symbiotic organisms, and are eaten in large numbers by aerial insectivores. By entering aerial food webs, flying ants help mediate the flow of energy and materials through ecosystems. They are also model systems for addressing several questions, including nutrient allocation tradeoffs and the evolution of reproductive polymorphisms.

AB Phosphatase enzymes regulate organic phosphorus (OP) turnover in eutrophic wetland soils, but a clear understanding of their relationships remains elusive. In this study, soil samples were collected from rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils of three dominant aquatic plants Phragmites communis, Zizania latifolia, and Scirpus planiculmis in Yeyahu Wetland of Beijing, China to investigate the phosphatase enzyme activities, including phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase and phytase, and the impact on OP turnover dynamics in wetlands. Results demonstrated that soil phosphatase activities in rhizosphere were higher than those in non-rhizosphere for all the three plants. Phosphatase activities were correlated strongly with soil labile organic P, although the relationships showed different trends for the three kinds of phosphatases. Moderate liable organic P had a positive correlation to phosphomonoesterase (r = 0.367, P < 0.01) and phosphodiesterase (r = 0.564, P < 0.01). There was a significant negative correlation between highly resistant organic P and phytase (r = -0.438, P < 0.05), indicating that phytase had obvious effects on the process of degrading highly stable P compounds in soils. These results suggest that phosphatase enzymes regulated OP turnover to increase available P and phytase had a strong impact on wetland P cycle system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil hydrolysable P can be a main P source for biota in P-limited tropical rain forests. Soil hydrolysable P occurs in various chemical fractions, including, monoester P, diester P, pyrophosphate and phytate, which need enzymatic hydrolysis into orthophosphate before their assimilation into biota. We examined whether P-limited plants and microbes preferentially hydrolyzed specific fraction of soil hydrolysable P and whether those in different successional stages had different abilities to hydrolyze various soil hydrolysable P.
   We measured four classes of phosphatase (phosphomonoesterase, PME; phosphodiesterase, PDE; pyrophosphatase, PyP; and phytase, PhT) activities for fine-roots and soils in nitrogen (N) and P fertilized primary and secondary tropical rain forests in Sabah, Malaysia.
   P fertilization reduced PME, PyP and PhT activities for fine-roots and PME and PyP activities for soils. Fine-roots in primary forests had higher PME and PyP activities whereas those in secondary forests had higher PhT activities.
   We suggest that P-limited trees and microbes depend more on hydrolysable P degraded by one step of enzymatic reaction (monoester P, pyrophosphate, and phytate) as a P source. We also suggest that trees have different soil-organic-P acquisition strategies in association with their life history strategies.

AB Zoonotic pathogens comprise a significant and increasing fraction of all emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that plague humans. Identifying host species is one of the keys to controlling emerging infectious diseases. From March 2007 until April 2012, we collected a total of 131 wild rodents in eight municipalities of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We investigated these rodents for infection with Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella spp. and Rickettsia spp. In total, 22.1% (29/131) of the rodents were infected by at least one pathogen; co-infection was detected in 1.5% (2/131) of rodents. Coxiella burnetii was detected in 4.6% (6/131) of the wild animals, 17.6% of the rodents harbored Bartonella spp. No cases of Rickettsia were identified. Bartonella doshiae and Bartonella vinsonii were the species found on the wild mammals. This report is the first to note C. burnetii, B. doshiae and B. vinsonii natural infections in Atlantic Forest wild rodents in Brazil. Our work highlights the potential risk of transmission to humans, since most of the infected specimens belong to generalist species that live near human dwellings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Spatial processes underlie major species coexistence mechanisms. A range of spatial analysis techniques are increasingly applied to data of fully mapped communities to quantify spatial structures in species and phylogenetic and functional diversity at some given spatial scale with the goal of gaining insights into processes of community assembly and dynamics. We review these techniques, including spatial point pattern analysis, quadrat-based analyses, and individual-based neighborhood models, and provide a practical roadmap for ecologists in the analysis of local spatial structures in species and phylogenetic and functional diversity. We show how scale-dependent metrics of spatial diversity can be used in concert with ecological null models, statistical models, and dynamic community simulation models to detect spatial patterns, reveal the influence of the biotic neighborhood on plant performance, and quantify the relative contribution of species interactions, habitat heterogeneity, and stochastic processes to community assembly across scale. Future works should integrate these approaches into a dynamic spatiotemporal framework.

AB There are tens of thousands of species of phytoplankton found throughout the tree of life. Despite this diversity, phytoplankton are often aggregated into a few functional groups according to metabolic traits or biogeochemical role. We investigate the extent to which phytoplankton species dynamics are neutral within functional groups. Seasonal dynamics in many regions of the ocean are known to affect phytoplankton at the functional group level leading to largely predictable patterns of seasonal succession. It is much more difficult to make general statements about the dynamics of individual species. We use a 7-year time series at station L4 in the Western English Channel with 57 diatom and 17 dinoflagellate species enumerated weekly to test whether the abundance of diatom and dinoflagellate species varies randomly within their functional group envelope or whether each species is driven uniquely by external factors. We show that the total biomass of the diatom and dinoflagellate functional groups is well predicted by irradiance and temperature and quantify trait values governing the growth rate of both functional groups. The biomass dynamics of the functional groups are not neutral and each has their own distinct responses to environmental forcing. Compared to dinoflagellates, diatoms have faster growth rates and grow faster under lower irradiance, cooler temperatures, and higher nutrient conditions. The biomass of most species varies randomly within their functional group biomass envelope, most of the time. As a consequence, modellers will find it difficult to predict the biomass of most individual species. Our analysis supports the approach of using a single set of traits for a functional group and suggests that it should be possible to determine these traits from natural communities.

AB Global change will likely affect savanna and forest structure and distributions, with implications for diversity within both biomes. Few studies have examined the impacts of both expected precipitation and land use changes on vegetation structure in the future, despite their likely severity. Here, we modeled tree cover in sub-Saharan Africa, as a proxy for vegetation structure and land cover change, using climatic, edaphic, and anthropic data (R-2=0.97). Projected tree cover for the year 2070, simulated using scenarios that include climate and land use projections, generally decreased, both in forest and savanna, although the directionality of changes varied locally. The main driver of tree cover changes was land use change; the effects of precipitation change were minor by comparison. Interestingly, carbon emissions mitigation via increasing biofuels production resulted in decreases in tree cover, more severe than scenarios with more intense precipitation change, especially within savannas. Evaluation of tree cover change against protected area extent at the WWF Ecoregion scale suggested areas of high biodiversity and ecosystem services concern. Those forests most vulnerable to large decreases in tree cover were also highly protected, potentially buffering the effects of global change. Meanwhile, savannas, especially where they immediately bordered forests (e.g. West and Central Africa), were characterized by a dearth of protected areas, making them highly vulnerable. Savanna must become an explicit policy priority in the face of climate and land use change if conservation and livelihoods are to remain viable into the next century.

AB In this paper, we present a third-grade ecology learning environment that integrates two forms of modeling-embodied modeling and agent-based modeling (ABMs)-through the generation of mathematical representations that are common to both forms of modeling. The term "agent" in the context of ABMs indicates individual computational objects or actors that obey simple rules assigned or controlled by the user. It is the interactions between these agents that give rise to emergent, aggregate-level behaviors in complex systems. While several researchers have argued for the effectiveness of ABMs for learning about complex systems, the design of classroom activity systems using ABMs, especially for elementary students, has received relatively less attention. In this paper, we report on a 2-week long proof-of-concept study conducted in a third-grade classroom of 15 students in which students began with an embodied modeling activity of foraging behavior, followed with the generation of mathematical inscriptions based on their embodied actions, and finally, conducted further inquiry of interdependence in an ecosystem using two separate ABMs. Furthermore, we show that the lens of mechanistic reasoning can be productively used to identify the process of students' conceptual development of interdependence in an ecosystem as they engage in the modeling activities.

AB Species can adjust their traits in response to selection which may strongly influence species coexistence. Nevertheless, current theory mainly assumes distinct and time-invariant trait values. We examined the combined effects of the range and the speed of trait adaptation on species coexistence using an innovative multispecies predator-prey model. It allows for temporal trait changes of all predator and prey species and thus simultaneous coadaptation within and among trophic levels. We show that very small or slow trait adaptation did not facilitate coexistence because the stabilizing niche differences were not sufficient to offset the fitness differences. In contrast, sufficiently large and fast trait adaptation jointly promoted stable or neutrally stable species coexistence. Continuous trait adjustments in response to selection enabled a temporally variable convergence and divergence of species traits; that is, species became temporally more similar (neutral theory) or dissimilar (niche theory) depending on the selection pressure, resulting over time in a balance between niche differences stabilizing coexistence and fitness differences promoting competitive exclusion. Furthermore, coadaptation allowed prey and predator species to cluster into different functional groups. This equalized the fitness of similar species while maintaining sufficient niche differences among functionally different species delaying or preventing competitive exclusion. In contrast to previous studies, the emergent feedback between biomass and trait dynamics enabled supersaturated coexistence for a broad range of potential trait adaptation and parameters. We conclude that accounting for trait adaptation may explain stable and supersaturated species coexistence for a broad range of environmental conditions in natural systems when the absence of such adaptive changes would preclude it. Small trait changes, coincident with those that may occur within many natural populations, greatly enlarged the number of coexisting species.

AB Recent theory predicts that stochastic dilution effects may result in species-rich communities with statistically independent species spatial distributions, even if the underlying ecological processes structuring the community are driven by deterministic niche differences. Stochastic dilution is a consequence of the stochastic geometry of biodiversity where the identities of the nearest neighbors of individuals of a given species are largely unpredictable. Under such circumstances, the outcome of deterministic species interactions may vary greatly among individuals of a given species. Consequently, nonrandom patterns in the biotic neighborhoods of species, which might be expected from coexistence or community assembly theory (e.g., individuals of a given species are neighbored by phylogenetically similar species), are weakened or do not emerge, resulting in statistical independence of species spatial distributions. We used data on phylogenetic and functional similarity of tree species in five large forest dynamics plots located across a gradient of species richness to test predictions of the stochastic dilution hypothesis. To quantify the biotic neighborhood of a focal species we used the mean phylogenetic (or functional) dissimilarity of the individuals of the focal species to all species within a local neighborhood. We then compared the biotic neighborhood of species to predictions from stochastic null models to test if a focal species was surrounded by more or less similar species than expected by chance. The proportions of focal species that showed spatial independence with respect to their biotic neighborhoods increased with total species richness. Locally dominant, high-abundance species were more likely to be surrounded by species that were statistically more similar or more dissimilar than expected by chance. Our results suggest that stochasticity may play a stronger role in shaping the spatial structure of species rich tropical forest communities than it does in species poorer forests. These findings represent an important step towards understanding the factors that govern the spatial configuration of local biotic communities. The stochastic dilution effect is a simple geometric mechanism that can explain why species' spatial distributions in species-rich communities approximate independence from their biotic neighborhood, even if deterministic niche processes are in effect.

AB Phosphorus (P) is the main limiting nutritional factor in the cultivation of Eucalyptus in Brazil. Despite this, little is known about the P fractions and dynamics in Eucalyptus soils in tropical regions. The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the distribution of labile and non-labile fractions of P in soil in 10 sites of Eucalyptus in the state of SAo Paulo, Brazil and (2) to determine the interactions among the P fractions and to identify which fractions act as sinks or sources for the available P fraction. The P fractions were separated using the Hedley sequential extraction method, and the P transformation processes were evaluated via structural equation modeling. The labile P (resin-Pi + Pi and Po in NaHCO3) varied between 6% and 16%, the moderately labile P (Pi + Po in NaOH) varied between 28% and 40%, the occluded P (Pi + Po in Sonicate + NaOH) varied between 6% and 19%, the P associated with Ca (HCl-Pi) varied between 0.4% and 3% and the residual-P varied between 35% and 47%. The hypothetical structural model of soil P cycle was composed of four P pools (latent variables): the organic pool, occluded pool, inorganic pool, and available pool. The structural model was adequate to identify functional pools of P in soil, and to identify transformation processes of P based on the source-sink relationships. The available P pool was highly dependent on inorganic and occluded pools and the organic pool acted predominantly as a sink of P on available and inorganic pools. The results reinforce the high level of recalcitrance of the organic pool and the fact that Eucalyptus plants must access pools of limited-availability P to meet their nutritional demands.

AB Brazil seeks to rapidly increase its agricultural production to meet future demands, especially for sugarcane, which is an agricultural commodity and a biofuel source. In this paper, we explore how to achieve this increase without compromising existing forestlands. We propose that it is possible to substantially expand sugarcane production in Brazil while avoiding further environmental losses and the indirect land use changes often associated with them, such as deforestation. This task could be accomplished by converting existing pasturelands with agricultural potential into cropland. A great deal of pastureland exists in Brazil. Thus, we addressed the following questions in this study: (I) where are the most suitable pasturelands for sugarcane located geographically and (2) what potential do these pasturelands have for sugarcane production regarding their physical suitability and other significant factors, such as infrastructure availability and socioeconomic factors. We conducted a land suitability analysis using a spatial location model based on multicriteria decision-making and geographic information systems (GIS) to identify the cultivated pasturelands most suitable for conversion to sugarcane production in Brazil. "What if" scenarios were built to determine how changes in the subjectively derived weights of the priority criteria would modify the spatial distribution of the suitability classes relative to the MCDA model and demonstrate the robustness of the crop suitability assessment. The most suitable pastureland areas for conversion to sugarcane production were predominantly located in Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Parana, Goias, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso and Para. These zones have large contiguous areas of pasture with moderate and high agricultural potentials for sugarcane production. The total estimated area of cultivated pasturelands with moderate or high suitability for sugarcane production was 50 million hectares, which is much larger than the area currently used for sugarcane production in Brazil.

AB Advances in phytoremediation research require the selection of new hyperaccumulators or accumulators and investigations of their tolerance and accumulation of heavy metals. Two concentration gradient experiments (preliminary and verification), involving the same soil Cd concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 mg kg(-1)), were conducted to study Cd accumulation and tolerance in Capsella bursa-pastoris. In the preliminary and verification concentration gradient experiments, the Cd content in shoots of C. bursa-pastoris exceeded 100 mg kg(-1) at a soil Cd concentration of 50 mg kg(-1), and the maxima of Cd contents in shoots were 307.67 and 369.20 mg kg(-1) at 125 mg kg(-1) Cd in soil, respectively. The shoot bioconcentration factor of C. bursa-pastoris was greater than 1, but the translocation factor was less than 1.0 in the preliminary and verification concentration gradient experiments. In the verification concentration gradient experiment, the malondialdehyde content and the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase increased compared with the control. Therefore, C. bursa-pastoris is a Cd-accumulator with strong tolerance to Cd, and could be used to remediate Cd-contaminated farmland soil in winter.

AB For decades, pastures have replaced Amazon forests, threatening biodiversity. Two dominant hypotheses explain this process. First, according to the hamburger connection beef markets promote conversion of forests into cattle ranches resulting in deforestation. Second, the land-as-wealth hypothesis explains deforestation as the result of land appreciation in forest frontiers. We tested these hypotheses using land use and socioeconomic data from northwestern Amazonia from 2000 to 2009. We also investigated two key control variables: coca cultivation and eradication, both of which have been proposed as important drivers of forest loss. We found high rate of conversion from forest to pasture, and unimpeded forest fragmentation. As predicted by the hamburger connection, pastures expanded as the cattle inventory grew. Beef demand did not drive pasture expansion, as ranching revenues declined and beef prices were roughly stable. Coca cultivation did not respond to the eradication campaign, and declined as the population became increasingly urbanized. We propose that investment on roads has enhanced the anticipated value of land. Cattle bolster land claims and can be used as financial collateral, so they have inherent value even without market exchange. Cattle can then increase despite stable beef prices and declining ranching revenues. To protect biodiversity, policy interventions that enhance the value of standing forests are needed to slow deforestation and fragmentation in these rapidly changing landscapes.

AB The term PBS is often used to denote market incentives for the provision of public goods within the field of environmental and resource issues. In this context, PBS translates into either 'payments for environmental services' or 'payments for ecosystem services' the terms that are not consistently defined in the literature and sometimes used as synonyms. Given the lack of coherent definitions, this note reviews current definitions of payments for ecosystem services and payments for environmental services entertained in the literature, discusses alternative meanings of environmental and ecosystem services in the PES context, and finally proposes a consistent definition. We argue that current definitions of PES found in the literature are insufficient to adequately describe the man-made nature of many environmental goods and services: that nature is 'produced' through human intervention. Building upon the FAO's definition of environmental services, we propose a definition that regards environmental services as services provided through countryside management in a broader sense whilst produced either unintentionally or intentionally.

AB Habitat fragmentation due to urbanization is increasing rapidly worldwide. Although patch area and edge effect are both important determinants of species diversity and the number of individuals in fragmented landscapes, studies that tested interaction between two effects were limited. Here we examined the interaction between area and edge effects on species richness and the number of individuals of carabids in highly fragmented forests in Tokyo, central Japan. We surveyed carabids in each of 26 forest patches (1.1-121.6 ha) using pitfall traps set in both edge and interior zones. First, we correlated the edge-to-interior differences of both species richness and the number of individuals with patch area. Second, we examined the interaction between patch area and distance to the edge on species richness and the number of individuals using generalized linear models. We found a significant decrease in carabid species richness and the number of individuals in edge zones. The edge-to-interior differences in both species richness and the number of individuals were positively correlated with patch area. Model selection revealed the evident interaction effects between patch area and distance to the edge: higher number of individuals was predicted in only large interior zones. Our results indicated that carabid beetle assemblages were influenced by the interaction between area and edge effects. Thus, in urban areas where small forest remnants dominate, circularizing the shape of the forest patches to maximize the core areas may be the most feasible and realistic means to preserve biodiversity.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) inoculation on plant growth and drought tolerance in seedlings of a promising oilseed crop, Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia volubilis L.), under well-watered or drought conditions. AMF inoculation was applied in four treatments: without AMF inoculation, Glomus versiforme, Paraglomus occultum, or combination of both microorganism inoculations. The results showed that AMF colonization significantly enhanced the growth of Sacha Inchi seedlings regardless of soil water conditions, and the greatest development was reached in plants dually inoculated under well-watered conditions. G. versiforme was more efficient than P. occultum. Plants inoculated with both symbionts had significantly greater specific leaf area, leaf area ratio and root volume when compared with the uninoculated control, G. versiforme, and P. occultum treatments alone, indicating a synergistic effect in the two AMF inoculation. Photosynthetic rate and water-use efficiency were stimulated by AMF, but not stomatal conductance. Inoculation with AM fungus increased antioxidant enzymes activities including guaiacol peroxidase and catalase, thus lowering hydrogen peroxide accumulation and oxidative damage, especially under drought stress conditions. However, proline content showed little change during drought stress and AMF colonization conditions, which suggested that proline accumulation might not serve as the main compound for osmotic adjustment of the studied species. These results indicate that AMF inoculation stimulated growth and enhanced drought tolerance of Sacha Inchi seedlings, through alterations in morphological, physiological and biochemical traits. This microbial symbiosis might be an effective cultivation practice in improving the performance and development for Sacha Inchi plants.

AB Questions How does the presence of understorey plant species vary with distance-to-edge along very large periphery-to-interior and forest patch size gradients? Can forest core and periphery species profiles be identified? What life-history traits can discriminate between forest core and forest periphery species?
   Location Temperate forests in the northern half of France.
   Methods Local climate, soil, stand characteristics and landscape metrics were collected on 19 989 plots in 1801 forest patches using data from the French National Forest Inventory. Very large distance-to-edge (31096 m) and patch size gradients (327100 000 ha) were explored. Four logistic regression models were compared to determine the response patterns of 214 species to distance-to-edge, while controlling for patch size and local habitat quality (soil, climate and stand). The maximum distance of correlation between species occurrence and distance-to-edge was assessed using response curve characteristics. The relationships between life-history traits (habitat preference, preference for ancient forests, reproduction mode, dispersal mode, life form and autecology) and species profile according to distance-to-edge were tested.
   Results Of the 214 species analysed, 40 had a core profile and 38 a periphery profile. The maximum distance of correlation was on average 748 m. Core species were more often species reproducing both by seed and vegetatively, ancient forest species, anemochores, bryophytes, pteridophytes, hemicryptophytes and acidophiles, whereas peripheral species were more often species reproducing by seed only, endozoochores, phanerophytes, thermophiles, basophiles, nitrogen-demanding and heliophiles.
   Conclusions Significant periphery-to-core patterns of distribution were detected over much larger ranges than hitherto recognized for common understorey plant species. Plant traits differentiated forest core from forest periphery species. This deep gradient cannot be solely explained by the usual edge-related biotic and abiotic factors. We hypothesized that it was due to edge displacement following general reforestation since ca. 1830. This edge shift created recent forests with new habitats on former agricultural lands where dispersal-limited core species had slowly expanded and forest edge species regressed at variable speeds. This long periphery-to-interior gradient of presence has important implications for forest plant species distribution, dynamics and conservation.

AB Questions The maintenance of a diverse sapling pool is of particular importance for the regeneration and persistance of species-rich forest ecosystems. However, the mechanisms of co-existence of saplings have rarely been studied experimentally. Do species richness, species composition, species identity and stand density affect the co-existence, growth patterns and crown architecture of tree saplings? Location Jiangxi Province, southeast China. Methods In a field experiment, we manipulated the local neighbourhood of saplings of four early-successional subtropical species (Schima superba, Elaeocarpus decipiens, Quercus serrata and Castanea henryi) with regard to species richness (one, two and four species), species composition (monocultures, six-two-species combinations and one-four-species combination) and stand density (low, intermediate and high). We tested for treatment effects and impact of species identity on growth variables, biomass allocation, crown architectural traits and branch demography. Results Species richness was a poor predictor of all response variables, but enhanced pruning and branch turnover. In contrast, species composition proved to be of great importance for growth, biomass allocation, crown architecture and branch demography. Local neighbourhood interactions of saplings were characterized by complementary or facilitative, as well as by competitive mechanisms. Intra-specific competition was higher than inter-specific competition for two species (C.similar to henryi, Q.similar to serrata) depending on the respective species combination. To a high degree, the competitive ability of species can be explained by species identity. Competition for light likely played a major role in our experiment, as evidenced by the strong response of crown architecture and branch demography to the manipulated predictor variables. Conclusions Effects of species composition and species identity on growth rates and crown architecture variables of tree saplings point to niche separation as a mechanism of species co-existence, while effects of species richness were not yet prominent at the sapling life stage.

AB Plants exhibit higher leaf-to-root ratios (L/R) and lower leaf nitrogen content (N-area) in low-light than in high-light environments, but an ecological significance of this trait has not been explained from a whole-plant perspective. This study aimed to theoretically and experimentally demonstrate whether these observed L/R and N-area are explained as optimal biomass allocation that maximize whole-plant relative growth rate (RGR). We developed a model which predicts optimal L/R and N-area in response to nitrogen and light availability. In the model, net assimilation rate (NAR) was determined by light-photosynthesis curve, light availability measured during experiments, and leaf temperature affecting the photosynthesis and leaf dark respiration rate in high and low-light environments. Two pioneer trees, Morus bombycis and Acer buergerianum, were grown in various light and nitrogen availabilities in an experimental garden and used for parameterizing and testing the model predictions. They were grouped into four treatment groups (relative photosynthetic photon flux density, RPPFD 100% or 10% x nitrogen-rich or nitrogen-poor conditions) and grown in an experimental garden for 60 to 100 days. The model predicted that optimal L/R is higher and N-area is lower in low-light than high-light environments when compared in the same soil nitrogen availability. Observed L/R and N-area of the two pioneer trees were close to the predicted optimums. From the model predictions and pot experiments, we conclude that the pioneer trees, M. bombycis and A. buergerianum, regulated L/R and N-area to maximize RGR in response to nitrogen and light availability.

AB The inclusion of carbon stock enhancements under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) framework will likely drive a rapid increase in biosequestration projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere through rehabilitation of degraded primary rain forests. Such projects could also present an important opportunity to reverse losses of biodiversity from degraded rain forests, but concern has recently been expressed that management interventions to increase carbon stocks may conflict with biodiversity conservation. Focusing on a large-scale rain forest rehabilitation project in northern Borneo, we examine: (i) how intensive rehabilitation of selectively logged forests affected patterns of bird community composition and (ii) whether changes in vegetation structure explain observed shifts in avian guild structure and species composition. Bird composition differed between unlogged, naturally regenerating logged, and rehabilitated logged habitats, with the avifauna of rehabilitated forest more similar to that of naturally regenerating forest. Crucially, rehabilitation did not adversely affect either those species that declined after logging or those species that are IUCN Red Listed. Rehabilitation reduced the prevalence of vines and shrubs within regenerating forest, and across all habitats, the abundance and species richness of all birds and of obligate frugivores were positively related to vine prevalence. In contrast, the abundance and richness of frugivore-insectivore generalists and of salliers were negatively related to vines, suggesting that avifaunal responses to forest rehabilitation were attributable to liberation cutting of vines. Management intervention to increase carbon stocks had little adverse effect on avian biodiversity and we therefore argue that rain forest rehabilitation should play a strong role in future REDD+ agreements.

AB Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) have high levels of plant and fungal diversity. We examined whether macromycete alpha and beta diversity were associated with woody plant diversity, forest structure, or microclimate, in four TMCFs at lower (1240-1440 m) and upper altitudes (1790-1900 m) in Veracruz, Mexico. Every 2 weeks during the growing season, macromycetes were collected from ten 10 m x 10 m permanent plots per site, and air and soil temperature and humidity were measured. In total, 2059 macromycetes (509 species) and 678 woody plants (63 species) were recorded. Macromycete diversity (Shannon Index) values of the two sites located in lower forests were higher than in upper sites. Beta diversity (Jaccard index) indicated high turnover among sites and sampling times. Macromycete richness was negatively correlated with overstorey tree richness, understorey vegetation structure, and air temperature, but was positively correlated with air humidity and soil water content and altitude. Ordinations separated lower from upper altitude forest sites. Changes in composition and abundance of macromycete species with altitude were explained by precipitation, temperature, and understorey vegetation structure, while soil water content effect changes within a growing season. Results imply that understorey vegetation structure is a more important aspect for macrofungal diversity management than for woody plant diversity.

AB Shade coffee plantations have received attention for their role in biodiversity conservation. Bats are among the most diverse mammalian taxa in these systems; however, previous studies of bats in coffee plantations have focused on the largely herbivorous leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae). In contrast, we have virtually no information on how ensembles of aerial insectivorous bats - nearly half the Neotropical bat species - change in response to habitat modification. To evaluate the effects of agroecosystem management on insectivorous bats, we studied their diversity and activity in southern Chiapas, Mexico, a landscape dominated by coffee agroforestry. We used acoustic monitoring and live captures to characterize the insectivorous bat ensemble in forest fragments and coffee plantations differing in the structural and taxonomic complexity of shade trees. We captured bats of 12 non-phyllostomid species; acoustic monitoring revealed the presence of at least 12 more species of aerial insectivores. Richness of forest bats was the same across all land-use types; in contrast, species richness of open-space bats increased in low shade, intensively managed coffee plantations. Conversely, only forest bats demonstrated significant differences in ensemble structure (as measured by similarity indices) across land-use types. Both overall activity and feeding activity of forest bats declined significantly with increasing management intensity, while the overall activity, but not feeding activity, of open-space bats increased. We conclude that diverse shade coffee plantations in our study area serve as valuable foraging and commuting habitat for aerial insectivorous bats, and several species also commute through or forage in low shade coffee monocultures.

AB Deforestation in Brazilian Amazonia accounts for a disproportionate global scale fraction of both carbon emissions from biomass burning and biodiversity erosion through habitat loss. Here we use field- and remote-sensing data to examine the effects of private landholding size on the amount and type of forest cover retained within economically active rural properties in an aging southern Amazonian deforestation frontier. Data on both upland and riparian forest cover from a survey of 300 rural properties indicated that 49.4% (SD = 29.0%) of the total forest cover was maintained as of 2007. and that property size is a key regional-scale determinant of patterns of deforestation and land-use change. Small properties (<= 150 ha) retained a lower proportion of forest (20.7%, SD = 17.6) than did large properties (>150 ha; 55.6%, SD = 27.2). Generalized linear models showed that property size had a positive effect on remaining areas of both upland and total forest cover. Using a Landsat time-series, the age of first clear-cutting that could be mapped within the boundaries of each property had a negative effect on the proportion of upland, riparian, and total forest cover retained. Based on these data, we show contrasts in land-use strategies between smallholders and largeholders, as well as differences in compliance with legal requirements in relation to minimum forest cover set-asides within private landholdings. This suggests that property size structure must be explicitly considered in landscape-scale conservation planning initiatives guiding agro-pastoral frontier expansion into remaining areas of tropical forest.

AB Limestone karst ecosystems in Southeast Asia and Vietnam are important reservoirs for biodiversity and are currently experiencing habitat loss and degradation due to land use changes and increasing pressure from extractive and tourism industries. Recent reviews indicate that their biodiversity is poorly known and raise doubts about the extent to which karst can maintain its biodiversity in the face of ongoing degradation. We investigated this issue by examining the effects of forest degradation on bat species diversity, composition and abundance. Using mist nets and harp traps, we sampled bat assemblages in karst forests of differing integrity for a total of 240 net nights and 180 harp trap nights, capturing 694 bats representing 36 species and five families. Our results confirm that primary forests in Vietnamese karst are exceptionally important for bat diversity, supporting substantial proportions of the national fauna. Disturbed and heavily degraded karst forests also appear capable of supporting relatively high numbers of bat species at low abundances, but their ability to do so in the longer term is in doubt and requires further research. Our findings of bats in relict forests on karst hillsides and ridgetops provide justification for their protection and raise the possibility that these may provide corridors for the movement of forest-dwelling bats within anthropogenic landscapes. Since the majority of Vietnamese karst landscapes remain unprotected however, the future of their biodiversity remains uncertain.

AB Spatial heterogeneity in coral reef communities is well documented. This "species turnover" (beta diversity) on shallow warm-water reefs strongly conforms to spatial gradients in the environment as well as spatially autocorrelated biotic processes such as dispersal and competition. But the extent to which the environment and spatial autocorrelation create beta diversity on deep cold-water coral reefs such as those formed by Lophelia pertusa (Scleractinia) is unknown. The effects of remotely sensed and ground-truthed data were tested on the community composition of sessile suspension-feeding communities from the Mingulay Reef Complex, a landscape of inshore Lophelia reefs off the Scottish west coast. Canonical correspondence analysis determined that a statistically significant proportion (68%) of the variance in community composition could be explained by remotely sensed environmental variables (northerly and easterly aspect, seabed rugosity, depth), ground-truthed environmental variables (species richness and reef macrohabitat) and geospatial location. This variation was further partitioned into fractions explained by pure effects of the environment (51%), spatially structured environmental variables (12%) and spatial autocorrelation (5%). Beta diversity in these communities reflected the effects of both measured and unmeasured and spatially dependent environmental variables that vary across the reef complex, i.e., hydrography. Future work will quantify the significance and relative contributions of these variables in creating beta diversity in these rich communities.

AB Questions
   What are the effects of soil, topography, treefall gaps, tree species composition, and tree density on liana species composition and total liana abundance?
   Location
   A 6-ha permanent plot in a subtropical montane forest in northwest Argentina.
   Methods
   Multiple regressions were used to quantify associations of liana species composition and total liana abundance with edaphic, disturbance and tree community variables. Gradients in liana and tree species composition were quantified using principal components analysis (PCA).
   Results
   Liana species composition was correlated most strongly with soil phosphorus concentration (R2=0.55). Total liana aanased with phosphorus and the density of recent treefall gaps (R2=0.60).
   Conclusions
   In our study area, liana composition and abundance are most strongly correlated with features of the physical environment, rather than host tree characteristics. Our results support the hypothesis that recent increases in liana abundance in mature tropical forests may be related to increased rates of gap formation.

AB Two payment for environmental services programs in the Amazon, namely, Noel Kempff Mercado Climate Action Project in Bolivia and Bolsa Floresta Program in Brazil, have been pioneering initiatives to demonstrate the ability to encourage forest conservation through market mechanisms involving direct payments for avoiding deforestation. This article argues that (a) to be effective in the long-run, programs have to consider the needs and priorities of forest dwellers, which are indeed beyond market-based incentives; (b) a win-win discourse combining forest conservation and poverty alleviation through provision of PES may hide vested interests of developed countries' institutions and developing countries' elites. Proving the workability of these types of activities and their quantification for emissions credit will be critical for the launching of reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) in the context of a future climate agreement.

AB The rock lobster Jasus lalandii expanded its centre of distribution south-eastwards into an area known as 'East of Cape Hangklip' on the south-west coast of South Africa in the early 1990s. Using historical and present data, we analysed differences in the abundance of key species and functional groups between the pre- and post-rock lobster invasion periods at two sites along that coast: Cape Hangklip and Betty's Bay. Pre-1989, lobsters were absent, but after 1995 they reached densities approximating 0.4-0.8 m-2. Benthic community composition also changed significantly with herbivores being abundant whereas macroalgae and sessile invertebrates were scarce pre-invasion. We attribute the decline of herbivores to the direct effects of lobster predation, in turn indirectly promoting macroalgae. Post-invasion sessile invertebrates and macroalgae increased by 2 600% and 453% respectively, whereas herbivores declined by 99.3%. The virtual elimination of the sea urchin Parechinus angulo-sus by rock lobsters has substantial implications for the commercial harvesting of the abalone Haliotis midae, because its juveniles are intimately associated with this urchin. The lobster invasion has thus not only led to a regime shift of the ecosystem but has also substantial economic consequences, which calls for an ecosystem approach to the management of the pool of commercially exploited resources in this region.

ID VASCULAR EPIPHYTES; MINERAL-NUTRITION; STOICHIOMETRY; CARBOHYDRATE;
   NUTRIENT; ECOLOGY; FORESTS; CARBON; LAND
AB Insufficient nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) frequently limit primary production. Although most nutrient studies on vascular epiphytes have focused on N uptake, circumstantial evidence suggests that P rather than N is the most limiting element for growth in this plant group. We directly tested this by subjecting a total of 162 small individuals of three bromeliad species (Guzmania monostachia, Tillandsia elongata, Werauhia sanguinolenta) to three N and three P levels using a full-factorial experimental design, and determined relative growth rates (RGR) and nutrient acquisition over a period of 11 weeks. Both N and P supply had a significant effect on RGR, but only tissue P concentrations were correlated with growth. Uptake rates of N and P, in contrast, were not correlated with RGR. Increased nutrient supply led to an up to sevenfold increase in tissue P concentration compared to natural conditions, while concentrations of N hardly changed or even decreased. All treatment combinations, even at the lowest experimental P supply, led to decreased N:P ratios. We conclude that P is at least as limiting as N for vegetative function under natural conditions in these epiphytic bromeliads. This conclusion is in line with the general notion of the prevalence of P limitation for the functioning of terrestrial vegetation in the tropics.

AB Spatial dispersion patterns of trees at different life stages are an important aspect to investigate in understanding the mechanisms that facilitate species coexistence. In this paper, Ripley's univariate L(r) and bivariate L-12(r) functions were used to analyze spatial distribution patterns and spatial associations across different life stages of 131 tree species in a 20-ha plot of a tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna, southwest China. Our results show that: (1) Saplings of 109 (83.2%) species have a significant clumped distribution, which confirms the ubiquity of clumped spatial distributions among tropical tree species. (2) Adults of 126 (96.2%) species have a random distribution suggesting that density-dependent mortality can make the spatial pattern of tropical trees more regular with time. (3) At small scales (0-10 m), 95 (72.5%) species have a neutral or negative sapling-adult association, implying that there is recruitment limitation within the vicinity of their conspecific adults. The reduction in spatial clumping in going from younger to older life stages and the neutral or negative sapling-adult association imply density-dependent mortality in the vicinity of adult trees. In accordance with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, such density-dependent mortality can free up space for other species to colonize, contributing to the maintenance of species diversity.

AB Spatio-temporal variation in tropical savanna tree cover remains poorly understood. We aimed to quantify the drivers of tree cover in tropical mesic savannas in Kakadu National Park by relating changes in tree cover over 40 years to: mean annual rainfall, fire activity, initial tree cover and prior changes in tree cover. Aerial photography, acquired in 1964, 1984 and 2004, was obtained for fifty sites in Kakadu that spanned a rainfall gradient from approximately 1200 to 1600 mm. The remotely sensed estimates of tree cover were validated via field survey. Linear mixed effects modelling and multi-model inference were used to assess the strength and form of the relationships between tree cover and predictor variables. Over the 40 years, tree cover across these savannas increased on average by 4.94 +/- 0.88%, but was spatio-temporally variable. Tree cover showed a positive albeit weak trend across the rainfall gradient. The strength of this positive relationship varied over the three measurement times, and this suggests that other factors are important in controlling tree cover. Tree cover was positively related to prior tree cover, and negatively correlated with fire activity. Over 20 years tree cover was more likely to increase if (i) tree cover was initially low or (ii) had decreased in the previous 20-year interval or (iii) there had been fewer fires. Across the examined rainfall gradient, the greater variability in fire activity and inherently higher average tree cover at the wetter latitudes resulted in greater dynamism of tree cover compared with the drier latitudes. This is consistent with savanna tree cover being determined by interactions between mean annual rainfall, tree competition and frequent fire in these tropical mesic savannas.

AB In the present study, I described the organization of a Neotropical bat assemblage, and tested whether this organization was variable in time. In an Atlantic Forest reserve in southeastern Brazil bats were captured monthly with mist nets over 4 years, and individuals were classified into guilds. I analyzed only leaf-nosed bats, and observed that guilds of fruit-eating bats dominated the assemblage. This pattern was repeated across months and years. However, among frugivores, canopy and understory guilds peaked during different months, but in both cases during the rainy season, while variation among habitat-opportunistic species was not explained by rainfall. The most reliable ecological service delivered by phyllostomid bats in the area is seed dispersal, although other services may be also important in particular seasons. My results suggest that the observed patterns of temporal species turnover are related to the abundance of preferred food items. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Tropical rainforests in Southeast Asia are decreasing rapidly because of conversion to agricultural lands, which in turn leads to an increase in mosaic landscapes. Little is known about the effects of these anthropogenic changes on bat fauna or feeding behaviour. To better explore anthropogenic effects on bats (Chiroptera), we investigated the diversity and feeding habits of bats in an intact lowland dipterocarp forest and surrounding areas of varying vegetation types. The total sampling effort using mist nets (32,795 m(2)h) resulted in the capture of 495 bats, representing 28 species. Simpson's index of diversity was relatively high in primary forests (7.86) compared to secondary forests (3.38), orchards (3.65), and oil palm plantations (1.24). The capture rate of two frugivorous bats clearly differed among the four vegetation types, and these species were never caught in orchards or oil palm plantations. In addition, the capture rate of microchiropterans was notably lower in oil palm plantations than in the other three vegetation types. These results indicate that many bat species rarely use agricultural land for feeding, and these plant communities are not suitable for maintaining bat diversity. However, the data on the feeding habits of three megachiropterans that were frequently captured in orchards and oil palm plantations indicate that agricultural plants are their primary food sources. Orchards and oil palm plantations may be inadequate habitats for most frugivorous and insectivorous bats, but these plant communities may provide important food sources for certain species of megachiropterans.

AB Chemotherapy is the only validated therapy for the treatment for the neglected diseases leishmaniasis and malaria. However, the emergence of drug resistance, collateral effects and long-term treatment encourage the development of new and more efficient drugs. The Amazon tropical forest includes the richest areas of biodiversity in the world, including a great number of microbes, plant and animal species that produce a source of interesting biologically active molecules. Several of these molecules, obtained from plant extracts and frog venom have leishmanicidal and plasmodicidal activity, highlighting the potential of this biodiversity for the development of new drugs. In research, modern approaches in new drug development are carried out using combinatorial chemistry, high-throughput screening, bioinformatics, molecular interaction, crystallography and dynamic studies of cellular and systemic toxicity. In Brazil, these techniques are mainly present in only a few academic groups with no efficient connection to industry. The problem associated with over-regulation for accessing the biological material in restricted areas, local populations and indigenous areas places major barriers in the path of research and development of new drugs. Thus, the association of academic research groups in Brazil, encouraged and supported by government and industry, is essential to overcome these major barriers related to the development of new products for treatment of neglected diseases from Amazonian biodiversity in future years.

AB We investigated the influence of Pinus afforestation on the structure of leaf-litter ant communities in the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest, studying an old secondary forest and a nearly 30 year-old never managed Pinus elliottii reforested area. A total of 12,826 individual ants distributed among 95 species and 32 genera were obtained from 50 1 m(2) samples/habitat. Of these, 60 species were recorded in the pine plantation and 82 in the area of Atlantic forest; almost 50% of the species found in the secondary forest area were also present in the pine plantation. The number of species per sample was significantly higher in the secondary forest than in the pine plantation. Forest-adapted taxa are the most responsible for ant species richness differences between areas, and the pine plantation is richer in species classified as soil or litter omnivorous-dominants. The specialized ant predators registered in the pine plantation, as seven Dacetini, two Basiceros, two Attini and two Discothyrea, belong to widely distributed species. The NMDS (non-metric multidimensional scaling) ordination also suggested strong differences in similarity among samples of the two areas. Furthermore, this analysis indicated higher sample heterogeneity in the secondary forest, with two clusters of species, while in the pine plantation the species belong to a single cluster. We applied the ant mosaic hypothesis to explain the distribution of the leaf-litter fauna and spatial autocorrelation tests among samples. We argue that the results are likely related to differences in quality and distribution of the leaf-litter between the pine plantation and the secondary area.

AB Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa), has emerged as the cornerstone of the extractive economy in much of the Amazon, but the debate continues as to whether or not current harvest levels have a detrimental effect on Brazil nut seedling recruitment. While regeneration studies to date have been conducted solely within mature forest, our study provides further insight into current Brazil nut regeneration dynamics, with a unique first look at regeneration in swidden fallows within two multiple-use areas in Acre, Brazil. Recruitment of individuals <= 10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) was evaluated within three 9 ha mature forest plots and six fallows of 0.5-1.0 ha each. Higher mean densities of B. excelsa seedlings (individuals < 1.5 m in height) were observed in fallow than in mature forest (12.7 and 5.3 individuals ha(-1), respectively). A generalized linear mixed model analysis revealed that in addition to forest type, proximity to seed sources also explained seedling densities. Height and diameter growth of young B. excelsa individuals was positively related to light availability. Photosynthetic photon flux density levels were over three times higher in fallows versus mature forest during peak sunlight hours. Results suggest that fallow environments may provide favorable conditions for B. excelsa regeneration. Not only can anthropogenic disturbance in the form of shifting cultivation play a positive role in B. excelsa regeneration, its historic presence on the landscape could explain current Brazil nut densities and distributions. Finally, swidden fallows could potentially be managed for enhanced Brazil nut densities, which may provide an opportunity for greater income for extractive families while contributing to the sustainability of Brazil nut extraction and forest conservation in the long term.

AB Tropical agroecosystems cover an increasingly large proportion of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Yet, relatively little is known about the factors that influence their avifauna, especially in areas of high human population density. The potential of tropical farmland for sustaining bird biodiversity, including forest birds, can be influenced by habitat structure and the distance from the nearest forest. We investigated the effect of these two factors on the bird community in the farmland near Kakamega Forest, Kenya. Using point counts, we assessed the number of bird species and individuals on 56 study plots in distances up to about 2,100 m from the forest. We observed a total of 96 bird species in the farmland, 22 of which were forest, 58 shrub-land, and 16 open-country species. High vertical vegetation heterogeneity and a large number of woody plant individuals were related to high species richness of forest and shrub-land birds, whereas open-country birds avoided such areas. The species richness and total number of forest birds declined with increasing distance to the forest. A comparison with the bird community within Kakamega Forest indicated that only a fraction of the forest species could be sustained in the farmland. This suggests that agroecosystems with a diverse habitat structure can support a high diversity of birds, but have only a limited capacity to compensate for forest loss.

AB Cattle and agricultural farming in the western Orinoco Basin began in 1555, and since then fragmentation of continuous forest has occurred. We evaluated the effects of the disturbances and the absence of large primates on plant community composition, diversity, and regeneration patterns. Atelines (Lagothrix and Ateles) inhabited the lowlands close to the Andean mountains, but no longer live in fragmented habitats. Their absence may have negative effects on plant populations because atelines play important roles as seed dispersers in neotropical forests, especially for large-seeded plants, which are rarely swallowed by other seed dispersers. We compared 2 1-ha vegetation plots in forest fragments north of the La Macarena Mountains with 7 plots in continuous forest in Tinigua National Park. Both sites share the same climatic conditions and have similar geological origins. There is floristic affinity between forests with similar ecological characteristics; the fragmented forests are also less diverse than the continuous forests. As predicted, the forest fragments have fewer individuals with large seeds. The results suggest that forest fragmentation and local ateline extinctions affect plant communities, reducing diversity and affecting large-seeded plants.

AB Questions: In a natural grassland-forest mosaic: What is the influence of phylogeny and diaspore traits related to disperser attraction (DAT) on (1) seed size/number trade-off (SSNT) in woody species colonizing forest patches; (2) on the frequency of the species? 3. What is the influence of forest patch area on mean seed size and number. 4. Do phylogeny and DAT expressed at the species level affect this relationship?
   Location: Campos grassland and Araucaria forest in Sao Francisco de Paula, RS, Brazil, at ca. 29 degrees 28' S; 50 degrees 13' W.
   Methods: Forest patches of different sizes in a grassland site recovering for ten years since human disturbances were surveyed by the relative abundance of vertebrate-dispersed woody saplings. We described colonizer species according to taxonomic phylogenetic relationships and diaspore type, size and color. We analyzed with a variation partitioning method their influence on SSNT and on species frequency in the patches. At the community level we regressed mean seed size and number on forest patch area and evaluated how these relation ships were affected by phylogeny and DAT at the species level.
   Results: 1. Phylogeny and DAT mostly explained seed size and seed number per diaspore variation. 2. By controlling phylogeny and DAT influence the frequency of species in forest patches was positively associated with their seed number in the diaspores, and negatively associated with their seed size. 3. Mean seed size and seed number at the community level were positively associated with patch area. 4. When phylogeny and DAT influences on seed size were removed this relationship was stronger for seed size and weaker for seed number.
   Conclusions: 1. Energy allocation to dispersal in detriment of offspring survival increased the successful establishment of colonizer species in forest patches, despite phylogenetic relationships and DAT variation in their diaspores. 2. Although patch area exerted a selective pressure on seed size, habitat preferences of dispersers may also influence patch colonization.

AB If community structure is influenced by habitat structure at a local level, then it should be possible to tie species occurrence to key habitat variables. We used a pitfall-trap system to determine the relationship of species composition, species diversity (relative abundance), and community structure to habitat structure along a transect through a habitat gradient in the Brazilian Cerrado. A total of 531 individuals of 12 lizard species were sampled. A species accumulation curve based on Estimates and a curve-fitting protocol predicted 12 species at day 22 and all species by about day 40. We registered 12 species at day 11. Trapping success declined through time, likely because of a combination of removal along the transect and seasonal environmental change (wet to dry). The more open end of our transect experienced higher temperatures in all microhabitats sampled, suggesting thermal structure associated with vegetative structure. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that lizard species composition and relative abundance respond to variation in vegetative and physical structure of the habitat at small scales. Consequently, maintenance of habitat gradients should be considered in programs aimed at maintaining local biodiversity.

AB Carapa guianensis Aublet. is a tropical tree with strong multiple-use characteristics, and is valued for both the high quality oil extracted from its seeds and as a timber resource. This study compares the population structure of this economically important rainforest tree in two contrasting forest types: occasionally inundated and terra firme forests. Main study objectives were (a) to assess the density, spatial distribution, and size class structure of C. guianensis in these two forest types and (b) to use patterns of abundance, distribution and demographic structure to help infer key demographic stages or ecological variables that merit special focus for management. Four 400 m, x 400 m plots, two in each forest type, were established to determine distribution and density patterns of C. guianensis >= 10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) at the landscape level, and 32 10 m x 10 m subplots were randomly nested within each of the larger plots to measure individuals < 10 cm dbh. Larger individuals (>= 10 cm dbh) were found at higher densities in occasionally inundated forest than in terra firme forest: 25.7 trees ha(-1) and 14.6 trees ha(-1), respectively. Mean density of C. guianensis individuals < 10 cm dbh was also higher in occasionally inundated forests, but variation of regeneration density among the subplots was high. Spatial distribution methods revealed a tendency toward clumping in both forest types, and both had similar size class structures, suggesting that both environments are suitable for C. guianensis. This new finding illustrates the potential for C guianensis management in terra firme forests. High densities and clumped distributions in both forest types are also indices favorable for sustainable species management. Finally, several ecological variables (tree density and reproductive potential) were sufficiently different between terra firme and occasionally inundated forests to recommend stratification by forest type when conducting further studies on key ecological and management variables of C guianensis.

AB The effects of energy on food web structure have been debated for at least 80 years. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence is meager, especially from terrestrial ecosystems. We analyzed long-term temporal variation in food chain length in a semiarid continental ecosystem, where productivity shows large interannual variations. Incidence of nonherbivorous prey in predator diet was used as a proxy of trophic position, allowing us to analyze the effect of productivity on food chain length within the assemblage of top predators ( which comprises the most abundant and persistent top predators in the system) and to compare observed patterns at the species and assemblage levels. At the species level, the relationship between trophic position and productivity took different forms, varying in magnitude and shape. This pattern contrasts with the consistent increase in food chain length, with productivity observed at the assemblage level. Our results indicate that productivity can be a main determinant of food chain length, but not necessarily because of energy limitation. Further, the increase in food chain length with available energy probably represents an aggregate attribute, driven to a large extent by predators with higher consumption rates, rather than being the result of compensatory responses among predators.

AB Subject trees included in growth analyses often vary in their initial size, possibly obscuring the effects of growth factors. We compare methods for incorporating size effects into growth models. For four different tree species, red maple (Acer rubrum L.), sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), and red oak (Quercus rubra L.), we compared models of radial growth rate of saplings as a function of light, water, and nitrogen availability that (i) ignored size effects on absolute growth-resource relationships, (ii) related absolute growth rate (AGR) to size and resource availability, (iii) related relative growth rate (RGR) to resource availability, and (iv) related RGR to tree size and resource availability. Size effects explained 13%-14% of variation in growth rates, and failure to account for these effects resulted in a substantial size bias in growth prediction. Overall, AGR-based models that included size as a predictor variable provided the best predictions and clearest interpretation of growth-resource relationships across all growth model types and species examined. Modeling RGR without including size effects resulted in residual size bias. Including size as a predictor of RGR yielded nearly equivalent results to using size to predict AGR. We suggest that investigators evaluate both AGR- and RGR-based approaches and determine which is most appropriate for their study.

AB Taxonomically, the Mollusca of the southern end of South America are moderately well known, but the literature is scattered, there is little information on their habitats, and distributional records are scarce for the Chilean archipelago lying between Chiloe Island (42 degrees S) and Tierra del Fuego (55 degrees S). Although much is known about the biology and ecology of of some species of Nacellidae, the taxonomy of the group have been partially neglected, particularly in remote areas of the world such as the Chilean fjords. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the nomenclatural status, and establish the morphological characteristics and distribution of the Chilean Nacellidae. Especially, the following three objectives are pursued: (i) to clarify the correct identity of existing species; (ii) to describe of morphological details, highlighting the clear diagnostic characters of each species. and (iii) to delimitate and discuss their geographical range in Chile. The examination of the Nacellidae of the Chilean fiords has resulted in the recognition of one species of Nacella (Nacella) and seven species of Nacella (Patinigera), wherein the principal specific differences are in the shell (shape, thickness and color) and in radular teeth morphology. The genus Nacella and its subgenus Patinigera are cold-water limpets, and are exclusively inhabitants of Subantarctic and Antarctic waters. The greater part of their range being subantarctic, but extending to the Antarctic by way of the Scotia Are, and also ranging northward up the Chilean coast to at least Valparaiso at 33 degrees S (only N. (P.) clypeater). They apparently have their centre of distribution in the Magellanic Province of southern South America, corresponding to an area with a high degree of diversification (N. (N.) mytilina, N. (P.) chiloensis, N. (P.) deaurata, N. (P.) delicatissima, N. (P.) flammea, N. (P.) magellanica, N. (P.) venosa), wherefrom the species tends to spread eastward, with a larval transport probably assisted to a considerable extent by the prevailing West Wind Drift which strongly operates in the Subantarctic Zone.

AB We conducted a rigorous test of tropical tree seedling microhabitat differentiation by examining microhabitat associations, survival and growth of established seedlings of ten tropical tree species representing a four-factor gradient in seed size. Eight microhabitat variables describing soil and light conditions were measured directly adjacent to each of 588 seedlings within twelve 10 x 100 m belt transects at Paracou, French Guiana, and at 264 reference points along the transects. From these measurements, we defined three principal components describing soil richness, soil softness and canopy openness. Six of ten species ( in 9 of 30 total cases) were distributed non-randomly with respect to microhabitat along at least one principal component. However, few species demonstrated clear microhabitat specialization. All shifts in distribution relative to reference points were in the same direction ( richer, softer soil). Furthermore, of 135 pairwise comparisons among the species, only 7 were significantly different. More than three-fourths of all seedlings (75.3%) survived over the 2-year monitoring period, but survival rates varied widely among species. In no case was the probability of survival influenced by any microhabitat parameter. Relative height growth rates for the seedlings over 2 years varied from - 0.031 cm cm(-1) year(-1) (Dicorynia guianensis, Caesalpiniaceae) to 0.088 cm cm(-1) year(-1) (Virola michelii, Myristicaceae). In only 4 of 30 cases was height growth significantly associated with one of the three principal components. Because the conditions in this study were designed to maximize the chance of finding microhabitat differentiation among a group of species differing greatly in life history traits, the lack of microhabitat specialization it uncovered suggests that microhabitat partitioning among tropical tree species at the established seedling stage is unlikely to contribute greatly to coexistence among these species.

AB Processes of natural regeneration in highly fragmented landscapes are strongly influenced by edge environments due to the effects of vegetation cover on microclimate conditions. These effects may be diminished or exacerbated through synergistic interactions with extreme climatic events such as drought. This study assessed the growth and physiological responses of five native tree and shrub species (Quercus acutifolia Nee, Q. castanea Nee, Pinus oaxacana (Mart.) Mirov. Dodonea viscosa (L.) Jacq., Rhus virens Adams) to microsites along edge gradients occurring between forest remnants and openings of different sizes (<0.2 and >1 ha) in both a highly fragmented and a relatively undisturbed adjacent landscape over a 2-year period (1 year with normal rainfall and one with extreme drought). Of the species studied, the shrub seedlings had significantly lower mortality (3-13%) than the oak (37-53%) and pine (35%). Seedling survival for all species was greatest in the edge and forest understory environments, suggesting that vegetation cover may have a facilitative effect on seedling regeneration. Greater survivorship and biomass of the shrub seedlings, especially in the open microsites, was attributed to their root system having a sufficient biomass and depth to more effectively access deeper water supplies. Interactions between edge effects and an extreme drought event were found to have a more pronounced impact on the performance of oak and pine seedlings compared to shrub seedlings. Patterns of pre-dawn water potential (psi(pd) < -3.8) and leaf phenology (slow turnover) indicated that oak species experienced high water stress that prevented their successful establishment in open environments, especially during drought years. In contrast, shrub seedlings, and to a lesser extent pine seedlings, maintained higher pre-dawn moisture potentials (psi(pd) > -2.9) and greater phenological plasticity (fast turnover) in response to drought, contributing to greater growth and survival success. To effectively manage fragmented tropical highland oak forest landscapes for reestablishment of the native oak ecosystem, there is a need to understand the complex and often synergistic interactions between different plant species, the edge environment, and climatic variability that strongly influence regeneration processes.

AB Defenses against predators may be physiological, morphological, behavioral, or combinations thereof and are nearly always induced, at least in part, by prey perception of predation risk. One antipredation behavior is to group; however the way in which this translates into a reduction in risk to an individual is not fully understood. Here we demonstrate a novel aspect of grouping as a defense, using aggregated limpets (Patella vulgata) as a test system. Although not having experienced the predator directly, potential prey in aggregations detect the vibrations of an attack on a group member and reduce their vulnerability to predation. This effect travels further and lasts longer than would be expected. Our results imply that, for a prey showing a mix of distributions (some solitary and some aggregated), aggregations may probably be easier to find but actually represent a single predation opportunity.

AB A study was carried out to determine the effect of single tree (Quercus ilex subsp, ballota) shaded microhabitats on the community structure of ground-nesting ants in a semi-natural Mediterranean ecosystem ("dehesa"). A total of 1156 ant nests belonging to 20 species were detected in the study area, with a mean density of 10-11 nests per 100 m(2). Ground ant nests were denser under tree cover than on exposed grassland. Species richness and diversity also tended to increase in areas under tree canopies. These effects were found to be proportional to the area of tree cover up to a certain limit, beyond which the trend became negative. Species composition differed between open ground and tree-shaded microhabitats. Shade-tolerant species such as Plagiolepis pygmaea were more common near trees, whereas the seed harvester ant Messor barbarus was more common in open areas.

AB Studies of habitat fragmentation have been restricted primarily to anthropogenically-altered habitats, with most research conducted 60-90 years post-fragmentation. It is unclear whether patterns in older systems concur with results from these dynamic landscapes, and hence the long-term viability of populations inhabiting habitat fragments remains largely unexplored. I focused on resident birds in fragments of humid pine-oak forest in Oaxaca, southern Mexico, isolated over 5000 years ago by climate-change. Seventeen fragments, ranging from 2 ha to over 150,000 ha were sampled in 1997 and 1998 yielding 141 species, of which 60 residents were used for analysis. Avian assemblages exhibited a highly nested structure and, with several notable exceptions, assemblages of birds in low-richness fragments were predictable subsets of those in more diverse fragments. Patch-scale factors-area, shape, elevation, habitat diversity and fractal dimension of edge-all exerted strong univariate influence on avian richness but were so closely inter-related that none had a significant independent effect. Thus, larger fragments were more complex in shape, included higher peaks, supported more diverse forests, and contained higher diversities of resident species. In contrast, the landscape-scale index used-distance from nearest large fragment (> 50,000 ha)-had little effect on richness. This was reinforced by species-level analyses-one species was significantly influenced by isolation, compared with 31 species that displayed significant minimum-area distributions, restricted to patches larger than a particular threshold value. In terms of autecology, vagility, relative abundance and elevational breadth were closely related to distribution-those species with greater mobility, higher abundances and broader elevational tolerances were consistently more widespread. I suggest that more abundant species were less prone to extinction initially, more vagile species were better dispersers and species with broader elevational tolerances more likely to be successful colonists. As with previous research from older landscapes, patch-scale factors were consistently found to be influential, with high quality fragments supporting diverse communities regardless of landscape context. This suggests that the influence of landscape-scale factors noted in younger, anthropogenically fragmented systems may be transitory, overwhelmed by patch-scale factors with time. Which patch attributes are most influential could not be resolved, however, indicating that even thousands of years after fragmentation, they affect diversity patterns in concert. Rather than differentiating effects of area from habitat heterogeneity and other patch-level factors, I advocate resource-based approaches to understand and manage diversity in habitat fragments.

AB The land crab, Gecarcinus quadratus (Gecarcinidae), affects plant diversity in a mainland, neotropical rain forest through selective seedling consumption. In Costa Rica's Corcovado National Park, G. quadratus lives in fossorial populations with up to six crabs m(-2) in coastal forest extending c. 600 in inland from the Pacific Ocean. A narrow transition zone (c. 30 in) separates the crab zone from the crabless zone that comprises the remainder of the 55 000-ha park. The composition of dicotyledonous plants from the adjacent zones were distinct: crabless zone transects (240 m(2)) contained 97 species representing 76 genera and 41 families; crab zone transects contained 46 species representing 38 genera and 25 families. Despite the narrow zonal separation, the crabless zone shared only 27.4, 29.9 and 52.8% of its species, genera and families, respectively, with the crab zone; in contrast, crab zone transects shared 56.5, 60.5 and 88% of their species, genera and families with the crabless zone. This abrupt diversity gradient suggests a powerful selection pressure in the crab zone preventing the establishment of certain dicotyledonous species. Two years of experimental crab exclusion suggested that G. quadratus reduces seedling density and diversity. Densities of seedlings (325 cm tall) within exclosures increased 144% over baseline values while control densities decreased. In contrast, seedlings at the cotyledon stage and taller (2650 cm) were unaffected by crab exclusion. Preference tests conducted in the crab zone revealed a five-fold ratio of mortality rates for seedlings transplanted from the crabless zone and crab zone respectively. However, when protected from crabs, transplanted crabless and crab zone seedlings survived similarly well over 6 mo (83 and 70% respectively). Together, data from transects and experiments suggest that G. quadratus influences plant community composition.

AB Ants can modify the properties of soil when they build their nests. We have investigated the degree and persistency of changes of soil morphology and chemistry in abandoned anthills in a temperate, deciduous wood in Jutland, Denmark. For this purpose, we sampled surface soils (0-10 cm) from each of five abandoned anthills (Formica polyctena Forster) and adjacent undisturbed sites, where anthills covered about 0.5% of the surface area. In addition, one soil profile in an abandoned anthill was sampled for morphological descriptions. All samples were analysed for pH, C, N, lignin-derived phenol, and cellulosic and non-cellulosic carbohydrate concentrations. The results showed that soils under the anthills were enriched in organic matter, were yellower and showed features of Podzol degradation. Former Podzols had to be reclassified to Umbrisols or Arenosols, whereas anthills on Luvisols affected soil classification only at the subdivision level. The ON ratio and soil pH were not significantly affected by the ants' activity. However, lignin-derived phenols and cellulosic polysaccharides were enriched inside the mounds by a factor of 6 and 7, respectively. This probably reflected collection of woody debris for nest construction while the nest was occupied, and large input of C from an increased root density. The degree of changes in the quality of the organic matter decreased with time since abandonment, but changes were still detectable within anthills left 20 years ago. As ant colonies are concentrated, and move regularly on a decadal timescale, formation of Formica anthills has an intrinsic influence on the heterogeneity of the soil within this forest ecosystem.

AB During low tide, the small periwinkles, Nodilittorina unifasciata Gray, an typically aggregated on intertidal shores in New South Wales, Australia. Previous work has documented considerable spatial and temporal variability in patterns of aggregation. in this study, aspects of behaviour of the snails that may lead to aggregation are examined in field and laboratory experiments. Although small snails were more Likely to be found in aggregations than were large snails, this pattern was influenced by the height on the shore and possibly by exposure to waves. There was also considerable individual variability in behaviour; many animals changed their pattern of dispersion (from solitary to aggregated and vice versa) from one low tide to the next. N. unifasciata appeared to recognise and respond to features of habitat as sites for aggregation, but, more importantly, aggregated in sites that previously contained an aggregation. They may move into these sites by following conspecific trails, but this could not be demonstrated in the field. Trail-following was common under laboratory conditions, although not all snails followed trails and trail-following varied in individuals from time to time. This behaviour was also influenced by environmental conditions, e.g., period of emersion. N. unifasciata did not, however, follow old trails and usually followed trails in the direction they were laid down. Most animals are therefore unlikely to return to sites of aggregation along outbound trails. These data are used to propose a model for aggregation of N. unifasciata which can explain how snails tend to aggregate in the same sites. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The cheilostome bryozoan Fenestrulina rugula is a major component of the encrusting fauna of physically disturbed shallow water habitats in Antarctica. On rocks collected from Rothera Point, Adelaide Island, F. rugula was the dominant occupier of space (88% of all bryozoans, 76% of all fauna), though spirorbid polychaetes showed more colonisation events per unit area. Growth rate was relatively rapid in comparison with other polar bryozoans, but slower than temperate or tropical species. In fully reproductive colonies almost 80% of zooids carried ovicells. Colonies whose growth brought them into contact with other encrusting fauna (usually another colony of F. rugula) produced smaller zooids and initiated ovicell production earlier than unrestrained colonies. Analysis of overgrowth interactions showed that F. rugula was a relatively poor competitor compared with other encrusting bryozoans, and most within-species interactions were indeterminate. Population mortality was relatively high, averaging 89% per annum, although not as high as in some other species from ephemeral habitats. F. rugula is thus a typical early coloniser in being relatively fast-growing, quick to mature, short-lived and a relatively poor competitor. The population dynamics and ecology of this assemblage dominant appear to have been influenced primarily by the ephemeral nature of its habitat.

AB The delta(13)C values of deciduous and evergreen tree leaves were compared in open and closed-canopy environments throughout a rainy season in Panama. Newly emerging leaves had higher delta(13)C values than older leaves of all seedlings and trees at all dates sampled. This was apparently not caused by a decline in water use efficiency as leaves develop because instantaneous c(i)/c(a), was significantly higher in newly emerging than in expanded leaves on the same twigs of trees in the field as well as on seedlings growing in a controlled, unchanging environment. Higher delta(13)C values in newly emerging leaves occurred across diverse environmental comparisons. For example, leaves emerging during the rainy season had higher delta(13)C values than corresponding mature leaves that had emerged both during the dry season and when water was abundant. The early enrichment in C-13 may thus reflect the translocation of carbon to initiate a new leaf. Furthermore, the lack of sensitivity of this enrichment to a microclimate suggests that it might be the result of processes that occur after carbon fixation by Rubisco. Other changes in delta(13)C values as leaves developed may also have resulted from carbon translocation processes. Foliar delta(13)C decreased significantly after most of the leaf biomass of the deciduous Apeiba membranacea had developed. The delta(13)C values of the evergreen Cecropia insignis were lower in the open canopy than in closed-canopy forests at the end of the rainy season. These findings suggest that the delta(13)C values of leaves can yield ecological information about the allocation of carbon within trees.

AB Animals greater than I mm, found among tangled tubes of Phyllochaetopterus socialis (Chaetopteridae) from Araca Beach, Sao Sebastiao district, Brazil, were studied for 1 year, with four samples in each of four seasons. They comprised 10 338 individuals in 17227 g dry weight of polychaete tubes, with Echinodermata, Polychaeta (not identified to species) and Crustacea as the dominant taxa. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index did not vary seasonally, only two species (a holothurian and a pycnogonid) showing seasonal variation. Ophiactis savignyi was the dominant species, providing 45.5% of individuals. Three other ophiuroids, the holothurian Synaptula hidriformis, the crustaceans Leprochelia savignyi, Megalobrachium soriatum and Synalpheus fritzmuelleri, the sipunculan Themiste alutacea and the bivalve Hiatella arctica were all abundant, but most of the 68 species recorded occurred sparsely. The assemblage associated with P. socialis was similar to the endofauna of the sponge Zygomycale parishii and the bryozoan Schizoporella unicornis, and to the epifauna of seaweed Sargassum cymosum, all of which occurred nearby.

AB We examined the photosynthetic acclimation of three tropical species of Miconia to canopy openings in a Costa Rican rainforest. The response of photosynthesis to canopy opening was very similar in Miconia affinis, M. gracilis, and M. nervosa, despite differences in growth form (trees and shrubs) and local distributions of plants (understory and gap). Four months after the canopy was opened by a treefall, photosynthetic capacity in all three species had approximately doubled from closed canopy levels. There were no obvious signs of high light damage after treefall but acclimation to the gap environment was not immediate. Two weeks after treefall, A(max), stomatal conductance, apparent quantum efficiency, and dark respiration rates had not changed significantly from understory values. The production of new leaves appears to be an important component of light acclimation in these species. The only variables to differ significantly among species were stomatal conductance at A(max) and the light level at which assimilation was saturated. M. affinis bad a higher stomatal conductance which may reduce its water use efficiency in gap environments. Photosynthesis in the more shade-tolerant M. gracilis saturated at lower light levels than in the other two species. Individual plant light environments were assessed after treefall with canopy photography but they explained only a small fraction of plant variation in most measures of photosynthesis and growth. In conclusion, we speculate that species differences in local distribution and in light requirements for reproduction may be more strongly related to species differences in carbon allocation than in carbon assimilation.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation result in significant landscape changes that ultimately affect plant diversity and add uncertainty to how natural areas will respond to future global change. This uncertainty is important given that the loss of biodiversity often includes losing key ecosystem functions. Few studies have explored the effects of landscape changes on plant functional diversity and evidence so far has shown far more pervasive effects than previously reported by species richness and composition studies. Here we present a review on the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on (1) individual functional traits-related to persistence, dispersal and establishment-and (2) functional diversity. We also discuss current knowledge gaps and propose ways forward. From the literature review we found that studies have largely focused on dispersal traits, strongly impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation, while traits related to persistence were the least studied. Furthermore, most studies did not distinguish habitat loss from spatial fragmentation and were conducted at the plot or fragment-level, which taken together limits the ability to generalize the scale-dependency of landscape changes on plant functional diversity. For future work, we recommend (1) clearly distinguishing the effects of habitat loss from those of fragmentation, and (2) recognizing the scale-dependency of predicted responses when functional diversity varies in time and space. We conclude that a clear understanding of the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on functional diversity will improve predictions of the resiliency and resistance of plant communities to varying scales of disturbance.

AB Fire and herbivory both remove aboveground biomass. Environmental factors determine the type and intensity of these consumers globally, but the traits of plants can also alter their propensity to burn and the degree to which they are eaten. To understand plant life-history strategies associated with fire and herbivory we need to describe both response and effect functional traits, and how they sort within communities, along resource gradients, and across evolutionary timescales. Fire and herbivore functional traits are generally considered separately, but there are advances made in understanding fire that relate to herbivory, and vice versa. Moreover, fire and herbivory interact: the presence of one consumer affects the type and intensity of the other. Here, we present a unifying conceptual framework to understand plant strategies that enable tolerance and persistence to fire and herbivory. Using grasses as an example, we discuss how flammability and fire tolerance, palatability, and grazing tolerance traits might organize themselves in ecosystems exposed to these consumers, and how these traits might have evolved with reference to other strong selective processes, like aridity. Our framework can be used to predict both the diversity of life-history strategies and plant species diversity under different consumer regimes.

AB The "blooming desert", or the explosive development and flowering of ephemeral herbaceous and some woody desert species during years with abnormally high accumulated rainfall, is a spectacular biological phenomenon of the hyper-arid Atacama Desert (northern Chile) attracting botanists, ecologists, geo-scientists, and the general public from all over the world. However, the number of "blooming deserts", their geographical distribution and spatio-temporal patterns have not been quantitatively assessed to date. Here, we used NDVI data from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) project to reconstruct the annual land surface phenology (ISP) of the Atacama Desert using a non-parametric statistical approach. From the reconstructed LSP, we detected the "blooming deserts" as positive NDVI anomalies and assessed three dimensions of the events: their temporal extent, intensity of "greening" and spatial extent. We identified 13 "blooming deserts" between 1981 and 2015, of which three (1997-98, 2002-03, and 2011) can be considered major events according to these metrics. The main event occurred in 2011, spanning 180 days between July and December 2011, and spread over 11,136 km2 of Atacama dry plains. "Blooming deserts" in Atacama have been triggered by the accumulation of precipitation during a period of 2 to 12 months before and during the events. The proposed three-dimensional approach allowed us to characterize different types of "blooming deserts": with longer episodes or larger spatial distribution or with different "greening" intensities. Its flexibility to reconstruct different ISP and detect anomalies makes this method a useful tool to study these rare phenomena in other deserts in the world also.

AB Malaria remains a serious public health problem in Brazil despite a significant drop in the number of cases in the past decade. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of malaria transmission in Brazil to highlight the epidemiologically most relevant components that could help tackle the disease. We consider factors impacting on the malaria burden and transmission dynamics including the geographical occurrence of both autochthonous and imported infections, the distribution and abundance of malaria vectors and records of natural mosquito infections with Plasmodium. Our analysis identifies three discrete malaria transmission systems related to the Amazon rainforest, Atlantic rainforest and Brazilian coast, respectively. The Amazonian system accounts for 99% of all malaria cases in the country. It is largely due to autochthonous P. vivax and P. falciparum transmission by mosquitoes of the Nyssorhynchus subgenus, primarily Anopheles darlingi. Whilst P. vivax transmission is widespread, P. falciparum transmission is restricted to hotspot areas mostly in the States of Amazonas and Acre. This system is the major source of P. vivax exportation to the extra-Amazonian regions that are also affected by importation of P. falciparum from Africa. The Atlantic system comprises autochthonous P. vivax transmission typically by the bromeliad-associated mosquitoes An. cruzii and An. bellator of the Kerteszia subgenus. An. cruzii also transmits simian malaria parasites to humans. The third, widespread but geographically fragmented, system is found along the Brazilian coast and comprises P. vivax transmission mainly by An. aquasalis. We conclude that these geographically and biologically distinct malaria transmission systems require specific strategies for effective disease control.

AB Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is thought to promote plant species diversity. Theoretical studies showing the importance of CNDD often assumed that all species are equally susceptible to CNDD; however, recent empirical studies have shown species can differ greatly in their susceptibility to CNDD. Using a theoretical model, we show that interspecific variation in CNDD can dramatically alter its impact on diversity. First, if the most common species are the least regulated by CNDD, then the stabilising benefit of CNDD is reduced. Second, when seed dispersal is limited, seedlings that are susceptible to CNDD are at a competitive disadvantage. When parameterised with estimates of CNDD from a tropical tree community in Panama, our model suggests that the competitive inequalities caused by interspecific variation in CNDD may undermine many species' ability to persist. Thus, our model suggests that variable CNDD may make communities less stable, rather than more stable.

AB Savannas are highly variable systems, and predicting variation, especially in the tree layer, represents a major unresolved challenge for forecasting biosphere responses to global change. Prediction to date has focused on disentangling interactions between resource limitation and chronic disturbances to identify what determines local savanna vegetation heterogeneity. By focusing at too fine a scale, this approach overlooks: sample size limitation arising from sparse tree distributions; stochasticity in demographic and environmental processes that is preserved as heterogeneity among tree populations with slow dynamics; and spatial self-organization. Renewed focus on large (1-50ha) permanent plots and on spatial patterns of tree-layer variability at even larger landscape spatial scales (>= 1000s of ha) promises to resolve these limitations, consistent with the goal of predicting large-scale biosphere responses to global change.

AB Southern Amazonia is the first region of Brazil's Amazon area to be exposed to intensive conversion to agriculture and ranching. This conversion emits greenhouse gases from the carbon stock in the biomass and soils of the previous vegetation. Quantifying these carbon stocks is the first step in quantifying the impact on global warming from this conversion. This review is limited to information on Brazilian Amazonia's carbon stocks. It indicates large amounts of carbon at risk of emission in both biomass and soils, as well as considerable uncertainty in estimates. Reducing uncertainty is a priority for research but the existence of uncertainty must not be used as an excuse for delaying measures to contain deforestation. The magnitude of carbon stocks is proportional to greenhouse gas emissions per hectare of deforestation and consequently to impact on global climate.

AB Secondary forests play an important role in restoring carbon and biodiversity lost previously through deforestation and degradation and yet there is little information available on the extent of different successional stages. Such knowledge is particularly needed in tropical regions where past and current disturbance rates have been high but regeneration is rapid. Focusing on three areas in the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus, Santarem, Machadinho d'Oeste), this study aimed to evaluate the use of single-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data in the 2007-2010 period for i) discriminating mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest, and ii) retrieving the age of secondary forests (ASF), with 100 to x 100 m training areas obtained by the analysis of an extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data over the three sites. A machine learning algorithm (random forests) was used in combination with ALOS PALSAR backscatter intensity at HH and HV polarizations and Landsat 5 TM surface reflectance in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions. Overall accuracy when discriminating mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest is high (95-96%), with the highest errors in the secondary forest class (omission and commission errors in the range 4-6% and 12-20% respectively) because of misclassification as mature forest. Root mean square error (RMSE) and bias when retrieving ASF ranged between 4.3-4.7 years (relative RMSE = 25.5-32.0%) and 0.04-0.08 years respectively. On average, unbiased ASF estimates can be obtained using the method proposed here (Wilcoxon test, p-value > 0.05). However, the bias decomposition by 5-year interval ASF classes showed that most age estimates are biased, with consistent overestimation in secondary forests up to 10-15 years of age and underestimation in secondary forests of at least 20 years of age. Comparison with the classification results obtained from the analysis of extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data showed a good agreement, with Pearson's coefficient of correlation (R) of the proportion of mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest at 1-km grid cells ranging between 0.97-0.98, 0.96-0.98 and 0.84-0.90 in the 2007-2010 period, respectively. The agreement was lower (R = 0.82-0.85) when using the same dataset to compare the ability of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat 5 TM data to retrieve ASF. This was also dependent on the study area, especially when considering mapping secondary forest and retrieving ASF, with Manaus displaying better agreement when compared to the results at Santarem and Machadinho d'Oeste.

AB Food webs as representations of who eats whom are at the core of community ecology. Incorporation of tools from network theory enables assessment of how complex systems respond to natural and human-induced stressors, revealing how harvesting may degrade the properties and resilience of food webs. We present a comprehensive, coastal marine food web that includes 147 taxa cooccurring on shallow subtidal reefs along the highly productive and exploited Humboldt Current System of central Chile. This food web has connectance of 0.06, link density of 1204 and mean chain length of 4.3. The fractions of intermediate (76%), omnivorous (49%) and cannibalistic (8%) nodes are slightly lower than those observed in other marine food webs. Of the 147 nodes, 34 are harvested. Links to harvested nodes represented 50 to 100% of all trophic links of non-harvested nodes, illustrating the great impact that fishery pressure can have on the food web. The food web was compartmentalized into 5 sub-webs with high representation of harvested taxa. This structure changes if the fishery node is removed. Similarity analyses identified groups of harvested species with non-harvested nodes, suggesting that these tropho-equivalents could be sentinel species for the community-wide impacts of coastal fisheries. We conclude that fishing effects can be transmitted throughout the food web, with no compartments completely unaffected by harvesting. It is urgent to establish monitoring programs for community-wide effects of fisheries and assess whether resilience of these highly productive subtidal food webs has al ready been compromised, thereby identifying essential nodes that require stronger fisheries regulation.

AB Seasonal meteorological variability within and among years has significant impact on forest productivity, thus understanding its detailed effects on tree growth contributes to the knowledge of the processes controlling forest productivity. This study used high frequency measurements of dendrometer bands (every 2-4 weeks over 1-2 years) to assess tree growth of four different planted forest types (Brazilian native tree species, Eucalyptus grand's, Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis, and Pinus taeda) in response to meteorological variables in distinct regions of Brazil. Multivariate linear regression analysis was applied to relate growth as function of meteorological variables. All species responded to multiple meteorological variables related to air temperature and water availability (maximum air temperature (p < 0.05), vapor pressure deficit (p < 0.01) and actual evapotranspiration (p < 0.01)). Dominant trees were more responsive to meteorological seasonality, compared to suppressed trees. Understanding the relations between forest growth and meteorological variables is useful and has practical applications, including the optimization of species zoning, modeling and the evaluation of climate change impacts on planted tree species for restoration or wood production purposes.

AB Natural regeneration provides multiple benefits to nature and human societies, and can play a major role in global and national restoration targets. However, these benefits are context specific and impacted by both biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across landscapes. Here, we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate change mitigation, sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the global biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest. We classified current land-use cover in the region and simulated a natural regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands, areas where potential conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some early stage regeneration is already occurring. We then modeled changes in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment retention, and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem services. We also modeled how land-use changes affect habitat availability for species. We found that natural regeneration can provide significant ecological and social benefits. Economic values of climate change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20 yr. Habitat availability is improved for three species with different dispersal abilities, although by different magnitudes. Improving the understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring farmers' decision making more in line with societal benefits. This alignment is crucial for natural regeneration to fulfill its potential as a large-scale solution for pressing local and global environmental challenges.

AB Background: As a highly valued and multiple function tree species, Cyclocarya paliurus is planted and managed for timber production and medical use. However, limited information is available on its genotype selection and cultivation for growth and phytochemicals. Responses of growth and secondary metabolites to light regimes and genotypes are useful information to determine suitable habitat conditions for the cultivation of medicinal plants.
   Results: Both light regime and provenance significantly affected the leaf characteristics, leaf flavonoid contents, biomass production and flavonoid accumulation per plant. Leaf thickness, length of palisade cells and chlorophyll a/b decreased significantly under shading conditions, while leaf areas and total chlorophyll content increased obviously. In the full light condition, leaf flavonoid contents showed a bimodal temporal variation pattern with the maximum observed in August and the second peak in October, while shading treatment not only reduced the leaf content of flavonoids but also delayed the peak appearing of the flavonoid contents in the leaves of C. paliurus. Strong correlations were found between leaf thickness, palisade length, monthly light intensity and measured flavonoid contents in the leaves of C. paliurus. Muchuan provenance with full light achieved the highest leaf biomass and flavonoid accumulation per plant.
   Conclusions: Cyclocarya paliurus genotypes show diverse responses to different light regimes in leaf characteristics, biomass production and flavonoid accumulation, highlighting the opportunity for extensive selection in the leaf flavonoid production.

AB Landscape dynamics are common phenomenon in the human-dominated environments whereby it can be observed that the composition and configuration between landscape elements change over time. This dynamism brings about habitat loss and fragmentation that can greatly alter ecosystem services at patch, class, and landscape levels. We conducted a study to examine composition and configuration of forested landscape in the central highlands of Ethiopia using satellite images of over a period of four decades, and FRAGSTAT raster dataset was used to analyze fragmentation. Our result showed five land use/land cover (LULC) types in the study area. Cultivated land and settlement land increased at the expense of forestland, shrubland, and grassland. Fragmentation analysis showed the number of patches increased for all LULC types, indicating the level of fragmentation and interspersion. Juxtaposition increased for shrubland, grassland, and cultivated lands and decreased for settlement and forestland resulting in the fragmentation and isolation of patches. The study of LULC along with fragmentation at the landscape level can help improve our understanding of the pace at which conversion of landscape elements is happening and the impacts on ecosystem services as studies of LULC are courser in nature and would not show how each land use is reducing in size, proximity and shape among other things that determine ecosystem services. Such type of studies in rural landscapes are very vital to consider appropriate land management policies for the landscape level by taking into account the interaction between each element for sustainable development. We recommend land managers, conservationists, and land owners for observing the roles of each patch in the matrix to maximize the benefits than focusing on a single element.

AB Microclimatic forest influence (edge effects into open or regenerating areas) occurs within harvested forest, but the depth and magnitude may change depending on the design of the harvested area. This is an important consideration for managers, because gradients in microclimate can significant affect the ability of species to recolonise following disturbance. One harvesting method that can increase the amount of forest influence is aggregated retention. This technique involves leaving groups of trees (aggregates) within the harvested area, thus increasing the amount of regenerating forest that is near to an edge and therefore under forest influence. However, differences in the scale of forest influence generated from aggregates compared to unlogged forests surrounding harvested areas have not been tested. Understanding the ability of retained aggregates to generate forest influence is important in designing and implementing aggregated retention harvesting practices.
   This study tested whether retained aggregates generated similar levels of forest influence as mature forest surrounding harvested areas. Microclimatic forest influence was examined by monitoring spatial changes in air temperature and relative humidity along transects running from within standing mature forest into harvested forest. Intact forest and aggregate transects were located in the direction of maximum expected forest influence (south-facing edges). Results showed that forest influence was mostly similar in both depth and magnitude regardless of the type of forest from which it was generated. Temporal examination of forest influence showed that it changed throughout the day and across the year, with peaks in magnitude occurring during the middle of the day, and in months close to the equinoxes. Shade derived from standing trees was a potential driver of temporal patterns in microclimatic forest influence.
   At its peak magnitude, the microclimatic forest influence observed will likely have significant impacts on habitat suitability and thus, presumably, species recolonisation after disturbance. Results indicated that aggregated retention is an effective method for generating forest influence within harvested areas. Therefore, aggregated retention has the potential to be a valuable harvesting technique to alter microclimate and have beneficial impacts on the recovery of harvested forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB QuestionsHow do spatial patterns of tree distribution and species co-occurrence differ between primary and secondary tropical rain forests? What signatures of ecological processes might be discerned by comparing the spatial patterns of trees between primary and secondary forest plots?
   LocationTropical rain forest vegetation, lowlands of Papua New Guinea.
   MethodsAll trees over 5cm DBH were surveyed in two non-replicated 1-ha plots situated in primary and secondary forest. Grid location, DBH, height and species identity were recorded for all surveyed trees. Analysis of the spatial pattern and the autocorrelation of tree sizes and identities were used to assess the structure of the forest found within the plots. Functions combining Ripley's K and the individual species-area relationship were applied to study the spatial distribution of trees and species diversity.
   ResultsThe spatial distribution of common species, and all stems collectively, was aggregated in the secondary forest plot but not different from random in the primary forest plot. Diameter and height were also strongly spatially auto-correlated in the secondary forest plot but not in the primary forest plot. Conspecific aggregations were more common in the secondary forest plot. Finally, the secondary forest plot was characterized by the presence of diversity-repelling species and lower diversity than the primary forest plot, where diversity-accumulating species were present.
   ConclusionsWe attribute the weaker autocorrelation of tree size in the primary forest to the development of size hierarchies throughout the course of stand aging. The conspecific aggregation and low local diversity within the secondary forest plot are likely caused by dispersal limitation during a brief period of establishment after disturbance. The higher local diversity of the primary forest can be explained by the reduction of species aggregation through increased mortality of conspecifics. This is caused by strong intraspecific competition, supporting the spatial segregation hypothesis (interspecific spatial segregation).

AB The elucidation of phytogeographic patterns and their drivers in biodiversity hotspots is essential to the study of ecology and the conservation of these areas. In 2000, an important study by Oliveira-Filho and Fontes led to changes in the paradigms that define our understanding of the Atlantic Forest (Brazil). Here, our aim was to revisit this study using a more comprehensive set of environmental predictors, an updated and much larger tree species dataset and checklist, and more refined data analyses. We performed exploratory and confirmatory analyses, including the modeling of the spatial components with Moran's Eigenvector Maps, using data from 483 sites in southeastern Brazil, which encompass a total of 3546 species and 33 geo-climatic variables. We observed strong floristic similarities between rain- and seasonal forests and a species distribution continuum across the main gradients. The environmental and spatial variables were significantly correlated with floristic patterns, and we demonstrated that the tree flora of the seasonal forests should no longer be considered a simple subset of the rain forest flora. The findings of the original paper were not only confirmed but we also unveiled additional, important phytogeographic patterns. We also reinforced the main conclusion of the paper that the Atlantic Forest concept must encompass all of the forest types east of the dry corridor in South America, a designation of utmost importance for the conservation of this biodiversity hotspot.

AB A tree ring oxygen isotope (delta O-18(TR)) chronology developed from one species (Cedrela odorata) growing in a single site has been shown to be a sensitive proxy for rainfall over the Amazon Basin, thus allowing reconstructions of precipitation in a region where meteorological records are short and scarce. Although these results suggest that there should be large-scale (>100 km) spatial coherence of delta O-18(TR) records in the Amazon, this has not been tested. Furthermore, it is of interest to investigate whether other, possibly longer-lived, species similarly record interannual variation of Amazon precipitation, and can be used to develop climate sensitive isotope chronologies. In this study, we measured delta O-18 in tree rings from seven lowland and one highland tree species from Bolivia We found that cross-dating with delta O-18(TR) gave more accurate tree ring dates than using ring width. Our "isotope cross-dating approach" is confirmed with radiocarbon "bomb-peak" dates, and has the potential to greatly facilitate development of delta O-18(TR) records in the tropics, identify dating errors, and check annual ring formation in tropical trees. Six of the seven lowland species correlated significantly with C odorata, showing that variation in delta O-18(TR) has a coherent imprint across very different species, most likely arising from a dominant influence of source water delta O-18 on delta O-18(TR), In addition we show that delta O-18(TR) series cohere over large distances, within and between species. Comparison of two C. odorata delta O-18(TR) chronologies from sites several hundreds of kilometres apart showed a very strong correlation (r = 0.80, p < 0.001, 1901-2001), and a significant (but weaker) relationship was found between lowland C odorata trees and a Polylepis tarapacana tree growing in the distant Altiplano (r = 0.39, p < 0.01, 1931-2001). This large-scale coherence of delta O-18(TR) records is probably triggered by a strong spatial coherence in precipitation delta O-18 due to large-scale controls. These results highlight the strength of delta O-18(TR) as a precipitation proxy, and open the way for temporal and spatial expansion of precipitation reconstructions in South America.

AB Recent studies indicate that morphologically cryptic species may be ecologically more different than would be predicted from their morphological similarity and phylogenetic relatedness. However, in biodiversity research it often remains unclear whether cryptic species should be treated as ecologically equivalent, or whether detected differences have ecological significance. In this study, we assessed the ecological equivalence of four morphologically cryptic species of the amphipod genus Niphargus. All species live in a small, isolated area on the Istrian Peninsula in the NW Balkans. The distributional ranges of the species are partially overlapping and all species are living in springs. We reconstructed their ecological niches using morphological traits related to feeding, bioclimatic niche envelope and species' preference for epi-hypogean habitats. The ecological meaning of differences in niches was evaluated using distributional data and co-occurrence frequencies. We show that the species comprise two pairs of sister species. All species differ from each other and the degree of differentiation is not related to phylogenetic relatedness. Moreover, low co-occurrence frequencies in sympatric zones imply present or past interspecific competition. This pattern suggests that species are not differentiated enough to reduce interspecific competition, nor ecologically equivalent to co-exist via neutral dynamics. We tentatively conclude that the question of ecological equivalence relates to the scale of the study: at a fine scale, species' differences may influence dynamics in a local community, whereas at the regional level these species likely play roughly similar ecological roles.

AB Tropical forest responses to climatic variability have important consequences for global carbon cycling, but are poorly understood. As empirical, correlative studies cannot disentangle the interactive effects of climatic variables on tree growth, we used a tree growth model (IBTREE) to unravel the climate effects on different physiological pathways and in turn on stem growth variation. We parameterized the model for canopy trees of Toona ciliata (Meliaceae) from a Thai monsoon forest and compared predicted and measured variation from a tree-ring study over a 30-year period. We used historical climatic variation of minimum and maximum day temperature, precipitation and carbon dioxide (CO2) in different combinations to estimate the contribution of each climate factor in explaining the inter-annual variation in stem growth. Running the model with only variation in maximum temperature and rainfall yielded stem growth patterns that explained almost 70% of the observed inter-annual variation in stem growth. Our results show that maximum temperature had a strong negative effect on the stem growth by increasing respiration, reducing stomatal conductance and thus mitigating a higher transpiration demand, and - to a lesser extent - by directly reducing photosynthesis. Although stem growth was rather weakly sensitive to rain, stem growth variation responded strongly and positively to rainfall variation owing to the strong inter-annual fluctuations in rainfall. Minimum temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration did not significantly contribute to explaining the inter-annual variation in stem growth. Our innovative approach - combining a simulation model with historical data on tree-ring growth and climate - allowed disentangling the effects of strongly correlated climate variables on growth through different physiological pathways. Similar studies on different species and in different forest types are needed to further improve our understanding of the sensitivity of tropical tree growth to climatic variability and change.

AB Economic instruments such as Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes are increasingly promoted to protect ecosystems (and their associated ecosystem services) that are threatened by processes of local and global change. Biophysical stressors external to a PES site, such as forest fires, pollution, sea level rise, and ocean acidification, may undermine ecosystem stability and sustained ecosystem service provision, yet their threats and impacts are difficult to account for within PES scheme design. We present a typology of external biophysical stressors, characterizing them in terms of stressor origin, spatial domain and temporal scale. We further analyse how external stressors can potentially impinge on key PES parameters, as they (1) threaten ecosystem service provision, additionality and permanence, (2) add challenges to the identification of PES providers and beneficiaries, and (3) add complexity and costs to PES mechanism design. Effective PES implementation under external stressors requires greater emphasis on the evaluation and mitigation of external stressors, and further instruments that can accommodate associated risks and uncertainties. A greater understanding of external stressors will increase our capacity to design multi-scale instruments to conserve important ecosystems in times of environmental change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Directed dispersal is defined as enhanced dispersal of seeds into suitable microhabitats, resulting in higher recruitment than if seeds were dispersed randomly. While this constitutes one of the main explanations for the adaptive value of frugivore-mediated seed dispersal, the generality of this advantage has received little study, particularly when multiple dispersers are involved. We used probability recruitment models of a long-lived rainforest tree in Madagascar to compare recruitment success under dispersal by multiple frugivores, no dispersal, and random dispersal. Models were parameterized using a three-year recruitment experiment and observational data of dispersal events by three frugivorous lemur species that commonly disperse its seeds. Frugivore-mediated seed dispersal was nonrandom with respect to canopy cover and increased modeled per-seed sapling recruitment fourfold compared to no dispersal. Seeds dispersed by one frugivore, Eulemur rubriventer, had higher modeled recruitment probability than seeds dispersed randomly. However, as a group, our models suggest that seeds dispersed by lemurs would have lower recruitment than if dispersal were random. Results demonstrate the importance of evaluating the contribution of multiple frugivores to plant recruitment for understanding plant population dynamics and the ecological and evolutionary significance of seed dispersal.

In a 12-yr study of secondary forests, initially ranging between 2 and 19yrs after abandonment, we compared species compositions through time along two pathways, abandoned clear-cuts dominated by Cecropia and abandoned pastures dominated by Vismia; prior results at these sites have not directly evaluated species composition. At all ages, the Chao-Jaccard similarity index of species composition was highest comparing pasture transects to each other, lowest comparing pastures transects to clear-cut transects, and intermediate comparing clear-cut transects to each other. Through time, clear-cut transects became less similar to each other, as did pasture transects. Changes in similarity reflected declining dominance along both pathways, but Cecropia dominance of clear-cut transects declined more rapidly than Vismia dominance of pasture transects. A rich association of species replaced Cecropia in clear-cut transects, resulting in decreased similarity among them. In pasture transects one genus, Bellucia, replaced the lost Vismia, so similarity of Vismia transects was maintained despite some turnover in dominance. Overall, even with turnover of individuals and decline of the dominant pioneers, the alternative pathways exhibited strikingly different species assemblies after two decades of succession, suggesting that the effect of land use persists well beyond initial floristic composition.

AB Loss of native vegetation cover is thought to be a major driver of declines in pollination success worldwide. However, it is not well known whether reducing the fragmentation of remaining vegetation can ameliorate these negative effects. We tested the independent effects of composition vs. configuration on the reproductive success of a keystone tropical forest herb (Heliconia tortuosa). To do this we designed a large-scale mensurative experiment that independently varied connected forest-patch size (configuration) and surrounding amount of forest (composition). In each patch, we tested whether pollen tubes, fruit, and seed set were associated with these landscape variables. We also captured hummingbirds as an indication of pollinator availability in a subset of patches according to the same design. We found evidence for an effect of configuration on seed set of H. tortuosa, but not on other aspects of plant reproduction; proportion of seeds produced increased 40% across the gradient in patch size we observed (0.64 to >1300 ha), independent of the amount of forest in the surrounding landscape at both local and landscape scales. We also found that the availability of pollinators was dependent upon forest configuration; hummingbird capture rates increased three and one-half times across the patch size gradient, independent of forest amount. Finally, pollinator availability was strongly positively correlated with seed set. We hypothesize that the effects of configuration on plant fitness that we observed are due to reduced pollen quality resulting from altered hummingbird availability and/or movement behavior. Our results suggest that prioritizing larger patches of tropical forest may be particularly important for conservation of this species.

AB Although differences in canopy openness, herbivory and their interaction may promote species coexistence, how these factors affect pioneer tree species and potentially limit growth, and survival has been poorly studied, particularly in tropical South Asia. We monitored the effect of canopy openness and herbivore damage on seedling survival and growth of 960 individuals of six pioneer tree species: Dillenia triquetra, Macaranga indica, Macaranga peltata, Schumacheria castaneifolia, Trema orientalis, and Wendlandia bicuspidata. Seedlings were placed in four gap-understory positionscenter, outer gap edge, inner forest edge, and understoryin four large, natural gaps within the Sinharaja World Heritage Reserve, Sri Lanka. Canopy openness positively affected survival probability beyond the 550-d experiment, while herbivory decreased survival and was highest in understory conditions. The relative order of species survival stayed fairly consistent between gap-understory positions and followed their known shade tolerance rankings. When averaged across all experimental conditions, T. orientalis had the lowest survival probability estimate beyond the 550-d experiment (0.05), but the greatest capacity for growth where it successfully established, while the species with highest averaged survival probability (0.79), D. triquetra, showed the lowest growth. One species, W. bicuspidata, responded positively to herbivory by re-sprouting. Coexistence of D. triquetra, T. orientalis, and W. bicuspidata can be explained by a trade-off among species in survival, growth, and response to herbivory. In addition to variation in canopy light environment, herbivory may be important in determining pioneer species distribution through fine-scale niche partitioning and should be carefully considered in reforestation efforts.

AB 1. We review plant competition in water-limited environments with focus on temporal niche dynamics and examine implications for diversity-productivity relationships and the response of ecosystem productivity to changes in water availability. The main theses under examination are that (i) plant functional types (PFTs) have distinct resource pulse use and coexist through mechanism of temporal resource use complementarity; and (ii) species of same PFT (functionally redundant species) coexist through distinct recruitment niches.
   2. In water-limited systems, opportunities for plant resource uptake and growth fluctuate through time, dependent on precipitation patterns. Species differ in the sensitivities of germination, seedling mortality and adult productivity to pulses of water availability, and this generates opportunity for temporal niche diversification. We illustrate this in two case studies.
   3. Case study I. Savannas: This is an example of niche separation between two distinct plant functional types (PFTs), trees and grasses. Several models suggest that the two PF s have complementary resource pulse use, which regulates their abundances, but other models suggest that tree abundance is regulated by the narrow recruitment niche of trees. Overly restrictive recruitment niches can cause a mismatch between resource availability, PF composition and ecosystem productivity.
   4. Case study II. The tropical dry forest: Here, we examine niche separation between closely related species of same PFT. These species commonly have distinct temporal recruitment niches based on differences in seed and seedling traits. A diversification of recruitment niches may be necessary for sympatric speciation and has the effect of broadening of the recruitment 'portfolio' of a phylogenetic lineage and PFT.
   5. Synthesis: Functional diversity, characterized by differences in adult resource use, optimizes ecosystem function in a pulsed resource environment only if PF abundances are regulated by adult resource use. Regulation through recruitment niches tends to uncouple plant productivity from resource availability. However, we hypothesize that a diversification of recruitment niches within PF s may help alleviate recruitment limitations and help communities attain a PF composition that optimizes resource use and permits adaptation to climate change.

AB Unregulated hunting of large-bodied frugivores is ubiquitous in tropical forests. Due to their low fecundity and complex social organization, large primates are often the first tropical forest vertebrates to be extirpated by hunting. Large primates are important seed dispersers and the only dispersal vectors of many large-seeded plants, leading to concerns that primate-dispersed trees will succumb to large-scale recruitment failure wherever they co-occur with overhunting. We used a field experiment in a remote, nonhunted region of the western Brazilian Amazon to test how the seedling recruitment success of a primate-dispersed Sapotaceae tree (Manilkara bidentata) is affected by distance from parent trees, protection from vertebrate seed predators, and gastro-intestinal seed cleaning associated with passage through frugivorous vertebrates. Only seed cleaning significantly increased the rate of seedling recruitment. Janzen-Connell effects have been widely purported as the central mechanism for recruitment failure, but our results suggest that for many tropical forest plant species Janzen-Connell effects are a second-order effect that acts once seeds have been successfully cleaned of fruit pulp by gut treatment. As an illustration of the relative importance of the sheer quantity of seeds ingested by woolly monkeys (Lagothrix cana), we further estimate the density and dispersal services provided by a complete primate assemblage to show that L cana cleans and disperses nearly one million seeds per km(2) per 24-day Manilkara fruiting season, amounting to over 71% of the seed dispersal services provided by the entire primate assemblage. The disperser vacuum in the absence of L. cane greatly reduces the quantity of cleaned seeds deposited on the forest floor. For similar fleshy-fruited species where gut passage greatly increases survival, a simple lack of redundancy in seed consumption may be the primary driver of recruitment failure resulting from large-primate extirpation due to overhunting, with Janzen-Connell effects secondarily influencing recruitment success as a function of either dispersal distance or seed density.

AB Pioneer tree species of tropical rain forests in the seedling and sapling size classes are generally associated with disturbances to the forest canopy. Pioneers have usually been lumped together within the same broad guild. Many studies have demonstrated differentiation of late successional shade-tolerant species within a forest but only a few studies have shown pioneers to be complex in differentiation. Most assume pioneers to be generalist and similar in growth and establishment. It is therefore not well understood, how sympatric pioneer species differ across life history stages in relation to disturbance characteristics such as canopy openness, type, intensity and historical condition of disturbance. Here we studied seedlings, saplings and larger trees of eight pioneer species common in and around the Sinharaja World Heritage Reserve in Sri Lanka to characterize species differences in relation to canopy openness, type and intensity of disturbance. We analyzed canopy hemispherical photographs and conditions of disturbance and assessed the probability of species' occurrence and the relative importance of disturbance characteristics by fitting progressively more complex multinomial logistical regression models. Canopy openness demonstrated the greatest association with seedling and sapling distribution. Trema orientalis, was found in the highest light conditions, while all other species showed a decrease in the probability of occurrence with increasing canopy openness. For larger trees, the historical condition of disturbance was shown to be a more important factor than the light characteristics. Irrespective of size classes, T. orientalis and Macaranga peltata were restricted to high light environments and large disturbances whereas Macaranga indica, Dillenia triquetra, Schumacheria castaneifolia, and Wendlandia bicuspidata were found in relatively lower light environments and smaller disturbances. Alstonia macrophylla and Melastoma malabathricum were able to exist across wide ranging light conditions. In seedlings and saplings, disturbance type was more influential than both the historical condition of disturbance and the intensity of the disturbance, with some evidence that species do occur differentially in certain disturbance types. In summary this study provides evidence that pioneers of all life history stages differentiate in relation to amount of light and disturbance characteristics and that such differentiations are important mechanisms for the coexistence and diversity of early seral tropical tree species. Findings from our study suggests that pioneers used for reforestation and site amelioration need to be selected carefully to match degree of exposure, history and type of disturbance of the site that is to be reforested.
