AB The Guiana Shield (GS) is one of the most pristine regions of Amazonia and biologically one of the richest areas on Earth. How and when this massive diversity arose remains the subject of considerable debate. The prevailing hypothesis of Quaternary glacial refugia suggests that a part of the eastern GS, among other areas in Amazonia, served as stable forested refugia during periods of aridity. However, the recently proposed disturbance-vicariance hypothesis proposes that fluctuations in temperature on orbital timescales, with some associated aridity, have driven Neotropical diversification. The expectations of the temporal and spatial organization of biodiversity differ between these two hypotheses. Here, we compare the genetic structure of 12 leaf-litter inhabiting frog species from the GS lowlands using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear sequences in an integrative analytical approach that includes phylogenetic reconstructions, molecular dating, and Geographic Information System methods. This comparative and integrated approach overcomes the well-known limitations of phylogeographic inference based on single species and single loci. All of the focal species exhibit distinct phylogeographic patterns highlighting taxon-specific historical distributions, ecological tolerances to climatic disturbance, and dispersal abilities. Nevertheless, all but one species exhibit a history of fragmentation/isolation within the eastern GS during the Quaternary with spatial and temporal concordance among species. The signature of isolation in northern French Guiana (FG) during the early Pleistocene is particularly clear. Approximate Bayesian Computation supports the synchrony of the divergence between northern FG and other GS lineages. Substructure observed throughout the GS suggests further Quaternary fragmentation and a role for rivers. Our findings support fragmentation of moist tropical forest in the eastern GS during this period when the refuge hypothesis would have the region serving as a contiguous wet-forest refuge.

AB In fragmented landscapes, agroforest woodlots can potentially act as stepping stones facilitating movement between forest fragments. We assessed the influence of agroforest woodlots on bird distribution and diversity in the Atlantic forest region (SE Brazil), and also tested which categories of species can use different types of connection elements, and whether this use is influenced by the distance to large forest patches. We studied two fragmented landscapes, with and without stepping stones linking large fragments, and one forested landscape. Using a point count, a bird survey was undertaken in the fragmented landscapes in five different elements: large remnants (> 400 ha), agroforest woodlots (0.4-1.1 ha), small patches (0.5-7 ha), riparian corridor, and pasture areas (the main matrix). Generalist and open-area species were commonly observed in the agroforest system or other connection elements, whereas only a few forest species were present in these connections. For the latter species, the distance of woodlots to large patches was essential to determine their richness and abundance. Based on our results and data from literature, we suggest that there is an optimal relationship between the permeability of the matrix and the efficiency of stepping stones, which occurs at intermediate degrees of matrix resistance, and is species-dependent. Because the presence of agroforest system favors a higher richness of generalist species, they appeared to be more advantageous for conservation than the monoculture system; for this reason, they should be considered as a management alternative, particularly when the matrix permeability requirement is met.

AB Seed dispersal is a critical but poorly understood life-history stage of plants. Here we use a genetic approach to describe seed dispersal patterns accurately in a natural population of the Neotropical tree species Jacaranda copaia ( Bignoniaceae). We used microsatellite genotypes from maternally derived tissue on the diaspore to identify which individual of all possible adult trees in the population was the true source of a given seed collected after it dispersed. Wind-dispersed seeds were captured in two different years in a large array of seed traps in an 84-ha mapped area of tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We were particularly interested in the proportion of seeds that traveled long distances and whether there was evidence for direct dispersal into gaps, which are required for successful recruitment of this pioneer tree species. Maximum likelihood procedures were used to fit single- and multiple-component dispersal kernels to the distance data. Mixture models, with separate distributions near and far, best fit the observed dispersal distances, albeit with considerable uncertainty in the tail. We discuss the results in light of different mechanisms responsible for separate distributions near the adult source and in the tail of the curve.

AB Floral key innovations play a significant role in the discussion of adaptive radiation in plants. The paper brings together a brief review of morphological key innovations in plants, elucidating their evolutionary significance in flower-pollinator interactions, and new data on Salvia, a genus being examined as an example for presumed adaptive radiation. We hypothesize that the characteristic staminal lever mechanism functions as a key innovation. It is defined as a functional unit including the modification of stamens to lever-like structures, their reversible movement, and the organization of the remaining floral structures involved in the process of pollen transfer. We follow the assumption that structure and functioning of the staminal levers play a major role in the process of pollen deposition on the pollinator's body, and that minute changes of both their proportions and their interactions with pollinators may have significant consequences for the pollination system. The functioning of the staminal lever mechanism is tested by field investigations, biomechanical experiments and pollination simulations. First results are presented, and possible modes of allopatric and sympatric speciation are discussed, based on morphometry of Salvia flowers and pollinators as well as on the operating mode of the staminal lever mechanism. Special attention is given to species-specific patterns of pollen deposition on the pollinator's body. We assume that, depending on the precision of the lever movement, sympatric Salvia species flowering during overlapping periods and sharing the same pollinating species may be either mechanically isolated from each other or able to hybridize. The latter may result in speciation, as may spontaneous mutations influencing the flower-pollinator interaction, e.g. by significant changes in morphometry of the staminal lever system and/or other flower structures. As a consequence, Salvia individuals may deposit pollen on a different part of the pollinator's body, or even adapt to a new pollinator species, both resulting in reproductive isolation from the parental population.

AB Aim As a result of the extinctions of several large frugivorous birds (and one flying fox) and the diminished ranges of others, Tonga now has a relatively small number of effective seed dispersers, especially for large-seeded plants. We estimate the bill width and gape of the two largest known extinct pigeon species (Ducula) present in Tonga prior to human arrival. We then estimate which native rain forest species had fruits that would have probably been included in the diets of these extinct birds but which may not be dispersed regularly by the smaller frugivores present today.
   Methods Bill width for the two largest extinct pigeons was derived by extrapolating from the size of fossil bones and measurements of skeletons of extant Ducula species. Ducula and Ptilinopus species have distensible jaws, and therefore their gape allows them to swallow objects broader than their bill width. We estimated the gape width and maximum ingestible fruit size that both the extinct and extant species could consume, by extrapolating from feeding observations of extant Ducula and Ptilinopus species (using known bill widths and fruit sizes). We determined whether those plant species whose fruit diameters exceed the mean gape width of the largest remaining avian frugivore in Tonga (Ducula pacifica Gmelin) appeared adapted for dispersal by birds or flying foxes.
   Results Approximately 79% of the native rain forest trees and lianas in Tonga produce fruits whose morphology suggests that they are adapted to vertebrate dispersal. Bill width estimates derived from the bones of the extinct Ducula sp. nova suggest that this pigeon could swallow fruit up to 48 mm in diameter, whilst the smaller Ducula cf. david Balouet & Olson is estimated to have been able to swallow fruit up to 36 mm in diameter. Plant species whose fruits are too large to be swallowed by Tonga's largest extant frugivorous bird (D. pacifica) yet display fruit characteristics suggesting birds were likely to have been their predominant vertebrate disperser in pre-human times include: Calophyllum inophyllum L., Cerbera odollam Gaertn, Planchonella garberi Christophersen, P. membranacea Lam., Pometia pinnata J. R. & G. Forst., Syzygium quandrangulatum (A. Gray) Merr. & Perry, Syzygium richii (A. Gray) Merr. & Perry and Terminalia catappa L.
   Main conclusions There is now no avian disperser in Tonga for plant species whose fruits measure >28 mm in diameter (the maximum gape of D. pacifica ). Although frugivorous flying foxes (Pteropus tonganus Quoy & Gaimard) may eat the fruit and disperse the seeds of the eight plant species identified with large fruits, the frequency of dispersal by birds was probably much higher in the past. Species that once relied on the large extinct pigeons for dispersal may have become reduced in abundance in their absence.

AB The PREDICTS project-Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems (www.predicts.org.uk)-has collated from published studies a large, reasonably representative database of comparable samples of biodiversity from multiple sites that differ in the nature or intensity of human impacts relating to land use. We have used this evidence base to develop global and regional statistical models of how local biodiversity responds to these measures. We describe and make freely available this 2016 release of the database, containing more than 3.2 million records sampled at over 26,000 locations and representing over 47,000 species. We outline how the database can help in answering a range of questions in ecology and conservation biology. To our knowledge, this is the largest and most geographically and taxonomically representative database of spatial comparisons of biodiversity that has been collated to date; it will be useful to researchers and international efforts wishing to model and understand the global status of biodiversity.

AB Different species are usually thought to have specific adaptations, which allow them to occupy different ecological niches. But recent neutral ecology theory suggests that species diversity can simply be the result of random sampling, due to finite population sizes and limited dispersal. Neutral models predict that species are not necessarily adapted to specific niches, but are functionally equivalent across a range of habitats. Here, we evaluate the ecology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of the most important microbial species in human history. The artificial collection, concentration and fermentation of large volumes of fruit for alcohol production produce an environment in which S. cerevisiae thrives, and therefore it is assumed that fruit is the ecological niche that S. cerevisiae inhabits and has adapted to. We find very little direct evidence that S. cerevisiae is adapted to fruit, or indeed to any other specific niche. We propose instead a neutral nomad model for S. cerevisiae, which we believe should be used as the starting hypothesis in attempting to unravel the ecology of this important microbe.

AB Poorly planned, large-scale ecological restoration projects may displace agricultural activities and potentially lead to the clearance of native vegetation elsewhere, with associated impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Yet few studies have considered these risks and the ways in which restoration can increase competition for land. Here, we address this issue by examining whether large-scale restoration of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest could displace cattle production, as a result of land shortages. Although the risks of displacement are indeed high when reforestation is planned in areas with high cattle productivity, we discuss how these risks can be minimized through a combination of productivity increases, a regional restoration planning framework, and the prioritization of marginal agricultural land for restoration. We also consider how restoration can, in some circumstances, be made more economically sustainable by incorporating income-generating activities such as exploitation of timber and non-timber forest products, certification, and payments for ecosystem services.

AB Nature conservation relies largely on peoples' rule adherence. However, noncompliance in the conservation context is common: it is one of the largest illegal activities in the world, degrading societies, economies and the environment Understanding and managing compliance is key for ensuring effective conservation, nevertheless crucial concepts and tools are scattered in a wide array of literature. Here I review and integrate these concepts and tools in an effort to guide compliance management in the conservation context. First, I address the understanding of compliance by breaking it down into five key questions: who?, what?, when?, where? and why?. A special focus is given to 'why?' because the answer to this question explains the reasons for compliance and noncompliance, providing critical information for management interventions. Second, I review compliance management strategies, from voluntary compliance to coerced compliance. Finally, I suggest a system, initially proposed for tax compliance, to balance these multiple compliance management strategies. This paper differs from others by providing a broad yet practical scope on theory and tools for understanding and managing compliance in the nature conservation context (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Complex networks of species interactions might be determined by species traits but also by simple chance meetings governed by species abundances. Although the idea that species traits structure mutualistic networks is appealing, most studies have found abundance to be a major structuring mechanism underlying interaction frequencies. With a well-resolved plant-hummingbird interaction network from the Neotropical savanna in Brazil, we asked whether species morphology, phenology, nectar availability and habitat occupancy and/or abundance best predicted the frequency of interactions. For this, we constructed interaction probability matrices and compared them to the observed plant-hummingbird matrix through a likelihood approach. Furthermore, a recently proposed modularity algorithm for weighted bipartite networks was employed to evaluate whether these factors also scale-up to the formation of modules in the network. Interaction frequencies were best predicted by species morphology, phenology and habitat occupancy, while species abundances and nectar availability performed poorly. The plant-hummingbird network was modular, and modules were associated to morphological specialization and habitat occupancy. Our findings highlight the importance of traits as determinants of interaction frequencies and network structure, corroborating the results of a previous study on a plant-hummingbird network from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Thus, we propose that traits matter more in tropical plant-hummingbird networks than in less specialized systems. To test the generality of this hypothesis, future research could employ geographic or taxonomic cross-system comparisons contrasting networks with known differences in level of specialization.
   Resumo Redes complexas de interacoes entre especies podem ser determinadas pelos atributos das especies, mas tambem meramente pelos encontros aleatorios governados pelas suas abundancias. Embora a ideia de que os atributos das especies estruturam as redes mutualisticas seja atraente, a maioria dos estudos tem observado a abundancia como principal fator determinante da frequencia das interacoes. Nesse estudo, investigamos uma rede de interacAo entre plantas e beija-flores no Cerrado do Brasil, para compreender se morfologia, fenologia, disponibilidade de nectar, ocupacAo de habitat e/ou abundancia das especies sAo capazes de predizer a frequencia das interacoes na comunidade. Para isso, nos construimos matrizes de probabilidades de interacoes e as comparamos com a matriz de interacAo observada, utilizando analise de verossimilhanca e selecAo de modelos. Alem disso, um algoritmo recentemente proposto para calcular a modularidade em redes bipartidas quantitativas foi utilizado para avaliar se (e como) esses fatores contribuem para a formacAode modulosna rede. A frequencia de interacoes na rede foi melhor predita pela morfologia, fenologia e ocupacAo de habitat, enquanto a abundancia e disponibilidade de nectar tiveram pior desempenho. As interacoes entre plantas e beija-flores se organizaram em modulos, que foram associados com especializacAo morfologica e ocupacAo de habitat. Nossos resultados mostram a importancia dos atributos das especies na determinacAo da frequencia de interacoes e estrutura da rede, corroborando os resultados de um estudo previo com uma rede de plantas e beija-flor na Mata Atlantica. Assim, nos propomos que os atributos das especies tem papel estruturador mais importante em redes de interacoes entre plantas e beija-flores tropicais do que em sistemas menos especializados. Para testar a generalidade desta hipotese, sugerimos que estudos futuros empreguem comparacoesgeograficas ou taxonomicasentre diferentes sistemas, contrastando redes de interacoes com diferentes niveis de especializacAo.

AB AimBiodiversity information is the focus of major initiatives aimed at assembling large-scale primary-data documentation (digital accessible knowledge') of the distribution of life on Earth. Recent efforts within Brazil have assembled a massive amount of such documentation for Brazilian plants, which we analyse in this study. Our aim is to identify areas representing gaps in current knowledge; these gaps can guide future botanical exploration and discovery in Brazil.
   LocationBrazil.
   MethodsWe assessed angiosperm inventories across Brazil at diverse spatial scales using statistics that summarize inventory completeness. In particular, we assess the completeness of geographical knowledge of Brazilian floras as measured in terms of geographical distance and climatic difference from well-documented sites.
   ResultsSpatial knowledge of Brazilian angiosperms is very unevenly distributed: well-known sites are concentrated in eastern and southern regions, whereas the remainder of the country remains poorly documented. Worse still, in many regions, areas lacking detailed botanical documentation coincide with areas of intense habitat destruction, such that many such sites will never be documented scientifically.
   Main conclusionsThis study illustrates how biodiversity survey and inventory efforts can be guided by existing knowledge. That is, to the extent that existing biodiversity knowledge is made digital and openly available, and to the extent that information is sufficiently comprehensive and informative, spatial summaries of completeness such as that presented here offer clear and strategic directions for maximizing the yield of new knowledge from any de novo field efforts.

AB Tropical forests contain large reserves of carbon that are vulnerable to perturbation linked to human activities, including deforestation and climate change. Accurate estimates of forest carbon are therefore required urgently to support efforts to conserve tropical forests. We quantified carbon stocks in primary and 60-year-old secondary forest plots located on infertile Ultisols in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, one of the few remaining areas of forest in Singapore. We used tree census data for 24.2 ha of primary forest and 23 ha of secondary forest, together with allometric equations, to estimate aboveground and coarse root biomass. Coarse woody debris stocks were censused along 2.44 km and 2.12 km of transects in primary and secondary forest, respectively. Soil carbon and fine root carbon stocks were assessed from soil samples taken to 3 m depth in a 2-ha secondary forest plot and a 2-ha primary forest plot, combined with bulk density measured in a nearby soil profile pit. Total estimated carbon stock in the primary forest, which was located on the hilltop and upper slopes (80-115 m elevation), was 337 Mg C ha(-1), of which 50% was aboveground biomass, 33% in soil, 12% in coarse roots, 4.6% in coarse woody debris, and 0.8% in fine roots. In the secondary forest, located on lower slopes and valley (50-85 m elevation), the total carbon stock was 274 Mg C ha(-1) and the relative importance of aboveground biomass and soil were reversed, with 38% in aboveground biomass, 52% in soil, 6.9% in coarse roots, 1.5% in coarse woody debris, and 1.3% in fine roots. Including carbon in deep subsoil (i.e. to 3 m) increased soil carbon stocks by similar to 40% compared to 1 m depth. Overall, the 60-year-old secondary forest contained 60% as much biomass as the primary forest, while the primary forest had lower carbon stocks than other primary forests in the region.

AB 1. Species diversity of arboreal arthropods tends to increase during rainforest succession so that primary forest communities comprise more species than those from secondary vegetation, but it is not well understood why. Primary forests differ from secondary forests in a wide array of factors whose relative impacts on arthropod diversity have not yet been quantified. 2. We assessed the effects of succession-related determinants on a keystone ecological group, arboreal ants, by conducting a complete census of 1332 ant nests from all trees with diameter at breast height = 5 cm occurring within two (unreplicated) 0.32-ha plots, one in primary and one in secondary lowland forest in New Guinea. Specifically, we used a novel rarefaction-based approach to match number, size distribution and taxonomic structure of trees in primary forest communities to those in secondary forest and compared the resulting numbers of ant species. 3. In total, we recorded 80 nesting ant species from 389 trees in primary forest but only 42 species from 295 trees in secondary forest. The two habitats did not differ in the mean number of ant species per tree or in the relationship between ant diversity and tree size. However, the between-tree similarity of ant communities was higher in secondary forest than in primary forest, as was the between-tree nest site similarity, suggesting that secondary trees were more uniform in providing nesting microhabitats. 4. Using our rarefaction method, the difference in ant species richness between two forest types was partitioned according to the effects of higher tree density (22.6%), larger tree size (15.5%) and higher taxonomic diversity of trees (14.3%) in primary than in secondary forest. The remaining difference (47.6%) was because of higher beta diversity of ant communities between primary forest trees. In contrast, difference in nest density was explained solely by difference in tree density. 5. Our study shows that reduction in plant taxonomic diversity in secondary forests is not the main driver of the reduction in canopy ant species richness. We suggest that the majority of arboreal species losses in secondary tropical forests are attributable to simpler vegetation structure, combined with lower turnover of nesting microhabitats between trees.

AB Seed dispersal by frugivores is thought to play an important role in the maintenance of tropical forest diversity. Spider monkeys (Ateles spp.) are amongst the most frugivorous primates known, and they incorporate a diverse array of fruit species in their diets. In a 1-y study in lowland Ecuador, 670 h of focal observations and data on 916 faecal depositions were collected, and these data are used to describe the seed dispersal patterns of one group of wild spider monkeys (Ateles belzebuth) in terms of both the quantity of seeds dispersed and the primary seed shadows generated. Spider monkeys fed on the fruits of at least 152 plant species and swallowed seeds from more than 98% of these. Collected faecal samples contained seeds from at least 133 different plant species, with an average of 1.9 species (range: 0-7) per defecation. Individual spider monkeys dispersed a minimum of similar to 195 000 seeds > 1 mm in diameter per year, similar to 35 000 of which were > 3 mm in diameter. Mean retention time for seeds was 4.5 h. Seed dispersal distances averaged 443 m, but some seeds were moved > 1250 m away from parental sources. These results suggest that declines in populations of spider monkeys might have a direct effect on forest dynamics, especially if other disperser species cannot compensate for their lost ecological services.

AB Light partitioning is thought to contribute to the coexistence of rain forest tree species. This study evaluates the three premises underlying the light partitioning hypothesis; 1) there is a gradient in light availability at the forest floor, 2) tree species show a differential distribution with respect to light, and 3) there is a trade-off in species performance that explains their different positions along the light gradient. To address these premises, we studied the light environment, growth, and survival of saplings of ten non-pioneer tree species in a Bolivian moist forest. Light availability in the understorey was relatively high, with a mean canopy openness of 3.5% and a mean direct site factor of 6.8%. Saplings of two light demanding species occurred at significantly higher light levels than the shade tolerant species. The proportion of saplings in low-light conditions was negatively correlated with the successional position of the species. Light-demanding species were characterised by a low share of their saplings in low-light conditions, a high sapling mortality, a fast height growth and a strong growth response to light. These data show that all three premises for light partitioning are met. There is a clear gradient in shade-tolerance within the group of non-pioneer species leading to a tight packing of species along the small range of light environments found in the understorey.

AB This study examines the distribution of algae and invertebrates on rocky shores in the northwest Mediterranean. The main objectives were to: (1) examine the consistency of vertical patterns of distribution in space and time; and (2) determine the relative importance of vertical position on the shore with respect to other sources of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. These patterns were investigated by repeatedly sampling two shores (about 70 km apart) in four different areas (10's to 100's of m apart) at each of three different heights. These areas were sampled eight times between April 1995 and August 1996. At each time, the percentage cover of sessile organisms and the density of molluscan grazers were estimated in three replicate plots (50 x 10 cm) in each area. The patterns of distribution and abundance of mobile animals were also examined in relation to season and topography of the substratum. At each level on each shore, sampling was done inside crevices in two areas randomly chosen among the four available, and outside crevices in the remaining two areas. This sampling was repeated in summer and in winter, at two randomly chosen dates in each season. There were large spatial and temporal fluctuations in patterns of abundance and distribution. There were inconsistencies in temporal changes from one shore to the other and among areas within levels for several of the organisms considered. Differences from one level on the shore to another were usually large but, in most cases, were not consistent from shore to shore or from time to time. The magnitude of these spatial and temporal effects was at least as large as that due to vertical position on the shore. Season and topography of the substratum were related to differences in the distribution and abundance of molluscan grazers but, again, these effects were variable in space and time. The results were, however, consistent with the hypothesis that limpets may benefit from the presence of crevices in proximity to their upper limit of distribution. Overall, results indicate that the structure of these assemblages cannot be predicted reliably on the basis of vertical position on the shore alone. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB It has been proposed that a 'bank of microscopic forms' functions as a survival mechanism for benthic macroalgae, in some ways analogous to the 'seed bank' of terrestrial plants. Four aspects related to this hypothesis are examined here, namely (1) origin and morphology of the structures forming banks; (2) their specific compositions; (3) environmental conditions that allow their survival in a state of suspended growth, and conditions that trigger reinitiation of growth; and (4) losses from the banks by diverse causes. Although the structures at which growth suspension occurs are of very different morphologies, and probably are also different in their capacities of temporal displacement, both types of banks are regulated by similar environmental factors and subjected to similar types of constraints. Some important differences between the 2 banks are likely to stem from the lesser longevity of the algal microscopic stages, which would limit the duration of banks of microscopic forms.

AB Amazonia is the most biodiverse rainforest on Earth, and the debate over how many tree species grow there remains contentious. Here we provide a checklist of all tree species collected to date, and describe spatial and temporal trends in data accumulation. We report 530,025 unique collections of trees in Amazonia, dating between 1707 and 2015, for a total of 11,676 species in 1225 genera and 140 families. These figures support recent estimates of 16,000 total Amazonian tree species based on ecological plot data from the Amazonian Tree Diversity Network. Botanical collection in Amazonia is characterized by three major peaks, centred around 1840, 1920, and 1980, which are associated with flora projects and the establishment of inventory plots. Most collections were made in the 20th century. The number of collections has increased exponentially, but shows a slowdown in the last two decades. We find that a species' range size is a better predictor of the number of times it has been collected than the species' estimated basin-wide population size. Finding, describing, and documenting the distribution of the remaining species will require coordinated efforts at under-collected sites.

AB The Brazilian Cerrado is recognized as one of the most threatened biomes in the world, as the region has experienced a striking change from natural Cerrado vegetation to intense cash crop production. This paper reviews the history of land conversion in the Cerrado and the development of soil properties and water resources under past and ongoing land use. We compared soil and water quality parameters from different land uses considering 80 soil and 18 water studies conducted in different regions across the Cerrado to provide quantitative evidence of soil and water alterations from land use change.
   Following the conversion of native Cerrado, significant effects on soil pH, bulk density and available P and K for croplands and less-pronounced effects on pastures were evident. Soil total N did not differ between land uses because most of the sites classified as croplands were nitrogen-fixing soybeans, which are not artificially fertilized with N. In contrast, water quality studies showed nitrogen enrichment in agricultural catchments, indicating fertilizer impacts and potential susceptibility to eutrophication. Regardless of the land use, P is widely absent because of the high-fixing capacities of deeply weathered soils and the filtering capacity of riparian vegetation. Pesticides, however, were consistently detected throughout the entire aquatic system. In several case studies, extremely high-peak concentrations exceeded Brazilian and European Union (EU) water quality limits, which were potentially accompanied by serious health implications. Land use intensification is likely to continue, particularly in regions where less annual rainfall and severe droughts are projected in the northeastern and western Cerrado. Thus, the leaching risk and displacement of agrochemicals are expected to increase, particularly because the current legislation has caused a reduction in riparian vegetation. We conclude that land use intensification is likely to seriously limit the Cerrado's future regarding both agricultural productivity and ecosystem stability. Because only limited data are available, we recommend further field studies to understand the interaction between terrestrial and aquatic systems. This study may serve as a valuable database for integrated modelling to investigate the impact of land use and climate change on soil and water resources and to test and develop mitigation measures for the Cerrado.

AB Aim The jaguar, Panthera onca, is a species of global conservation concern. In Mexico, the northernmost part of its distribution range, its conservation status, is particularly critical, while its potential and actual distribution is poorly known. We propose an ensemble model (EM) of the potential distribution for the jaguar in Mexico and identify the priority areas for conservation.
   Location Mexico.
   Methods We generated our EM based on three presence-only methods (Ecological Niche Factor Analysis, Mahalanobis distance, Maxent) and considering environmental, biological and anthropogenic factors. We used this model to evaluate the efficacy of the existing Mexican protected areas (PAs), to evaluate the adequacy of the jaguar conservation units (JCUs) and to propose new areas that should be considered for conservation and management of the species in Mexico.
   Results Our results outline that 16% of Mexico (c. 312,000 km2) can be considered as suitable for the presence of the jaguar. Furthermore, 13% of the suitable areas are included in existing PAs and 14% are included in JCUs (Sanderson et al., 2002).
   Main conclusions Clearly much more should be carried out to establish a proactive conservation strategy. Based on our results, we propose here new jaguar conservation and management areas that are important for a nationwide conservation blueprint.

AB PES is an increasingly mainstream tool for influencing land-use decisions on private land and Costa Rica's experience provides critical insight. We review findings of PES impacts on forest cover, a proxy for forest-based ecosystem services. National studies conclude that PES has not lowered deforestation rates. Yet in northern Costa Rica, there is evidence of additionality for PH-related avoided deforestation. Moreover, sub-national studies of bi-directional forest cover change, along with farm-level interview data and an understanding of ground-based operations, demonstrate that avoided deforestation is an incomplete measure of PES impact. Sub-national case studies suggest PES is associated with agricultural abandonment and net gains in forest cover via forest regeneration and plantation establishment. Explanations include that forest regeneration has always been an accepted PES modality for some regions. Also, early PES cohorts have an implicit spatial correlation with pre-PES incentives focusing exclusively on reforestation. Without understanding de facto PES implementation, it is impossible to appropriately evaluate PES impacts or discern whether PES outcomes positive or negative are due to PES design or its implementation. This distinction is critical in refining our understanding of both the utility and limitations of PES and has some practical implications for PES-style REDD initiatives. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB It is hard to defend the view that biotic communities represent a simple and predictable response to the abiotic environment. Biota and the abiotic environment interact, and the environment of an individual certainly includes its neighbors and visitors in the community. The complexity of community assembly calls forth a quest for general principles, yet current results and theories on assembly rules differ widely.
   Using a grassland microcosm as a model system, we manipulated fertility, disturbance by defoliation, soil/microclimate, and arrival order of species belonging to two groups differing in functional attributes. We analyzed the Outcome of community assembly dynamics in terms of species richness, invasibility, and species composition. The analyses revealed strong environmental control over species richness and invasibility. Species composition was mainly determined by the arrival order of species, indicating that historical contingency may change the outcome of community assembly. The probability for multiple equilibria appeared to increase with productivity and environmental stability. The importance of arrival order offers an explanation of the difficulties in predicting local occurrences of species in the field.
   In our experiment, variation in fertility and disturbance was controlling colonization with predictable effects on emergent community properties such as species richness. The key mechanism is suggested to be asymmetric competition, and our results show that this mechanism is relatively insensitive to the species through which it works. While our analyses indicate a positive and significant correlation between richness and invasibility, the significance disappears after accounting for the effect of the environment.
   The importance of arrival order (historical contingency) and environmental control supports the assumption of the unified neutral theory that different species within a trophic level can be considered functionally equivalent when it comes to community assembly. However, our results indicate that variation in asymmetric competition is the key factor determining the richness of the resulting communities, and this is far from neutral.

AB Measuring how anthropogenic disturbance affects biological systems is crucial for conservation and management. However, it is often difficult to quantify disturbance when it occurs in a slow, long-lasting - or chronic - fashion. Because various human activities influence gradually an area, chronic disturbance must be measured on a continuous scale that accounts for different sources of disturbance. Here we propose a method to develop multimetric indices for chronic disturbance. The approach is exemplified by considering the effects of disturbance on the threatened cactus Mammillaria pectinifera. Fourteen indicators of three agents of disturbance (human activities, livestock raising and land degradation) were measured in 10 populations of M. pectinifiera, and summarised through principal components analysis (PCA). An index for each agent was also developed. M. pectinifera achieved maximum density at intermediate values of the first PCA axis, which was related to disturbance intensity. Assessing only both extremes of the disturbance gradient, where density is low, would erroneously suggest that disturbance has no effect on this plant. The different disturbance agents act synergistically on M. pectinifera, and their combined effects are detrimental. Land degradation reduces plant density, while livestock enhances it. However, overgrazing promotes degradation, so maintaining appropriate livestock levels is critical for management. Our method allowed us to identify which agents have more impact on threatened species, and sets the basis to manage disturbance agents in a way compatible with conservation. The method proposed here can be easily modified for its use in other environments and to account for different forms of anthropogenic disturbance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Three fragmented rain forests and one primary forest in southern Yunnan were plotted. The microclimate and soil conditions of these forests were also studied. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) The microclimatic differences between inside and outside forest are less in the fragmented forests than in the primary forest, which indicates that the buffer effects to climatic change have been reduced in the fragmented forests. The soil has deteriorated to some extent due to forest fragmentation. ( 2) In species composition, especially the abundance of some species and the dominant ranks of some families have changed with fragmentation. Barringtonia macrostachya, the most dominant species in the control primary forest, disappeared from the fragmented forests, while Antiaris toxicaria, which is a characteristic but not dominant species in the primary forest, is dominant in fragmented forests. ( 3) The total number of species per plot was reduced in the fragmented forests and the more seriously disturbed the fragment was, the more the species richness diminished. ( 4) In life form spectra, the liana and microphanerophyte species increased, but epiphyte, megaphanerophyte, mesophanerophyte and chamaephyte species decreased in the fragmented forests. ( 5) The plant species diversity is generally lower in the fragmented forests than in the primary forest, although for some life forms it could be higher. ( 6) The tree species with small populations could be lost first in the process of rain forest fragmentation. ( 7) The heliophilous or pioneer tree species increased and the shade-tolerant species were reduced in the fragmented forests.

AB Habitat fragmentation and the widespread creation of habitat edges have recently stimulated interest in assessing the effects of ecotones on biodiversity. Ecotones, natural or anthropogenic, can greatly affect faunal movement, population dynamics, species interactions, and community structure. Few data exist, however, on insect community response to forest-savanna ecotones, a natural analog to anthropogenically cleared areas adjacent to forest. In this study, the abundance, total biomass, average individual biomass, and distribution of scarabaeine dung beetles were examined at a sharp tropical evergreen forest-savanna ecotone in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. The abundance, total biomass, and average individual biomass of dung beetles varied significantly across the forest, edge, and savanna habitats. Species richness (S(obs)) also varied significantly across the three habitats, but statistical estimations of true species richness (S(est)) did not. Habitat specificity of the dung beetles in this study was extremely high. Of the 50 most common species collected during the study, only 2 species were collected in both the forest and savanna habitats, signaling nearly complete community turnover in just a few meters. Strong edge effects were evidenced by the decline in abundance, total biomass, and species richness at the forest-savanna boundary.

AB Naturally regenerated seedlings of longleaf pine are typically observed to cluster in the center of tree fall canopy gaps and be encircled by a wide zone from which they are generally excluded. Twelve representative canopy gaps distributed across 600 ha of a naturally regenerated uneven-aged longleaf pine forest in the sandhills of north central Florida were examined to determine which aboveground and belowground factors are responsible for development of this seedling exclusionary zone. Within 12 m of adult trees growing along the gap edge, significantly fewer longleaf pine seedlings were present, The canopy of overstory trees, however, extended only 4-5 m into the gap. The relatively open structure of the longleaf pine canopy (57% cover) allowed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to be evenly distributed upon the forest floor across each canopy gap. Thus, light avail-ability was not related to pine seedling clustering near gap centers, Significantly greater forest litter mass beneath adult trees (5 Mg ha(-1)) could result in fires more intense than would be supported by the litter mass near gap centers (2.5 Mg ha(-1)). However, litter mass was significantly elevated only within 4 m of the gap edge. The fine root biomass within 12 m of the gap edge (3-4.5 Mg ha(-1)) was two to six times that measured near the gap center and most closely coincided with the width of the seedling exclusionary zone along the margin of each gap. Thus, while the canopy of adjacent adult trees may indirectly influence seedling mortality through deposition of needle litter and greater fire intensity within 4 m of the gap edge, the root systems of these adults also appear to directly compete with seedlings within 12-16 m of the gap edge for limited site resources, To effectively regenerate and sustain longleaf pine wiregrass ecosystems, caution should be used in prescribing single-tree selection harvest methods so as not to create gap openings so small (< 30 m diameter) that intraspecific competition from adult toes totally excludes seedlings. Group selection methods may prove more effective in creating canopy gaps of sizes suitable (greater than or equal to 40 m diameter) for ensuring that intraspecific competition from adults is maintained at a level which allows for survival and growth of seedlings. Shelterwood and deferment methods may also prove useful where more open canopy conditions are desired. However, the pine seedlings' need for light cannot be used as an appropriate rationale for application of clearcutting methods. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB As assessed by the IUCN Mace-Lande system, seven (35%) of the 20 Alouatta species and subspecies with adequate data are classified as "threatened," i.e., critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable (Rylands et al, 1995). This percentage is much lower than the 75 to 100% threatened taxa for, the other large-bodied genera: Ateles, Lagothrix, and Brachyteles. Only 5 of the 16 Neotropical genera have lower percentages of threatened taxa than that of Alouatta: Cebuella, Pithecia, Saguinus, Saimiri, and Cebus The threatened howler taxa occupy small distributions in areas of forest fragmentation. In general, populations are most affected by major habitat disturbance, such as total deforestation and flooding from dam construction, and by human hunters. Facilitated by their ability to exploit folivorous diets in small home ranges, howlers can tolerate considerable habitat fragmentation but not the increased exposure to hunting that may accompany it. Howlers seem particularly vulnerable to yellow fever and bot fly parasitism. Although the former threat may decrease by increasing fragmentation of the habitat, other sorts of parasitism may ino ease in disturbed habitats. The Low genetic variability of the Central American howlers suggests a resistance to inbreeding depression potentially experienced during population bottlenecks. Greater between-population variability may still exist. Although howlers are not readily bred in captivity, they respond well to translocation. Translocation has been successfully achieved for greater than or equal to 4 howler species and is a viable option for introducing new genetic variability into population fragments and repopulating areas from which howlers are extinct. Their pattern of bisexual dispersal facilitates colonization of regenerating habitats, and in suitable, protected habitats they have shown the capacity for strong population recovery.

AB The importance of spatial partitioning of gap resources in the maintenance of tree species diversity was studied in an Appalachian old-growth forest. We established three I-ha plots, subdivided into contiguous 10 x 10 m subplots, in a mesic cove forest with a disturbance regime characterized by small canopy gaps (<0.1 ha). For tests of partitioning along the gradient from gap interior to the shaded understory, canopy cover of each subplot was classified as gap, gap border, or non-gap. For tests of gap-size partitioning, gap and gap border subplots were classed by gap size. Species-accumulation curves for the regeneration stratum (stems >1.37 m tall and less than or equal to 10 cm DBH) based on: (1) species per unit area, and (2) species per individual were plotted for each of the canopy cover classes and for all subplots combined. The species-area curve for gaps was steeper than the all-subplots curve that represented the entire gradient from gap centers to the shaded understory. By contrast, all of the species-individuals curves were similar. Sorrenson's indices showed that only gap subplots, particularly those associated with large gaps, had highly self-similar species composition. Furthermore, the relative abundance of most species was similar between gaps and the shaded understory. However, intolerant species often had higher relative abundance in gaps, especially in gaps greater than or equal to 0.04 ha in size. We concluded that gap partitioning hypotheses applied to some intolerants, but not to tolerants. The density hypothesis, a null model attributing species richness levels to stem density levels, largely explained the richness patterns in our study forest.

AB Density dependence was examined in two species of neotropical treelets, Faramea occidentalis and Desmopsis panamensis, in a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island in Panama. Survival and growth probability of plants larger than 1 cm dbh (diameter at breast height), and recruitment into the 1-cm class, were assessed as a function of the number of conspecific neighbors in various distance and size classes. Density-dependent effects on survival and growth were strong in Faramea. Performance of 1-8 cm dbh plants declined with increasing numbers of adult neighbors within 1 m, 1-2 m, and 2-4 m, but neighbors at 4-6 m had no effect. Performance also declined with increasing numbers of juvenile neighbors <4 cm dbh, but the effect was less pronounced. Saplings of Faramea grew poorly in areas of high juvenile density within 30 m, independent of the effects caused by neighbors within 4 m. In contrast to Faramea, Desmopsis showed no density dependence in survival nor in growth. For recruitment, however, the two species showed similar patterns: recruit density was lower in regions with an adult conspecific within 1 or 2 m distance, but higher in regions with high densities of adult or juvenile conspecifics between 2 and 30-60 m. Desmopsis must have suffered density-dependent effects at stages < 1 cm dbh, but the effect vanished by the 1 cm dbh stage. In Faramea, strong neighborhood effects were evident in all size classes < 8 cm dbh.

AB Brazil has become a global leader in the production of commodity row crops such as soybean, sugarcane, cotton, and corn. Here, we report an increase in Brazilian cropland extent from 26.0 Mha in 2000 to 46.1 Mha in 2014. The states of Maranhao, Tocantins, Piaui, Bahia (collectively MATOPIBA), Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Para all more than doubled in cropland extent. The states of Goias, Minas Gerais, and Sao Paulo each experienced >50% increases. The vast majority of expansion, 79%, occurred on repurposed pasture lands, and 20% was from the conversion of natural vegetation. Area of converted Cerrado savannas was nearly 2.5 times that of Amazon forests, and accounted for more than half of new cropland in MATOPIBA. Spatiotemporal dynamics of cropland expansion reflect market conditions, land use policies, and other factors. Continued extensification of cropland across Brazil is possible and may be likely under current conditions, with attendant benefits for and challenges to development.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) mediate plant interspecific competition and community structure. However, the magnitude and direction of AMF effects and underlying mechanisms are not clear. Here, we synthesized the results of 304 studies to evaluate how AMF affect plant competition and community structure and which abiotic and biotic conditions in experimental design modify these AMF effects. The magnitude and direction of AMF effects on plant competitive ability (in terms of competitive response) differed markedly among plant functional groups. When AMF inoculum was added, competitive ability was strongly enhanced in N-fixing forbs and was significantly suppressed in C-3 grasses, whereas no effect was observed in C-4 grasses, non-N-fixing forbs and woody species. Furthermore, AMF inoculation increased competitive ability of perennial species when their competitors were annual species. AMF inoculation differentially influenced separate aspects of plant community structure and species composition. AMF inoculation significantly increased plant diversity but had no effects on plant productivity. Response of dominant plant species to AMF inoculation was the determining factor in explaining variations in how and to what degree plant diversity was influenced by AMF inoculation. When dominant species derived strong benefits from AMF, their dominance level was increased by AMF inoculation, which consequently decreased plant diversity. We did not find stronger AMF effects on plant diversity and productivity when greater numbers of AMF species were used in the inoculation.Synthesis. Despite large variations in AMF effects among studies, a unifying mechanism was observed that the mycorrhizal responsiveness (differences in plant growth between AMF and non-AMF colonization treatments) of target and neighbouring plant species can determine AMF effects on the competitive outcome among plant species, which in turn influenced plant species diversity and community composition. Given that plant traits, soil nutrient conditions and probably mycorrhizal fungal traits are all factors determining the degree of mycorrhizal response of plant species, future studies should explicitly consider each of these factors in experimental design to better understand AMF effects on plant coexistence, plant community dynamics and ecosystem processes.

AB The establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), particularly of no-take areas, is often viewed as a conflict between conservation and fishing. Partially protected areas (PPAs) that restrict some extractive uses are often regarded as a balance between biodiversity conservation and socio-economic viability. Few attempts have been made to generalize the ecological effects of PPAs. We synthesized the results of empirical studies that compared PPAs to (i) no-take reserves (NTRs) and (ii) to open access (Open) areas, to assess the potential benefits of different levels of protection for fish populations. Response to protection was examined in relation to MPA parameters and the exploitation status of fish. Our syntheses suggest that while PPAs significantly enhance density and biomass of fish relative to Open areas, NTRs yielded significantly higher biomass of fish within their boundaries relative to PPAs. The positive response to protection was primarily driven by target species. There was a large degree of variability in the magnitude of response to protection, although the size of the PPA explained some of this variability. The protection regime within the PPA provided useful insights into the effectiveness of partial MPAs. We conclude that MPAs with partial protection confer advantages, such as enhanced density and biomass of fish, compared to areas with no restrictions, although the strongest responses occurred for areas with total exclusion. Thus, MPAs with a combination of protection levels are a valuable spatial management tool particularly in areas where exclusion of all activities is not a socio-economically and politically viable option.

AB With the increasing need to restore former agricultural lands worldwide and in the tropics, in particular, it is critical to explore different models for how to restore these lands in a cost-effective manner which best simulates natural forest recovery and provides for human livelihoods. We propose that agro-successional restoration, which we define as incorporating a range of agroecology and agroforestry techniques as a transition phase early in forest restoration, could be used more widely to overcome socioeconomic and ecological obstacles to restoring these lands. Over centuries, farmers and scientists have developed various agroforestry techniques that aim to cultivate crops and trees, in a range of crop types, time periods of cultivation (a few years to several decades), and complexity of species planted. The management practices used in these systems, such as weeding and increasing soil fertility, parallel those used in many forest restoration efforts. The synergism between these approaches is evidenced by many existing agro-successional examples currently used by smallholders in the tropics. Benefits of the agro-successional model include extending the management period of restoration, offsetting some management costs, providing food security for small landholders, and involving small landholders in the restoration process.

AB Aim The impact of fragmentation on a eucalypt forest was investigated by examining the effects of fragment size, time since fragmentation, degree of anthropogenic disturbance to fragment interiors, and time since fire, on native and exotic plant species richness per unit area.
   Location Two areas of dry open-forest were studied on the central coast of New South Wales in south-eastern Australia. Fifty forest fragments were located at Tomago, an area progressively fragmented over the last 60 years, most recently by clearing for sand-mining. Also at Tomago were six very large blocks of forest that were used as reference sites. The second area at Myall Lakes National Park (50 km north of Tomago) had four very large areas of intact forest that were also used as reference sites.
   Methods Fragments were allocated into (1) three size classes: small (<1 ha), medium (1 to <10 ha) and large (10 to <100 ha); (2) two classes of age since fragmentation: young (up to 10 years) and old (10 years or more); (3) two classes of disturbance (minor, major) based on the degree and extent of human-induced disturbance to the fragment interior; and (4) two classes of time since fire (between 5 and 6 years; 10 years or more). Reference sites belonged to a very large size class (>100 ha). Mean plant species richness per 25 m(2) area was determined for each fragment and analysed separately for native and exotic species.
   Results The most significant effects observed resulted from anthropogenic disturbance. In fragments with major disturbance, native species richness per unit area was significantly reduced in small-sized young and medium-sized old fragments. A significant increase was also observed for exotic species richness in fragments with major disturbance. With minor disturbance, native species richness in small fragments declined significantly with time since fragmentation, in contrast to medium and large fragments. Among recently created fragments, those recently burned had significantly more native species per unit area than those burned 10 or more years ago.
   Main conclusions Anthropogenic disturbance coupled with fragmentation had a stronger and more immediate effect in reducing native species richness and increasing exotic species richness than did fragmentation alone. In the absence of major disturbance, small fragments had fewer native species than larger size classes, but only after 10 or more years since fragmentation, confirming the importance of controlling for age of fragments when examining species-area relationships. This study has not tested whether differences in area were the direct cause of this loss of species over time; other factors that are correlated with area (such as edge effects) may also be involved. The increase in native species richness following fire was consistent with other studies of fire in unfragmented eucalypt forest. This study thus shows that in addition to the factors emphasized in classical island biogeography models, fragment age, disturbance and fire history are important in explaining species richness in fragmented eucalypt forests.

AB Maintaining biodiversity within fragmented landscapes has become a primary focus of ecology. Despite many theoretical and comparative studies on species persistence following fragmentation, experimental studies investigating the mechanisms behind population declines remain rare. In recent years, coastal horned lizards (Phrynosoma coronatum) have disappeared throughout much of their range in coastal southern California. In addition to the direct impact of habitat loss due to urbanization, horned lizard populations continue to decline in the remaining fragmented landscape. One factor that may contribute to their decline is the invasion of exotic species from the surrounding urban matrix. Horned lizards are ant specialists, and they may be particularly vulnerable to changes in the native ant community resulting from the invasion of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile). In this study we examined how Argentine ants influence horned lizard growth rates by raising hatchlings on prey typical of invaded and uninvaded sites. Hatchling horned lizards maintained positive growth rates on a diet of just one native ant species (Crematogaster californica). However, on a diet of Argentine ants or arthropods typical of an invaded community, horned lizard growth rates were either negative or averaged near zero. In addition, when lizards were switched from a diet of Argentine ants to native ants, growth rates increased. One factor contributing to growth was foraging rate; capture success appears partly responsible for why horned lizards specialize on ants vs. other, harder to capture, arthropods. Moreover, a comparison of diets among age classes of coastal horned lizards suggests a diversity of ants is necessary to support lizard populations. While stochastic demographic and environmental processes are often invoked to explain the decline of populations following fragmentation, it appears that horned lizards are disappearing from habitat remnants in southern California at least in part due to the deterministic effects of a biological invasion.

AB Acclimation to periodic high-light stress was studied in tree seedlings from a neotropical forest. Seedlings of several pioneer and late-succession species were cultivated under simulated tree-fall gap conditions; they were placed under frames covered with shade cloth with apertures of different widths that permitted defined periods of daily leaf exposure to direct sunlight. During direct sun exposure, all plants exhibited a marked reversible decline in potential photosystem II (PSII) efficiency, determined by means of the ratio of variable to maximum Chl a fluorescence (F-v/F-m). The decline in F-v/F-m under full sunlight was much stronger in late-succession than in pioneer species. For each gap size, all species exhibited a similar degree of de-epoxidation of violaxanthin in direct sunlight and similar pool sizes of xanthophyll cycle pigments. Pool sizes increased with increasing gap size. Pioneer plants possessed high levels of beta -carotene that also increased with gap size, whereas alpha -carotene decreased. In contrast to late-succession plants, pioneer plants were capable of adjusting their Chl a/b ratio to a high value in wide gaps. The content of extractable UV-B-absorbing compounds was highest in the plants acclimated to large gaps and did not depend on the successional status of the plants. The results demonstrate a better performance of pioneer species under high-light conditions as compared with late-succession plants, manifested by reduced photoinhibition of PSII in pioneer species. This was not related to increased pool size and turnover of xanthophyll cycle pigments, nor to higher contents of UV-B-absorbing substances. High beta -carotene levels and increased Chl a/b ratios, i.e. reduced size of the Chl a and b binding antennae, may contribute to photoprotection in pioneer species.

In most species of strongly seasonal climates (e.g., trees of the cold temperate forests of North America and Japan), seed dispersal and seedling establishment are processes separated in time by at least a few weeks and more typically by a few months. This leaves ample opportunity for various factors to affect the spatial patterns of seed dispersal, survival and germination, and seedling emergence. Spatial uncoupling between these sequential processes leads to spatial independence (i.e., absence of a relationship) in the abundance patterns of life stages. Along a topographical gradient in an old-growth cold temperate forest of northeastern North America, I analyzed the spatial patterns of seed rain, seed bank, and seedling emergence of a major tree component, Betula alleghaniensis, over a 4-yr period. I examined the degree of consistency through time of the spatial patterns of each life stage and of their relationships with one another. Seed rain and seedling spatial patterns were quite variable through time, but that of the seed bank was relatively consistent despite large interyear fluctuations in abundance. Overall, two major spatial patterns emerged along the topographical gradient: one that emphasized the three peaks of density of mature Betula trees, and one with a single peak in the middle section of the gradient, where Betula tree density was higher. Correlations between the spatial patterns of seed and seedling abundance were significant in some years, but not in others. Seed survival was practically constant in space in one year, but quite variable in another; yet, it was consistently density independent. Spatial uncoupling was important between processes as reflected by the spatial independence between life-stage abundance patterns. This uncoupling significantly contributes to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the system and complicates fine-scale modeling of population and community dynamics.

AB Various measurements of the abundance, proximity, and stature of neighbouring plants are utilized as indices of competitive intensity experienced by crop trees. These indices can be useful in assessing the desirability of vegetation control and stand thinnings, and in simulating stand development. Static competition indices, however, have fundamental limitations which should be more widely considered. Competition is usually a constraint to growth, not a determinant of growth, so any measurement of competition alone is fundamentally limited in its ability to predict individual crop tree performance. Differences in the microsite effects of competitors and the autecological responses of crop species result in wide variation in the size of the functional competitive arena, and suggest the need for distinct weightings of competitive intensity for different combinations of species and site. Site differences and weather variation, when coupled with species differences in above- and below-ground allocation, will alter the mode and intensity of competition within a stand and from year to year. The phenology of competitors and focal species will likewise alter interference patterns within a year, making one-time measurements sometimes misleading. Suggested alternatives for determining the importance and intensity of competition include the maintenance of competition-free seedlings (''phytometers'') in order to gauge the competitive constraints experienced elsewhere in a plantation. Simulation models of tree growth and stand development also show promise, but they must incorporate the dynamics of noncrop vegetation development. In developing guidelines for the assessment of noncrop interference and the advisability of vegetation control, there is still a need to determine, in a generalizable manner, appropriate survey plot sizes and critical competition thresholds for different combinations of site type, crop species, and vegetation complex.

AB Woody tropical rain forest species were grouped according to their dependence on gaps for regeneration as obligate gap species, gap-dependent and gap-independent species. Differences in leaf size, shape, anatomy, and mineral nutrient concentrations among these species groups were studied. Obligate gap species had larger leaves than both gap-dependent species and gap-independent species. Gap-independent species had more elongated leaves, and had larger stomata but a lower density of stomata. Gap-dependent species had higher specific leaf weight values and more N and P per unit area than the two other species groups. Gap-dependent species also had more K per unit area and thicker leaves than obligate gap species. Gap-dependent species were more often deciduous, and gap-independent species were less often deciduous than expected on the basis of the distribution of deciduous species over the total species sample. No such segregation existed with respect to compound-leaved species. Gap-dependent species had a greater contrast in most of the leaf characteristics in sun vs shade environments than both obligate gap species and gap-independent species. It is argued that the differences in leaf characteristics between species of different groups are probably related to the way the species exploit their characteristic environments.

AB Pathogen spillover from wildlife to domestic animals and humans, and the reverse, has caused significant epidemics and pandemics worldwide. Although pathogen emergence has been linked to anthropogenic land conversion, a general framework to disentangle underlying processes is lacking. We develop a multi-host model for pathogen transmission between species inhabiting intact and converted habitat. Interspecies contacts and host populations vary with the proportion of land converted; enabling us to quantify infection risk across a changing landscape. In a range of scenarios, the highest spillover risk occurs at intermediate levels of habitat loss, whereas the largest, but rarest, epidemics occur at extremes of land conversion. This framework provides insights into the mechanisms driving disease emergence and spillover during land conversion. The finding that the risk of spillover is highest at intermediate levels of habitat loss provides important guidance for conservation and public health policy.

AB As one of the few countries in Latin America to have reversed persistent losses in tree cover, Chile may hold important insights for forest transition theory. However, existing studies have not provided methodologically consistent analyses at sufficient temporal and spatial scales to properly assess the state of Chile's forest transition. In the current study, we generate high-resolution maps of Chilean land use change between 1986, 2001 and 2011. We couple remote sensing with a review of historic assessments of Chile's forest resources to document long-term trends in forest extent. This historical review identifies multiple discrete forest transitions throughout Chile's history. These fluctuations in forest clearing emphasize that the cultural, economic and political forces that precipitate forest transitions can all be reversed. The remote sensing analysis calls into question official statistics indicating an expansion of native forests between 1986 and 2011. We find that increases in forest cover were largely driven by the expansion of forest plantations, rather than through native forest regeneration. Plantation forests directly displaced native forests in many locations, especially during the 1986-2001 period. Nevertheless, declines in the rate of forest conversion during the 2001-2011 period suggest that plantations are beginning to ease pressure on native forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A plant's growth rate is seen as a central element of its ecological strategy, and as determined by its traits. Yet the literature is inconsistent about the empirical correlation between functional traits and growth, casting doubt on the capacity of some prominent traits to influence growth rate.
   We propose that traits should influence growth in a way that depends on the size of individual plants. We outline mechanisms and hypotheses based on new theoretical work and test these predictions in tree species using a meta-analysis of 103 studies (>500 correlations) for five traits (specific leaf area, wood density, maximum height, seed mass and maximum assimilation rate). We also recorded data for 14 other traits commonly used in the trait literature. To capture the effects of plant size, we tested for a shift in the direction of correlation between growth rates and each trait across three ontogenetic stages: seedling, sapling and adult.
   Results were consistent with predictions, although there were some limitations arising from unequal numbers of observation across ontogenetic stages. Specific leaf area was correlated with relative growth rate in seedlings but not in adult plants. Correlations of growth with wood density were not affected by ontogenetic stage. Seed mass, assimilation rate and maximum height were correlated with relative growth rate only in one ontogenetic stage category: seedlings, seedlings and adults, respectively.
   Although we were able to confirm several of our theoretical predictions, major knowledge gaps still exist in the trait literature. For example, for one-third of the traits considered, the majority (>75%) of reported correlations with growth came from the same ontogenetic stage.
   Synthesis. We show for some traits, how trait-growth correlations change in a predictable way with plant size. Our understanding of plant strategies should shift away from describing species as having a fixed growth strategy throughout their life (on a continuous axis from slow to fast growth), in favour of a size-dependent growth trajectories.

AB Understanding and quantification of phosphorus (P) fluxes are key requirements for predictions of future forest ecosystems changes as well as for transferring lessons learned from natural ecosystems to croplands and plantations. This review summarizes and evaluates the recent knowledge on mechanisms, magnitude, and relevance by which dissolved and colloidal inorganic and organic P forms can be translocated within or exported from forest ecosystems. Attention is paid to hydrological pathways of P losses at the soil profile and landscape scales, and the subsequent influence of P on aquatic ecosystems. New (unpublished) data from the German Priority Program 1685 Ecosystem Nutrition: Forest Strategies for limited Phosphorus Resources were added to provide up-to-date flux-based information. Nitrogen (N) additions increase the release of water-transportable P forms. Most P found in percolates and pore waters belongs to the so-called dissolved organic P (DOP) fractions, rich in orthophosphate-monoesters and also containing some orthophosphate-diesters. Total solution P concentrations range from ca. 1 to 400 mu g P L-1, with large variations among forest stands. Recent sophisticated analyses revealed that large portions of the DOP in forest stream water can comprise natural nanoparticles and fine colloids which under extreme conditions may account for 40-100% of the P losses. Their translocation within preferential flow passes may be rapid, mediated by storm events. The potential total P loss through leaching into subsoils and with streams was found to be less than 50 mg P m(-2) a(-1), suggesting effects on ecosystems at centennial to millennium scale. All current data are based on selected snapshots only. Quantitative measurements of P fluxes in temperate forest systems are nearly absent in the literature, probably due to main research focus on the C and N cycles. Therefore, we lack complete ecosystem-based assessments of dissolved and colloidal P fluxes within and from temperate forest systems.

AB Developing and improving methods to monitor forest carbon in space and time is a timely challenge, especially for tropical forests. The next European Space Agency Earth Explorer Core Mission BIOMASS will collect synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data globally from employing a multiple baseline orbit during the initial phase of its lifetime. These data will be used for tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) processing, with a vertical resolution of about 20 m, a resolution sufficient to decompose the backscatter signal into two to three layers for most closed-canopy tropical forests. A recent study, conducted in the Paracou site, French Guiana, has already shown that TomoSAR significantly improves the retrieval of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in a high biomass forest, with an error of only 10% at 1.5-ha resolution. However, the degree to which this TomoSAR approach can be transferred from one site to another has not been assessed. We test this approach at the Nouragues site in central French Guiana (ca 100 km away from Paracou), and develop a method to retrieve the top-of-canopy height from TomoSAR. We found a high correlation between the backscatter signal and AGB in the upper canopy layer (i.e. 20-40 m), while lower layers only showed poor correlations. The relationship between AGB and TomoSAR data was found to be highly similar for forests at Nouragues and Paracou. Cross validation using training plots from Nouragues and validation plots from Paracou, and vice versa, gave an error of 16-18% of AGB using 1-ha plots. Finally, using a high-resolution LiDAR canopy model as a reference, we showed that TomoSAR has the potential to retrieve the top-of-canopy height with an error to within 2.5 m. Our analyses show that the TomoSAR-AGB retrieval method is accurate even in hilly and high-biomass forest areas and suggest that our approach may be generalizable to other study sites, having a canopy taller than 30 m. These results have strong implications for the tomographic phase of the BIOMASS spaceborne mission. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB To combine the rational use of marine benthic resources and economic development of small-scale fishers, Chile passed legislation in 1991 establishing a comanagement policy that grants exclusive territorial user rights for fisheries (TURFS) to artisanal fisher organizations in well-defined inshore coastal areas, known as Management and Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources (MEABRs). In general the policy has been proclaimed a management and economic success because benthic resource abundances have increased inside MEABRs in comparison with open-access areas. However, there is a lack of studies assessing the impact of this management policy on nontargeted subtidal species and community assemblages and the policy's implications for biodiversity and conservation. This study starts to fill this gap and links the allocation of TURFs for benthic resources with add on conservation benefits for species that are not directly linked with the fishery policy. Comparative subtidal surveys inside vs. outside MEABRs were used to assess the effects of three MEABRs on managed targeted benthic species, biodiversity (species richness), and community assemblages in central Chile. Surveys focused exclusively on subtidal kelp forest habitats dominated by Lessonia trabeculata, spanning 4-12 In in depth and with similar levels of habitat complexity. The study comprised: (1) quantification of kelp forest complexity, (2) understory survey of sessile species, (3) quantification of conspicuous benthic macroinvertebrates, including those under management, and (4) quantification of reef-fish species inside the kelp habitat. Results showed population enhancement of target-managed invertebrates inside MEABRs. Moreover, reef-fish species were significantly more diverse and abundant inside MEABRs, and community assemblages of nontarget benthic invertebrates and reef fish were significantly different inside vs. outside MEABRs. The comanagement of inshore benthic resources in Chile, through MEABRs aims for the sustainability of invertebrate and algae stocks. However, our study shows that this management tool, which in practice restricts access to the entire management area, provides important conservation add-on effects for species that are not the focus of the management policies. Therefore, in Chile, the hundreds of already established MEABRs could represent an important ancillary network, which complements the biodiversity objectives of fully protected areas such as no-take marine protected areas or others.

AB The expansion of urban areas and adjacent farming land into natural landscapes modifies habitats and produces small isolated pockets of native vegetation. This fragmentation of the natural habitat subdivides animal communities, reduces population sizes and increases vulnerability to extinction. In this paper we investigate whether fragmentation decreases lizard species richness, composition, overall abundance and abundance at the species level. Urban remnants consisting of five small (< 10 ha) and four large (> 10 ha) fragments of natural bushland were paired with continuous bushland areas located near Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. These remnants were surveyed six times, using pitfall traps, from November 2001 to March 2002. Lizard species richness and abundance were not significantly influenced by habitat fragmentation or fragment size. Egernia whitii was the only lizard species significantly influenced by fragment size, and was only present in large fragments and continuous bush. Vegetation type and structure as well as environmental variables (geology and aspect) influenced the structure of reptile communities. Lizard species that were able to use a number of different habitat types were found to persist at most sites, irrespective of fragment size. Edge environment did not significantly influence lizard species richness or abundance in remnant areas. Lizard species richness was significantly lower in sites that had a high ratio of exotic to native plant species. Therefore, if remnants continue to be invaded by exotic plants, lizard species that require native plant communities will become increasingly vulnerable to local extinction. Our results suggest that lizard species requiring specialized habitats, such as E. whitii, may persist in large urban remnants rather than small urban remnants because large reserves are more likely to encompass rare habitats, such as rocky outcrops. Habitat heterogeneity, rather than size, may be the key to their persistence.

AB The use of paddock trees by birds was assessed in a grazing landscape in southern New South Wales, Australia. Seventy paddock tree sites were surveyed for 20 min each in the morning, and 36 sites were surveyed again at midday in March 2000. During this time, the presence and abundance of birds was recorded. Several site and landscape variables were measured at each site. These included tree species, a tree size index, a measure of the crown cover density around the site, and proximity to the nearest woodland patch. During formal surveys, 31 bird species, including several woodland species, were observed using paddock trees. Data from bird surveys in woodland patches that were obtained in a separate study in November 1999 were used to compare whether there was a relationship between the abundance of a given bird species in woodland patches and paddock trees. Many birds commonly detected in woodland patches were also common in paddock trees. However, some birds with special habitat requirements were absent from paddock trees although they were common in woodland patches. Site occupancy patterns were modelled for several guilds of birds using logistic regression. Foliage-foraging birds were more likely to occupy clumps of trees and sites with a high tree size index. Nectarivores appeared to be more likely to be detected at sites more than 200 m from woodland, although this result was marginally non-significant (P = 0.08). The probability of detecting granivores was higher at sites with a low tree size index. Open country species were most likely to occupy large trees and sites that were located more than 200 m from the nearest woodland patch. The value of paddock trees may have been underestimated in the past because a wide variety of bird species use paddock trees on a regular basis. Ensuring the continued survival of paddock trees should be an important aspect of future conservation and revegetation efforts.

AB Line-transect surveys were conducted at the Isecheno study site in the Kakamega Forest, western Kenya to estimate diurnal primate densities. The estimates from several different methods of analysis of census data were compared to "true" density values based on home range size and overlap for two species. The Whitesides method [Whitesides et al., 1988], which incorporates species-specific mean group spread into its formula for estimating transect width, provided the most accurate density estimates. The importance of including as many groups as possible when calculating density from home range size and overlap is demonstrated with long-term data from Colobus guereza and Cercopithecus mitis. Colobus guereza group density at Isecheno was much lower than that published from a recent brief study [von Hippel, 1996]. Cercopithecus mitis group density has fallen while overall population biomass appears to have remained stable over 20 years of study. Isecheno has the second highest diurnal primate biomass of the ten Guineo-Congolian rainforest sites for which biomass data are available, despite having the lowest primate species richness. Within the Guineo-Congolian rainforest system, primate biomass appears to vary to some extent between ecogeographic regions: two of three mid-elevation East African sites have high biomasses, two of two lowland West African sites have intermediate biomasses, and four of five lowland Central African sites have low biomasses. There is a strong positive correlation between total colobine biomass and total primate biomass at the ten Guineo-Congolian rainforest sites. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB 1. Diet overlap among age and sex classes of sympatric dasyurid carnivores (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae) at Cradle Mountain National Park in Tasmania, Australia, was determined to assess the likelihood of current interspecific competition, which could influence and explain the disparate population densities of the three species.
   2. The carnivore guild divided into two groups based on body size and prey size, within which diet overlapped: Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus laniarius) and male spotted-tailed quells (Dasyurus maculatus), which consumed larger prey species, and female spotted-tailed quells and eastern quells (D. viverrinus), which consumed smaller prey species. Male spotted-tailed quells overlapped in diet with adult devils in winter, but not in summer. However, in summer the small number of male spotted-tailed quells overlapped in both body weight and diet with a large cohort of young devils. Too few data were obtained to repeat these analyses with female and young spotted-tailed quells and eastern quells, but results indicated that a similar pattern of overlap may occur.
   3. Spotted-tailed quells would experience the highest degree of dietary overlap with another species of carnivore, with all age and sex classes experiencing overlap for much of the year. Adult devils and young eastern quells would both be free of overlap for more than half the year.
   4. No indications of seasonal food limitation, when competition is most likely to occur, were found during this study, but this may occur over a longer time scale.
   5 If the high degree of diet overlap experienced by spotted-tailed quells means higher competitive pressure, this may explain the low density of this species at Cradle Mountain.
   6. These results, high levels of interference experienced by spotted-tailed quells, and the behavioural and numerical dominance of devils, the largest species in the guild, support Brown & Maurer's (1986) and Cotgreave's (1993) ideas that competitive dominance may be more important than energetic equivalence in determining relationships between body size and abundance in local assemblages of animals.

AB Sexual systems of 139 tree species from a tropical rain forest at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico were investigated to: 1) estimate the relative proportions of hermaphroditic, monoecious, and dioecious species; 2) describe flowers, fruits, and seeds in terms of size and weight; 3) describe flowering and fruiting phenology; and 4) correlate sexuality to pollination and dispersal syndromes, and the successional status occupied in the forest. Hermaphroditism occurred in 63% of the species, monoecism in 9%, and dioecy in 27%. Nondioecious species had larger flowers, but dioecious species had more seeds per fruit. The dioecious condition was associated with small flowers pollinated with unspecialized insects and fleshy fruits dispersed by animals at both species and generic levels. Reproductive traits were more correlated among nondioecious species than dioecious species. Pioneer species had more seeds per fruit, and longer flowering and fruiting periods, but persistent species produced heavier seeds and fruits. Flower and fruit morphological traits, sexual systems. and tree guilds are related in a comprehensive way, and a flow model based on data from this study is presented.

AB Tropical forests are renowned for their high diversity, yet in many sites a single tree species accounts for the majority of the individuals in a stand. An explanation for these monodominant forests remains elusive, but may be linked to mycorrhizal symbioses. We tested three hypotheses by which ectomycorrhizas might facilitate the dominance of the tree, Oreomunnea mexicana, in montane tropical forest in Panama. We tested whether access to ectomycorrhizal networks improved growth and survival of seedlings, evaluated whether ectomycorrhizal fungi promote seedling growth via positive plant-soil feedback, and measured whether Oreomunnea reduced inorganic nitrogen availability. We found no evidence that Oreomunnea benefits from ectomycorrhizal networks or plant-soil feedback. However, we found three-fold higher soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations outside than inside Oreomunnea-dominated forest and a correlation between soil nitrate and Oreomunnea abundance in plots. Ectomycorrhizal effects on nitrogen cycling might therefore provide an explanation for the monodominance of ectomycorrhizal tree species worldwide.

AB Sediment microbial communities are responsible for a majority of the metabolic activity in river and stream ecosystems. Understanding the dynamics in community structure and function across freshwater environments will help us to predict how these ecosystems will change in response to human land-use practices. Here we present a spatiotemporal study of sediments in the Tongue River (Montana, USA), comprising six sites along 134 km of river sampled in both spring and fall for two years. Sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons and shotgun metagenomes revealed that these sediments are the richest (similar to 65,000 microbial 'species' identified) and most novel (93% of OTUs do not match known microbial diversity) ecosystems analyzed by the Earth Microbiome Project to date, and display more functional diversity than was detected in a recent review of global soil metagenomes. Community structure and functional potential have been significantly altered by anthropogenic drivers, including increased pathogenicity and antibiotic metabolism markers near towns and metabolic signatures of coal and coalbed methane extraction byproducts. The core (OTUs shared across all samples) and the overall microbial community exhibited highly similar structure, and phylogeny was weakly coupled with functional potential. Together, these results suggest that microbial community structure is shaped by environmental drivers and niche filtering, though stochastic assembly processes likely play a role as well. These results indicate that sediment microbial communities are highly complex and sensitive to changes in land use practices.

AB Losses of plant species diversity can affect ecosystem functioning, with decreased primary productivity being the most frequently reported effect in experimental plant assemblages, including tree plantations. Less is known about the role of biodiversity in natural ecosystems, including forests, despite their importance for global biogeochemical cycling and climate. In general, experimental manipulations of tree diversity will take decades to yield final results. To date, biodiversity effects in natural forests therefore have only been reported from sample surveys or meta-analyses with plots not initially selected for diversity. We studied biomass and growth of subtropical forests stands in southeastern China. Taking advantage of variation in species recruitment during secondary succession, we adopted a comparative study design selecting forest plots to span a gradient in species richness. We repeatedly censored the stem diameter of two tree size cohorts, comprising 93 species belonging to 57 genera and 33 families. Tree size and growth were analyzed in dependence of species richness, the functional diversity of growth-related traits, and phylogenetic diversity, using both general linear and structural equation modeling. Successional age covaried with diversity, but differently so in the two size cohorts. Plot-level stem basal area and growth were positively related with species richness, while growth was negatively related to successional age. The productivity increase in species-rich, functionally and phylogenetically diverse plots was driven by both larger mean sizes and larger numbers of trees. The biodiversity effects we report exceed those from experimental studies, sample surveys and meta-analyses, suggesting that subtropical tree diversity is an important driver of forest productivity and re-growth after disturbance that supports the provision of ecological services by these ecosystems.

AB While global technical progress is relatively linear, there is wide variation in its environmental and social impacts at the local level, with cycles of expansion and retraction or boom and bust, of long or short duration. Analysis of previous open-ended stages of extraction and agro commodities in the Amazon indicates a general gravitational trend for technical progress to increase productivity and permit transformation of increasingly generic forms of material or energy, rather than relying on the specific physical or chemical properties provided by nature. While increased demand favours frontier expansion in the periphery when there is no other alternative, technical progress ultimately favours spatial reconcentration of production in central countries. The agroenergy stage now beginning involves rapid frontier expansion and offers various environmental and economic opportunities, but also generates a series of negative ecosystemic and socio-economic impacts, which are both direct and indirect, for tropical regions. The Amazon and the Cerrado are particularly vulnerable. Interacting with climate change and land use, the upcoming stage of cellulosic energy could result in a collapse of the new frontier into vast degraded pasture. The present and future impacts can be mitigated through crafting of appropriate policies, not limited to the Amazon, stressing intensified and more sustainable use of areas already cleared, minimizing new clearing and consolidation of alternatives for sustainable use of natural resources by local communities. Coping with these scenarios requires knowledge of complex causal relationships.

AB We studied the relationships of bird and small mammal species richness, composition, and abundance to vegetation structure and economic profitability across a coffee intensification gradient in central Veracruz, Mexico. We conducted 2 years of point count censuses for summer resident birds, 2 years of Sherman live trapping for small mammals, and gathered vegetation structure data at 147 sampling points distributed over 16 sites spanning a cultivation intensification gradient. We calculated net annual revenue per hectare as an index of profitability from economic and management data collected during interviews with plantation owners/managers. Both the species richness and abundance of forest-affiliated birds were significantly greater in floristically and structurally diverse 'bajo monte' coffee and forest compared with commercial polyculture coffee, which was, in turn, significantly richer than statistically indistinguishable specialized shade and sun coffee. Mammal capture rates were extremely low at all but two sites. Forest bird species richness and abundance were explained by multiple linear regression models that included statistically significant effects of shade cover, percent of trees with epiphytes, and canopy height. We found no clear relationship between profitability and biodiversity, with biodiverse bajo monte coffee plantations ranking among the most profitable under all price scenarios. The high profitability of biodiverse bajo monte coffee systems was not dependent on the inclusion of long-term environmental costs or premium pricing systems. Our results demonstrate that high-biodiversity coffee cultivation can be compatible with high profitability, and has significant potential for conserving biodiversity in coffee-growing regions, but only as a substitute for low-biodiversity coffee cultivation, not forest.

AB Fragmented habitats are a common occurrence in many marine systems, but remain poorly studied in comparison to their terrestrial counterparts. Here, I show that crustaceans inhabiting fragmented Zostera seagrass meadows show a dramatic response (change in abundance) to patch edges, with 11 out of 12 tests showing greatest abundance at the boundary between sand and seagrass. These patterns occurred on a scale of 0.25-1 m around the patch edge. Changes in seagrass biomass are unlikely to explain this pattern, as seagrass biomass increased smoothly at the patch edge, and did not decline towards patch interiors. In contrast to crustaceans, only a few polychaete taxa responded to the patch edge (9 of 25 tests), and bivalves generally did not show a response (1 of 5 tests). These latter groups are predominantly infaunal, and their lack of response may be partly due to the presence of substantial quantities of seagrass root and rhizome material in the sand habitat, which was defined visually based on the lack of above-ground seagrass components only.

AB In the lowland tropical rain forest of central Amazonia, I investigated the responses of understory bird communities to forest edges bordering a narrow (<40 m width), unpaved road. From 3681 mist-net captures, bird abundance and composition were examined at three distances (10, 70, and 130 m) from forest edge. The degree to which regrowth vegetation along forest borders reduced edge effects was also assessed by contrasting bird communities near roads with varying levels of regrowth.
   Forests near road margins had reduced canopy cover and height and higher numbers of fallen trees than did forest interiors. Bird communities near forest edges also differed markedly from those in forest interiors. Total bird captures and captures of insectivores increased with distance from edge, whereas captures of frugivores and nectarivores did not vary significantly. Mature regrowth on edges significantly increased the captures of insectivores. When insectivorous birds were divided into feeding guilds, birds in six of eight guilds showed significant responses to distance from edge; five of these had fewer captures near road margins whereas one guild (edge/gap specialists) had higher captures. For most guilds, significant alterations in abundance and species composition were evident within 10-70 m of road margins.
   My results suggest that the majority of Amazonian understory birds respond negatively to artificial edges created by a narrow, unpaved road. Forest regrowth along road margins alleviated negative edge effects for only a limited subset of forest-dependent species.

TI Ecological consequences of hunting in Atlantic forest patches, Sao

SO ORYX
LA English
DT Article
DE Atlantic Forest; biomass; Brazil; density; hunting; mammals
AB This paper evaluates the ecological consequences of hunting by comparing mammalian densities, biomass, relative energy consumption and community structure between sites with different levels of hunting pressure. Hunting is carried out mainly by colonists who farm on the edge of Atlantic forest fragments in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Mammals were studied over a period of 18 months, along 2287 km of line transects. Transects were distributed among two protected sites, one slightly hunted site and two heavily hunted sites. Tapirs, the two peccary species, brocket deer, armadillos and agoutis are preferred by hunters in the region. Primates are not hunted in the region. Hunting has affected community structure, with ungulates dominating mammalian biomass at protected sites and primates dominating at hunted sites. This has caused an ecological inversion in the hunted areas of the Atlantic forests. In amazonian regions of the Neotropics hunting is more evenly distributed among primates, large rodents, and ungulates and has resulted in an opposite inversion, with hunted sites having lower primate biomass. Atlantic forests are very susceptible to the possible ecological imbalances induced by hunting by humans, and this must be considered for management and conservation programmes.

AB Whether seed consumers affect plant establishment is an important unresolved question in plant population biology. Seed consumption is ubiquitous; at issue is whether seedling recruitment is limited by safe-sites or seeds. If most seeds inhabit sites unsuitable for germination, post-dispersal seed consumption primarily removes seeds that would otherwise never contribute to the population and granivory has minimal impacts on plant abundance. Alternatively, if most seeds ultimately germinate before they lose viability, there is greater potential for seed consumption to affect plant recruitment. Of the many studies on seed consumption, few ask how seed loss affects seedling recruitment for species with long-lived seed banks. We examined postdispersal seed predation and seedling emergence in bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), a woody leguminous shrub of coastal grasslands and dunes in California. We followed the fate of seeds in paired experimental seed plots that were either protected or exposed to rodent granivores in grassland and dune habitats. Significantly more seeds were removed by rodents in dunes than grasslands. In dunes, where rodent granivory was greatest (65% and 86% of seeds removed from plots by rodents in two successive years), there is a sparse seed bank (6.6 sleds m(-2)), and granivory significantly reduced seedling emergence (in the same two years, 18% and 19.4% fewer seedlings emerged from exposed versus protected plots), suggesting seed rather than safe-site limited seedling recruitment. In contrast, rodents removed an average of 6% and 56% of seeds from grassland plots during the same two years, and the grassland seed bank is 43-fold that of the dunes (288 seeds m(-2)). Even high seed consumption in the second year of the study only marginally influenced recruitment because seeds that escaped predation remained dormant. Burial of seeds in both habitats significantly reduced the percentage of seeds removed by rodents. Results suggest that granivores exert strong but habitat-dependent effects on lupine seed survival and seedling emergence.

AB Leaf mass per area (LMA) is a trait of central importance to plant physiology and ecosystem function, but LMA patterns in the upper canopies of humid tropical forests have proved elusive due to tall species and high diversity. We collected top-of-canopy leaf samples from 2873 individuals in 57 sites spread across the Neotropics, Australasia, and Caribbean and Pacific Islands to quantify environmental and taxonomic drivers of LMA variation, and to advance remote-sensing measures of LMA. We uncovered strong taxonomic organization of LMA, with species accounting for 70% of the global variance and up to 62% of the variation within a forest stand. Climate, growth habit, and site conditions are secondary contributors (1-23%) to the observed LMA patterns. Intraspecific variation in LMA averages 16%, which is a fraction of the variation observed between species. We then used spectroscopic remote sensing (400-2500 nm) to estimate LMA with an absolute uncertainty of 14-15 g/m(2) (r(2) = 2 0.85), or similar to 10% of the global mean. With radiative transfer modeling, we demonstrated the scalability of spectroscopic remote sensing of LMA to the canopy level. Our study indicates that remotely sensed patterns of LMA will be driven by taxonomic variation against a backdrop of environmental controls expressed at site and regional levels.

AB We examined the influence of small-scale gap disturbances on stand development and tree species coexistence in an old-growth Fagus sylvatica-Abies alba forest in the Dinaric Mountains of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The structure and composition of tree regeneration in gaps were compared to the forest as a whole, and the influence of gap size on the density and composition of regeneration was assessed. Transition probabilities were also calculated from gapfillers in different life stages to examine canopy replacement patterns. The structure and composition of tree regeneration were similar between gaps and the forest as a whole, and there was no relationship between overall regeneration density and gap size, indicating most individuals established prior to gap formation. Likewise, there was no strong evidence of gap-size partitioning for shade tolerant F. sylvatica and A. alba, although less tolerant Acer pseudoplatanus only recruited to taller life stages in larger gaps. Transition probabilities calculated from the seedling and sapling data suggest that most gaps will be captured by F. sylvatica, while probabilities based on pole-sized gapmakers indicate both A. alba and F. sylvatica will be maintained in the canopy. We suggest that gaps primarily play a role in reorganizing advance regeneration, and that coexistence of shade tolerant F. sylvatica and A. alba is more likely related to their differential ability to tolerate shaded understory conditions, particularly during larger life stages, rather than gap-size partitioning.

AB China has the world's longest history of soil bioengineering, with the first mention of giant fascines to control torrential floodwaters dating from over 2000 BC. However, soil degradation on steep slopes has accelerated hugely over the last 50 years, due to poor farming practice, deforestation, road and dam construction. The central government has therefore devised a series of major programs to reduce the exploitation of forest resources (Natural Forest Protection Program - NFPP)and to rehabilitate steep slopes by encouraging the conversion of cropland to forest and orchards (Sloping Land Conversion Program SLCP). In this review, we define soil bio- and eco-engineering and examine China's past experience in both domains. We focus on case studies whereby vegetation has been used in conjunction with civil engineering to prevent landslides in Hong Kong and the social and practical aspects of planting on steep slopes to conserve soil on a large-scale in mainland China. The successes and failures of tree planting and forest management in the NFPP and SLCP are discussed along with the priorities for future research and practical applications. This review introduces a special edition of the journal Ecological Engineering, whereby a selection of papers presented at the Second International Conference 'Ground Bio- and Eco-engineering: The Use of Vegetation to Improve Slope Stability - ICGBE2' held in Beijing, China, 14-18 July 2008, are published. This congress joined together scientists and practitioners with the aim of discussing new theory, methods and applications for using vegetation to fix soil on steep slopes prone to landslides and erosion. In this review, we consider the key points from the conference and place them in the context of managing and restoring degraded slopes in China, one of the world's most pertinent study sites.

AB The spatial dispersion of individuals in a species is an important pattern that is controlled by many mechanisms. In this study we analyzed spatial distributions of tree species in a large-scale (20 ha) stem-mapping plot in a species-rich subtropical forest of China. O-ring statistic was used to measure spatial patterns of species with abundance > 10. Omega(0-10), the mean conspecific density within 10 m of a tree, was used as a measure of the intensity of aggregation of a species. Our results showed: (1) aggregated distribution was the dominant pattern in the plot. The percentage of aggregated species decreased with increased spatial scale. (2) The percentages of significantly aggregated species decreased from abundant to intermediate and to rare species. Rare species was more strongly aggregated than common species. Aggregation was weaker in larger diameter classes. (3) Seed traits determined the spatial patterns of trees. Seed dispersal mode can influence spatial patterns of species, with species dispersed by both modes being less clumped than species dispersed by animal or wind, respectively. Considering these results, we concluded that seed dispersal limitation, self-thinning and habitat heterogeneity primarily contributed to spatial patterns and species coexistence in the forest.

AB Habitat fragmentation is a major cause of functional disruption in plant-animal interactions. The net effect on plant regeneration is, however, controversial because a given landscape change can simultaneously hamper mutualism and attenuate antagonism. Furthermore, fragmentation effects may emerge at different spatial scales, depending on the size of the foraging range of the different interacting animals. We studied pollination by insects, firugivory by birds acting as seed dispersers, and post dispersal seed predation by rodents in 60 individual hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.) trees in relation to structural fragmentation in the surrounding habitat. We evaluated fragmentation at three spatial scales by measuring the percentage of forest cover in three concentric areas around each tree of, respectively, 10-m, 20- to 50-m, and 50- to 100-m radius. The number of developing pollen tubes per flower style and fruit set decreased in proportion to the decrease of forest cover Similarly, the magnitude of firugivory in focal trees was negatively affected by habitat loss. In contrast, seed predation was higher under plants in highly fragmented contexts. The effect of fragmentation was additive in terms of reducing the potential of plant regeneration. Moreover, the functional scale of response to habitat loss differed among interactions. Fragmentation effects on pollination emerged at the largest scale, whereas seed predation was mostly affected at the intermediate scale. In contrast to expectations from the larger foraging range of birds, fragmentation effects on frugivory mainly operated at the finest scale, favored by the ability of birds to cope hierarchically with spatial heterogeneity at different scales. Given that two opposing demographic forces (frugivory and seed predation) would be potentially affected by fine-scale features, we propose structural scale as the primary spatial dimension of fragmentation effects on the process of plant regeneration.

AB Indigenous forest reserves represent approximately one fifth of Brazilian Amazonia and pose enormous challenges for sustainable natural resource management by native Amazonians. In collaboration with the Kayapo Indians of A'Ukre of southeastern Amazonia, we obtained a game harvest profile of over 1360 forest vertebrates consumed at this village over a 20-month period, including 743 mammals, 361 forest tortoises and 256 birds from a minimum of 42 game species. This amounted to a total of 13,775 kg of game animals harvested over the entire study (mean = 26.2 kg d(-1)supercript stop). We also obtained some 450 km of line transect census data of midsized to large-bodied vertebrates within the core hunting catchment of this village and in an unhunted but otherwise comparable site upriver of A'Ukre. Population density estimates of 16 of the 18 species censused were significantly depressed by hunting by central place foragers within the village catchment, and a number of harvest-sensitive prey species showed clear evidence of local depletion. For the time being, however, we can conclude that hunting was sustainable at the landscape scale largely because source-sink dynamics in the context of low village catchment density is made possible by large surrounding tracts of primary forest that remain unharvested or underharvested.

AB Amazonian forest fragments and second-growth forests often differ substantially from undisturbed forests in their microclimate, plant-species composition, and soil fauna. To determine if these changes could affect litter decomposition, we quantified the mass loss of two contrasting leaf-litter mixtures, in the presence or absence of soil macroinvertebrates, and in three forest habitats. Leaf-litter decomposition rates in second-growth forests (> 10 years old) and in fragment edges (< 100 m from the edge) did not differ from that in the forest interior (> 250 in from the edges of primary forests). In all three habitats, experimental exclusion of soil invertebrates resulted in slower decomposition rates. Faunal-exclosure effects were stronger for litter of the primary forest, composed mostly of leaves of old-growth trees, than for litter of second-growth forests, which was dominated by leaves of successional species. The latter had a significantly lower initial concentration of N, higher C:N and lignin:N ratios, and decomposed at a slower rate than did litter from forest interiors. Our results indicate that land-cover changes in Amazonia affect decomposition mainly through changes in plant species composition, which in turn affect litter quality. Similar effects may occur on fragment edges, particularly on very disturbed edges, where successional trees become dominant. The drier microclimatic conditions in fragment edges and second-growth forests (>10 years old) did not appear to inhibit decomposition. Finally, although soil invertebrates play a key role in leaf-litter decomposition, we found no evidence that differences in the abundance, species richness, or species composition of invertebrates between disturbed and undisturbed forests significantly altered decomposition rates.

AB Lasius flavus is a dominant mound-building ant species of temperate grasslands that significantly modifies soil parameters. These modifications are usually the result of workers' activities such as food accumulation and nest construction. An alternative hypothesis that could explain changes in soil is colony founding in areas of higher soil fertility.
   In our study we investigated several soil parameters sampled in 10 ant nests and adjacent (control) plots in mountain grassland in Slovakia. The alternative hypothesis was tested by comparing occupied and abandoned mounds. While we found increased concentrations of available P and K in the nests, concentrations of total C, total N, Ca2+ and Mg2+, were tower there. We propose that differences found between the soil. of nests and control plots are entirety a product of ant activity during mound occupancy and not due to initial soil differences during nest establishment. This was confirmed by the comparison of occupied and abandoned nests in which the soil fertility of abandoned nests was similar to conditions in the surrounding soil.
   Along with the modification of soil chemistry, we recorded changes in soil physical properties and the vertical. distribution of nutrients. Ant nests were characterized by the dominance of 0.02-0.1 mm particles and tower bulk density. In the same habitat, nutrient concentrations did not change along the vertical gradient in contrast to control plots where soil nutrients decreased and bulk density increased with depth. Root biomass followed the vertical. pattern observed with nutrients: in control plots, most roots were concentrated in the uppermost layer (0-3 cm), whereas they were evenly distributed along the vertical gradient in the nests. We also found that rhizome.

AB The distributions of 51 non-human primate species are used for Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE) to determine the relationships among 14 interfluvial regions in the Amazon basin, South America. Two most parsimonious cladograms were found. The strict consensus tree of these cladograms suggests an early separation between Lower Amazonia (eastern) and Upper Amazonia (western). The major clusters of interfluvial regions identified in the PAE cladogram are congruent,vith the areas of endemism delimited for birds. When interfluvial regions are converted into avian areas of endemism, the PAE cladogram is congruent with one of the two general areas cladograms suggested for Amazonia based on phylogenies of several clades of forest birds. Our analysis suggests that PAE can be used as a tool to objectively identify areas of endemism at an intra-continental scale as well as to make historical inferences. However, the value of a PAE cladogram in this latter application should be always evaluated by congruence with area cladograms built upon cladistic biogeography procedures.

AB 1. Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle, but the drivers of net forest biomass change (i.e. net carbon sequestration) are poorly understood. Here, we evaluate how abiotic factors (soil conditions and disturbance) and biotic factors (forest structure, diversity and community trait composition) shape three important demographic processes (biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) and how these underlie net biomass change.
   2. To test this, we evaluated 9 years of biomass dynamics using 48 1-ha plots in a Bolivian tropical moist forest, and measured for the most abundant species eight functional traits that are important for plant carbon gain and loss. Demographic processes were related to the abiotic and biotic factors using structural equation models.
   3. Variation in net biomass change across plots was mostly due to stand-level mortality, but mortality itself could not be predicted at this scale. Contrary to expectations, we found that species richness and trait composition - which is an indicator for the mass-ratio theory - had little effect on the demographic processes. Biomass recruitment (i.e. the biomass growth by recruiting trees) increased with higher resource availability (i.e. water and light) and with high species richness, probably because of increased resource use efficiency. Biomass growth of larger, established trees increased with higher sand content, which may facilitate root growth of larger trees to deeper soil layers.
   4. In sum, diversity and mass-ratio are of limited importance for the productivity of this forest. Instead, in this moist tropical forest with a marked dry season, demographic processes are most strongly determined by soil texture, soil water availability and forest structure. Only by simultaneously evaluating multiple abiotic and biotic drivers of demographic processes, better insights can be gained into mechanisms playing a role in the carbon sequestration potential of tropical forests and natural systems in general.

AB Plant reproduction by means of flowers has long been thought to promote the success and diversification of angiosperms. It remains unclear, however, how this success has come about. Do flowers, and their capacity to have specialized functions, increase speciation rates or decrease extinction rates? Is floral specialization fundamental or incidental to the diversification? Some studies suggest that the conclusions we draw about the role of flowers in the diversification and increased phenotypic disparity (phenotypic diversity) of angiosperms depends on the system. For orchids, for example, specialized pollination may have increased speciation rates, in part because in most orchids pollen is packed in discrete units so that pollination is precise enough to contribute to reproductive isolation. In most plants, however, granular pollen results in low realized pollination precision, and thus key innovations involving flowers more likely reflect reduced extinction rates combined with opportunities for evolution of greater phenotypic disparity (phenotypic diversity) and occupation of new niches. Understanding the causes and consequences of the evolution of specialized flowers requires knowledge of both the selective regimes and the potential fitness trade-offs in using more than one pollinator functional group. The study of floral function and flowering-plant diversification remains a vibrant evolutionary field. Application of new methods, from measuring natural selection to estimating speciation rates, holds much promise for improving our understanding of the relationship between floral specialization and evolutionary success.

AB Tropical regions are facing increasing atmospheric inputs of nutrients, which will have unknown consequences for the structure and functioning of these systems. Here, we show that Neotropical montane rainforests respond rapidly to moderate additions of N (50 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and P (10 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Monitoring of nutrient fluxes demonstrated that the majority of added nutrients remained in the system, in either soil or vegetation. N and P additions led to not only an increase in foliar N and P concentrations, but also altered soil microbial biomass, standing fine root biomass, stem growth, and litterfall. The different effects suggest that trees are primarily limited by P, whereas some processes-notably aboveground productivity-are limited by both N and P. Highly variable and partly contrasting responses of different tree species suggest marked changes in species composition and diversity of these forests by nutrient inputs in the long term. The unexpectedly fast response of the ecosystem to moderate nutrient additions suggests high vulnerability of tropical montane forests to the expected increase in nutrient inputs.

AB Understanding how plant species coexist in tropical rainforests is one of the biggest challenges in community ecology. One prominent hypothesis suggests that rare species are at an advantage because trees have lower survival in areas of high conspecific density due to increased attack by natural enemies, a process known as negative density dependence (NDD). A consensus is emerging that NDD is important for plant-species coexistence in tropical forests. Most evidence comes from short-term studies, but testing the prediction that NDD decreases the spatial aggregation of tree populations provides a long-term perspective. While spatial distributions have provided only weak evidence for NDD so far, the opposing effects of environmental heterogeneity might have confounded previous analyses. Here we use a novel statistical technique to control for environmental heterogeneity while testing whether spatial aggregation decreases with tree size in four tropical forests. We provide evidence for NDD in 22% of the 139 tree species analyzed and show that environmental heterogeneity can obscure the spatial signal of NDD. Environmental heterogeneity contributed to aggregation in 84% of species. We conclude that both biotic interactions and environmental heterogeneity play crucial roles in shaping tree dynamics in tropical forests.

AB Environmental synergisms may pose the greatest threat to tropical biodiversity. Using recently updated data sets from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, we evaluated the incidence of perceived threats to all known mammal, bird, and amphibian species in tropical forests. Vulnerable, endangered, and extinct species were collectively far more likely to be imperiled by combinations of threats than expected by chance. Among 45 possible pairwise combinations of 10 different threats, 69%, 93%, and 71% were significantly more frequent than expected for threatened mammals, birds, and amphibians, respectively, even with a stringent Bonferroni-corrected probability value (p = 0.003). Based on this analysis, we identified five key environmental synergisms in the tropics and speculate on the existence of others. The most important involve interactions between habitat loss or alteration (from agriculture, urban sprawl, infrastructure, or logging) and other anthropogenic disturbances such as hunting, fire, exotic-species invasions, or pollution. Climatic change and emerging pathogens also can interact with other threats. We assert that environmental synergisms are more likely the norm than the exception for threatened species and ecosystems, can vary markedly in nature among geographic regions and taxa, and may be exceedingly difficult to predict in terms of their ultimate impacts. The perils posed by environmental synergisms highlight the need for a precautionary approach to tropical biodiversity conservation.

AB To understand the potential roles of seasonally dry tropical forests (tropical monsoon forests) of mainland Southeast Asia in the regional climate system, we briefly describe the complex forest types in this region and review published studies which reported water vapour exchange between tropical monsoon forests and the atmosphere. In addition, we propose future research needs to address deficiencies in our current knowledge base. Seasonal variation in atmospheric evaporative demand, which generally increases with atmospheric water vapour deficit and incoming solar radiation, is conspicuous in this monsoon region, reaching maxima in the late dry season and relatively low values in the wet season. Though the number of reviewed studies is limited, a comparison of seasonal patterns of evapotranspiration (ET) between forest types shows increased ET corresponding with the atmospheric evaporative demand in two evergreen forest ecosystems, but not in both an evergreen and two deciduous forest ecosystems. This contrasting ET seasonality results in considerable differences in dry season ET among forest types, ranging from a low of 0.6 mm d(-1) at one evergreen forest type, to 5.9 mm d(-1) at another evergreen forest type. Further investigations of both rooting-depths and responses of stomatal conductance of individual trees to dry conditions are suggested to be necessary to draw a more general conclusion regarding dry season ET difference between forest types. Besides the seasonal changes in evaporative demand, inter-annual fluctuations of rainfall and its seasonal distribution are also significant in this region. Recent phenological. and physiological studies suggest that these inter-annual variations in rainfall can have significant impacts on water and energy exchanges above the tropical monsoon forests. Thus, we stress the need for further examination of the effects of rainfall-regime anomalies on water and energy exchanges between tropical monsoon forests and the atmosphere. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB We measured the N-15 natural abundance values of 320 individuals belonging to 45 different plant species of the Brazilian cerrado. We also determined delta(15)N of soil nitrogen as a function of soil depth. Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that N-limited cerrado would have a large range of plant delta(15)N values, similar to patterns seen in northern high-latitude ecosystems. Foliar delta(15)N values did demonstrate the large range found in some other N-limited ecosystems, varying from -5parts per thousand to +7.9parts per thousand, Significant variability within individual species was also seen across cerrado community types. Several factors contributed to this variability, including the presence of N-fixing legumes, associations with mycorrhizal fungi, delta(15)N variability of soil organic matter with depth, fire events, and the seasonality of N-immobilization and mineralization processes in cerrado soils.

AB 1. Vegetative growth in vascular epiphytes is assumed to be severely limited by intermittent supply of water and nutrients, but experimental evidence for this notion is meagre. The effects of water, nutrient supply and light on growth were studied in an epiphytic bromeliad, Vriesea sanguinolenta Cogn. & Marchal (syn. Werauhia sanguinolenta) in a large forest gap in a lowland forest of Panama, in a full-factorial design. To investigate ontogenetic drift, three plant-size classes (approximate to5, 15 and 35 cm leaf length) were included in the experiment.
   2. Water supply had the strongest influence on growth, but the magnitude of this effect differed considerably among size classes. Nutrient supply affected growth only in small and intermediate-sized plants. More light (60% of direct irradiation) tended to decrease growth rates compared to 30% irradiation.
   3. Small plants showed by far the highest potential to adjust their relative growth rate (RGR) in response to favourable growing conditions.

AB 1 Past work on tropical rain forest tree seedlings has been dominated by contrasts between strongly light-demanding and strongly shade-tolerant species. We examined patterns of growth and mortality among shade-tolerant tree seedlings in response to light, and investigated the morphological and physiological correlates of high seedling growth and survival rates across species.
   2 Seedlings of 15 tree species from Australian tropical lowland forest were grown for up to 1 year in neutral-density shadehouses at three light levels (10%, 0.8% and 0.2% full daylight). All species showed negligible mortality in the 10% and 0.8% shadehouses, but survival was significantly reduced in 0.2% daylight.
   3 Seedling survival rate in 0.2% daylight showed no significant relationship with either the dry mass of seed reserves (embryo plus endosperm), or relative growth rates in dry mass (RGR(M) ) in 0.8% and 10% light.
   4 The RGR(M) values in 0.8% and 10% daylight were strongly positively correlated, and showed a strong negative correlation with the dry mass of seed reserves. Interspecific variation in low-light RGR(M) was driven by unit leaf rate (rate of accumulation of dry mass per unit area of leaf), whereas interspecific variation in high-light RGR(M) was most closely correlated with leaf area ratio (leaf area per total plant dry mass).
   5 Variation in seedling characters in response to light may have important implications for the coexistence of shade-tolerant tropical tree species.

AB Many plants depend on frugivorous animals for the dispersal of their seeds. However, it is only poorly known whether regional differences in frugivore diversity have consequences for seed dispersal, seedling establishment, and the spatial distribution of seedlings and trees. This comparative study of seed dispersal investigated the consequences of regional differences in frugivore diversity for two tree species of the genus Commiphora. C. harveyi was studied in South Africa where avian frugivore diversity is high, C. guillaumini was studied in Madagascar where the avian fruigivore community is depauperate. At both study sites, the percentages of handled and dispersed seeds in Commiphora trees were quantified by fruit traps, and visitation rates, seed handling rates and dispersal rates were quantified for each animal species for two consecutive years. Seedlings were mapped and the spatial distribution of trees quantified. At both study sites, fruits were mainly eaten by birds. The total percentage of dispersed seeds in South Africa was significantly higher than in Madagascar (70.8% vs. 7.9%) because there was a lack of effective dispersers that swallowed seeds in Madagascar. Seed dispersal benefit, i.e. the increase in the probability of becoming established as a seedling away,from parent trees due to dispersal was much higher in Madagascar (80 times higher probability) compared to South Africa (6 times higher). Corresponding with the different dispersal percentages, seedlings in South Africa were found at relatively large distances from the nearest Commiphora tree (median distance=21.0 m), whereas in Madagascar seedlings were found mostly under and close to the nearest Commiphora tree (median distance=0.9 m). Finally, Commiphora trees in the Malagasy study site were clumped, but were more randomly distributed in the South African study site. These results suggest that regional differences in frugivore diversity and behaviour strongly affect seed dispersal of trees, seedling establishment and the spatial distribution of seedlings and trees.

AB Hummingbirds demonstrate the full scope of Rensch's rule (females larger than males in small species, males larger than females in large species). The phoretic flower mites that hummingbirds compete with for nectar show the same pattern. An analysis of phylogenetically independent contrasts for 154 hummingbird and 37 mite species confirmed that both small (female-larger) and large (male-larger) species contribute to this result. I propose a common cause for this convergent pattern of sexual size dimorphism, with support from ecological and behavioral data for both groups. When morphology or behavior constrains each species to a limited range of resource densities, natural selection tends to diversify body size among species. If mating is promiscuous or polygynous, sexual selection favors larger males when resources are sufficient. But if male reproductive behavior is energetically costly, smaller males may have an advantage when resources are limiting, producing a pattern of allometry for sexual size dimorphism that conforms with Rensch's rule. Stabilizing selection on female size, if it occurs, amplifies this pattern. When the resource-density spectrum is broad enough, both female-larger and male-larger size dimorphism should occur within the same clade.

AB The colobus monkeys and gorillas of African forests share a strong tendency to depend on foliage during lean seasons. In many areas, both kinds of primate are threatened by habitat destruction. But while the total removal of natural habitat is clearly a major threat to the survival of many African forest primates, an analysis of survey data suggests that human predation tends to have a greater negative impact on primate populations than does selective logging or low-intensity bush-fallow agriculture. In the absence of hunting, the population density of colobus monkeys correlates with the protein:fibre ratio of mature tree foliage in their habitat, and the density of gorillas appears to be correlated with the abundance of terrestrial herbaceous vegetation. Because moderately disturbed forest can be relatively rich in high quality lean-season folivore foods, such forest sometimes supports a higher density of folivorous primates than forest that has not been recently disturbed but that has been subject to hunting. Conservation plans for African forests should place more emphasis on the control of hunting and less on rural development, and long-range plans should also allow for the strong possibility of political instability.

AB Due to our intensive subsistence and habitat-modification strategies-including broad-spectrum harvesting and predation, widespread landscape burning, settlement construction, and translocation of other species-humans have major roles as ecological actors who influence fundamental trophic interactions. Here we review how the long-term history of human-environment interaction has shaped the evolutionary biology of diverse non-human, non-domesticated species. Clear examples of anthropogenic effects on non-human morphological evolution have been documented in modern studies of substantial changes to body size or other major traits in terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants in response to selective human harvesting, urbanized habitats, and human-mediated translocation. Meanwhile, archaeological records of harvested marine invertebrates and terrestrial vertebrates suggest that similar processes extend considerably into prehistory, perhaps to 50,000 yr BP or earlier. These results are consistent with palaeoenvironmental and other records that demonstrate long-term human habitat modification and intensive harvesting practices. Thus, while considerable attention has been focused on recent human impacts on 'natural' habitats, integrated evidence from modern biology and archaeology suggests a deep history of human entanglement with our ecosystems including substantial effects on the evolutionary biology of non-human taxa. The number and magnitude of such effects will probably increase given the continued intensification of anthropogenic activities and ecosystem impacts, including climate change and direct genetic modification.

AB Pervasive tenure insecurity in developing countries is a key challenge for REDD+. Brazil, a leader in REDD+, has advanced efforts to link forest tenure reform and environmental compliance. We describe how these policies have shaped sub-national interventions with detailed data on land tenure and livelihoods in four REDD+ pilot sites in the Brazilian Amazon. Despite different local contexts, REDD+ proponents have converged on a similar strategy of collaborating with government agencies to clarify tenure and pave the way for a mix of regulatory enforcement and incentive-based REDD+ mechanisms. This polycentric governance model holds promise for effective and equitable REDD+ implementation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, there have been few studies of density dependence conducted for more than one life-history stage or that control for habitat heterogeneity, which may influence spatial patterns of survival and mask density dependence. We explored the prevalence of density dependence across multiple life stages, and the effects of controlling for habitat heterogeneity, in a temperate forest in northeast China. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to test for density-dependent mortality of seedlings and spatial point pattern analysis to detect density dependence for sapling-to-juvenile transitions. Conspecific neighbors had a negative effect on survival of plants in both life stages. At the seedling stage, we found a negative effect of conspecific seedling neighbors on survival when analyzing all species combined. However, in species-level analyses, only 2 of 11 focal species were negatively impacted by conspecific neighbors, indicating wide variation among species in the strength of density dependence. Controlling for habitat heterogeneity did not alter our findings of density dependence at the seedling stage. For the sapling-to-juvenile transition stage, 11 of 15 focal species showed patterns of local scale (< 10 m) conspecific thinning, consistent with negative density dependence. The results varied depending on whether we controlled for habitat heterogeneity, indicating that a failure to account for habitat heterogeneity can obscure patterns of density dependence. We conclude that density dependence may promote tree species coexistence by acting across multiple life-history stages in this temperate forest.

AB Resistance and tolerance are the most important defense mechanisms against herbivores. Initial theoretical studies considered both mechanisms functionally redundant, but more recent empirical studies suggest that these mechanisms may complement each other, favoring the presence of mixed defense patterns. However, the expectation of redundancy between tolerance and resistance remains unsupported.
   In this study, we tested this assumption following an ecological genetics field experiment in which the presence/absence of two herbivores (Lema daturaphila and Epitrix parvula) of Datura stramonium were manipulated. In each of three treatments, genotypic selection analyses were performed and selection patterns compared.
   Our results indicated that selection on resistance and tolerance was significantly different between the two folivores. Tolerance and resistance are not redundant defense strategies in D. stramonium but instead functioned as complementary defenses against both beetle species, favoring the evolution of a mixed defense strategy. Although each herbivore was selected for different defense strategies, the observed average tolerance and resistance were closer to the adaptive peak predicted against E. parvula and both beetles together.
   In our experimental population, natural selection imposed by herbivores can favor the evolution of mixed defense strategies in plants, accounting for the presence of intermediate levels of tolerance and resistance.

AB To gain insight into the ecological processes driving community reassembly in disturbed ecosystems, we assessed the phylogenetic dispersion of early- and late-successional tree species occurring in lowland forests of northeastern Costa Rica. Early-successional species were more closely related than expected by chance, whereas late-successional species tended to be less closely related than expected by chance. Then, we evaluated temporal changes in the phylogenetic structure of seedling and tree assemblages in four 1-ha plots of secondary forests in this region. We found an increase in the phylogenetic evenness among tree individuals over time in all secondary tree assemblages, indicating that relatedness among tree individuals decreases as succession unfolds. This pattern was jointly promoted by recruitment and mortality processes, suggesting that increasing evenness was caused by the replacement of individuals of early-successional species from closely related lineages by late-successional species belonging to a wider diversity of lineages. Based on species occurrence, however, tree community reassembly did not show any significant phylogenetic trend over time. These results suggest that shifts in species abundance over succession have a greater impact on the phylogenetic structure of the community than the turnover of species. Seedling assemblages showed higher phylogenetic evenness than tree assemblages, suggesting that propagule colonization is an important process driving phylogenetic changes in species composition throughout succession. Overall, our findings showed that the phylogenetic structure of these successional communities varies at two temporal scales. At short timescales, decreased dominance by early-successional species over succession leads to increased evenness among tree individuals. At longer timescales, colonization processes result in increased phylogenetic evenness in seedling communities compared to tree communities, forecasting increasing phylogenetic evenness among adult individuals at late-successional stages.

ID DEFORESTATION; AMAZON
AB Increased food production can be achieved by incorporating more land into the productive process, by increasing productivity in already opened areas or by a combination of both strategies. By allowing a fraction of current pasture area to accommodate the expansion of food and biofuel crops intensification of existing pastoral systems is a strategy to avoid further loss of native vegetation. However, there is a common misperception that the path of growth of the Brazilian beef production has been primarily based on the expansion of extensive pastures. Empirical evidence presented in this article shows that whilst this was the case for the 1950-1975 period, the pattern of cattle production in Brazil has changed profoundly since then. During the 1950-2006 period productivity gains explained 79% of the growth in beef production in Brazil and supported a land-saving effect of 525 million hectares. Therefore, without this land-saving effect an additional pasture area that is 25% higher than the Amazon biome in Brazil would be needed to meet current levels of Brazilian beef production.

AB Land use leads to massive habitat destruction and fragmentation in tropical forests. Despite its global dimensions the effects of fragmentation on ecosystem dynamics are not well understood due to the complexity of the problem. We present a simulation analysis performed by the individual-based model FORMIND. The model was applied to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the world's biodiversity hot spots, at the Plateau of Sao Paulo. This study investigates the long-term effects of fragmentation processes on structure and dynamics of different sized remnant tropical forest fragments (1-100 ha) at community and plant functional type (PFT) level. We disentangle the interplay of single effects of different key fragmentation processes (edge mortality, increased mortality of large trees, local seed loss and external seed rain) using simulation experiments in a full factorial design.
   Our analysis reveals that particularly small forest fragments below 25 ha suffer substantial structural changes, biomass and biodiversity loss in the long term. At community level biomass is reduced up to 60%. Two thirds of the mid- and late-successional species groups, especially shade-tolerant (late successional climax) species groups are prone of extinction in small fragments. The shade-tolerant species groups were most strongly affected; its tree number was reduced more than 60% mainly by increased edge mortality. This process proved to be the most powerful of those investigated, explaining alone more than 80% of the changes observed for this group. External seed rain was able to compensate approximately 30% of the observed fragmentation effects for shade-tolerant species.
   Our results suggest that tropical forest fragments will suffer strong structural changes in the long term, leading to tree species impoverishment. They may reach a new equilibrium with a substantially reduced subset of the initial species pool, and are driven towards an earlier successional state. The natural regeneration potential of a landscape scattered with forest fragments appears to be limited, as external seed rain is not able to fully compensate for the observed fragmentation-induced changes. Our findings suggest basic recommendations for the management of fragmented tropical forest landscapes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rates of tree growth in tropical forests reflect variation in life history strategies, contribute to the determination of species' distributional limits, set limits to timber harvesting and control the carbon balance of the stands. Here, we review the resources that limit tree growth at different temporal and spatial scales, and the different growth rates and responses of functional groups defined on the basis of regeneration strategy, maximum size, and species' associations with particular edaphic and climatic conditions.
   Variation in soil water availability determines intra- and inter-annual patterns of growth within seasonal forests, whereas irradiance may have a more important role in aseasonal forests. Nutrient supply limits growth rates in montane forests and may determine spatial variation in growth of individual species in lowland forests. However, its role in determining spatial variation in stand-level growth rates is unclear. In terms of growth rate, we propose a functional classification of tropical tree species which contrasts inherently fast-growing, responsive species (pioneer, large-statured species), from slow-growing species that are less responsive to increasing resource availability (shade-bearers, small-statured species). In a semi-deciduous forest in Ghana, pioneers associated with high-rainfall forests with less fertile soils, had significantly lower growth rates than pioneers that are more abundant in low-rainfall forests with more fertile soils. These results match patterns found in seedling trials and suggest for pioneers that species' associations with particular environmental conditions are useful indicators of maximum growth rate.
   The effects of variation in resource availability and of inherent differences between species on stand-level patterns of growth will not be independent if the functional group composition of tropical forests varies along resource gradients. We find that there is increasing evidence of such spatial shifts at both small and large scales in tropical forests. Quantifying these gradients is important for understanding spatial patterns in forest growth rates.

AB We present an analysis of the long-term survival of two cohorts of seedlings of the tropical canopy tree Ocotea whitei (Lauraceae) on a 1-ha plot of mature, lowland moist forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. In 1980, we counted an even-aged cohort of seedlings that germinated in 1979, then measured and tagged survivors in 1981. We also measured and tagged a second, smaller cohort of seedlings that germinated in 1981. We followed the subsequent survival of all seedlings through 1985, Seedling mortality was phenotypically, temporally, and spatially non-random. Important correlates of nonrandom mortality included: (l)seedling size and age, (2) an El Nino drought, and (3) biotic neighborhood. Larger and older seedlings survived better than smaller and younger seedlings, respectively, and the El Nino-related drought of 1982-1983 was associated with elevated mortality rates. Seedling density, which was strongly correlated with the proximity to the nearest conspecific adult, increased mortality. The observed mortality patterns suggest that processes consistent with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis operate during the recruitment phase of O. whitei population dynamics. However, the processes causing the observed density- and distance-dependent mortality may vary with factors such as total seed number, seedling size, and climatic variation, making it difficult to determine whether time-integrated seedling-to-adult spacing mechanisms other than self-thinning operate on a given plant population. After 6 years in the hectare studied, survivors remained densest and most numerous underneath the adult trees. We conclude that only long-term demographic data, collected at a variety of scales on a variety of species, will ultimately answer the question: do Janzen-Connell effects contribute substantially to structuring tropical forests?.

AB The paper reviews the main findings of rocky shore and subtidal nearshore experimental marine ecology (EME) in cold and temperate marine ecosystems during the past four decades. It analyzes the role of EME in coastal management and conservation. The historical development of strategies for managing single or multispecies fisheries are reviewed. The published results show overexploitation and depletion of more than 60% of the fish stocks and a lack of connection between the management of fisheries and results derived from experimental marine ecology. This is mainly due to: (a) the different temporal and spatial scale at which most marine ecologists and fishery managers operate; (b) the lack of long-term fishery monitoring and adaptive techniques for management; and (c) limitations in the design of experiments on fisheries. Large-scale oceanic perturbations, due to combinations of excessive resource exploitation and environmental variability coupled with present trends in management approaches are discussed. Modern approaches and tools for management of fisheries, such as Adaptive Management (AM), Territorial User Rights in Fisheries (TURFs), Individual Transferrable Quotas and Non-Transferrable Quotas (ITQs, INTQs) are discussed in the context of small-scale fisheries and EME, Published views on limits of applied ecological research with regards to management of fisheries are discussed. Linkages between EME, marine conservation and the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and experimental exclusions of humans are highlighted. Results derived from MPAs, such as: (a) species or community trophic cascades, and (b) the role of key-stone species and species interaction strengths, are discussed. It is concluded that the role of EME in conservation has been greater than has been the case in management of fisheries. The potential to link EME, conservation and the management of fisheries is exemplified through the proposed establishment in Chile of a connected network of Scientific Reserves, MPAs and TURFs sites. The final conclusion is that to cross-fertilize EME, conservation and management, there are three main challenges: (1) to end the traditional view of approaching the management of fisheries and marine conservation as contradictory/antagonizing issues; (2) to improve communications between experimental marine ecology and the management of fisheries through the implementation of experimentation and adaptive management; (3) to improve linkages between marine conservation, the management of fisheries and social sciences.

AB Quantifying and understanding the main drivers of biodiversity responses to human disturbances at multiple scales is key to foster effective conservation plans and management systems. Here we report on a detailed regional assessment of the response of ant communities to land-use change and forest disturbance in the Brazilian Amazon. We aimed to explore the effects of land-use intensification at both site and landscape scales, examining variation in ant species richness and composition, and asking which set of environmental variables best predict observed patterns of diversity. We sampled 192 sites distributed across 18 landscapes (each 50 km(2)) in Paragominas, eastern Brazilian Amazon, covering ca. 20,000 km(2). We sampled from undisturbed primary forest through varyingly disturbed primary forests, secondary forests, pastures and mechanised agriculture, following a gradient of decreasing total aboveground biomass. Irrespective of forest disturbance class, ant species richness was almost twice as high in forests when compared to production areas. In contrast, ant species composition showed continuous variation from primary forest to intensive agriculture, following a gradient of aboveground biomass. Ant species richness at all spatial scales increased with primary forest cover in the surrounding landscapes. We highlight the limited value of species richness as an indicator of changes in habitat quality, reinforcing calls to consider species composition in assessments of forest disturbance. Taken together, our results reveal the unique biodiversity value of undisturbed primary forests, but also show that disturbed primary forests and secondary forests have high conservation value, and thus play an important role in regional conservation planning.

AB Soil microorganisms regulate fundamental biochemical processes in plant litter decomposition and soil organic matter (SOM) transformations. Understanding how microbial communities respond to changes in vegetation is critical for improving predictions of how land-cover change affects belowground carbon storage and nutrient availability. We measured intra-and interannual variability in soil and forest litter microbial community composition and activity via phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) and extracellular enzyme activity across a well-replicated, long-term chronosequence of secondary forests growing on abandoned pastures in the wet subtropical forest life zone of Puerto Rico. Microbial community PLFA structure differed between young secondary forests and older secondary and primary forests, following successional shifts in tree species composition. These successional patterns held across seasons, but the microbial groups driving these patterns differed over time. Microbial community composition from the forest litter differed greatly from those in the soil, but did not show the same successional trends. Extracellular enzyme activity did not differ with forest succession, but varied by season with greater rates of potential activity in the dry seasons. We found few robust significant relationships among microbial community parameters and soil pH, moisture, carbon, and nitrogen concentrations. Observed inter- and intrannual variability in microbial community structure and activity reveal the importance of a multiple, temporal sampling strategy when investigating microbial community dynamics with land-use change. Successional control over microbial composition with forest recovery suggests strong links between above and belowground communities.

AB 1. Deterministic theories predict that local communities assemble from a regional species pool based on niche differences, thus by plant functional adaptations. We tested whether functional traits can also explain patterns in species dominance among the suite of co-occurring species.
   2. We predicted that along a gradient of secondary succession, the main driver of species dominance changes from environmental filtering in the relatively harsh (dry and hot) early successional conditions, towards increased competitive interactions and limiting similarity in later successional conditions (when light is limited).
   3. We used the Kurtosis (K) (a measure of peakedness) of the functional trait distribution of secondary forest communities in high-diversity tropical rain forest in Chiapas, Mexico. The forests ranged 1-25 years in age, and we used eight functional leaf traits related to a plants' carbon, water and heat balance. We calculated the functional trait distribution based on species dominance, where trait values were weighted by species' relative basal area, as well as based on species presence, all species counting once. 'K-ratio' was subsequently computed by dividing kurtosis based on species dominance by kurtosis based on species presence. If the K-ratio is high, the dominant species are functionally similar and we interpreted this as environmentally driven functional convergence allowing species to become dominant. If the K-ratio is small, dominant species are a functionally dissimilar subset of the species present and we interpreted this as competitively driven functional divergence allowing species to become dominant.
   4. We found that in early succession, dominant species represent a functionally narrow subset of species with similar traits, and in late succession, dominant species increasingly represent a wide subset of the species present. This trend was found for traits that reflect photosynthetic performance and light capture, and indicates increased competition for light with succession. No trend was found for traits that indicate defence against herbivory, suggesting no successional changes in herbivore pressure.
   5. Synthesis. This is one of the first studies showing that drivers of species dominance change along a gradient of secondary succession. During the early successional time window we evaluated, the importance of environmental filtering as a driving force fades away rapidly, and the importance of niche partitioning for species dominance starts to emerge.

AB Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ca) will undoubtedly affect the metabolism of tropical forests worldwide; however, critical aspects of how tropical forests will respond remain largely unknown. Here, we review the current state of knowledge about physiological and ecological responses, with the aim of providing a framework that can help to guide future experimental research. Modelling studies have indicated that elevated ca can potentially stimulate photosynthesis more in the tropics than at higher latitudes, because suppression of photorespiration by elevated ca increases with temperature. However, canopy leaves in tropical forests could also potentially reach a high temperature threshold under elevated ca that will moderate the rise in photosynthesis. Belowground responses, including fine root production, nutrient foraging and soil organic matter processing, will be especially important to the integrated ecosystem response to elevated ca. Water use efficiency will increase as ca rises, potentially impacting upon soil moisture status and nutrient availability. Recruitment may be differentially altered for some functional groups, potentially decreasing ecosystem carbon storage. Whole-forest CO2 enrichment experiments are urgently needed to test predictions of tropical forest functioning under elevated ca. Smaller scale experiments in the understorey and in gaps would also be informative, and could provide stepping stones towards stand-scale manipulations.

AB A reconstruction of land use changes and the implications thereof for landslide occurrence on critical slopes of Mount Elgon in Eastern Uganda were undertaken. Aerial photographs taken in 1960 formed the benchmark for the analysis of respective land use changes between 1995 and 2006, using 30 m Landsat TM and 20 m SPOT MS images. Landslide sites were mapped using a MobileMapper, and terrain parameters were derived using a 15 m Digital Elevation Model. A supervised classification approach was employed to generate land-cover maps, from which the areas of three land-cover classes (agricultural fields, woodlands and forests) were calculated. A post-classification comparison change-detection technique revealed different trends in land-cover change between the periods 1960-1995 and 1995-2006. Whereas there were minimal land use changes between 1960 and 1995, the period 1995-2006 marked a considerable loss of woodlands and forest cover, particularly on steep concave slopes (36 degrees-58 degrees) of the National Park. The encroachment onto the critical slopes was noted to have induced a series of shallow and deep landslides in the area. All the mapped landslides were noted to lie on steep concave slopes of a northerly orientation, which had been opened up for cultivation. Deforestation and cultivation alter the soil hydrological conditions on steep concave slopes, rendering them susceptible to saturation. This may trigger debris flows during rainfall events. There is a need to restore forest cover on the fragile steep slopes and restrain local communities from opening up new areas for cultivation on critical slopes, particularly within the protected area.

AB To supply ecosystem services, private landholders incur costs. Knowledge of these costs is critical for the design of conservation-payment programs. Estimating these costs accurately is difficult because the minimum acceptable payment to a potential supplier is private information. We describe how an auction of payment contracts can be designed to elicit this information during the design phase of a conservation-payment program. With an estimate of the ecosystem-service supply curve from a pilot auction, conservation planners can explore the financial, ecological, and socioeconomic consequences of alternative scaled-up programs. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in Indonesia, where soil erosion on coffee farms generates downstream ecological and economic costs. Bid data from a small-scale, uniform-price auction for soil-conservation contracts allowed estimates of the costs of a scaled-up program, the gain from integrating biophysical and economic data to target contracts, and the trade-offs between poverty alleviation and supply of ecosystem services. Our study illustrates an auction-based approach to revealing private information about the costs of supplying ecosystem services. Such information can improve the design of programs devised to protect and enhance ecosystem services.

Tropical forest carbon stocking is unlikely to increase given, that carbon pool size is driven by tree and patch demography, with tree longevity unlikely to increase. Unlike epiphytes, tropical lianas are likely to play a more important role in a CO2-rich future.

AB A persistent challenge in ecology is to explain the high diversity of tree species in tropical forests. Although the role of species characteristics in maintaining tree diversity in tropical forests has been the subject of theory and debate for decades, spatial patterns in local diversity have not been analyzed from the viewpoint of individual species. To measure scale-dependent local diversity structures around individual species, we propose individual species - area relationships (ISAR), a spatial statistic that marries common species-area relationships with Ripley's K to measure the expected a diversity in circular neighborhoods with variable radius around an arbitrary individual of a target species. We use ISAR to investigate if and at which spatial scales individual species increase in tropical forests' local diversity (accumulators), decrease local diversity (repellers), or behave neutrally. Our analyses of data from Barro Colorado Island (Panama) and Sinharaja (Sri Lanka) reveal that individual species leave identifiable signatures on spatial diversity, but only on small spatial scales. Most species showed neutral behavior outside neighborhoods of 20 m. At short scales (< 20 m), we observed, depending on the forest type, two strongly different roles of species: diversity repellers dominated at Barro Colorado Island and accumulators at Sinharaja. Nevertheless, we find that the two tropical forests lacked any key species structuring species diversity at larger scales, suggesting that '' balanced '' species-species interactions may be a characteristic of these species-rich forests. We anticipate our analysis method will be a starting point for more powerful investigations of spatial structures in diversity to promote a better understanding of biodiversity in tropical forests.

AB The combined effects of rapid habitat loss, fragmentation and disturbance on tropical forest avifaunas have not been examined to date. The southern Amazonian 'arc of deforestation' marks the boundary of the most aggressive agricultural frontier in tropical forests worldwide. We sampled 21 disturbed and undisturbed primary forest patches, ranging in size from 1.2 to 14,476 ha, to elucidate the synergistic effects of both forest disturbance and fragmentation on bird community structure, and pinpoint which species were the "winners" and "losers" from this process. A number of forest patch metrics, derived from an independent remote sensing approach, explained much of the resulting presence/absence matrix. The bird community exhibited a highly nested structure, with small patches being most dissimilar from one another. Bird species differed in their response to both forest patch size and forest canopy perforation according to their dependence on closed-canopy primary forest. Forest patch geometry, which clearly modulated the shape of species-area relationships accounted for 83-96% of the variation in species richness, but forest habitat quality resulting from logging and surface-fire disturbance was also a significant predictor of species richness for the most forest-dependent taxa.

AB Using standardized small mammal surveys at 26 Atlantic Forest sites, we evaluated the efficiency and compared the weight of captured species and individuals between large pitfall traps and Sherman traps. We also investigated the effects of climatic variables on daily capture success of pitfalls. Pitfalls were clearly more efficient than Sherman traps, capturing 29 species, of which 16 were captured exclusively with this method-mostly represented by rare species. In contrast, Sherman traps captured 14 species, of which just I was not captured with pitfall traps. Compared to Sherman traps, pitfalls captured (per site) 3 times the number of species, 2 times the number of individuals, and significantly more individuals of 7 species. Despite differences in sampling efficiency, positive correlations suggest that at least coarse-scale variation among sites for several assemblage parameters are congruent between the 2 trapping methods. Sherman traps tended to capture adults, whereas pitfalls captured individuals over a broader range of weight classes or tended to capture more juveniles. Total daily capture rates in pitfall traps increased with precipitation. Our results suggest that large pitfall traps are effective at capturing rare species and juveniles, probably because they are less selective, and are thus essential for inventorying the rich and poorly known small mammal fauna of the tropics and for demographic studies.

AB Most tropical regions are facing historical difficulties of generating biologically reconstructed long-term climate records. Dendrochronology (tree-ring studies) is a powerful tool to develop high-resolution and exactly dated proxies for climate reconstruction. Owing to the seasonal variation in rainfall we expected the formation of annual tree rings in the wood of tropical West African tree species. In the central-western part of Benin (upper Oueme catchment, UOC) and in northeastern Ivory Coast (Comoe National Park, CNP) we investigated the relationship between climate (precipitation, sea surface temperature (SST)) and tree rings and show their potential for climate reconstruction. Wood samples of almost 200 trees belonging to six species in the UOC and CNP served to develop climate-sensitive ring-width chronologies using standard dendrochronological techniques. The relationship between local precipitation, monthly SST anomalies in the Gulf of Guinea, El Nino- Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and ring-width indices was performed by simple regression analyses, two sample tests and cross-spectral analysis. A low-pass filter was used to highlight the decadal variability in rainfall of the UOC site. All tree species showed significant relationships with annual precipitation proving the existence of annual tree rings. ENSO signals could not be detected in the ring-width patterns. For legume tree species at the UOC site significant relationships could be found between SST anomalies in the Gulf of Guinea indicating correlations at periods of 5.1-4.1 and 2.3 years. Our findings accurately show the relationship between tree growth, local precipitation and SST anomalies in the Gulf of Guinea possibly associated with worldwide SST patterns. A master chronology enabled the reconstruction of the annual precipitation in the UOC to the year 1840. Time series analysis suggest increasing arid conditions during the last 160 years which may have large impacts on the hydrological cycles and consequently on the ecosystem dynamics and the development of socio-economic cultures and sectors in the Guinea-Congolian/Sudanian region.

AB Tree-ring studies contribute worldwide to the understanding of climate and its relation to tree growth. Long tree-ring chronologies serve as climate proxies for the reconstruction of past, pre-instrument climate and its recent change. In tropical regions, the availability of exactly dated tree-ring chronologies is limited. The dendroclimatic potential of two dominant species from dry forests in northern Namibia was examined in the study presented in this paper. Both species (Burkea africana Hook and Pterocarpus angolensis DC) were sampled at two sites (ca. 900 km apart), and the response to several climatic variables, including ENSO indices, is studied. All specimens showed distinct growth rings and cross-dating between radii was successful for all trees. Species-specific mean curves were built for both sites. The mean curves of different species of the same site synchronised significantly, allowing the construction of a site-specific chronology. Synchronisation between sites was not possible, but spectral analysis of the chronologies implied that both show similar long-term (6.7 year) oscillation patterns. B. africana is more sensitive to rainfall variation than P. angolensis at both sites. Growth response to rainfall was positive, but a time-lag in the reaction occurred between the sites, corresponding to the time-lag of the beginning of the rainy season. Air temperature showed a negative correlation with stem increment at both sites. The response at the westernmost site to two ENSO indices indicates a tree growth decrease during El Nino years, which are generally dry in southern Africa.

AB Populations of a protandric limpet, Cymbula oculus, were compared between two South African Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), Dwesa and Tsitsikamma, and four exploited sites, and between sites exposed to or sheltered from strong wave action. Harvesting is decimating populations of this limpet. Compared with harvested sites, limpets in MPAs were 30-50% larger, adult densities 75% greater and biomass 30-90% greater. The female:male ratio was 0.58:1 inside the MPAs, but 0.11:1 at harvested sites. Growth rate and age-at-maturity were unaffected by harvesting, but survivorship was 10-fold higher inside MPAs, and reproductive output a staggering 80-fold higher. Conversely, recruitment was three times higher in harvested than protected areas, and inversely correlated with adult density. Wave action had negative effects of similar magnitude to harvesting. Limpets at sheltered sites were 65% larger, biomass 80% greater, female proportions 40% higher, survivorship 25% greater and growth 33% greater. Recruitment was, however, 45% greater at wave-exposed sites. All these effects were detected only inside the MPAs, being masked by harvesting elsewhere. The impacts of harvesting and wave action could never have been detected without the existence of MPAs, emphasizing their importance for base-line studies as well as protection. Dwesa MPA is under threat from poaching and demands for access to resources, but a strong case exists for retaining at least a core fully protected area. Our results clearly illustrate the need for MPAs among the tools used for coastal management. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Relatively little information exists on the effects of logging on rain forest organisms, particularly in the Neotropics where logging operations have increased dramatically in recent years. In this study we determined experimentally the effects of selective logging of a central Amazonian forest on ground-living ants.
   2. The experimental design consisted of three 4-ha replicated plots representing control unlogged forest, forest logged 10 years prior to the start of the study (1987), and forest logged 4 years prior to the start of the study (1993). The logging operation removed 50% of the basal area of trees of commercial value, or about eight trees per hectare. This resulted in a significant decrease in canopy cover, and an increase in understorey vegetation density in logged plots relative to controls.
   3. Collection and identification of ants from a total of 360 1-m(2) samples of leaf-litter revealed 143 ant species, of which 97 were found in the control plots, 97 in the plots logged in 1987, and 106 in those logged in 1993. Species richness, evenness and mean abundance (ants m(-2)) per plot did not vary among treatments. Most of the species found in the control plots were also present in the logged plots. However, population density of many species changed as a result of logging, an effect that persisted for at least 10 years after logging. Species commonly found in sites that were directly disturbed by logging (gaps and tracks) were rare in the undisturbed forest, as revealed by an additional collection of ants.
   4. These results suggest that the persistence of ant assemblages typical of undisturbed forest is likely to depend on the amount of structural damage incurred by logging. Thus management techniques that minimize logging impacts on forest structure are likely to help maintain the conservation value of logged forests for ground-dwelling ants. It is particularly important to minimize the extent of logging roads and tracks created by heavy machinery because these areas appear more prone to invasion by non-forest species.

AB Ectothermic organisms often face dramatic traverses of environmental temperature on a daily or seasonal basis; exemplars among this group are invertebrates and fish of the rocky intertidal zone. Because of the extremes of temperature exposure, intertidal animals have served as an excellent study system to examine the expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in response to natural variation in environmental temperature. Ecologically relevant variation in Hsp expression has been observed with seasonal acclimatization, with small-scale temperature gradients that occur in microhabitats and between species with different intertidal distributions. The maturing understanding of Hsp expression patterns in marine organisms has established a solid foundation on which to build the nest set of questions. In this paper, I present an overview of the variation of Hsp expression in intertidal animals in nature and then address two emerging areas of investigation in the ecological physiology of Hsps. One area addresses the plasticity of Hsp expression in marine invertebrates and focuses on the mechanism of regulation of Hsp gene expression by environmental temperature. A second emerging area of investigation concerns whether Hsps as molecular chaperones display functional diversity that correlates with species' adaptation temperature.

AB We discuss the main ecological factors that influence tree recruitment in neotropical moist- and wet forests within the context of timber management based on selective logging. We argue that setting aside protection areas in managed forests as a way to preserve ecological processes may not be sufficient to ensure sustainable levels of tree regeneration, and that a thorough understanding and application of tree seed ecology can help to refine management prescriptions. We review relevant aspects of tree reproductive biology seed production and dispersal, spatial and temporal constraints on seed availability, disperser behavior, and the potential consequences of hunting and forest fragmentation on tree regeneration, and discuss their implications for biological sustainability in managed forests. Tree seed production can be influenced by the selective removal of neighbors of the same species (due to insufficient pollen transfer), flowering asynchrony, and attributes of the species' sexual system. The extent to which an area is supplied by seed can be affected by dispersal mechanism, spatio-temporal limitations to seed dispersal, and tree size-dependent levels of seed production at the species level. Studies of vertebrate-disperser behavior and tree seed deposition in logged forests are scarce and warrant further attention in order to refine our understanding of the dependency of sustained timber production on vertebrate fauna. Although much remains to be learned about tree seed ecology in neotropical logged forests, the baseline information presented here may offer a starting point for developing ecological criteria for seed tree retention. Furthermore, it may contribute in improving ecologically-based management prescriptions in order to enhance or at least maintain sufficient levels of natural regeneration without the need to rely on artificial regeneration.

AB We monitored nine butterfly communities with varying degrees of human disturbance by conducting a census twice a month during 1980 by the line transect method in and around Tsukuba City, central Japan. We analyzed the biodiversity and community structures using the generalist/specialist concept. The site (community) order based on decreasing human disturbance was positively correlated with butterfly species diversity (H'), species richness (the total number of species), and the number of specialist species in a community, but not with the number of generalist species. The number of generalist species was rather constant, irrespective of the degree of human disturbance. Thus, both the butterfly species diversity and species richness were more dependent on the specialists than the generalists. Our analyses also showed that the generalist species were distributed widely over the communities, and they maintained high population densities, resulting in high rank status in abundance in a community, with more spatial variation in density per species. Specialist species showed the opposite trends. These results demonstrate that the generalist/specialist concept is a powerful tool applicable to analyse the biodiversity and structure of natural communities.

AB I studied gray woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagotricha cana) in an undisturbed central Amazonian terra firme forest, near the headwaters of the Urucu river, Tefe, Amazonas, Brazil (5-degrees 50'S, 65-degrees 16'W). I report the diet and feeding ecology of a group of 39-41 individuals, based on systematic feeding observations obtained during 11 months. Woolly monkeys are primarily frugivorous; mature fruits and young seeds account for 83 and 7% of 3298 feeding records, respectively. On a seasonal basis, however, they relied heavily on young foliage (16%), seed-pod exudates (6%), and flowers (3%), particularly during the greatest annual period of ripe fruit scarcity, as determined by a phenological survey. Animals represent only 0.1% of their year-round diet, and they spent little time capturing arthropods and other prey items. Although at least 225 plant species, belonging to 116 genera and 48 families, are in their diet, the three top-ranking families (Moraceae, Sapotaceae, and Leguminosae) account for 43% of their food species and 63% of the time they spent feeding on a year-round basis. I compare the feeding ecology and diet of L. l. cana in the Urucu and other taxa of Lagothrix in upper Amazonia - the last large-bodied Neotropical primates to be studied - to those of other ateline genera: Ateles and Brachyteles.

AB Models of gap-phase regeneration in tropical wet forests are based primarily on studies of canopy trees. These paradigms are derived from studies of a small number of species whose life history traits place them easily into ''pioneer'' or ''climax'' species. Woody plants of the forest understory, subcanopy trees and shrubs, are known to affect significantly regeneration dynamics in treefall gaps, yet we lack fundamental information on life history characteristics of understory plants that could permit their incorporation into gap regeneration models. We investigated intra- and interspecific variability in early life history characteristics of understory Melastomataceae species of different growth forms and adult distributions from the lowland tropical rain forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We examined germination patterns in vitro (22 species), effects on germination of passage through birds (5 species), seedling establishment in the field (3 species), and growth in different light environments (8 species).
   Established seedlings were significantly more abundant in gaps than in nearby understory sites. This pattern was generally applicable to all melastomes studied, regardless of the habitat where adults were normally most abundant. Seedlings were more common in the root pits and on the root mounds of uprooted trees, even though there was less light available to the seedlings in these microsites than elsewhere in the gaps. In a series of germination trials in vitro, most seeds germinated readily within 1-2 wk. Comparisons of germination rates between seeds collected from bird droppings and seeds extracted from fruits by hand gave varied results. With one exception, seeds of shade-tolerant species germinated more slowly following passage through birds, while seeds from high-light-demanding species germinated more rapidly after passing through birds.
   Seeds of three common species were sown directly into different microsites within gaps and understory control sites. In contrast to the germination trials, emergence percentages in the field ranged from 4% in understory sites to 21% in gap centers. Survival after 1 yr was low (0.1%-0.4%). After 1 yr, these seedlings were small (< 2 cm tall) and produced few leaves. In similar light environments in the shade-house, melastome seedling survival was between 80% and 100%, and growth increased with increasing light levels from 2% (corresponding to understory sites) to 20% (small gap centers) of full sun. With the exception of two species common to abandoned pastures and river banks, the species used in the shade-house growth experiments did not show significant increases in growth with increases in light from 20% to 40%. Suites of early life history traits described for tropical tree species are not consistent with the variation in pattern seen within this one family of understory species.

TI Intact but empty forests? Patterns of hunting-induced mammal defaunation

SO PLOS BIOLOGY

AB Tropical forests are increasingly degraded by industrial logging, urbanization, agriculture, and infrastructure, with only 20% of the remaining area considered intact. However, this figure does not include other, more cryptic but pervasive forms of degradation, such as overhunting. Here, we quantified and mapped the spatial patterns of mammal defaunation in the tropics using a database of 3,281 mammal abundance declines from local hunting studies. We simultaneously accounted for population abundance declines and the probability of local extirpation of a population as a function of several predictors related to human accessibility to remote areas and species' vulnerability to hunting. We estimated an average abundance decline of 13% across all tropical mammal species, with medium-sized species being reduced by >27% and large mammals by >40%. Mammal populations are predicted to be partially defaunated (i.e., declines of 10%-100%) in ca. 50% of the pantropical forest area (14 million km(2)), with large declines (>70%) in West Africa. According to our projections, 52% of the intact forests (IFs) and 62% of the wilderness areas (WAs) are partially devoid of large mammals, and hunting may affect mammal populations in 20% of protected areas (PAs) in the tropics, particularly in West and Central Africa and Southeast Asia. The pervasive effects of overhunting on tropical mammal populations may have profound ramifications for ecosystem functioning and the livelihoods of wild-meat-dependent communities, and underscore that forest coverage alone is not necessarily indicative of ecosystem intactness. We call for a systematic consideration of hunting effects in (large-scale) biodiversity assessments for more representative estimates of human-induced biodiversity loss.

AB The consequences of global change for the maintenance of species diversity will depend on the sum of each species responses to the environment and on the interactions among them. A wide ecological literature supports that these species-specific responses can arise from factors related to life strategies, evolutionary history and intraspecific variation, and also from environmental variation in space and time. In the light of recent advances from coexistence theory combined with mechanistic explanations of diversity maintenance, we discuss how global change drivers can influence species coexistence. We revise the importance of both competition and facilitation for understanding coexistence in different ecosystems, address the influence of phylogenetic relatedness, functional traits, phenotypic plasticity and intraspecific variability, and discuss lessons learnt from invasion ecology. While most previous studies have focused their efforts on disentangling the mechanisms that maintain the biological diversity in species-rich ecosystems such as tropical forests, grasslands and coral reefs, we argue that much can be learnt from pauci-specific communities where functional variability within each species, together with demographic and stochastic processes becomes key to understand species interactions and eventually community responses to global change.

AB An ongoing debate in ecology concerns the impacts of ecological drift and selection on community assembly. Here, we show that there is a transition in diverse ecological communities between a selection-dominated regime (the niche phase) and a drift-dominated regime (the neutral phase). Simulations and analytic arguments show that the niche phase is favored in communities with large population sizes and relatively constant environments, whereas the neutral phase is favored in communities with small population sizes and fluctuating environments. Our results demonstrate how apparently neutral populations may arise even in communities inhabited by species with varying traits.

AB Herbivory has been identified as a potent evolutionary force, but its ecological impacts have been frequently underestimated. Leaf-cutting ants represent one of the most important herbivores of the Neotropics and offer an interesting opportunity to address the role played by herbivorous insects through a perspective that embraces population- to ecosystem-level effects. Here we: (1) qualitatively summarize the multiple ways leaf-cutting ants interact with food plants and their habitats and elucidate the ultimate outcome of such interactions at multiple organization levels; (2) update our understanding of leaf-cutting ant-promoted disturbance regimes; and (3) examine potential ecological roles by leaf-cutting ants within the context of human-modified landscapes to guide future research agendas. First, we find that leaf-cutting ants show that some herbivorous insects are able to generate ecologically important disturbance regimes via non-trophic activities. Second, impacts of leaf-cutting ants can be observed at multiple spatio-temporal scales and levels of biological organization. Third, ecosystem-level effects from leaf-cutting ants are ecosystem engineering capable not only of altering the abundance of other organisms, but also the successional trajectory of vegetation. Finally, effects of leaf-cutting ants are context-dependent, species-specific, and synergistically modulated by anthropogenic interferences. Future research should examine how leaf-cutting ants respond to deforestation and influence remaining vegetation in human-modified landscapes. By promoting either heterogeneity or homogeneity, leaf-cutting ants operate not only as agricultural pests but also as ecological key players.

AB Maintaining connectivity with source populations is especially important for populations of boreal species at the southern edge of their distributions, where anthropogenic disturbance and climate change can be a threat. In the conterminous United States, Canada lynx Lynx canadensis is a federally threatened boreal species that may require connectivity with northern populations to persist. Connectivity is a function of movement between patches and the likelihood that patches are suitable for resident populations. Therefore, we combined resource selection, step selection, and least-cost path models to define empirically movement corridors for lynx in the Northern Rocky Mountains. We used telemetry data for 64 lynx monitored during 1998-.2007 to create a broad-scale resource selection model that predicted probable lynx habitat across the species' distribution in the Northern Rocky Mountains. Our model indicated that lynx selected home ranges at mid-elevations with low surface roughness and high canopy cover. Based on a subset of 37 (16 females, 21 males) adult lynx fitted with GPS collars from 2005 to 2007, we then tested the extent to which remotely-sensed indices of environmental heterogeneity, including greenness, normalized difference vegetation index, surface roughness, and a principal component that indexed stand age, could characterize landscape connectivity for lynx. We found that connectivity between lynx habitat in Canada and that in the conterminous US is facilitated by only a few putative corridors that extend south from the international border. Maintaining the integrity of these connectivity corridors is of primary importance to lynx conservation in the Northern Rockies. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Considerable efforts are focused on the consequences of climate change for tropical rainforests. However, potentially the greatest threats to tropical biodiversity (synergistic interactions between climatic changes and human land use) remain understudied. Key concerns are that aridification could increase the accessibility of previously non-arable or remote lands, elevate fire impacts and exacerbate ecological effects of habitat disturbance. The growing climatic change literature often fails to appreciate that, in coming decades, climate land use interactions might be at least as important as abiotic changes per se for the fate of tropical biodiversity. In this review, we argue that protected area expansion along key ecological gradients, regulation of human-lit fires, strategic forest carbon financing and re-evaluations of agricultural and biofuel subsidies could ameliorate some of these synergistic threats.

AB Colombian Andean forests cover nine million ha. These forests provide an informative case study of mountain deforestation in South America. They are surrounded by tropical lowland forests, and they host most of the country's human population. This study evaluates the relative importance of human and natural variables in deforestation of the Colombian Andes between 1985 and 2005 using remote sensing methods, geographic information system (GIS) technology and general linear models (GLM). The following factors affected the annual deforestation in the region positively: forced population migration, unsatisfied basic needs, economic activity, crops, pastures, illicit crops, protected areas and slope. Factors having a negative effect were tenure of small land parcels, road density, water scarcity and mean temperature. The results of this study also provide insight into the differences between the dynamics of lowland forests and those of montane forests. Montane forests had a lower annual rate of deforestation than did forests in the lowlands. Socio-economic, demographic and biophysical factors explain overall deforestation rates for the region. However, when altitude variation is taken into account, intraregional differences in the Andes become evident. Deforestation processes differ between those areas adjacent to the high Andean valleys where most of the country's population concentrates and those areas in the tropical lowlands north, west and east of the Andean chain. Differences between lowland and montane forest dynamics are due partly to the accessibility of forests and differences in wealth and economic activities. In montane forests, deforestation is positively influenced by economic activity, the presence of protected areas and higher slopes. Deforestation in montane forests is negatively affected by tenure of small land parcels, road density, water scarcity and mean temperature. Lowland deforestation rates are more closely related to rural population, pasture percentage, crops, protected areas and temperature. Our results suggest that montane forests appear to be in a more advanced stage of colonisation and economic development, whereas lowland forests are closer to the colonisation frontier and to rapidly growing colonist populations. This study reinforces the idea that although the most common tropical drivers of deforestation are found in the Andes, these drivers operate differently when intraregional differences are considered.

AB In networks of plant-animal mutualisms, different animal groups interact preferentially with different plants, thus forming distinct modules responsible for different parts of the service. However, what we currently know about seed dispersal networks is based only on birds. Therefore, we wished to fill this gap by studying bat-fruit networks and testing how they differ from bird-fruit networks. As dietary overlap of Neotropical bats and birds is low, they should form distinct mutualistic modules within local networks. Furthermore, since frugivory evolved only once among Neotropical bats, but several times independently among Neotropical birds, greater dietary overlap is expected among bats, and thus connectance and nestedness should be higher in bat-fruit networks. If bat-fruit networks have higher nestedness and connectance, they should be more robust to extinctions. We analyzed 1 mixed network of both bats and birds and 20 networks that consisted exclusively of either bats (11) or birds (9). As expected, the structure of the mixed network was both modular (M = 0.45) and nested (NODF = 0.31); one module contained only birds and two only bats. In 20 datasets with only one disperser group, bat-fruit networks (NODF = 0.53 +/- A 0.09, C = 0.30 +/- A 0.11) were more nested and had a higher connectance than bird-fruit networks (NODF = 0.42 +/- A 0.07, C = 0.22 +/- A 0.09). Unexpectedly, robustness to extinction of animal species was higher in bird-fruit networks (R = 0.60 +/- A 0.13) than in bat-fruit networks (R = 0.54 +/- A 0.09), and differences were explained mainly by species richness. These findings suggest that a modular structure also occurs in seed dispersal networks, similar to pollination networks. The higher nestedness and connectance observed in bat-fruit networks compared with bird-fruit networks may be explained by the monophyletic evolution of frugivory in Neotropical bats, among which the diets of specialists seem to have evolved from the pool of fruits consumed by generalists.

AB We analysed patterns of habitat and microhabitat preferences of 19 families (comprising 135 genera and 950 species) of crustose, corticolous lichens in Costa Rica (Arthoniaceae, Arthopyreniaceae, Coenogoniaceae, Graphidaceae, Lecanoraceae, Letrouitiaceae, Monoblastiaceae, Pertusariaceae, Physciaceae, Pilocarpaceae, Porinaceae, Pyrenulaceae, Ramalinaceae, Roccellaceae, Strigulaceae, Teloschistaceae, Thelenellaceae, Thelotremataceae, Trypetheliaceae), in order to test whether Thelotremataceae are suitable predictors of undisturbed tropical rain forest and can be used as bioindicators of ecological continuity. The dataset consisted of 12,215 specimen samples and six environmental parameters recorded for each sample (altitude, degree of seasonality, vegetation type, disturbance level, substrate nature, light exposure), which were analysed by a multivariate approach using principal component analysis (PCA). The analysis showed that three of the 19 families, Letrouitiaceae, Porinaceae, and Thelotremataceae, showed significant preferences for undisturbed primary to old growth secondary forest, fully shaded to semi-exposed microhabitats, and the bark of mature tree trunks, parameters assumed to be correlated with ecological continuity of closed rain forest habitats. Thelotremataceae had broader altitudinal range than Letrouitiaceae and Porinaceae and significantly higher genus and species diversity (16 genera, 130 species) compared to Porinaceae (4 genera, 40 species) and Letrouitiaceae (1 genus, 5 species). Our results support the hypothesis that Thelotremataceae perform best as predictors of undisturbed dry and lowland to montane rain forest and are the most suitable lichen bioindicators of ecological continuity in these ecosystems. In contrast, Lecanoraceae, Pertusariaceae, Physciaceae, and Teloschistaceae, were found to be predictors of disturbed and pioneer (micro-)habitats. We also found that, among a variety of parameters tested, the Index of Ecological Continuity (IEC), adapted to the use of Thelotremataceae in tropical forests, performs best in terms of predicting disturbance levels and site history. A semi-taxonomic approach identifying morphotypes rather than genera or species yielded the same results, making this method suitable for a broader spectrum of potential users.

AB In the Cerrado savannas from Brazil fire events are common and strongly influence the vegetation structure and, consequently, the associated small mammals. In this paper, we investigate changes in the structure of small mammal communities related to sites of different post-fire ages. Mammals were captured in similar Cerrado sites that differed in time since the last burn ( 1 to 26 yr). We sampled six sites in the wet season of 1997 ( phase 1) and, three years later, six sites in the wet and dry seasons ( phase 2). Six rodent species and four marsupials were captured. Community composition changed drastically as a function of time since fire. The diversity and abundance of small mammals reached maximum values in the early successional stages. The rodent Calomys tener was present only in early seral stages. The rodent Bolomys lasiurus was more frequent in mid-successional stages and decreased in later seral stages, and the rodent Oryzomys subflavus occupied all successional stages. The marsupial Gracilinanus agilis was dominant in the area that did not burn for at least 23 yr. Changes in composition of the community of small mammals were more accelerated in early successional stages, when there are more drastic vegetational changes. The ability of small mammals to cope with Cerrado fires and the great dissimilarity among post-burning seral stages suggest that a mosaic of areas representing different post-fire seral stages could increase the regional diversity of this group.

AB I analyzed patterns of variation in root mass allocation and root morphology among seedlings of woody species in relation to environmental factors in four Neotropical forests. Among forests, I explored the response of root traits to sites varying in water or nutrient availability. Within each forest, I explored the plastic response of species to different microhabitats: gaps and understory. Additionally, I explored evidence for life history correlation of root and shoot traits by comparing species differing in their successional group (light-demanding [22 spp.] or shade tolerant [27 spp.]) and germination type (species with photosynthetic cotyledons or species with reserve cotyledons). At each forest site, young seedlings from 10 to 20 species were excavated. A total of 55 species was collected in understory conditions and 31 of them were also collected in gaps. From each seedling, six morphological ratios were determined. Allocation to roots was higher in forest sites with the lowest soil resources. Roots were finer and longer in the most infertile site, while roots were deeper in the site with the longest dry season. Seedling traits did not differ between germination types. Shade tolerant species allocated more to roots and developed thicker roots than light-demanding species. Light-demanding species showed stronger plastic responses to habitat than shade tolerant species, and species with photosynthetic cotyledons showed lower plasticity than species with reserve cotyledons. Overall, these results suggest that among Neotropical species, root allocation and root morphology of seedlings reflect plant adjustments to water or nutrient availability at geographic and microhabitat scales. In addition, life history specialization to light environments is suggested by differences among groups of species in their allocation to roots and in their root morphology.

AB Primary tropical lowland rainforest in Sabah, Malaysia, has been largely reduced to small to medium-sized, often isolated, forest islands surrounded by a highly altered agricultural landscape. The biodiversity patterns of leaf litter ant communities were monitored in two forest fragments of differing size as well as in a contiguous forest over the course of two years. Species number and diversity in the forest isolates was significantly lower, reaching only 47.5% of the species number collected in the contiguous forest. Species density was also lower, which had led to a thinning of the ant community in the fragments. Community composition was substantially altered in the forest remnants, and an increase of tramp species with smaller fragment size was detected. These results were unexpected and alarming, as the medium-sized forest is with its 42.9 km(2) a comparatively large primary forest fragment for Sabah.

AB Land managers seeking to reestablish historical fire regimes need guidance on how to apply prescribed fire to promote the population persistence of endangered species. We explored extinction risks of Hypericum cumulicola , a fire-dependent plant endemic to the Lake Wales Ridge, Florida (U.S.A). Stochastic and deterministic matrix population models based on six censuses (1994-1999) and data from several germination and seedling survival experiments were used to compare H. cumulicola demography and extinction probabilities under different fire regimes. Environmental variation associated with site, year, and winter precipitation was included in these models. We estimated time to extinction of unburned populations of different sizes and the probabilities of extinction under no fire, different regular fire-return intervals, and alternating short and long fire-return intervals. Following an initial fire, even relatively large populations of thousands of individuals may become locally extinct within 300-400 years without additional fires. Extinction probability declined as intervals between fires decreased. Fire intervals of >50 years resulted in an appreciable extinction probability after 200 years. Cycles of highly staggered short and long fire-return intervals caused slightly higher chances of extinction than regular fire-return intervals. The simulations were sensitive to estimates of survival in the seed bank. Active management will be required to restore favorable fire regimes in areas where fire has been suppressed. To maintain biodiversity, managers should consider variable fire regimes to match the requirements of a variety of species with different life histories.

AB 1 Seedlings of 16 West African timber tree species were grown in six neutral shade-houses with irradiances 2%, 6%, 10%, 28%, 44% and 66% of unshaded values.
   2 Tested species included well-known pioneers, which showed negative growth in 2% irradiance but which responded strongly to increased irradiance, and very shade-tolerant non-pioneers, which had positive growth in 2% irradiance but responded only slightly to increased irradiance.
   3 For all species, maximum growth occurred at an irradiance varying between 10% and 44%. The inhibition of growth at higher irradiance was greater in the more shade-tolerant species.
   4 Data from growth analyses were used in a principal components analysis to quantify the species' positions on a light response gradient. The growth variables most strongly correlated with this gradient were relative growth rate (RGR) and relative diameter growth in 2% irradiance, and also apparent quantum efficiency and leaf mortality rate in both 2% and 66% irradiance. These results draw attention to the importance of performance in deep forest shade in defining differences among tropical forest tree species.
   5 The second (independent) axis of the principal components analysis separated three species that are known from other experiments to be drought tolerant. Other species' traits of functional significance (adult deciduousness, seed size, seed dispersal) were only weakly, if at all, associated with the gradient of light response.
   6 Possible methods for efficient placement of other species on the gradient of light response are discussed. Formulation of standardized conditions simulating deep shade would allow diameter growth to be used as a simple non-destructive measure of a species' position on the gradient of light response, which could then be applied to any tropical forest flora.

AB Encrusting algae have been described as dominant space occupying species on rocky shores around the world. Despite their abundance, however, most studies classify species under generic names (e.g. Ralfsia sp.) or as a functional group (e.g. encrusting algae), thereby underestimating the number of species present and their ecological importance. Studies on six rocky shores of varying exposure, in Hong Kong, recorded eight common species of encrusting algae. The greatest abundance of encrusting algae was recorded on shores of intermediate exposure, where four distinct zonation bands could be identified; a cyanobacterial ''Kyrtuthrix-Zone'' in the upper midlittoral, a ''Bare-Zone'' below this, a ''Mixed-Zone'' in the lower midlittoral and a ''Coralline-Zone'' in the infralittoral fringe. Abundance declined on shores of greater and lower exposure to wave action, where bivalves and barnacles were competitively dominant. Certain species were found in greater abundance on exposed shores (e.g. Dermocarpa sp. and Hildenbrandia occidentalis), while others preferred more sheltered shores (e.g. Hildenbrandia prototypus and Kyrtuthrix maculans). With the exception of some cyanobacterial crusts, the abundance of encrusting algae was always greatest towards the low shore, an area of decreased physical stress and increased herbivore density. Zonation patterns showed seasonal variation associated with the monsoonal climate of Hong Kong. Most species increased in abundance during the cool season, while during the summer months the cover and vertical extent of encrusting algae decreased in relation to summer temperatures, although K. maculans increased in abundance during the summer. On Hong Kong shores, encrusting algae have a high species richness and exhibit within-functional group spatial and temporal variation which is mediated by herbivory and seasonal, physical stresses.

TI MECHANISMS OF DIFFERENTIAL SURVIVAL AND GROWTH OF 2 SPECIES OF LITTORINA

AB Gastropods from wave-exposed shores are typically smaller and thinner-shelled with a larger foot than gastropods from protected shores. We investigated the value of these adaptations by comparing the survival and growth of one exposed shore species and one protected shore species of Littorina transplanted to wave-exposed and protected shores.
   Adult snails on exposed shores with heavy surf had reduced winter growth rates and low over-winter survival rates. Demographic studies of the exposed shore species showed that few adults survived the winter at the most exposed sites; recruitment to the following year's population was primarily from small juveniles that overwintered between barnacles and within algae. The protected shore species had slightly lower survival than the exposed shore species on exposed shores. The protected shore species was also more susceptible to dislodgement in a flow tank. The low winter growth rates and survival may explain why the large, late-maturing, protected shore species does not occur on exposed shores.
   Adult snails on protected shores had moderate winter growth rates and moderate over-winter survival. The exposed shore species survived very poorly on protected shores, in part because of predation by shore crabs. In laboratory experiments the thin-shelled exposed shore species was significantly preferred by shore crabs and withstood significantly less force. The small size, thin shell, and large shell aperture of the exposed shore species makes it vulnerable to the shore crabs and may explain why it does not occur on protected shores.

AB The mechanisms underlying interspecific variation in conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) are poorly understood. Using a multilevel modeling approach, we combined long-term seedling demographic data from a subtropical forest plot with soil fungal community data by means of DNA sequencing to address the feedback of various guilds of soil fungi on the density dependence of trees. We show that mycorrhizal type mediates tree neighborhood interactions at the community level, and much of the interspecific variation in CNDD is explained by how tree species differ in their fungal density accumulation rates as they grow. Species with higher accumulation rates of pathogenic fungi suffered more from CNDD, whereas species with lower CNDD had higher accumulation rates of ectomycorrhizal fungi, suggesting that mutualistic and pathogenic fungi play important but opposing roles.

AB Rationale: Improved understanding of the lung microbiome in HIV-infected individuals could lead to better strategies for diagnosis, therapy, and prophylaxis of HIV-associated pneumonias. Differences in the oral and lung microbiomes in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals are not well defined. Whether highly active antiretroviral therapy influences these microbiomes is unclear.
   Objectives: We determined whether oral and lung microbiomes differed in clinically healthy groups of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects.
   Methods: Participating sites in the Lung HIV Microbiome Project contributed bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing data from oral washes and bronchoalveolar lavages(BALs) obtained from HIV-uninfected individuals (n = 86), HIV-infected individuals who were treatment naive (n = 18), and HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (n = 38).
   Measurements and Main Results: Microbial populations differed in the oral washes among the subject groups (Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Rothia, and Atopobium), but there were no individual taxa that differed among the BALs. Comparison of oral washes and BALs demonstrated similar patterns from HIV-uninfected individuals and HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy, with multiple taxa differing in abundance. The pattern observed from HIV-infected individuals who were treatment naive differed from the other two groups, with differences limited to Veillonella, Rothia, and Granulicatella. CD4 cell counts did not influence the oral or BAL microbiome in these relatively healthy, HIV-infected subjects.
   Conclusions: The overall similarity of the microbiomes in participants with and without HIV infection was unexpected, because HIV-infected individuals with relatively preserved CD4 cell counts are at higher risk for lower respiratory tract infections, indicating impaired local immune function.

AB Rationale: Microbiome studies typically focus on bacteria, but fungal species are Common in many body sites and can have profound effects on the host. Wide gaps exist in the understanding of the fungal microbiome (mycobiome) and its relationship to lung disease.
   Objectives: To characterize the mycobiome at different respiratory tract levels in persons with and without HIV infection and in HIV-infected individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Methods: Oral washes (OW), induced sputa (IS), and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were collected from 56 participants. We performed 18S and internal transcribed spacer sequencing and used the neutral model to identify fungal species that are likely residents of the lung. We used ubiquity ubiquity plots, random forest, logistic regression, and metastats to compare fungal communities by HIV status and presence of COPD.
   Measurements and Main Results: Mycobiomes of OW, IS, and BAL shared common organisms, but each also had distinct members. Candida was dominant in OW and IS, but BAL had 39 fungal species that were disproportionately more abundant than in the OW. Fungal communities in BAL differed significantly by HIV status and by COPD, with Pneumocystis jirovecii significantly overrepresented in both groups. Other fungal species were also identified as differing in HIV and COPD.
   Conclusions: This study systematically examined the respiratory tract mycobiome in a relatively large group. By identifying Pneumocystis and other fungal species as overrepresented in the lung in HIV and in COPD, it is the first to determine alterations in fungal communities associated with lung dysfunction and/or HIV, highlighting the clinical relevance of these findings.

AB Secondary forests and monoculture plantations are widespread in the tropics and are the two most common forms of reforestation. To assess the value of both systems for CO2 mitigation, we performed a systematic analysis of the two systems comparing growth rates and potential to store carbon. The increasing involvement of these forest types in carbon trading makes a pertinent issue. We used a meta-analytical approach to evaluate relative rates of aboveground growth (biomass accumulation) in secondary forests and monoculture plantations, controlling for climate and site characteristics. We find a general tendency for aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) to be marginally higher in plantations than secondary forests. Three recorded site factors were significantly associated with ABA, but differed between reforestation types. Plantation growth rates were negatively correlated with precipitation seasonality, while growth rates of secondary forest were positively correlated with surrounding tree cover and negatively correlated with duration of prior land use. It is noteworthy that poor reporting of site history such as prior land-use duration, particularly in monoculture plantations, and a strong bias in studies towards measuring young forest plots obfuscates evaluation of some ecological drivers and long-term processes. We conclude that the difference in ABA between tropical secondary forests and monoculture plantations is smaller than previously assumed, emphasising the potential of secondary forests for low-cost carbon storage and biomass production, particularly in landscapes with high existing tree cover or highly seasonal rainfall.

AB Size frequency distributions of canopy gaps are a hallmark of forest dynamics. But it remains unknown whether legacies of forest disturbance are influencing vertical size structure of landscapes, or space-filling in the canopy volume. We used data from LiDAR remote sensing to quantify distributions of canopy height and sizes of 434 501 canopy gaps in five tropical rain forest landscapes in Costa Rica and Hawaii. The sites represented a wide range of variation in structure and natural disturbance history, from canopy gap dynamics in lowland Costa Rica and Hawaii, to stages and types of stand-level dieback on upland Mauna Kea and Kohala volcanoes. Large differences in vertical canopy structure characterized these five tropical rain forest landscapes, some of which were related to known disturbance events. Although there were quantitative differences in the values of scaling exponents within and among sites, size frequency distributions of canopy gaps followed power laws at all sites and in all canopy height classes. Scaling relationships in gap size at different heights in the canopy were qualitatively similar at all sites, revealing a remarkable similarity despite clearly defined differences in species composition and modes of prevailing disturbance. These findings indicate that power-law gap-size frequency distributions are ubiquitous features of these five tropical rain forest landscapes, and suggest that mechanisms of forest disturbance may be secondary to other processes in determining vertical and horizontal size structure in canopies.

AB Trees forage for light through optimal leaf display. Effective leaf display is determined by metamer traits (i.e., the internode, petiole, and corresponding leaf), and thus these traits strongly co-determine carbon gain and as a result competitive advantage in a light-limited environment. We examined 11 metamer traits of sun and shade trees of 38 coexisting moist forest tree species and determined the relative strengths of intra- and interspecific variation. Species-specific metamer traits were related to two variables that represent important life history variation; the regeneration light requirements and average leaf size of the species. Metamer traits varied strongly across species and, in contrast to our expectation, showed only modest changes in response to light. Intra- and interspecific responses to light were only congruent for a third of the traits evaluated. Four traits, amongst which leaf size, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf area ratio at the metamer level (LAR) showed even opposite intra- and interspecific responses to light. Strikingly, these are classic traits that are thought to be of paramount importance for plant performance but that have completely different consequences within and across species. Sun trees of a given species had small leaves to reduce the heat load, but light-demanding species had large leaves compared to shade-tolerants, probably to outcompete their neighbors. Shade trees of a given species had a high SLA and LAR to capture more light in a light-limited environment, whereas shade-tolerant species have well-protected leaves with a low SLA compared to light-demanding species, probably to deter herbivores and enhance leaf lifespan. There was a leaf-size-mediated trade-off between biomechanical and hydraulic safety, and the efficiency with which species can space their leaves and forage for light. Unexpectedly, metamer traits were more closely linked to leaf size than to regeneration light requirements, probably because leaf-size-related biomechanical and vascular constraints limit the trait combinations that are physically possible. This suggests that the leaf size spectrum overrules more subtle variation caused by the leaf economics spectrum, and that leaf size represents a more important strategy axis than previously thought.

ID RESTORATION
AB In Costa Rica, most reforestation trials with native species were established in the tropical humid regions. In the dry tropics, research on the performance of native species in forest plantations is incipient and trials comparing pure and mixed designs are limited. This paper presents the results of two experimental plantations with native trees in pure and mixed plots in the dry tropics of Costa Rica. The growth and productivity of 13 native species in pure and mixed plantations was compared with Tectona grandis (L.f.) Lam., an exotic species broadly used in the region. In a plantation of relatively slower growing species, measurements taken at 68 months of age resulted in Samanea saman (Jacq.) Merril. and Dalbergia retusa Hemsl. demonstrating the best growth, followed by Astronium graveolens Jacq. and Swietenia macrophylla King. Measurements in a plantation of relatively faster growing species, at 68 months of age, showed that growth of Schizolobium parahyba (Vell.) Blake was greatest in the pure and mixed plots, followed by Terminalia oblonga (Ruiz & Pav.) Steud., Anarcadium excelsum (Bert. & Balb. ex Kunth) Skeels and Pseudosamanea guachapele (Kunth) Harms. The native species grew better in the mixed plots. The pure plots of T grandis (L.f.) Lam. were the most productive, compared to all species and the mixture of species. Plantations of T grandis (L.f.) Lam. seem to be well adapted to the region and are certainly a commercially interesting alternative. Nevertheless, mixed plantations with native species would contribute more to sustainable management, because while single-species plantations do not provide a great range of goods and services when compared to the natural forest, mixed plantations are likely to increase this range of benefits.

AB Forests and savannas are the major ecotypes in humid tropical regions. Under present climatic conditions, forest is in a phase of natural expansion over savanna, but traditional human activities, especially fires, have strongly influenced the succession. We here present a new model, FORSAT, dedicated to the forest-savanna mosaic on a landscape scale and based on stochastic modelling of key processes (fire and succession cycle) and consistent with common field data. The model is validated by comparison between the qualitative emergent behaviour of the model and results of biogeographical field studies. Three types of forest succession are shown: progression of the forest edge, fort-nation and coalescence of clumps in savanna and global afforestation of savanna. The parameters (frequency of savanna fires, climate and soil fertility) appear to have comparable effects and there is a sharp threshold between a forest edge progression scenario and the cluster formation one. Moreover, pioneer seed dispersal pattern and recruitment are determinant: peaked curves near a seed source and far dispersal combine to increase the fitness of the pioneers. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB 1 Primate frugivores are important seed dispersers for a large fraction of tree species in many tropical forests. The movement, diet preferences and defecation patterns produced by primates may therefore strongly influence seed dispersion patterns and seedling recruitment success. Here we examine the pattern of seed dispersal generated by white-faced monkeys (Cebus capucinus ) in relation to adult tree distribution in the 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama.
   2 Diet breadth of Cebus was remarkably wide. Over four months they consumed fruits of 95 out of an estimated 240 species available. Seeds of 67 species passed intact through the gut and 28 were spat out.
   3 Dispersal effectiveness of Cebus was also high. Two Cebus groups on average spent < 10 min feeding in individual trees, had large home ranges (> 150 ha), travelled 1-3 km day(-1) and defecated seeds in small clumps throughout the day.
   4 Mean dispersal distance of ingested seeds was 216 m (range 20-844 m), with the highest probability of dispersal 100-200 m from the parent plant. For six of nine species studied, the distance between defecation sites and nearest conspecific adults of seeds in faeces was not significantly different from random expectations.
   5 The scattered dispersal pattern produced by Cebus suggests that this species contributes relatively little to dispersal limitation (sensu Nathan & Muller-Landau 2000) compared to other dispersers in the community. Long-distance dispersal by Cebus resulted in substantial movement of seeds in and out of the 50 ha plot, and suggests that inverse modelling procedures to estimate dispersal functions from trap data may not adequately describe dispersal patterns generated by this primate.

The objectives were to (1) determine intraspecific variation in phenology between sites in different geographic locations with different precipitation regimes, (2) compare interspecific phenological patterns within sites during one year, and (3) document seasonal pollinator use of floral resources at one site in relation to the flowering phenology of these species. To determine the sequence of phenological events in trees of the family Bombacaceae across three study sites, phenology of marked individuals was recorded every 2 wk from September 2000 through August 2001 for six species. To estimate the importance of bombacaceous species in the diet of nectarivorous bats, pollen samples were collected from the bodies or feces of bats once every 2 wk during flowering. Our study suggests that phenological patterns of the Bombacaceae family in Neotropical dry forests are mainly constrained by phylogenetic membership and adaptive selective pressures associated with competition for pollinators. Abiotic factors related to precipitation and soil water content appear to be regulating leaf flushing and abscission, but the principal causes of flowering are related to ultimate factors associated with competition for pollinators. This study is the first that evaluates the phenological pattern of species and genera of the same family at different latitudes in a similar life zone.

AB The Tierras Bajas is an area of 20,000 km(2) of lowland deciduous forest in eastern Santa Cruz, Bolivia, that has undergone rapid change during the past two decades. As part of the largest remaining area of intact deciduous tropical forest in the world, it has been nominated a priority area for conservation by several environmental organization. We quantified the spatial and temporal patterns of deforestation in the area by digital processing of high-resolution satellite imagery from 1975 thru 1998. The estimated rate of deforestation was among the highest in the world for such a limited area, ranging from 160 km(2)/year in the early 1980s to almost 1200 km(2)/year in the late 1990s. Although most deforestation up to 1983 was in Bolivian peasant and Mennonite colonies, most deforestation after 1984 was in non-Mennonite industrial soybean farms. The level of fragmentation of uncut forest, caused by the spatial patterns of deforestation, also differed among these broad land-use types. Deforestation is planned and spontaneous peasant colonies was complex in shape, forming relatively large areas of edge-affected forest, whereas that in Mennonite and other industrial farms was in large, rectangular increments, creating relatively less edge. But the distribution of these farms and the practice of initially clearing around the peripheries of properties resulted in the isolation of large areas of forest. In 1998 four-fifths of the remaining forest were either within 1 km of a clearance edge or in isolated fragments of <50 km(2). Compared with deforested area, the areas of isolated and edge-affected forest were disproportionately large during the early stages of frontier colonization. These results imply that if the fragmentation effects of deforestation are to be minimized, conservation planning must occur at the earliest stages of frontier development.

AB The diet of feral cats (Felis catus) was studied at Lake Burrendong, central-eastern New South Wales, from July 1994 to June 1997. Mammals were the major prey in 499 scats that were analysed. Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were the staple prey, while carrion was an important secondary food. Invertebrates, other mammalian prey, vegetation, birds and reptiles were generally minor components of the diet. Few significant seasonal differences in diet were found; however, invertebrates contributed less and possums more to the diet in winter and summer respectively. A significant dietary response was found to changes in rabbit abundance, but not for the other prey types. Cats continued to prey heavily on rabbits even after a 90% decline in rabbit abundance occurred, which coincided with the advent of Rabbit Calicivirus Disease (RCD). House mice (Mus domesticus) increased in importance in the diet ten months post-RCD. Although the abundance of cats was correlated with the abundance of some prey species, other factors may have influenced the observed patterns; these are discussed.

ID COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PREY; PREDATION; WISCONSIN; PATTERNS; AREA
AB We quantified the spatial heterogeneity in nearshore fish community composition within six Wisconsin lakes and examined its relation to habitat heterogeneity and species diversity. Fish abundance was estimated annually (1981-84) using seines at six sites in each lake. Substrate type, macrophyte growth form, and depth gradient were noted at each site. Species richness was estimated as the expected number of species when the number of individuals was held constant over lakes (rarefaction). Fish community spatial heterogeneity (the average percent dissimilarity in fish species composition over all possible pairs of seine sites within a lake) differed among lakes; it was positively correlated with within-lake variation in the depth gradient and with species diversity as estimated by rarefaction. We tested whether differences in community spatial heterogeneity among lakes resulted simply from differences in species diversity using a randomization test based on random permutations of the rows (seine hauls) in the species composition data matrix. Lakes differed in the extent to which the observed community heterogeneity exceeded the randomization results. Spatial heterogeneity of the fish community, as opposed to sampling phenomena resulting from differences in richness, was a strong factor in some lakes.

AB The potential impacts of payments for environmental services (PES) and protected areas (PAs) on environmental outcomes and local livelihoods in developing countries are contentious and have been widely debated. The available evidence is sparse, with few rigorous evaluations of the environmental and social impacts of PAs and particularly of PES. We measured the impacts on forests and human well-being of three different PES programs instituted within two PAs in northern Cambodia, using a panel of intervention villages and matched controls. Both PES and PAs delivered additional environmental outcomes relative to the counterfactual: reducing deforestation rates significantly relative to controls. PAs increased security of access to land and forest resources for local households, benefiting forest resource users but restricting households' ability to expand and diversify their agriculture. The impacts of PES on household well-being were related to the magnitude of the payments provided. The two higher paying market-linked PES programs had significant positive impacts, whereas a lower paying program that targeted biodiversity protection had no detectable effect on livelihoods, despite its positive environmental outcomes. Households that signed up for the higher paying PES programs, however, typically needed more capital assets; hence, they were less poor and more food secure than other villagers. Therefore, whereas the impacts of PAs on household well-being were limited overall and varied between livelihood strategies, the PES programs had significant positive impacts on livelihoods for those that could afford to participate. Our results are consistent with theories that PES, when designed appropriately, can be a powerful new tool for delivering conservation goals whilst benefiting local people.
   El Impacto de los Pagos por Servicios Ambientales y areas Protegidas sobre la Subsistencia Local y la Conservacion del Bosque en el Norte de Camboya Los impactos potenciales de los pagos por servicios ambientales (PSA) y areas protegidas (APs) sobre los resultados ambientales y las subsistencias locales en los paises en desarrollo son polemicos y se han debatido ampliamente. La evidencia disponible es escasa; ha habido pocas evaluaciones rigurosas de los impactos ambientales y sociales de las APs y particularmente los PSA. Medimos el impacto sobre los bosques y el bienestar humano en tres diferentes programas de PSA que se llevan a cabo dentro de dos APs en el norte de Camboya usando un panel de aldeas de intervencion y controles emparejados. Tanto los PSA como las APs brindaron resultados ambientales adicionales en relacion a los contrafacticos, esto quiere decir que redujeron las tasas de deforestacion significativamente en relacion a los controles. Las areas protegidas incrementaron el acceso seguro a los recursos del suelo y el bosque para las viviendas locales, beneficiando a los usuarios de los recursos del bosque pero restringiendo la habilidad de las viviendas para expandirse y diversificar su agricultura. Los impactos de los pagos por servicios ambientales sobre el bienestar de las viviendas estuvieron relacionados con la magnitud de los pagos proporcionados. Los dos programas de PSA de mayor paga y con conexion al mercado tuvieron impactos positivos significativos, mientras que un programa de menor paga con el objetivo de proteger a la biodiversidad no tuvo un efecto detectable sobre las viviendas, a pesar de sus resultados ambientales positivos. Las viviendas que se inscribieron a los programas de PSA con mayor paga, sin embargo, necesitaban tipicamente mas bienes capitales, por lo que eran menos pobres y tenian mayor seguridad alimentaria que otros aldeanos. Por esto, mientras los impactos de las APs sobre el bienestar de las viviendas fueron limitados en general y variaron dependiendo de las estrategias de subsistencia, los programas de PSA tuvieron impactos positivos significativos sobre las viviendas para aquellos que podian costear participar. Nuestros resultados son congruentes con las teorias de que los PSA, cuando se designan apropiadamente, pueden ser una herramienta poderosa y novedosa para obtener objetivos de conservacion mientras se beneficia a la gente local.

AB Forested tropical landscapes around the world are being extensively logged and converted to agriculture, with serious consequences for biodiversity and potentially ecosystem functioning. Here we investigate associations between habitat disturbance and functional diversity of ants and termites-two numerically dominant and functionally important taxa in tropical rain forests that perform key roles in predation, decomposition, nutrient cycling and seed dispersal. We compared ant and termite occurrence and composition within standardised volumes of soil and dead wood in old growth forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Termites occurred substantially less frequently in converted habitats than in old growth forest, whereas ant occurrences were highest in logged forest and lowest in old growth forest. All termite feeding groups had low occurrence in disturbed habitats, with soil feeders occurring even less frequently than wood feeders. Ant functional groups showed more variable associations, with some opportunist and behaviourally dominant groups being more abundant in degraded habitats. The importance of ants and termites in tropical ecosystems and such differing patterns of assemblage variation suggest that ecosystem functioning may be significantly altered in converted habitats.

ID DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE; FAIRNESS; RATIONALITY; PERCEPTIONS; RECOGNITION;
   KNOWLEDGE
AB Distribution and procedure, two core social justice concepts, are central concerns for the design and practice of payments for ecosystem services (PESs). This paper explores the relationship between local conceptions of justice and the more globally referenced justice principles embedded in the design of PES schemes. The importance of this is that perceptions of justness are powerful determinants of human behaviour and, consequently, many environmental conflicts arise from contested visions of what constitutes 'just' environmental management. With that in mind we propose that PES schemes built on conceptions of justice that broadly align with those of prospective service providers will be better received than those that do not. In order to explore differences in justice conceptions, we specify three commonly defined dimensions of environmental justice: distribution, procedure and recognition. We predict that there will be differences in the importance different actors place on these different dimensions of justice and also differences in how each particular dimension is conceived. We interview 80 randomly selected respondents from a PES case in Rwanda and relate their views about justice to the design of the PFS. Our findings challenge the implicit universalism in many market-based conservation interventions: that imposed framings of justice will resonate with local ones. They also challenge the assumption that different dimensions of justice are always mutually supporting - the fallacy of the rising tide that lifts all boats. We also conclude that an environmental justice framing provides a fruitful new analytical approach for research into global forest conservation efforts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Warming, watering and elevated atmospheric CO2-concentration effects have been extensively studied separately; however, their combined impact on plants is not well understood. In the current research, we examined plant growth and physiological responses of three dominant species from the Eurasian Steppe with different functional traits to a combination of elevated CO2, high temperature, and four simulated precipitation patterns. Elevated CO2 stimulated plant growth by 10.8-41.7 % for a C-3 leguminous shrub, Caragana microphylla, and by 33.2-52.3 % for a C-3 grass, Stipa grandis, across all temperature and watering treatments. Elevated CO2, however, did not affect plant biomass of a C-4 grass, Cleistogenes squarrosa, under normal or increased precipitation, whereas a 20.0-69.7 % stimulation of growth occurred with elevated CO2 under drought conditions. Plant growth was enhanced in the C-3 shrub and the C-4 grass by warming under normal precipitation, but declined drastically with severe drought. The effects of elevated CO2 on leaf traits, biomass allocation and photosynthetic potential were remarkably species-dependent. Suppression of photosynthetic activity, and enhancement of cell peroxidation by a combination of warming and severe drought, were partly alleviated by elevated CO2. The relationships between plant functional traits and physiological activities and their responses to climate change were discussed. The present results suggested that the response to CO2 enrichment may strongly depend on the response of specific species under varying patterns of precipitation, with or without warming, highlighting that individual species and multifactor dependencies must be considered in a projection of terrestrial ecosystem response to climatic change.

AB We use under-explored municipality level datasets to assess the recent economic and policy determinants of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. We estimate yearly panel data models (from 2002 to 2009) for 663 municipalities in the region. The results show that recent deforestation is increasing with economic activity and is also affected by economic incentives, measured by fluctuations in agricultural product and wood prices. Moreover, we document that the increasing enforcement efforts of the Brazilian environmental police (IBAMA) were effective in reducing deforestation rates.

AB The role of fire and climate in determining savanna and forest distributions requires comprehensive theoretical reevaluation. Empirical studies show that climate constrains maximum tree cover and that fire feedbacks can reduce tree cover substantially, but neither the stability nor the dynamics of these systems are well understood. A theoretical integration of rainfall effects with fire processes in particular is lacking. We use simple, well-supported assumptions about the percolation dynamics of fire spread and the demographic effects of climate and fire on trees to build a dynamic model examining the stability of tree cover in savannas and forests. Fire results in the potential for one or possibly two stable equilibria, while the effects of increasing rainfall on tree demography result in (discontinuous) increases in tree cover and in forest tree dominance. As rainfall increases, the system moves from (1) stable low tree cover to (2) bistability of low and high tree cover to (3) stable high tree cover. Thus, theory suggests that tree cover uniquely determined by climate at low and high rainfall but determined by fire feedbacks at intermediate rainfall-as empirical studies suggest-may be a universal feature of systems where fire has strong effects on tree demography.

AB Across the deforestation frontier in eastern Amazonia, we examined the relationship between edge-related forest desiccation and deforestation patterns using remote-sensing techniques. Canopy-moisture levels were estimated over an eight-year period in three study sites that encompassed similar to 100,000 km(2) in area. We found four main effects of deforestation on dry-season canopy desiccation. First, intact forests showed no detectable change in canopy water content whereas forests adjacent to clearings showed significant water loss. Second, the distance to which edge-related desiccation penetrated into forest interiors varied among landscapes with differing forest loss and fragmentation. In moderately fragmented landscapes (with 65% and 51% remaining forest cover), canopy desiccation extended 1-1.5 km into forest interiors, whereas in heavily fragmented landscapes (20% forest cover) desiccation penetrated up to 2.7 km into forests. Third, the magnitude of edge-related desiccation varied among landscapes with differing fragmentation. Moderately fragmented landscapes exhibited a greater magnitude of change in canopy-water loss over the first 1 km from an edge than did heavily fragmented landscapes. Finally, forest desiccation penetrated further into forests over time in the moderately fragmented landscapes, but not in the heavily fragmented landscape, where edge-related desiccation had evidently 'saturated' remaining forests. We conclude that protracted dry seasons will have far more serious effects on fragmented than intact rainforests, with the former becoming highly vulnerable to destructive fires. With similar to 30,000 km of new forest edge being created annually in Brazilian Amazonia, these finding have serious implications for forest conservation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Large tree species have a disproportional influence on the structure and functioning of tropical forests, but the forces affecting their long-term persistence in human-dominated landscapes remain poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that aging forest edges and small fragments (3.4-295.7 ha) are greatly impoverished in terms of species richness and abundance of large trees in comparison to core areas of forest interior. The study was conducted in a hyper-fragmented landscape of the Atlantic forest, northeast Brazil. Large tree species were quantified by recording all trees (DBH >= 10 cm) within fiftyeight 0.1-ha plots distributed in three forest habitats: small forest fragments (n = 28), forest edges (n = 10), and primary forest interior areas within an exceptional large forest remnant (n = 20). Large tree species and their stems >= 10 cm DBH were reduced by half in forest edges and fragments. Moreover, these edge-affected habitats almost lacked large-stemmed trees altogether (0.24 +/- 0.27% of all stems sampled), and very tall trees were completely absent from forest edges. In contrast, large trees contributed to over 1.5% of the whole stand in forest interior plots (2.9 +/- 2.8%). Habitats also differed in terms of tree architecture: relative to their DBH trees were on average 30% shorter in small fragments and forest edges. Finally, an indicator species analysis yielded an ecological group of 12 large tree species that were significantly associated with forest interior plots, but were completely missing from edge-affected habitats. Our results suggest a persistent and substantial impoverishment of the large-tree stand, including the structural collapse of forest emergent layer, in aging, hyper-fragmented landscapes.

AB The intensity of competition among forest tree seedlings is poorly understood, but has important ramifications for their recruitment and for the maintenance of species diversity. Intense competition among seedlings could allow competitively dominant species to exclude subordinate species. Alternatively, the low density and small stature of forest tree seedlings could preclude intense interseedling competition. In this case, other processes, such as size-asymmetric competition with adults, interactions with consumers, or neutral dynamics would prevail as those structuring the forest understory. We tested the intensity of, and potential for, intraspecific competition among tree seedlings of three species (Brosimum alicastrum, Matisia cordata, and Pouteria reticulata) in two Neotropical rain forests. We reduced stem densities by up to 90 percent and monitored individual growth and survival rates for up to 24 mo. Individual growth and survival rates were generally unrelated to stem density. Contrary to the predicted behavior of intensely competing plant populations, the distribution of individual heights did not become more left-skewed with time for any species, regardless of plot density; i.e., excesses of short, suppressed individuals did not accumulate in high-density plots. We further measured the overlap of zones of influence (ZOIs) to assess the potential for resource competition. Seedling ZOIs overlapped only slightly in extremely dense monodominant plots, and even less in ambient-density plots of mixed composition. Our results thus suggest that interseedling competition was weak. Given the low density of tree seedlings in Neotropical forests, we infer that resource competition among seedlings may be irrelevant to their recruitment.

AB We assessed the effect of native bamboo and lianas on microclimate, tree regeneration and forest structure in a semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest subjected to selective timber extraction during the last century. We hypothetized that bamboo and liana cutting would increase incoming solar radiation in the understory promoting establishment and survival of pioneer and light-requiring canopy tree species. A manipulative experiment consisting of bamboo and liana cutting was performed in a native forest stand in northeastern Argentina. In three permanent 1-ha plots bamboo and lianas were cut and allowed to decompose in situ, while other three plots were used as a control treatment. We measured solar radiation reaching the understory, soil water availability and air temperature in both bamboo and liana cutting and control plots. Tree sapling abundance and richness, stand basal area, bamboo density, and cover of lianas, herbs, shrubs, fallen trees and branches were also determined. We performed multivariate analyses to relate tree sapling abundance and richness with biotic and abiotic factors. Bamboo and liana cutting increased by 100% the solar radiation reaching the understory. The fraction of solar radiation transmitted at 0.7 m height above ground in control and treated plots was 0.1 and 0.2, respectively. Minimum soil matric potentials after a severe dry spell were less than -2 MPa. Soil water availability was higher under closed-canopy in the treated plots because liana transpiration was prevented by cutting. Although bamboo and liana cutting increased incoming solar radiation, tree seedling and sapling abundance of pioneer and light-demanding species was not improved by the treatment. Instead, an increased abundance of herbaceous plants was observed in gaps and open canopy areas (i.e., sites with amounts of herb cover greater than 75% represented the I I and 2% of the total number of sites in treated and control plots, respectively). Sapling survival and growth rates, on the other hand, appeared to be promoted by bamboo and liana cutting. Bamboo inhibited tree sapling abundance and richness in gaps, whereas tree basal area had a positive effect. In the semideciduous Atlantic Forest, native bamboos modify gap phase regeneration, and may affect canopy cover and forest composition in the long term. Post-logging management techniques are needed for sustainable timber production in these forest stands. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable management systems for tropical forests require information on tree growth. Generally, growth rates of commercial tropical tree species are derived from repeated measurements in permanent sample plots. Here, we present an alternative method: the use of tree ring analysis. It has some important advantages over plot studies.
   The aims of this study were (1) to demonstrate how tree ring analysis can be helpful to tropical forest management and (2) to evaluate future timber yields under Bolivian forestry legislation. To this end, we collected stem discs of 17-60 harvested trees of each of four commercial tree species in the Bolivian Amazon and reconstructed their lifetime growth trajectories through ring measurements.
   Using ring analysis, we calculated age estimates of harvested trees and size distributions of potential crop trees for the next harvest. Timber yields at the next harvest were estimated by projecting ingrowth of trees to harvestable sizes during a cutting cycle of 20 years (as set by Bolivian regulations) using the growth data obtained from tree ring analysis. This was done in two ways: by looking forward and project ingrowth in 20 years based on densities of trees below the minimum cutting size ("prospective analysis"), and by looking backwards using densities of trees above the harvest limit to calculate their size 20 years ago ("retrospective analysis"). Both methods yielded low recuperation of initially harvested volume for all four species (generally 20-30%). Thus, initial timber yields of our study species cannot be sustained with a logging cycle of 20 years.
   We discuss the advantages of tree ring analysis over growth rates obtained from permanent sample plot data. First, age estimates are calculated directly - not based on simulations - and are therefore more accurate. Second, growth rates obtained from ring data of canopy trees are representative for those trees that successfully reached the canopy, and do not include the probably slower-growing individuals that are less likely to reach the canopy. Third, the lifetime growth patterns obtained from ring data allow for accurate assessment of variation among trees in long-term growth and incorporating this intra-specific long-term growth variation resulted in higher and more accurate estimates of timber yield.
   Finally, we argue that ring analysis should be added to the toolbox of research methods for tropical forest management, but without substituting the monitoring of permanent sample plots, which provides relevant information on forest structure, damage and growth rates of non-ring forming tree species.

AB Few studies have directly assessed how rapidly functionally important insect communities recover following rain forest loss and fragmentation. In 1986, B. Klein compared the dung and carrion beetle assemblages of clearcuts, fragmented, and non-fragmented forests in central Amazonia, reporting drastic short-term changes in community composition. Fifteen years later, we resampled the same sites using identical techniques and found that, with the regrowth of secondary vegetation between forest fragments, the initial differences had largely disappeared. As the secondary vegetation itself supports dung beetle assemblages similar to those of continuous forest, we conclude that, from the perspective of the dung beetles, the experimentally fragmented area had returned to a continuous state within approximately one decade. These results offer some good news for the conservation of tropical ecosystems, since they suggest that conditions favorable for functionally important arthropods may be quickly restored by secondary regrowth. They also suggest that the preservation of forest fragments and secondary vegetation may provide an important complement to the conservation of intact mature forest.

AB 1. Coffee is produced in tropical regions of the world, largely in Latin America. Coffee cultivation techniques range from traditional systems, where coffee grows under a diverse canopy of shade trees (shade-coffee plantations), to modern systems, where coffee grows without any type of shade (sun-coffee plantations). Shade-coffee plantations provide refuge for forest fauna in otherwise deforested landscapes. The conservation value of these agro-ecosystems depends upon their structural and floristic diversity.
   2. The way coffee producers manage the vegetation, including the epiphytic component, may profoundly affect the value of plantations for conserving biological diversity. Shade-coffee certification programmes have emerged to verify that coffee advertised as 'shade grown' is actually grown on highly biodiverse plantations. Although these programmes universally encourage epiphyte protection from pruning (a common practice), there has been no experimental evaluation of the importance of epiphytes in supporting faunal diversity. We report the effect of experimentally removing epiphytes on the bird assemblage in a shade-coffee farm near Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico.
   3. We established two matching pairs of epiphyte removal and control plots. We compared bird diversity and abundance, based on daily censuses during the breeding and non-breeding season. We used existing information on the way in which birds use epiphytes as foraging and nesting substrates to explain the presence of different species in plots with epiphytes.
   4. Plots without epiphytes tended to be less diverse than plots with epiphytes, but rarefaction analysis and ANOVA showed no significant differences in species richness between treatments in any of the seasons. Mean bird abundance was significantly higher in plots with epiphytes during both seasons, and a multidimensional scaling analysis showed that bird community structure differed between the two treatments.
   5. Eighteen forest bird species were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. Three non-forest species were more common in plots without epiphytes. Resident bird species that used epiphytes as a nesting substrate were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes.
   6. When epiphytes are removed, canopy cover, foraging substrates, nest sites and nest materials are eliminated and microclimatic conditions change. This could increase predation on adult birds and nests, increase intra- and interspecific competition, and decrease individual survivorship.
   7. Synthesis and applications. This is the first experimental assessment of the importance of epiphytes for birds. Shade-coffee plantations with epiphytes maintain higher abundance and diversity of the inhabitant bird fauna than plantations without epiphytes. This study reinforces the value of positive epiphyte management as an important factor in shade-grown coffee certification, where the goal is to promote biodiversity conservation.

AB Seed mass is considered to be an important attribute for the establishment success of plant species being linked with their seed production, establishment, and survival. This meta-analysis shows that seed mass is also closely correlated to growth-related species attributes of the established phase of rain forest tree species, and that the strength of this relationship varies with light conditions. Seed mass is an especially good predictor of species traits under high-light conditions, when the species attain their full growth potential. At high irradiance (>20% of full light) seed mass is negatively correlated with RGR, NAR, LAR, SLA and LMF. At low irradiance (<5% of full light), seed mass is only negatively correlated with LAR and SLA. Correlations between seed mass and morphological traits are therefore strongest at low irradiance where light interception is important. Conversely, correlations between seed mass and a physiological trait are strongest at high irradiance, where maximisation of photosynthetic rates is important. The strength of the correlation between growth parameters and seed mass declines over time, and disappears after 1-4 years. Seed mass appears to be a good proxy for the shade tolerance of tropical tree species, especially at the younger stages of the life cycle.

AB We investigate the ecological status of the standing crop of high-value tree species in coastal scarp forest of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. We compare resource availability, distribution and use in several forests that are under state and community management. Species suitable for harvesting were identified using a simple linear-programming model based on the frequency and scale of regeneration (grain) of the tree species.
   Twenty high-value tree species were widely used. Nine species were apparently over-exploited and absent from community forests. Tree densities were higher in state forests than community forest. Size-class distribution profiles for all species, except Harpephyllum caffrum and Heywoodia lucens, displayed the characteristic inverse J-shaped distribution that generally indicates stable populations. Tree species varied in their spatial scale of recruitment, but were mostly intermediate- to coarse-grained. Two fine-grained species in state forest (Englerophytum natalense and Millettia grandis) and only one species in community forest (E. natalense) had densities that could potentially sustain current levels of exploitation.
   The prevailing tenurial system (i.e. state or community forest), the tree species and category of stem size (dbh) used, all affected tree harvesting off-take levels. Trees in the 10-20 cm diameter size-class (poles) were most harvested. Harvesting levels of pole-sized stems were more influenced by tree size than species, were significantly greater in community than state forests, and could be explained by the closer proximity of households to community ((x) over bar = 1.5 km) than state forests ((x) over bar = 3.2 km). Given the willingness of communities distant from forests to plant multipurpose indigenous trees, there is the potential for strengthening community forestry, and thus rural development, via forestry interventions such as agroforestry. However, the survival of these forests depends on the establishment of suitable integrated community-based institutions and management practices. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High irradiances, high air temperatures and low relative humidities characterize the seasonal savannas of central Brazil, locally known as cerrados. In the present study, we investigated the implications to photoprotection of diurnal adjustments in photochemical and non-photochemical processes in five cerrado woody species that differed in photosynthetic capacity and in the duration and extension of the midday depression of photosynthesis. We also evaluated the contribution of photorespiration to minimize the danger of photoinhibition and the potential carbon costs of the operation of this mechanism in response to changes in irradiance levels. Notwithstanding the large differences in diurnal patterns of photosynthesis and in stomatal conductance. four out of the five species showed a tight common linear relationship between net CO2 assimilation rates and transpiration over the large range of environmental conditions that prevailed during typical sunny days at the end of the rainy season. Large reversible decreases in photochemical efficiency were compensated by proportional increases in non-photochemical processes related to photoprotection, irrespective of the prevailing irradiance levels and degree of stomata closure. Light response curves were used to evaluate the relative contribution of photorespiratory CO2 production to electron flow in response to changes in irradiance levels. A large percentage of the electron flow was used to drive photorespiration in light-saturated leaves. In conclusion, an efficient control of photochemical and non-photochemical quenching and adjustments in the partition of electron flow between assimilative and non-assimilative processes alleviated the danger of photoinhibition. However, the results also Suggest that losses in potential carbon gain because of high photorespiratory cost,, could impose strong limitations on leaf carbon balance of cerrado woody species.

AB The considerable variability found in post-dispersal seed predation and the absence of consistent directional trends (e.g., with reference to seed size) has made it difficult to predict accurately the impact of seed predators on plant communities. We examined the variation attributable to location, seed density and seed burial on the removal of seeds of three tree species: Fraxinus excelsior, Taxus baccata and Ulmus glabra. Experiments were undertaken in five deciduous woodlands in Durham, U.K., and the relative importance of vertebrate and invertebrate seed predators was assessed using selective exclosures. In all five woodlands, seed removal was greatest from treatments to which vertebrates had access, and losses attributable to invertebrates were negligible. Rodents, in particular Apodemus sylvaticus (Muridae) and Clethrionomys glareolus (Cricetidae), were the principal seed consumers in these woodlands. Unidentified vertebrate seed predators (probably birds, rabbits and/or squirrels) appeared to be significant seed removers in three of the five woodlands. Rates of removal differed among the three tree species, increasing in the following order Fraxinus < Taxus < Ulmus but were not related to seed mass. The major effect influencing rates of seed removal was seed burial, which halved rates of seed removal overall. The effect of seed burial was a function of seed size. The larger seeds of Taxus realising little benefit from seed burial whereas encounter of the smaller Ulmus seeds fell by almost two-thirds. Removal was density-dependent for all three species. However, the relative increase in seed encounter through an increase in seed density was a negative function of seed size. This suggests that, for large seeds, the opportunity to escape seed predation via burial or reduced seed density is limited. These results reveal a number of parallels with other studies of post-dispersal predation and identify several generalities regarding the interaction between plants and post-dispersal seed predators. Comparison of the seed predation results with actual seedling distributions suggests that seed predators may influence regeneration of Ulmus glabra but probably play a lesser role in the dynamics of Taxus baccata and Fraxinus excelsior.

AB The relationship between physical factors (principally temperature) and biological factors (herbivory) in structuring mid and low shore communities were investigated on a moderately-exposed tropical rocky shore. Physical stress, as measured by rock surface temperature and evaporation of distilled water, was greatest higher on the shore as a result of increased exposure time. Exclusion of herbivores (by caging) and alteration of physical factors (by shading) caused little visible change in community structure in the mid shore. There was also no difference in community structure between open rock areas and control treatments for experimental manipulations at either shore level. Chlorophyll levels increased in rock chips from treatments at both shore levels that excluded herbivores, but still allowed access to sunlight, indicating a developing biofilm. In the low shore, however, treatments that provided refuge from herbivores and direct sunlight were colonized by barnacles (Balanus amphitrite) and an encrusting alga, Hildenbrandia. There appeared to be an interaction between these factors in structuring the community; removal of herbivores allowed the settlement of barnacles which was greatest in shaded treatments. On Hong Kong shores during the summer months biological interactions are important low on the shore in combination with physical factors. In the mid shore, however, physical factors appear the major structuring agent. Community structure on Hong Kong shores is dictated by seasonal variation in physical factors which mediate the effect of biological factors' such as herbivory.

AB Diaspore (seed and/or fruit) survivorship of 12 species of North Queensland rainforest trees was monitored over a 4 week period in two rainforests on the Atherton Tableland, north Queensland, Australia, with replicated sites in forest interiors, canopy gaps, forest edges and adjacent pastures. General linear modelling was used to estimate the relative importance of forest site, habitat, species and diaspore type on survival.
   The probability of survival varied significantly among species, between habitat, forest and diaspore types. Survival averaged 41.2% at day 28, was greater in one forest (Curtain Fig, 56.1%) than the other (Lamins Hill, 25.3%) and was apparently inversely related to the abundance of rodents. In both forests, survival declined in the order: pasture > > forest edge greater-than-or-equal-to forest interior = canopy gap. A lack of significant difference between the forest interior and canopy gap is consistent with findings in other rainforest sites within Australia, but contrasts with most results from other continents. The study also indicated that diaspore weight was an important intrinsic variable affecting survival, the predators (mostly rodents) taking small to moderately large diaspores rather than the very large ones.

AB The use of Local Environmental Knowledge has been considered as an important strategy for adaptive management in the face of Global Environmental Change. However, the unprecedented rates at which global change occurs may pose a challenge to the adaptive capacity of local knowledge systems. In this paper, we use the concept of the shifting baseline syndrome to examine the limits in the adaptive capacity of the local knowledge of an indigenous society facing rapid ecosystem change. We conducted semi-structured interviews regarding perceptions of change in wildlife populations and in intergenerational transmission of knowledge amongst the Tsimane', a group of hunter-gatherers of Bolivian Amazonia (n = 300 adults in 13 villages). We found that the natural baseline against which the Tsimane' measure ecosystem changes might be shifting with every generation as a result of (a) age-related differences in the perception of change and (b) a decrease in the intergenerational sharing of environmental knowledge. Such findings suggest that local knowledge systems might not change at a rate quick enough to adapt to conditions of rapid ecosystem change, hence potentially compromising the adaptive success of the entire social-ecological system. With the current pace of Global Environmental Change, widening the gap between the temporal rates of on-going ecosystem change and the timescale needed for local knowledge systems to adjust to change, efforts to tackle the shifting baseline syndrome are urgent and critical for those who aim to use Local Environmental Knowledge as a tool for adaptive management.

AB This paper presents findings from a study of seven Payment for Environmental Service (PES) schemes that assessed impacts on livelihoods and implications for the design of incentive mechanisms for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). It focuses on two areas of importance to the local impacts of PES and REDD+ schemes: (i) whether tenure and wealth filter access to schemes by local resource users and managers and (ii) how the design of contracts and the configuration of payments and other benefits impact local livelihoods and the sustainability of schemes. The PES schemes reviewed occurred on land falling under diverse tenure arrangements. Full ownership rights were not a prerequisite for PES agreements, but the criteria for selecting the location and participants for schemes were important access determinants. The schemes did provide some benefits to participants, generating a small amount of additional income to participating households and investments in community infrastructure and services where payments were made to community bodies. However, payments were often well below the opportunity costs faced by participants over the life of the scheme, which could diminish positive impacts on local livelihoods and ultimately undermine the sustainability of such schemes. Passing on transaction and monitoring costs from intermediaries to participants also reduced the flow of benefits to local actors. In addition, payment schedules often did not cover the full duration of the PES contract, which diminished the likely sustainability and conditionality of the schemes. Such factors will have to be clearly addressed in the design of REDD+ schemes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Payments for Environmental Services (PES) is gaining recognition worldwide as a serious option for conservation of ecosystems, as well as potentially improving the livelihoods of people providing environmental services. However, little attention has been paid to research on views of local people in their potential roles as service providers. In this research we explore perspectives of poor people living in a National Park in Vietnam, where introduction of PES is being considered. In-depth interviews and workshops were conducted - with strong emphasis on the use of visual techniques, to help facilitate learning processes and provide insight into local perspectives. From the research, two models were developed to indicate general factors that influence the likelihood of people adopting, and adhering to, PES schemes. We suggest these models can be used to guide the design of PES. Our findings also reveal three main requirements important in design of pro-poor PES: (1) Thorough scoping studies for ensuring that schemes are based on sound understanding of potential providers' perspectives and context. (2) Such studies should emphasise qualitative research and draw on participatory tools, to facilitate open dialogue and co-learning by researchers and participants. (3) Policy makers should consider designing hybridized schemes, i.e., in which PES concepts are combined with integrated conservation and development. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oil palm plantations today cover large areas of former tropical lowland rain forest in Southeast Asia and are rapidly expanding on the island of Borneo. Study of the community of ground-dwelling ants in different plantations in Sabah, Malaysia, over 2 years using tuna baiting, revealed that the oil palm plantation ground ant community was severely reduced in species richness in comparison to the forest interior, regardless of age, undergrowth cover, or proximity to neighbouring forest. The results indicate that oil palm plantation habitats, now covering more than 15% of Sabah's land area, can sustain only about 5% of the ground-dwelling ant species of the forest interior. Nine of the 23 ant species baited in the plantations were never recorded inside forest. All numerically dominant ants were non-forest species. The most common species was Anoplolepis gracilipes, an invasive species present at 70% of all bait sites and known to cause 'ecological meltdowns' in other situations. The low frequency and species number of forest ground ants indicates that oil palm plantations act as effective dispersal barriers leading to community isolation in rain forest remnants. The replacement of natural forests with oil palm plantations poses a serious threat to the conservation of biodiversity on Borneo if similar results are confirmed in other taxa.

AB Reduced pollination success, as a function of habitat loss and fragmentation, appears to be a global phenomenon. Disruption of pollinator movement is one hypothesis put forward to explain this pattern in pollen limitation. However, the small size of pollinators makes them very difficult to track; thus, knowledge of their movements is largely speculative. Using tiny radio transmitters (0.25 g), we translocated a generalist tropical 'trap-lining' hummingbird, the green hermit (Phaethornis guy), across agricultural and forested landscapes to test the hypothesis that movement is influenced by patterns of deforestation. Although, we found no difference in homing times between landscape types, return paths were on average 459+/-144 m (+/-s.e.) more direct in forested than agricultural landscapes. In addition, movement paths in agricultural landscapes contained 36+/-4 per cent more forest than the most direct route. Our findings suggest that this species can circumvent agricultural matrix to move among forest patches. Nevertheless, it is clear that movement of even a highly mobile species is strongly influenced by landscape disturbance. Maintaining landscape connectivity with forest corridors may be important for enhancing movement, and thus in facilitating pollen transfer.

AB Anthropogenic disturbances such as fragmentation are rapidly altering biodiversity, yet a lack of attention to species traits and abundance patterns has made the results of most studies difficult to generalize. We determined traits of extinction-prone species and persent a novel strategy for classifying species according to their population-level response to a gradient of disturbance intensity. We examined the effects of forest fragmentation on dung beetle communities in an archipelago of 33 islands recently created by flooding in Venezuela. Species richness, density, and biomass all declined sharply with decreasing island area and increasing island isolation. Species richness was highly nested, indicating, that local extinctions occurred monrandomly. The most sensitive dung beetle species appeared to require at least 85 ha of forest, more Man many large vertebrates. Extinction-prone species were either large-bodied, forest specialists, or uncommon. These explanatory variables were unrelated, suggesting at least 3 underlying causes of extirpation. Large species showed high wing loading (body mass/wing area) and a distinct flight strategy that may increase their area requirements. Although forest specificity made most species sensitive to fragmentation, a few persistent habitat generalists dispersed across the matrix. Density functions classified species into 4 response groups on The basis of their change in density with decreasing species richness. Sensitive and persistent species both declined with increasing fragmentation intensity, but persistent species occurred on more islands, which may be due to their higher baseline densities. Compensatory species increased in abundance following the initial loss of sensitive species, but rapidly declined with increasing fragmentation. Supertramp species (widespread habitat generalists) may be poor competitors but strong dispersers; their abundance peaked following the decline of the other 3 groups. Nevertheless, even the least sensitive species were extirpated or rare on the smallest and most isolated islands.

AB The effects of anthropogenic disturbances on forest structure and plant diversity of secondary forest ecosystems were evaluated based on the classification by site factors in the montane regions of northeastern China. Forty-five sample plots containing 720 sub-plots of overstory species (8 m x 8 m), 1,440 quadrats of understory species (2 m x 2 m), and 1,440 quadrats of herbaceous layer species (1 m x 1 m) were clustered into five groups (G1, G2, G3, G4 and G5) by site variables with Hierarchical Cluster Analysis. Meanwhile, the disturbance levels corresponding to the five groups were determined according to the factors influencing human disturbances (D0-G2, D1-G1, D2-G3, D3-G5, and D4-G4). Species diversities of overstory, understory, herbaceous layer and overall species were evaluated using species number, Margalef index, Pielou index, Shannon-Wiener index, and Simpson index; and beta-diversities (Whittaker index, Cody index). Basal area of stands exhibited a decreasing trend along the disturbance level due to a gradual increase in the extraction of timber by the human disturbances. The indices of species diversity suggested that overstory and understory species were distributed evenly among the groups or disturbance levels. There were no absolutely dominant tree species in the secondary forest ecosystems. The differences in site factors and the current disturbance intensities were not intense enough to lead to loose changes in overstory and understory species. The species diversity indices exhibited the maximum values at D3 (G5) for herbaceous layer species; this may suggest that the current disturbance intensities were intense enough to lead the changes of herbaceous layer species. Three rare and endangered species (Juglans mandshurica, Fraxinus mandshurica and Acanthopanax senticosus) were found within the secondary forests. These rare and endangered species appeared in each clustered group or disturbance level, which suggested that the current disturbance intensity in the study area was not strong enough to influence the distribution of rare and endangered species. The current disturbances in the secondary forests may not lead to a decrease in stability and complexity of the overstory and understory species, but the higher disturbance level may be intense enough to change the habitat fitness for the herbaceous species.

AB In many tropical countries forest fragmentation caused by changes in human land use activities is of primary concern for sustainability. In Malaysia this relationship is usually described without any quantitative measurement to show the implications for land use planning and management. To understand this relationship, this study developed a single forest fragmentation index based on a combination of three landscape metrics, i.e., non-forest area, forest edge bordered by human land use and patch size coefficient of variation, using the state of Selangor, Malaysia as a case study. Two defined natural landscapes; wetland and forest landscapes were used as a basic unit of analyses of pattern change of forest fragmentation and its relationship to human land use in three temporal years of 1966, 1981 and 1995. Results showed that forest fragmentation in the state of Selangor generally increased during the time periods studied. Multiple regression analysis showed that human land use is an important determinant of forest fragmentation, but the significance of several land uses as explanatory variables to forest fragmentation changed temporally. Oil palm and rubber plantations were apparently the major contributors to forest fragmentation. Differences in fragmentation pattern occurred between the two natural landscapes. Forest fragmentation increased in the wetland landscape, whereas not much change was observed in the forest landscape. Oil palm plantation appeared to be the major contributor to forest fragmentation in the wetland landscape, whereas rubber plantation was the major factor in the forest landscape. This study also revealed that knowledge of forest fragmentation through a single index in different natural landscapes provides a pathway for identifying which forested areas are highly threatened and must be given priority in strategic planning of nature conservation. In conclusion, it is vital to understand the relationship between changes in human land use and degree of forest degradation measured by a single index in order to describe the implications for land use planning and management.

AB Seeds from tropical fruiting trees ingested and defecated on the soil surface by primary dispersers (such as primates) are vulnerable to destruction from rodents, insects, and fungi. Burial by dung beetles as an incidental result of their feeding and nesting activities often provides these seeds with refugia from attack. To examine the effect of habitat disturbance on the dung beetle communities involved in this process, I surveyed dung beetles at three sites in the Amazon basin, in the states of Para, Amazonas, and Rondonia, Brazil Through principal component analysis on measurements of size and behavioral characters of beetles, I determined the relative quality of beetle species as seed dispersers (dispersal defined as horizontal or vertical movement of seeds) and ranked them into seed dispersal guilds, I used correspondence analysis to examine in what habitats (primary forest or varying degrees of disturbed habitat) these guilds were abundant. Most guilds decreased with increasing habitat disturbance, but one guild made up of large nocturnal burrowers (primarily Dichotomius) became more abundant with increasing disturbance (up to the level of highest disturbance surveyed), at which point all dung beetle species became scarce. Clear-cuts had lower species richness, lower abundance, and lower biomass than forested areas. These results imply char clear-cutting is detrimental to all seed dispersal dynamics in tropical rain forests, but that some levels of disturbance allow enough disperser activity to preserve this ecosystem function.

AB Species responses to disturbance (mortality of dominant individuals within a community) influence many aspects of that ecological community. To trace the responses of vegetation to one particular type of disturbance, I sampled vegetation in 250 canopy gaps in 1976/1977, 1983, and 1990/1991. These gaps were located in three sites in the southern Appalachians of eastern North America: Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Walker Cove Research Natural Area, and Joyce Kilmer Wilderness Area. Each gap was sampled thrice for sapling composition (stems greater than or equal to 1 cm in diameter at breast height). Additional measurements included the extension growth of border trees into the gap, recent mortality rates of border trees, deterioration rates of gas makers that had been standing dead in earlier samples, and the composition of understory plots.
   The mean extension (branch) growth of border trees was 12 cm/yr, with slower growth by longer branches. Gap makers that had been tall stumps tended to deteriorate, although 35% stayed intact over the 14 yr of the study. Border-tree mortality averaged 0.60%/yr, with higher rates for larger stems and with much interspecific variation.
   Stem density of saplings in gaps increased during the first sampling interval and decreased during the second as self-thinning counteracted increased establishment. Basal area increased during both sampling intervals. The death of border trees increased basal area per unit gap area.
   The four main species (Acer saccharum, Tsuga canadensis, Fagus grandifolia, and Halesia carolina) showed different patterns of correlation to gap size and age. Species in general showed more correlations with gap age for the first sample than afterwards; gap size was more consistently related to species importance. Species patterns also were affected by the presence or absence of border-tree mortality. The stands studied seem nearly at equilibrium. Some small changes are likely to occur, but the species present dominated all size classes: gap saplings, border trees, other canopy trees not related to gaps, and understory saplings. Species differed in their relative growth rates in the understory and in gaps of different sizes. Species also differed in their survival rates in the understory and in the canopy.

AB Relationships between ornithophilous flowers and hummingbirds have been little studied in southern South America, where hummingbird species richness is low. We studied an ornithophilous flower assemblage and the hummingbird pollinators in a montane forest in southeastern Brazil. Twenty-three native hummingbird-pollinated plant species in 21 genera and 14 families were observed. Bromeliaceae, Fabaceae, Gesneriaceae, and Lobeliaceae are represented by more than one species within the assemblage. Flower shapes vary from narrow tube to bowl-shape, but tubular flowers prevail. The variety of flower shapes and sizes results in diverse pollen placement on the body parts of hummingbird visitors, although pollen is deposited mostly on the bill. Sugar concentration in nectar averages 22.1%, and nectar volume per flower averages 16.9 mu l. The plant populations bloom for one month to year-round, and their flowering approaches the steady-state pattern. Four flower subsets may be defined within the assemblage, each subset related to the bill size and foraging habits of the most frequent bird visitor. Of the six species of humming-birds recorded at the study site, four are common and largely resident. The four hummingbirds differ in bill size, body mass, and favoured foraging sites, attributes which reflect their favoured flower subsets. One hermit and one trochiline hummingbird share most of the flower species they use, these two birds being the major pollinators within the flower assemblage. This montane forest community may be viewed as medium-rich in ornithophilous flower species and poor in hummingbird species.

AB In order to clarify regeneration traits and their fitness, we compared seed fall, seedling emergence, and first-year seedling survival of four co-occurring species, Carpinus tschonoskii, C. japonica C. laxiflora, and C. cordata, in an old-growth temperate deciduous forest in Ogawa Forest Reserve, central Japan. Seedling emergence ratio of C. cot-data (5.5%), whose seeds mostly germinated 1.5 yr after seed fall, was lower than the other species (8.5-11.2%). First-year seedlings of Carpinus tschonoskii and C. japonica had much lower survival rates (2.7%, both species) than C. laxiflora and C. cop darn (7.5-8.5%) under closed canopy, suggesting that the former two are more disturbance dependent than the latter two. They are characterized by their seed and seedling performances as seed rain type fundamentally; however, C. cordata and C. laxiflora are able to establish a seedling bank, and C. cordata has a seed bank too. These regenerative strategies partly explain the abundance and population structure of the four species in this old-growth forest. Multiple regression analyses showed that topography was important for survival of all species but C. cordata. This result was consistent with the adult distribution of these species in this forest. Wind dispersal of Car-pinus is effective, both to escape from density- or distance-dependent high mortality and to increase the chance of arriving at canopy gaps, where seedling survival rate is high. However, escaping high mortality seems relatively more important for C. laxiflora and C. cordata (seedling bank strategy), and arriving at a canopy gap is relatively more important for C. tschonoskii and C. japonica (seed rain strategy).

AB AimSpecies distribution modelling typically relies completely or partially on climatic variables as predictors, overlooking the fact that these are themselves predictions with associated uncertainties. This is particularly critical when such predictors are interpolated between sparse station data, such as in the tropics. The goal of this study is to provide a new set of satellite-based climatic predictor data and to evaluate its potential to improve modelled species-climate associations and transferability to novel geographical regions.
   LocationRain forests areas of Central Africa, the Western Ghats of India and South America.
   MethodsWe compared models calibrated on the widely used WorldClim station-interpolated climatic data with models where either temperature or precipitation data from WorldClim were replaced by data from CRU, MODIS, TRMM and CHIRPS. Each predictor set was used to model 451 plant species distributions. To test for chance associations, we devised a null model with which to compare the accuracy metric obtained for every species.
   ResultsFewer than half of the studied rain forest species distributions matched the climatic pattern better than did random distributions. The inclusion of MODIS temperature and CHIRPS precipitation estimates derived from remote sensing each allowed for a better than random fit for respectively 40% and 22% more species than models calibrated on WorldClim. Furthermore, their inclusion was positively related to a better transferability of models to novel regions.
   Main conclusionsWe provide a newly assembled dataset of ecologically meaningful variables derived from MODIS and CHIRPS for download, and provide a basis for choosing among the plethora of available climate datasets. We emphasize the need to consider the method used in the production of climate data when working on a region with sparse meteorological station data. In this context, remote sensing data should be the preferred choice, particularly when model transferability to novel climates or inferences on causality are invoked.

AB Soils are self-organized ecological systems within which organisms interact within a nested suite of discrete scales. Microorganisms form communities and physical structures at the smallest scale (microns), followed by the community of their predators organized in microfoodwebs (tens of microns), the functional domains built by ecosystem engineers (centimeters to meters), ecosystems, and landscapes. Ecosystem engineers, principally plant roots, earthworms, termites, and ants, play key roles in creating habitats for other organisms and controlling their activities through physical and biochemical processes. The biogenic, organic, and organomineral structures that they produce accumulate in the soil space to form three-dimensional mosaics of functional domains, inhabited by specific communities of smaller organisms (microfauna and mesofauna, microorganisms) that drive soil processes through specific pathways. Ecosystem engineers also produce signaling and energy-rich molecules that act as ecological mediators of biological engineering processes. Energy-rich ecological mediators may selectively activate microbial populations and trigger priming effects, resulting in the degradation, synthesis, and sequestration of specific organic substrates. Signaling molecules inform soil organisms of their producers' respective presences and change physiologies by modifying gene expression and through eliciting hormonal responses. Protection of plants against pests and diseases is largely achieved via these processes. At the highest scales, the delivery of ecosystem services emerges through the functioning of self-organized systems nested within each other. The integrity of the different subsystems at each scale and the quality of their interconnections are a precondition for an optimum and sustainable delivery of ecosystem services. Lastly, we present seven general research questions whose resolution will provide a firmer base for the proposed conceptual framework while offering new insights for sustainable use of the soil resource.

AB Background: Landscape fires in South America have considerable impacts on ecosystems, air quality and the climate system. We examined long-term trends and interannual variability of forest, savanna and agricultural fires for the continent during 2001-2012 using multiple satellite-derived fire products. Results: The annual number of active fires in tropical forests increased significantly during 2001-2005. Several satellite-derived metrics, including fire persistence, indicated that this trend was mostly driven by deforestation. Fires between 2005 and 2012 had a small decreasing trend and large year-to-year changes that were associated with climate extremes. Fires in savannas and evergreen forests increased in parallel during drought events in 2005,2007 and 2010, suggesting similar regional climate controls on fire behavior. Deforestation fire intensity (the number of fires per unit of deforested area) increased significantly within the Brazilian Amazon in areas with small-scale deforestation. Conclusion: Fires associated with forest degradation are becoming an increasingly important component of the fire regime and associated carbon emissions.

AB We describe in this paper a new genus and species of cricetid rodent from the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, one of the most endangered eco-regions of the world. The new form displays some but not all synapomorphies of the tribe Oryzomyini, but a suite of unique characteristics is also observed. This new forest rat possesses anatomical characteristics of arboreal taxa, such as very developed plantar pads, but was collected almost exclusively in pitfall traps. Phylogenetic analyses of morphological (integument, soft tissue, cranial, and dental characters) and molecular [nuclear - Interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (Irbp) - and mitochondrial - cytochrome b - genes] datasets using maximum likelihood and cladistic parsimony approaches corroborate the inclusion of the new taxon within oryzomyines. The analyses also place the new form as sister species to Eremoryzomys polius, an Andean rat endemic to the Maranon valley. This biogeographical pattern is unusual amongst small terrestrial vertebrates, as a review of the literature points to few other similar examples of Andean-Atlantic Forest pairings, in hylid frogs, Pionus parrots, and other sigmodontine rodents.

AB We present here the first statistically calibrated and verified tree-ring reconstruction of climate from continental Southeast Asia. The reconstructed variable is March-May (MAM) Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) based on ring widths from 22 trees (42 radial cores) of rare and long-lived conifer, Fokienia hodginsii (Po Mu as locally called) from northern Vietnam. This is the first published tree ring chronology from Vietnam as well as the first for this species. Spanning 535 years, this is the longest cross-dated tree-ring series yet produced from continental Southeast Asia. Response analysis revealed that the annual growth of Fokienia at this site was mostly governed by soil moisture in the pre-monsoon season. The reconstruction passed the calibration-verification tests commonly used in dendroclimatology, and revealed two prominent periods of drought in the mid-eighteenth and late-nineteenth centuries. The former lasted nearly 30 years and was concurrent with a similar drought over northwestern Thailand inferred from teak rings, suggesting a "mega-drought" extending across Indochina in the eighteenth century. Both of our reconstructed droughts are consistent with the periods of warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific. Spatial correlation analyses with global SST indicated that ENSO-like anomalies might play a role in modulating droughts over the region, with El Nio (warm) phases resulting in reduced rainfall. However, significant correlation was also seen with SST over the Indian Ocean and the north Pacific, suggesting that ENSO is not the only factor affecting the climate of the area. Spectral analyses revealed significant peaks in the range of 53.9-78.8 years as well as in the ENSO-variability range of 2.0 to 3.2 years.

AB Tree presence in semiarid ecosystems is generally constrained by insufficient annual rainfall. However, in semiarid Chile, rainforest patches dominated by Aextoxicon punctatum are unexpectedly found on coastal mountaintops (450-600 m) at 30 degrees S, surrounded by a xerophytic vegetation matrix that receives only 147 mm of annual precipitation. It has been proposed that these forests persist as a result of fog-water inputs. If so, then because fog-water deposition is spatially heterogeneous and shows strong edge effects, the potential environmental gradient created by the direction of fog input should determine forest structure and tree regeneration patterns. To investigate this hypothesis, we measured fog inputs, forest structural attributes (age and size distribution, basal area, and coarse woody debris), and tree regeneration in three different habitats: the windward edges (WE), leeward edges (LE), and the interior (center) of rainforest patches varying in area from 0.2 to 22 ha. Mean fog-water input was estimated from passive collectors over 1 year in WE and LE of patches. Tree regeneration was greater in the WE and forest interior (FI) and decreased toward the LE of patches, following a marked pattern of decline in fog inputs. Older trees and coarse woody debris were concentrated in the FI and LE of patches. Tree regeneration and patch structure appear to be largely controlled by fog-input direction and edge effects. We propose that forest patches may be slowly growing toward the incoming fog edge, while dying at the opposite edge.

AB In this study we assessed the impact of the spatial scale of analysis on patterns of latitudinal diversity of rocky intertidal invertebrates and on the relationship between local and regional species richness. Fifty-three wave-exposed sites were sampled along the coast of Chile between 18degrees40'S and 42degrees35'S, covering a range of over 2600 km and 25degrees of latitude. Three spatial scales were defined to analyze latitudinal trends of diversity: (1) regional, based on species range limits across the entire region (100s of km), (2) site, corresponding to hundreds of square meters sampled at each location, (3) sampling unit scale, corresponding roughly with a square meter of rocky shore. The analysis showed that spatial patterns of species richness and species turnover varied according to the scale used. At a regional scale, species richness showed a mid-latitudinal peak (i.e. around 30 to 32degreesS), decreasing toward northern and southern latitudes. No clear latitudinal trends in diversity were detected at site and especially at sampling unit scales. Despite the fact that at regional scale species turnover was low and geographically uniform, at the site scale beta diversity showed the existence of 2 zones of higher species turnover (19 to 20degreesS and 30 to 32 S), which may be attributed to changes in ecological and oceanographical regimes. The relationship between regional and local species richness changed depending on the 'local' scale used; unsaturated patterns (linear positive relationship between local and regional diversity) were evident at site scale, whereas saturated patterns (quadratic trend between local and regional diversity) were observed when the local scale was defined in terms of the sampling unit. We suggest that different regulating processes, operating at different spatial scales, may explain the latitudinal trends in diversity at site and sampling unit scales. While regional processes may set an upper limit in species richness at site scale, species interactions (e.g. competition) may control species richness at sampling unit scales. These findings question the current idea of the disproportionate prevalence of regional factors over local ones in determining diversity of local assemblages. They also suggest that regulation of local diversity results from the interplay of regional and local processes.

AB Despite many observations of herbivores and granivores influencing the survival of tree seeds and seedlings, the net effects of these consumers on plant succession remain unclear. We used both experimental herbivore manipulations and observations of changes in vegetation cover to evaluate the longer-term impacts of small-mammal herbivores and granivores on woody plant invasion into old fields in New York State. Over a 5-yr period, we manipulated the density of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) within partial enclosures replicated at five study sites. Average vole activity in enclosures with high vole density was significantly greater than that in enclosures with low vole density. In contrast, activity of competitively inferior white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) was significantly greater within enclosures designated as low vole density. Colonization by tree seedlings, as well as shrubs and vines. was significantly greater in enclosures under the low vole density treatment. Further, tree seedling abundance was higher in shrub-dominated enclosures with low vole, but high mouse, activity. Five years of contrasting mouse and vole activity within adjacent enclosures revealed that seedling predation by voles had a greater net effect on changes in woody vegetation cover in old fields than did seed predation by mice, despite studies reporting higher rates of seed vs. seedling predation in these areas. We conclude that short-term measures of predation intensity may not accurately predict the longer-term effects of small-mammal herbivores on vegetation dynamics and suggest that voles may be a keystone herbivore in old-field succession.

AB A comparison between bat-pollinated plant assemblages at two sites in different altitudinal ranges covered by the Atlantic rainforest in southeastern Brazil is presented. The lowlands (5-90 m) harbour ten plant species in seven families, pollinated mostly by three glossophagine bat species. The highlands (1540-1600 m) harbour seven plant species in five families, pollinated by a single species of glossophagine. Bromeliads account for about 30% of the bat-pollinated species at each assemblage. Tube anti brush shapes prevail in the flowers at both sites. Corolla lengths averaged 26.8 and 37.2 mm, sugar concentrations in nectar averaged 15.0 and 18.1%, and nectar volumes averaged 150.8 and 167.0 mu l in the lowland and highland assemblages, respectively. The flowers are pollinated mostly by glossophagine bats during hovering visits, and the plants are visited in the trap-line foraging pattern. The plants bloom annually and both assemblages show a staggered continual flowering pattern. Flowering, seasonality was found at both sites, with flowering clustering in the drier season at the lowland site and in the wetter season at the highland site. The ratio between bat-pollinated and hummingbird-pollinated species is 0.24 at the lowland site and 0.23 at the highland one. These similar values indicate that additional studies on bat- and bird-pollinated assemblages are merited at other Atlantic rainforest sites. (C) 1999 Annals of Botany Company.

AB This large-scale geographic comparison examines the effects of subsistence hunting pressure and several indirect indicators of habitat quality on the abundance of howler monkeys (Alouatta spp.), the best studied and the most folivorous of all platyrrhine primates. Alouatta population densities were obtained from a standardized series of line-transect censuses undertaken at 23 Amazonian forest sites (1987-1995), including annually flooded (varzea), unflooded (terra firme), and eastern Amazonian transitional terra firme forests. A total of 83 density estimates from elsewhere were compiled from a comprehensive review of field studies from southern Mexico to northern Argentina. Howler density and biomass in Neotropical forests is profoundly affected by degree of hunting pressure, structural heterogeneity of the forest canopy, and to a lesser extent, the rainfall seasonality, total rainfall, and latitude of a given site. Mild gradients of forest elevation were a poor predictor of howler densities. In evergreen forests of lowland Amazonia, distance to major white-water rivers, which covaries with forest heterogeneity and soil fertility, is the best single predictor of howler densities. In Amazonia, habitat-specific patterns of distribution and abundance of Alouatta and other arboreal folivores conform to geochemical gradients determined by watershed types and their consequences for soil fertility. Results presented here confirm suggestions for Old World generalist herbivores that howler monkeys face strong dietary constraints which are most likely related to quality, phenology and productivity of digestible foliage during periods of resource scarcity.

AB We describe and apply a correspondence between two major modeling approaches to forest dynamics: transition markovian models and Sap models or JABOWA-FORET type simulators. A transition model can be derived from a gap model by defining states on the basis of species, functional roles, vertical structure, or other convenient cover types. A gap-size plot can be assigned to one state according to dominance of one of these cover types. A semi-Markov framework is used for the transition model by considering not only the transition probabilities among the states, but also the holding times in each transition. The holding times are considered to be a combination of distributed and fixed time delays. Spatial extensions are possible by considering collections of gap-size plots and the. proportions of these plots occupied by each state. The advantages of this approach include: reducing simulation time, analytical guidance to the simulations, direct analytical exploration of hypothesis and the possibility of fast computation from closed-form solutions and formulae. These advantages can be useful in the simulation of landscape dynamics and of species-rich forests, as well as in designing management strategies. A preliminary application to the H. J. Andrews forest in the Oregon Cascades is presented for demonstration.

AB This paper seeks to clarify the ecological and evolutionary impacts of foraging for arthropods vs. nectar in hummingbirds, using data on morphology, sites, and tactics of arthropod foraging, and prey taken by ii species of hummingbirds of La Selva, a Costa Rican lowland wet forest, as well as information on time budgets of male and female hummingbirds from two other sites. Hermit hummingbirds have long, curved bills and are nearly exclusively understory hover-gleaners that take mostly spiders. Most glean from webs but Threnetes ruckeri differs in foraging behavior and takes mostly jumping spiders. Nonhermits have shorter, straighter bills and employ a greater range of foraging tactics and sites, taking a wider variety of prey. In most species flycatching is frequent and flies and wasps are the predominant prey items, but some also take many spiders and ants; in particular, Heliothryx barroti is predominantly a hover-gleaner of the canopy and takes more spiders than flies. In Thalurania colombica, males and females differ in sites and tactics of arthropod foraging during the breeding season but not at other times. Breeding female hummingbirds spend much more time foraging for arthropods than do males in the same times and places, although flower visitation still, constitutes the majority of foraging time.
   Among La Selva hummingbirds, bill curvature is strongly correlated with the proportion of gleaning vs. hawking, and with the proportion of prey taken from the substrate (spiders, ants) as opposed to volant prey (flies, wasps). Broad wings (low aspect ratio) and high wing disk loading are correlated with hovering, gleaning, and the proportion of spiders and ants in the diet; narrow wings and high wing disk loading, with flycatching. Except for the three species that engage in the most flycatching, females have broader wings than males and in virtually all species, females have higher wing disk loading. However, no parameter of wing morphology shows a clear relationship to strategies of nectar exploitation, probably reflecting the facultative nature of the latter.
   Hermits and nonhermits differ strongly in their preferred foraging levels in the vegetation, both for nectar and for arthropods, with the former using the understory almost exclusively, the latter using the canopy to a much greater extent, in both forest and second growth. Nevertheless, the two groups do not differ in the proportion of foraging attempts for nectar vs. arthropods, nor in the distribution of foraging through the day, in either habitat. In nearly all species, bills of females are longer than those of males, and this could increase their ability to forage for arthropods at least as much as for nectar.
   Much of the controversy regarding frequency and energetic importance of arthropod foraging vs. flower visitation reflects the biases inherent in observing each type of foraging or in interpreting data from stomach contents or emetic samples, or from failure to consider the specific tactics of foraging for arthropods. Reports that hummingbirds can exist for extended periods or breed without access to nectar or alternative sugar sources require confirmation, as does a report that availability of arthropods rather than nectar determines hummingbird breeding seasonality in dry areas. The major impact of arthropods in hummingbirds' diets appears to be at the daily, rather than seasonal, level. Data on arthropod prey do not support the notion that hummingbirds visit flowers for insects rather than nectar, and there is no evidence to suggest that their bills are specialized for extracting insects from flowers. Rather, it appears that the bills of hummingbirds are adapted to extracting nectar from particular types of flowers, and that these bill specializations in turn constrain the tactics of arthropod foraging-in particular, the long, curved bills of the hermits might preclude effective flycatching. Selection on wing morphology from flower visitation might well be mostly indirect, via constraints on arthropod foraging tactics imposed by bill morphology, rather than directly through nectar foraging strategies. There is no basis for considering hermits to be more insectivorous than nonhermits; they represent a separate radiation within the Trochilidae, in a different habitat and in association with a different group of flowers, than do several major radiations of the nonhermits.

AB Mapping forest types and tree species at regional scales to provide information for ecologists and forest managers is a new challenge for the remote sensing community. Here, we assess the potential of a U-net convolutional network, a recent deep learning algorithm, to identify and segment (1) natural forests and eucalyptus plantations, and (2) an indicator of forest disturbance, the tree species Cecropia hololeuca, in very high resolution images (0.3 m) from the WorldView-3 satellite in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest region. The networks for forest types and Cecropia trees were trained with 7611 and 1568 red-green-blue (RGB) images, respectively, and their dense labeled masks. Eighty per cent of the images were used for training and 20% for validation. The U-net network segmented forest types with an overall accuracy >95% and an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.96. For C. hololeuca, the overall accuracy was 97% and the IoU was 0.86. The predictions were produced over a 1600 km(2) region using WorldView-3 RGB bands pan-sharpened at 0.3 m. Natural and eucalyptus forests compose 79 and 21% of the region's total forest cover (82 250 ha). Cecropia crowns covered 1% of the natural forest canopy. An index to describe the level of disturbance of the natural forest fragments based on the spatial distribution of Cecropia trees was developed. Our work demonstrates how a deep learning algorithm can support applications such as vegetation, tree species distributions and disturbance mapping on a regional scale.

AB Climate change models predict more frequent and severe droughts in the humid tropics. How drought will impact tropical forest carbon and greenhouse gas dynamics is poorly understood. Here we report the effects of the severe 2015 Caribbean drought on soil moisture, oxygen, phosphorus (P), and greenhouse gas emissions in a humid tropical forest in Puerto Rico. Drought significantly decreases inorganic P concentrations, an element commonly limiting to net primary productivity in tropical forests, and significantly increases organic P. High-frequency greenhouse gas measurements show varied impacts across topography. Soil carbon dioxide emissions increase by 60% on slopes and 163% in valleys. Methane (CH4) consumption increases significantly during drought, but high CH4 fluxes post-drought offset this sink after 7 weeks. The rapid response and slow recovery to drought suggest tropical forest biogeochemistry is more sensitive to climate change than previously believed, with potentially large direct and indirect consequences for regional and global carbon cycles.

AB Research on herbivore-induced plant defence and research on pollination ecology have had a long history of separation. Plant reproduction of most angiosperm species is mediated by pollinators, and the effects of herbivore induced plant defences on pollinator behaviour have been largely neglected. Moreover, there is expected to be a trade-off between plant reproductive strategies and defence mechanisms. To investigate this trade-off, it is essential to study herbivore-induced plant resistance and allocation of resources by plants, within the same system, and to test if indirect plant resistance can conflict with pollinator attraction. Here, I review the key literature highlighting connection between plant defence and reproduction, and propose to exploit natural variation among plant species to assess the ecological costs of plant responses to herbivores and pollinators.

AB Whole genome sequencing is helping generate robust phylogenetic hypotheses for a range of taxonomic groups that were previously recalcitrant to classical molecular phylogenetic approaches. As a case study, we performed a shallow shotgun sequencing of eight species in the tropical tree family Chrysobalanaceae to retrieve large fragments of high-copy number DNA regions and test the potential of these regions for phylogeny reconstruction. We were able to assemble the nuclear ribosomal cluster (nrDNA), the complete plastid genome (ptDNA) and a large fraction of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) with approximately 1000x, 450x and 120x sequencing depth respectively. The phylogenetic tree obtained with ptDNA resolved five of the seven internal nodes. In contrast, the tree obtained with mtDNA and nrDNA data were largely unresolved. This study demonstrates that genome skimming is a cost-effective approach and shows potential in plant molecular systematics within Chrysobalanaceae and other under-studied groups.

AB Long-term surveys of entire communities of species are needed to measure fluctuations in natural populations and elucidate the mechanisms driving population dynamics and community assembly. We analysed changes in abundance of over 4000 tree species in 12 forests across the world over periods of 6-28years. Abundance fluctuations in all forests are large and consistent with population dynamics models in which temporal environmental variance plays a central role. At some sites we identify clear environmental drivers, such as fire and drought, that could underlie these patterns, but at other sites there is a need for further research to identify drivers. In addition, cross-site comparisons showed that abundance fluctuations were smaller at species-rich sites, consistent with the idea that stable environmental conditions promote higher diversity. Much community ecology theory emphasises demographic variance and niche stabilisation; we encourage the development of theory in which temporal environmental variance plays a central role.

AB The influence of environmental change on species interactions will affect population dynamics and community structure in the future, but our current understanding of the outcomes of species interactions in a high-CO2 world is limited. Here, we draw upon emerging experimental research examining the effects of ocean acidification on coastal molluscs to provide hypotheses of the potential impacts of high-CO2 on predator-prey interactions. Coastal molluscs, such as oysters, mussels, and snails, allocate energy among defenses, growth, and reproduction. Ocean acidification increases the energetic costs of physiological processes such as acid-base regulation and calcification. Impacted molluscs can display complex and divergent patterns of energy allocation to defenses and growth that may influence predator-prey interactions; these include changes in shell properties, body size, tissue mass, immune function, or reproductive output. Ocean acidification has also been shown to induce complex changes in chemoreception, behavior, and inducible defenses, including altered cue detection and predator avoidance behaviors. Each of these responses may ultimately alter the susceptibility of coastal molluscs to predation through effects on predator handling time, satiation, and search time. While many of these effects may manifest as increases in per capita predation rates on coastal molluscs, the ultimate outcome of predator-prey interactions will also depend on how ocean acidification affects the specified predators, which also exhibit complex responses to ocean acidification. Changes in predator-prey interactions could have profound and unexplored consequences for the population dynamics of coastal molluscs in a high-CO2 ocean.

AB Snails are highly unusual among multicellular animals in that they move on a layer of costly mucus, leaving behind a trail that can be followed and utilized for various purposes by themselves or by other animals. Here we review more than 40years of experimental and theoretical research to try to understand the ecological and evolutionary rationales for trail-following in gastropods. Data from over 30 genera are currently available, representing a broad taxonomic range living in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. The emerging picture is that the production of mucus trails, which initially was an adaptation to facilitate locomotion and/or habitat extension, has evolved to facilitate a multitude of additional functions. Trail-following supports homing behaviours, and provides simple mechanisms for self-organisation in groups of snails, promoting aggregation and thus relieving desiccation and predation pressures. In gastropods that copulate, trail-following is an important component in mate-searching, either as an alternative, or in addition to the release of water- or air-borne pheromones. In some species, this includes a capacity of males not only to identify trails of conspecifics but also to discriminate between trails laid by females and males. Notably, trail discrimination seems important as a pre-zygotic barrier to mating in some snail species. As production of a mucus trail is the most costly component of snail locomotion, it is also tempting to speculate that evolution has given rise to various ways to compensate for energy losses. Some snails, for example, increase energy intake by eating particles attached to the mucus of trails that they follow, whereas others save energy through reducing the production of their own mucus by moving over previously laid mucus trails. Trail-following to locate a prey item or a mate is also a way to save energy. While the rationale for trail-following in many cases appears clear, the basic mechanisms of trail discrimination, including the mechanisms by which many snails determine the polarity of the trail, are yet to be experimentally determined. Given the multiple functions of trail-following we propose that future studies should adopt an integrated approach, taking into account the possibility of the simultaneous occurrence of many selectively advantageous roles of trail-following behaviour in gastropods. We also believe that future opportunities to link phenotypic and genotypic traits will make possible a new generation of research projects in which gastropod trail-following, its multitude of functions and evolutionary trade-offs can be further elucidated.

AB Microbial ecology has made large advances over the last decade, mostly because of improvements in molecular analysis techniques that have enabled the detection and identification of progressively larger numbers of microbial species. However, determining the ecological patterns and processes taking place in communities of microbes remains a significant challenge. Are communities randomly assembled through dispersal and priority effects, or do species interact with each other leading to positive and negative associations? For mycorrhizal fungi, evidence is accumulating that stochastic and competitive interactions between species may both have a role in shaping community structure. Could the methodological approach, which is often incidence based, impact the outcomes detected? Here, we applied an incidence-based Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) database approach to examine species diversity and ecological interactions within a community of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Co-occurrence analysis revealed that the ECM community colonizing root tips was strongly structured by competitive interactions, or ecological processes generating a similar spatial pattern, rather than neutral processes. Analysis of beta-diversity indicated that community structure was significantly more similar (spatially autocorrelated) at distances equal to or <3.41 m. The eight most frequently encountered species in the root tip community of ECM fungi displayed significant competitive interactions with at least one other species, showing that the incidence-based approach was capable of detecting this sort of ecological information.

AB Extreme climatic events represent disturbances that change the availability of resources. We studied their effects on annual plant assemblages in a semi-arid ecosystem in north-central Chile. We analysed 130 years of precipitation data using generalised extreme-value distribution to determine extreme events, and multivariate techniques to analyse 20 years of plant cover data of 34 native and 11 exotic species. Extreme drought resets the dynamics of the system and renders it susceptible to invasion. On the other hand, by favouring native annuals, moderately wet events change species composition and allow the community to be resilient to extreme drought. The probability of extreme drought has doubled over the last 50 years. Therefore, investigations on the interaction of climate change and biological invasions are relevant to determine the potential for future effects on the dynamics of semi-arid annual plant communities.

AB Species' responses to tropical forest fragmentation are variable and not well understood. Species' functional traits might help to reveal patterns of fragmentation sensitivity and provide valuable guidance to conservation practice. On the basis of 30 reviewed studies published between 1997 and 2008, we present a quantitative analysis of 730 responses of Neotropical vertebrates to forest fragmentation and habitat loss in terms of Species' presence, abundance or fitness. Our intention was to identify possible ecological predictors of sensitivity to fragmentation, such as vertebrate group, feeding guild, forest dependency, and body size. We also controlled for methodology and study site characteristics, i.e. parameters studied, study design, study ID, and site ID. These ecological and methodological variables are frequently hypothesized to have an influence on reported fragmentation sensitivity. We conducted Linear Mixed Model analyses in order to relate the potential predictor variables to reported fragmentation effects. Model performance was assessed on the basis of AIC values. The best models included feeding guild, feeding guild+study design and feeding guild+forest dependency, respectively. We found that study ID and site ID significantly improved the models. Post-hoc tests revealed that nectarivores, possibly herbivores, and species able to use open habitats were affected significantly less by forest fragmentation than others. We therefore conclude that Neotropical nectarivores that are able to use open habitats are less negatively affected by forest fragmentation. Furthermore, a study site's characteristics will always be crucial in explaining observed fragmentation effects.

AB Equatorial rain forests that maintain a balance between speciation and extinction are hot-spots for studies of biodiversity. Western Ghats in southern India have gained attention due to high tropical biodiversity and endemism in their southern most area. We attempted to track the affinities of the pollen flora of the endemic plants of Western Ghat area within the fossil palynoflora of late Palaeocene-early Eocene (similar to 55-50 Ma) sedimentary deposits of western and northeastern Indian region. The study shows striking similarity of extant pollen with twenty eight most common fossil pollen taxa of the early Palaeogene. Widespread occurrences of coal and lignite deposits during early Palaeogene provide evidence of existence of well diversified rain forest community and swampy vegetation in the coastal low lying areas all along the western and northeastern margins of the Indian subcontinent. Prevalence of excessive humid climate during this period has been seen as a result of equatorial positioning of Indian subcontinent, superimposed by a long term global warming phase (PETM and EECO) during the early Palaeogene. The study presents clear evidence that highly diversified equatorial rain forest vegetation once widespread in the Indian subcontinent during early Palaeogene times, are now restricted in a small area as a refugia in the southernmost part of the Western Ghat area. High precipitation and shorter periods of dry months seem to have provided suitable environment to sustain lineages of ancient tropical vegetation in this area of Western Ghats in spite of dramatic climatic changes subsequent to the post India-Asia collision and during the Quaternary and Recent times.

AB The impacts of tropical deforestation and forest degradation on SE Asia's biotas have been documented, but a quantitative synthesis is currently lacking. We examined the responses of biodiversity to anthropogenic forest disturbance by comparing key ecological attributes between undisturbed and neighboring disturbed forests. Based on data from four taxonomic groups (vascular plants, invertebrates, birds, and mammals), six broad measures of 'ecological health' (e.g., richness, abundance, and demographics), and a range of different impact types from 120 articles published, we calculated the proportion of pairwise comparisons in which the measure of ecological health was lower in impacted than in pristine sites, as would be expected if forest disturbance was detrimental. The explanatory power of correlates of disturbance sensitivity was assessed using an information-theoretic evaluation of a candidate set of generalized linear models (GLMs). Overall, 73.6 percent (95% CI = 70.8-76.2%) of 1074 pairwise comparisons supported the expectation that forest disturbance was detrimental to ecological health, with mammals being the most sensitive group. The median effect size was for pristine areas to have 22.2 percent higher ecological health than equivalent disturbed areas. The most responsive measure of ecological health was species richness (median = 28.6% higher in pristine), and agricultural areas were the most ecologically degraded (median = 35.6% higher in pristine). However, the GLMs revealed no marked differences overall between taxonomic groups, habitat impact types, or ecological health measures. Our finding implies that the sensitivity of biodiversity to forest disturbance is moderately high, but essentially universal, suggesting urgent forest conservation actions.

   PATTERNS
AB The prominently right-skewed distribution of species sizes has been the subject of a large literature in animal ecology, but has received comparatively little attention from plant ecologists. It is evident that not all explanations that have been offered for animals are directly applicable to plants.
   We suggest three hypotheses that require further study in the interpretation of size-dependent species richness in plants.
   These hypotheses are all based on mechanisms that have generated, for smaller plants, a greater historical opportunity for speciation: (i) large adult plant size confers significant adaptation primarily in habitat types that have been relatively uncommon in space, across evolutionary time; (ii) relatively small species are more widely differentiated from each other in the environmental qualities defining their niches, many of which are made possible by the mere presence of larger species residing in the same habitat; and (iii) compared with large species, smaller species generally have higher fecundity allocation, i.e. they can produce a greater number of offspring per unit plant size per unit time, which generally confers a higher premium under most circumstances of natural selection, thus generating a potentially greater number of descendant individuals, and derived species.
   We discuss the implications of these hypotheses in addressing an underlying paradox in plant competition/coexistence theory, i.e. that large adult size is assumed to be the principal trait that confers competitive ability yet, even in those habitat types where competition is assumed to reach the highest levels of intensity within vegetation, the vast majority of the resident species are, nevertheless, relatively small.

AB Nutrient resorption efficiency of woody plants, litterfall and nutrient fluxes were investigated in a burned and an unburned cerrado plot between October 199 7 and September 1999. A large experiment (Fire project, Brasilia, Brazil) on the effects of prescribed burnings was initiated in 1992. Cerrado plots were delimited and subjected to different fire regimes. Seasonal trend of litterfall was similar in both plots but the production in the burned plot was 42.2 g m(-2) y(-1) before the fourth prescribed fire (September 1998) and decreased by 22%, 1 y after burning while in the unburned plot it was around 2 30 g m(-2) y(-1). Although nutrient concentrations in leaf litter were higher in the burned plot, the nutrient fluxes were 60-80% lower than in the unburned plot. Nutrient use efficiency (ecosystem level) was 4373 for P and 137 for N. Measured resorption efficiency for 10 cerrado species ranged front 14.5 to 37.2% for N and from 40 to 70.4%, for P and in general. there were no differences between plots. N is in short supply, partly because of fire history, but the results, both at ecosystem and species levels (mean N/P in fresh leaves was 18), indicated it stronger limitation by P than by N.

AB Unprecedented deforestation is currently underway in Southeast Asia. Since this trend is likely to continue, it is critical to determine the value of human-modified habitats (e.g., mixed-rural habitat) for conserving the regional native forest avifauna. The impacts of ongoing deforestation on the highly endemic avifauna (33%) of Sulawesi (Indonesia) are poorly understood. We sampled birds in primary and secondary forests in the Lore Lindu National Park in central Sulawesi, as well as the surrounding plantation and mixed-rural habitats. Species richness, species density and population density of forest birds showed a consistent decreasing trend in the following order: primary forests > secondary forests > mixed-rural habitat > plantations. Although primary forests contained the highest proportion (85%) of a total of 34 forest species recorded from our point count surveys, 40-yr old secondary forests and the mixed-rural habitat showed high conservation potential, containing 82% and 76% of the forest species, respectively. Plantations recorded only 32% of the forest bird species. Fifteen forest species had the highest abundance in primary forests, while two species had higher abundance outside primary forests. Our simulations revealed that all forest birds that were sensitive to native tree cover could be found in areas with at least 20% continuous native tree cover. Our study shows that although primary forests have the highest conservation value for forest avifauna, the potential of degraded habitats, such as secondary forests and the mixed-rural habitat, for conserving forest species can be enhanced with appropriate land use and management decisions.

AB Here we explore the possible role of leaf-level gas exchange traits in determining growth rate differences and competitive interactions between evergreen angiosperms and conifers.
   We compared relationships among photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), maximum ad stomatal conductance (G(s)), leaf life span, nitrogen concentration (N) and specific leaf area (SLA), in sun leaves of 23 evergreen angiosperm and 20 conifer populations.
   Despite similar average leaf N(mass), conifer leaves lived longer on average (36 months) than angiosperms (25 months). At a standardized leaf N, A(mass) was higher in angiosperms (56 nmol g(-1) s(-1)) than in conifers (36 nmol g(-1) s(-1)). Stepwize regression suggested that most of this difference in photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency could be explained by G(s) and SLA. Mean G(s) (on an area basis) of angiosperms was higher than that of conifers (152 vs 117 mmol m(2) s(-1)), but A(area)-G(s) relationships were similar for the two groups. At a given leaf N, conifers had lower SLA (projected area basis) than angiosperms.
   Photosynthetic differences probably contribute to the competitive advantage of angiosperm trees over conifers in productive habitats, and may be linked to the greater hydraulic capacity of vessels, enabling angiosperms to develop higher stomatal conductance and therefore sustain higher transpiration rates.

AB The spatial distribution of seeds can influence several parameters of the natural regeneration of plant populations. Factors shaping seedfall patterns have been typically explored from the tree perspective (seed shadow) or from the population perspective (seed rain). However, the seed rain is actually composed of multiple seed shadows. In this paper, we use this framework to explore the variables shaping the seedfall pattern of the wild olive tree (Olea europaea var. sylvestris), a fleshy-fruited tree of the Mediterranean scrublands. We monitored the movement patterns of avian seed dispersers and the seedfall around each fruit-bearing O. europaea tree in two contrasting sites, differing in the degree of human management and abundance of scrub cover.
   None of the seed dispersers moved between microhabitats (different shrub species and open interspaces) as a function of microhabitat relative abundance. All dispersers foraged preferentially at O. europaea; only the smaller species visited open interspaces, and these only sporadically.
   Avoidance of open sites by frugivores, especially larger species, and their attraction to source trees were the major determinants of the seedfall pattern. Regarding seed size distribution among microhabitats, we found that only small seeds were significantly overrepresented in open interspaces. From the seed shadow perspective, seed density under trees was similar in the: two study sites, but it decreased with distance at a higher rate in the disturbed scrubland. From the seed rain perspective, seed density was significantly different among microhabitats, with open interspaces collecting few, if any, seeds, and places under source trees receiving the highest densities.
   Results from seed shadow and seed rain analyses were integrated to construct a path model to explore the relative contribution of spatial, microhabitat, and individual tree features to the seedfall pattern. Factors related to microhabitat were identified as having a major role in shaping seedfall pattern. Open interspaces collected few seeds, points under shrub species with sparse foliage collected moderate seed densities, and points under shrubs with dense foliage collected the highest seed densities. The comparison between sites suggests that habitat alteration (a reduction of the scrub layer) can lead to contrasting seedfall patterns. The occurrence of an abundant scrub layer in the well-preserved scrubland allowed a complex pattern of seed rain. In contrast, the sparse scrub cover in the disturbed scrubland yielded a seedfall pattern composed of multiple seed shadows constrained to the vicinity of tree crowns. Thus, our sampling design and analytical approach have proved useful in describing the relative importance of the set of variables that shapes the complex seedfall pattern of a bird-dispersed plant. This seedfall pattern, in turn, is central to the understanding of the spatial patterns of plant recruitment and the efficiency of the dispersal mutualism.

AB Due to frequent fire. low nutrient availability, and prolonged drought, tropical savanna is a stressful environment for the survival and growth of woody plant seedlings. To understand why forest species do not succeed in this environment while savanna species are able to persist, che effects of fire and woody cover on seedlings of these two functional groups were investigated in the Brazilian Cerrado. Seedlings were established in experimental plots under three densities of woody cover, in sites protected from fire and sires to be subjected to fire. There was a clear difference in the ability of savanna and forest species to survive fire. None of the three forest species were able to survive fire during the first two years of life, whereas eight of the nine savanna species were able to resprout following lire. The small seed size of the ninth savanna species, Miconia albicans. predisposed its seedlings to he sensitive to fire, because there was a strong positive correlation between seed size and survivorship. Savanna species were less dependent on woody cover than were forest species, which exhibited higher growth and survival under tree canopies than in open grassland. The low races of establishment and survival of forest trees in savanna, combined with high sensitivity to fire, appear sufficient to prevent the expansion of forest into savanna under current lire regimes in the Cerrado.

AB Ecological studies of hummingbird communities have emphasized die importance of local conditions and contemporary interactions in the development of these varied faunas. A time-calibrated, DNA hybridization-based phylogeny of the principal hummingbird lineages was used to examine historical aspects of hummingbird faunas in the species-rich tropical lowlands and Andes, and the relatively depauperate West Indies and temperate regions of Central and North America. Parsimony reconstructions of ancestral distributions indicate that these faunas are polyphyletic in origin, comprising several to many independent lineages. Based on the timing of geologic and cladogenic events, hummingbird faunas appear to have arisen more often by colonization than by large-scale vicariance, with multiple dispersals across water gaps, elevational gradients, and latitude. The extent to which particular lineages colonized different regions depended, however, on lineage ecology as well as on the habitat and age of the fauna. In general, the oldest extant trochilofauna, which today occupies the tropical lowlands, was the principal source of colonizing taxa. However, all regions except possibly the West Indies contributed taxa now found elsewhere, including in the tropical lowlands. The Andean fauna comprises several lineages with lowland origin (hermits, Mangoes, Brilliants, Coquettes? Emeralds) as well as at least one that arose in temperate regions outside South America (Bees). At least two lineages that colonized the West Indies gave rise to endemic genera (Mangoes to Eulampis, and Emeralds to Orthorhyncus). Even groups that diversified in the highlands (Brilliants and Bees) Save rise to taxa that subsequently reinvaded the tropical lowlands. As the result of these varied histories, hummingbird communities cannot be arranged easily with respect to organizational complexity and coevolution with nectar sources. Although the physically insular faunas in the Andes and West Indies differ markedly in diversity, both were more strongly affected by colonization than the other faunas. A high potential for coevolution between hummingbirds and plants probably facilitated the successful establishment and radiation of the several Andean-associated lineages. However, coexistence between the two most diverse Andean clades may have been favoured initially through different habitat preferences by their extra-Andean ancestors. In the tropical lowlands, by comparison, the basic separation between the forest-dwelling hermits and canopy and edge-dwelling nonhermits appears to have evolved in situ. The low species and morphologic diversity of hummingbirds breeding north of Mexico reflects the predominance there of a single relatively recent lineage. The regional coexistence of numerous unrelated lineages implies that patterns of ancestry, colonization, and extinction contribute to the make-up of contemporary species-rich hummingbird faunas and serves to qualify the view that hummingbird communities are coadapted assemblages that resist change.

AB The trophic ecology of the stomiid assemblage (Pisces, Stomiiformes, Stomiidae) in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, a region with physical and biological characteristics typical of oligotrophic low-latitude regimes, was investigated. Over 1400 specimens representing 69 species and 17 genera were examined. Four patterns of feeding were evident among the abundant stomiids: (1) myctophid predation. (2) zooplankton/small micronekton predation; (3) penaeidean shrimp predation; and (4) copepod/micronekton predation. One rare species preyed on cephalopods. It was concluded that stomiids exhibited a high level of prey-selectivity, particularly considering the broad range of prey types available in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The absence of numerically dominant potential prey (e.g. Cyclothone spp., sternoptychids) in the diets of piscivorous stomiids is possibly a function of feeding periodicity coupled with stomiid vertical migration. Stomiids may feed at night in the upper 200 m on vertically migrating myctophids while disregarding co-occurring nonmigrating prey during the daytime. Integration of stomiid abundance and diet data suggests that: (1) stomiids are the dominant upper trophic-level predators of the Gulf of Mexico mesopelagial; (2) stomiids inflict the highest predation impact on myctophids in low-latitude midwater ecosystems; and (3) the historic use of predation-avoidance arguments to explain certain mesopelagic phenomena (e.g. vertical migration, ventral photophores) appears to be substantiated by estimates of stomiid predation-impact. The stomiids may serve as key trophic mediators in the transfer of energy from the mesopelagial to the bathy- and benthopelagial.

AB Tropical woody plants store similar to 230 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in their above-ground living biomass. This review suggests that these stocks are currently growing in primary forests at rates that have decreased in recent decades. Droughts are an important mechanism in reducing forest C uptake and stocks by decreasing photosynthesis, elevating tree mortality, increasing autotrophic respiration, and promoting wildfires. Tropical forests were a C source to the atmosphere during the 2015-2016 El Nino-related drought, with some estimates suggesting that up to 2.3 PgC were released. With continued climate change, the intensity and frequency of droughts and fires will likely increase. It is unclear at what point the impacts of severe, repeated disturbances by drought and fires could exceed tropical forests' capacity to recover. Although specific threshold conditions beyond which ecosystem properties could lead to alternative stable states are largely unknown, the growing body of scientific evidence points to such threshold conditions becoming more likely as climate and land use change across the tropics.
   Droughts have reduced forest carbon uptake and stocks by elevating tree mortality, increasing autotrophic respiration, and promoting wildfires.
   Threshold conditions beyond which tropical forests are pushed into alternative stable states are becoming more likely as effects of droughts intensify.

AB This letter uses satellite remote sensing to examine patterns of cropland expansion, cropland abandonment, and changing cropping frequency in Mato Grosso, Brazil from 2001 to 2011. During this period, Mato Grosso emerged as a globally important center of agricultural production. In 2001, 3.3 million hectares of mechanized agriculture were cultivated in Mato Grosso, of which 500 000 hectares had two commercial crops per growing season (double cropping). By 2011, Mato Grosso had 5.8 million hectares of mechanized agriculture, of which 2.9 million hectares were double cropped. We found these agricultural changes to be selective with respect to land attributes -significant differences (p < 0.001) existed between the land attributes of agriculture versus non-agriculture, single cropping versus double cropping, and expansion versus abandonment. Many of the land attributes (elevation, slope, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, initial soy transport costs, and soil) that were associated with an increased likelihood of expansion were associated with a decreased likelihood of abandonment (p < 0.001). While land similar to agriculture and double cropping in 2001 was much more likely to be developed for agriculture than all other land, new cropland shifted to hotter, drier, lower locations that were more isolated from agricultural infrastructure (p < 0.001). The scarcity of high quality remaining agricultural land available for agricultural expansion in Mato Grosso could be contributing to the slowdown in agricultural expansion observed there over 2006 to 2011. Land use policy analyses should control for land scarcity constraints on agricultural expansion.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs aim to improve environmental outcomes by providing direct incentives to land managers for the provision of ecosystem services. Participation in PES programs is voluntary, so effective program design requires careful consideration of farmers' preferences. This study quantifies such preferences using a choice experiment. The study site is the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania, an internationally recognized 'biodiversity hotspot.' We assess preferences for four payment approaches: constant and variable annual cash payments to individual farmers, a constant annual cash payment to a village fund on behalf of farmers, and an upfront manure fertilizer payment. We find that the manure fertilizer payment was statistically significant in motivating farmer participation while the group payment was non-significant In addition, the relationship between the likelihood of participation and the stringency of conditionality is surprisingly non-linear. In a test of external validity, average willingness to accept (WTA) values are found to be similar to the average opportunity cost of maintaining land uses consistent with conservation objectives.

AB Tropical forests play a major role in regulating global carbon (C) fluxes and stocks, and even small changes to C cycling in this productive biome could dramatically affect atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Temperature is expected to increase over all land surfaces in the future, yet we have a surprisingly poor understanding of how tropical forests will respond to this significant climatic change. Here we present a contemporary synthesis of the existing data and what they suggest about how tropical forests will respond to increasing temperatures. Our goals were to: (i) determine whether there is enough evidence to support the conclusion that increased temperature will affect tropical forest C balance; (ii) if there is sufficient evidence, determine what direction this effect will take; and, (iii) establish what steps should to be taken to resolve the uncertainties surrounding tropical forest responses to increasing temperatures. We approach these questions from a mass-balance perspective and therefore focus primarily on the effects of temperature on inputs and outputs of C, spanning microbial- to ecosystem-scale responses. We found that, while there is the strong potential for temperature to affect processes related to C cycling and storage in tropical forests, a notable lack of data combined with the physical, biological and chemical diversity of the forests themselves make it difficult to resolve this issue with certainty. We suggest a variety of experimental approaches that could help elucidate how tropical forests will respond to warming, including large-scale in situ manipulation experiments, longer term field experiments, the incorporation of a range of scales in the investigation of warming effects (both spatial and temporal), as well as the inclusion of a diversity of tropical forest sites. Finally, we highlight areas of tropical forest research where notably few data are available, including temperature effects on: nutrient cycling, heterotrophic versus autotrophic respiration, thermal acclimation versus substrate limitation of plant and microbial communities, below-ground C allocation, species composition (plant and microbial), and the hydraulic architecture of roots. Whether or not tropical forests will become a source or a sink of C in a warmer world remains highly uncertain. Given the importance of these ecosystems to the global C budget, resolving this uncertainty is a primary research priority.

AB Recent studies showed that photochemical breakdown (photodegradation) of plant material accounts for a substantial portion of litter decomposition and subsequent trace gas release in ecosystems under high radiative load and low precipitation. In the absence of solar radiation, thermal degradation may also cause trace gas release at temperatures below the ignition point. These observations suggest that the abiotic processes of photodegradation and thermal degradation of plant litter may be important in understanding global trace gas budgets. In a laboratory incubation study, we performed a simultaneous carbon (C) accounting of CO2, CO, and CH4 produced as a byproduct of photodegradation and thermal degradation of six different plant litter types that varied in chemical composition. The patterns of trace gas release during photodegradation and thermal degradation differed considerably across the six plant materials, suggesting that chemical composition of litter may influence the rates of abiotic degradation. There was a strong positive correlation between the rates of trace gas release during photodegradation and temperature. A significant portion of trace gases were produced during low temperature (<similar to 100 similar to degrees C) thermal degradation of litter in the absence of solar radiation, which was also positively correlated to temperature. In addition, both thermal degradation and photodegradation occurred in the absence of O2. This indicates that the mechanism formerly accepted as photo-oxidation may only be one of several photodegradation processes. We speculate that the direct breakdown of chemical groups such as carboxyl, carbonyl, and methoxyl groups may result in CO2, CO, and CH4 release. We suggest that the combined processes of thermal and photodegradation of litter may be a previously under accounted source of C-based trace gases from terrestrial systems.

AB Palaeoecologists argue that the vegetation of Amazonia has changed markedly since the late Pleistocene and show that forest fires have been increasingly more common since the beginning of the Holocene. Because these occurrences coincide with the onset of human colonisation of the region, students of Amazonia discuss the extent to which it's Holocene fire record reflects climatically-related and/or anthropogenic causes. One factor that complicates inferences is the overall heterogeneity of the basin's vegetation: during drier moments of the Holocene and/or within less humid sub-regions of the basin, it is difficult to conclude whether fire signals reflect more frequent natural fires or more intense burning by human communities. Another factor is that pre-Columbian livelihoods were not homogenously distributed throughout the region and changed over the course of the Holocene. This paper seeks to help establish an 'anthropogenic baseline' against which Holocene evidence for burning can be assessed. To this end, it reviews the role that slash-and-burn cultivation has had in discussions about pre-Columbian Amazonia, discusses how this account has been modified by recent research on pre-Columbian anthropogenic soils, and queries the extent to which the regionally-heterogeneous timing of crop domestication and cultivation may have influenced the fire history of pre-Columbian Amazonia.

SO BIOLOGY LETTERS

ID ANIMALS; STRESS; SHIFTS
AB There is considerable interest in understanding how ectothermic animals may physiologically and behaviourally buffer the effects of climate warming. Much less consideration is being given to how organisms might adapt to non-climatic heat sources in ways that could confound predictions for responses of species and communities to climate warming. Although adaptation to non-climatic heat sources (solar and geothermal) seems likely in some marine species, climate warming predictions for marine ectotherms are largely based on adaptation to climatically relevant heat sources (air or surface sea water temperature). Here, we show that non-climatic solar heating underlies thermal resistance adaptation in a rocky-eulittoral-fringe snail. Comparisons of the maximum temperatures of the air, the snail's body and the rock substratum with solar irradiance and physiological performance show that the highest body temperature is primarily controlled by solar heating and re-radiation, and that the snail's upper lethal temperature exceeds the highest climatically relevant regional air temperature by approximately 22 degrees C. Non-climatic thermal adaptation probably features widely among marine and terrestrial ectotherms and because it could enable species to tolerate climatic rises in air temperature, it deserves more consideration in general and for inclusion into climate warming models.

AB What are the relative contributions of environmental factors and geographic distance to palm community structure at the mesoscale, and how do they depend on the length of the environmental gradient covered? How do soil and topography affect variation of the canopy and understory palm community structure at the mesoscale? How does fine-scale variation within the broad edaphic/topographic classes affect palm community composition?
   Reserva Ducke, terra-firme forest, Manaus, Brazil.
   Palms were sampled in 72 plots 250 m x 4 m, systematically distributed over an area of 100 km(2). Soil, topography and distance to watercourses were measured for all plots. The relationship between community structure axes, summarized by NMDS ordinations, and environmental predictors, was analysed with multivariate regressions. Matrix regressions were used to determine the proportions of variance explained by environmental and geographic predictors.
   Floristic variation at the mesoscale was mostly related to environmental variation, and the proportion of variance explained depended on the amplitude of the environmental gradient. Soil was the main predictor of floristic change, but its effects differed between life forms, with the understory palm community structured within one of the edaphic/topographic classes, in association with distance to watercourses.
   Dispersal limitation does not explain palm composition at the mesoscale, and the amplitude of environmental gradients covered by the analysis can be as important as the scale of analysis, in determining the relative contributions of environmental and geographical components to community structure. Soil and topography can predict a large proportion of palm composition, but gradients differ in scale, with some environmental gradients being nested within others. Therefore, although all environmental gradients are nested within distance, they do not necessarily coincide.

AB Recent models of community assembly, structure, and dynamics have incorporated, to varying degrees, three mechanistic processes: resource limitation and interspecific competition, niche requirements of species, and exchanges between a local community and a regional species pool. Synthesizing 30 years of data from an intensively studied desert rodent community, we show that all of these processes, separately and in combination, have influenced the structural organization of this community and affected its dynamical response to both natural environmental changes and experimental perturbations. In addition, our analyses suggest that zero-sum constraints, niche differences, and metacommunity processes are inextricably linked in the ways that they affect the structure and dynamics of this system. Explicit consideration of the interaction of these processes should yield a deeper understanding of the assembly and dynamics of other ecological communities. This synthesis highlights the role that long-term data, especially when coupled with experimental manipulations, can play in assessing the fundamental processes that govern the structure and function of ecological communities.

AB We developed an automated tree crown analysis algorithm using 1-m panchromatic IKONOS satellite images to examine forest canopy structure in the Brazilian Amazon. The algorithm was calibrated on the landscape level with tree geometry and forest stand data at the Fazenda Cauaxi (3.75 degrees S, 48.37 degrees W)in the eastern Amazon, and then compared with forest stand data at Tapajos National Forest (3-08 degrees S, 54.94 degrees W) in the central Amazon. The average remotely sensed crown width (mean +/- SE) was 12.7 +/- 0.1 m (range: 2.0-34.0 m) and frequency of trees was 76.6 trees/ha at Cauaxi. At Tapajos, remotely sensed crown width was 13.1 +/- 10.1 m (range: 2.0-38.0 m) and frequency of trees was 76.4 trees/ha. At both Cauaxi and Tapajos, the remotely sensed average crown widths were within 3 percent of the crown widths derived from field measurements, although crown distributions showed significant differences between field-measured and automated methods. We used the remote sensing algorithm to estimate crown dimensions and forest structural properties in 51 forest stands (1 km(2)) throughout the Brazilian Amazon. The estimated crown widths, tree diameters (dbh), and stem frequencies differed widely among sites, while estimated biomass was similar among most sites. Sources of observed errors included an inability to detect understory crowns and to separate adjacent, intermingled crowns. Nonetheless, our technique can serve to provide information about structural characteristics of large areas of unsurveyed forest throughout Amazonia.

AB Background and Aims Prior work has shown that above- and below-ground dry biomass across individual plants scale in a near isometric manner across phyletically and ecologically diverse species. Allometric theory predicts that a similar isometric scaling relationship should hold true across diverse forest-types, regardless of vegetational composition.
   Methods To test this hypothesis, two compendia for forest-level above- and below-ground dry biomass per hectare (M-A and M-R, respectively) were examined to test the hypothesis that M-A vs. M-R scales isometrically and in the same manner as reported for data from individual plants. Model Type II regression protocols were used to compare the numerical values of MA vs. MR scaling exponents (i.e. slopes of log-log linear relationships) for the combined data sets (n = 1534), each of the two data sets, and data sorted into a total of 17 data subsets for community- and biome-types as well as communities dominated by angiosperms or conifers.
   Key Results Among the 20 regressions examined, 15 had scaling exponents that were indistinguishable from that reported for MA vs. MR across individual plants. The isometric hypothesis could not be strictly rejected on statistical grounds; four of these 15 exponents had broad 95% confidence intervals resulting from small sample sizes. Significant variation was observed in the y-intercepts of the 20 regression curves, because of absolute differences in MA or MR.
   Conclusions The allometries of forest- and individual plant-level MA vs. MR relationships share strikingly similar scaling exponents, but differ because of considerable variation in y-intercepts. These results support prior allometric theory and provide boundary conditions for the scaling of MA and MR.

AB Recent work on global patterns of deforestation has shown that countries with high per capita GDP or low remaining forest cover are more likely to be experiencing afforestation than deforestation. Here, I show that the relationship is more complex than previously described, because the effect of one variable is dependent upon the value of the other. As a result, high-income nations exhibit the opposite response to disappearing forest cover than low-income nations. In an analysis of 103 countries, I found that high-income countries with low forest cover have the highest rates of afforestation, typically through the establishment of new plantations. In contrast, low-income countries with little forest are more likely to consume that remaining portion at a faster proportional rate than do low-income countries with more forest. Nations with large amounts of forest have approximately equal deforestation rates, regardless of national wealth. These results highlight for the first time that there is a strong interaction between forest cover and economic development that determines rates of forest change among nations.

AB The paper investigated the application of MODIS data for mapping regional land cover at moderate resolutions (250 and 500 in), for regional conservation purposes. Land cover maps were generated for two major conservation areas (Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem-GYE, USA and the Par State, Brazil) using MODIS data and decision tree classifications. The MODIS land cover products were evaluated using existing Landsat TM land cover maps as reference data. The Landsat TM land cover maps were processed to their fractional composition at the MODIS resolution (250 and 500 m). In GYE, the MODIS land cover was very successful at mapping extensive cover types (e.g. coniferous forest and grasslands) and far less successful at mapping smaller habitats (e.g. wetlands, deciduous tree cover) that typically occur in patches that are smaller than the MODIS pixels, but are reported to be very important to biodiversity conservation. The MODIS classification for Para State was successful at producing a regional forest/non-forest product which is useful for monitoring the extreme human impacts such as deforestation. The ability of MODIS data to map secondary forest remains to be tested, since regrowth typically harbors reduced levels of biodiversity. The two case studies showed the value of using multi-date 250 m data with only two spectral bands, as well as single day 500 in data with seven spectral bands, thus illustrating the versatile use of MODIS data in two contrasting environments. MODIS data provide new options for regional land cover mapping that are less labor-intensive than Landsat and have higher resolution than previous 1 km AVHRR or the current 1 km global land cover product. The usefulness of the MODTS data in addressing biodiversity conservation questions will ultimately depend upon the patch sizes of important habitats and the land cover transformations that threaten them.

AB The diverse fauna and flora of rocky intertidal ecosystems are being impacted by the activities of rapidly increasing coastal populations in many regions of the world. Human harvesting of intertidal species can lead to significant changes in body sizes of these taxa. However, little is known about the temporal trajectories of such size declines and more importantly, the long-term effects of chronic human impacts. Furthermore, it is unclear whether sizes of species not directly targeted for harvesting are also declining through indirect effects. Here we use historical (extending back to 1869) and field survey data covering 200 km of mainland southern California coast to show that human activities have led to significant and widespread declines in body sizes of rocky intertidal gastropod species over the last century. These declines, initiated several decades ago, are continuing and contrary to expectation, they are not restricted to species harvested for human consumption. Data from the only national park in this area, where conservation laws are strictly imposed, demonstrate that negative ecological impacts can be ameliorated if existing laws are enforced.

AB To gain insight into suborganismal mechanisms underlying responses of predators to environmental stress, we examined the effects of temperature and food availability on the physiology and feeding activity of the predatory whelk Nucella ostrina (formerly N. emarginata). Studies were conducted in the mid-low transition zone on rocky reefs at two sites on the Oregon coast: Strawberry Hill (SH) and Boiler Bay (BB). SH is dominated by suspension-feeding invertebrates and their predators, while BB is dominated by macrophytes. In wave-exposed (EX) and wave-protected (PR) habitat,, at each site, we measured air and water temperatures, whelk body temperatures, and indices of physiological condition (malate dehydrogenase [MDH] activities and RNA: DNA ratios) for wild-caught whelks. The influence of food (+/- prey) and thermal conditions (+/- shelter) on prey consumption, physiological performance (oxygen consumption rate), and response to thermal stress (induction of Hsp70-class stress proteins) of whelks was determined in field experiments. Low-tide air temperatures, whelk body temperatures, and biochemical indices of whelk field condition were consistently different between sites (SH > BB) and wave exposures (temperatures: PR > EX, condition: PR < EX). Foraging activity, metabolic rates, and stress protein (Hsp) expression were consistently higher at SH than BB. Respiration rates were lower for all -prey treatments than for +prey treatments however, whelks in -prey +shade treatments had lower Hsp expression and higher respiration rates (an indication of better physiological condition) than whelks in -prey -shade treatments. Most measures of performance suggested that wave-exposed individuals were more physiologically robust than wave-protected individuals. Temporal physiological responses to stress suggested that high levels of heat stress compromise whelk performance later in the summer. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that physiological stress interacts with prey abundance to modify activity of whelks. Detailed studies of the effects of environmental stress on predator-prey interactions are needed to elucidate the relationship between physiological stress and predator-prey interactions. However, present evidence suggests that whelks alter activity (behavioral modification) and physiology (biochemical modification) in ways that lead to differential impacts by these predators on prey populations at different sites.

AB Habitat loss and subsistence hunting are two of the main activities that affect wildlife in frontier areas. We compared subsistence hunting patterns in four villages with different ethnic composition and degree of habitat disturbance in the vicinity of Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, Campeche, Mexico. We also compared differences between some of these villages in harvest composition and prey availability to determine hunting preferences. We used a Landsat TM satellite image to analyze the degree of disturbance around the villages. We conducted periodic surveys of subsistence hunting and prey availability. Wildlife availability was assessed monthly on nine transects (3000 m) established in the vicinity of three villages. The relative around of disturbed habitat was smaller in a indigenous Maya village (IV) and larger in a mestizo village (MV). The two mixed-composition villages (MCVs) had intermediate levels of disturbance. Ten species, four large and six small, of birds and mammals accounted for 97% of the hunting records. Hunting was more intense in IV and less intense in MCV1. The three village types has different hunting preferences. The habitat-mosaic composition in the vicinity of the villages influenced prey availability and subsistence-hunting preferences. Changes in the habitat mosaic were caused by the size of the holding and by ethnic composition. In spite of longer settlement time, the habitat mosaic in the vicinity of IV was less transformed than that of the other sites. Their larger holding size and greater diversity of economic activities may explain why the Mayas at IV have transformed the landscape less than the other groups and can hunt more and larger prey.

AB Studies on tree communities have demonstrated that species diversity can enhance forest productivity, but the driving mechanisms at the local neighbourhood level remain poorly understood. Here, we use data from a large-scale biodiversity experiment with 24 subtropical tree species to show that neighbourhood tree species richness generally promotes individual tree productivity. We found that the underlying mechanisms depend on a focal tree's functional traits: For species with a conservative resource-use strategy diversity effects were brought about by facilitation, and for species with acquisitive traits by competitive reduction. Moreover, positive diversity effects were strongest under low competition intensity (quantified as the total basal area of neighbours) for acquisitive species, and under high competition intensity for conservative species. Our findings demonstrate that net biodiversity effects in tree communities can vary over small spatial scales, emphasising the need to consider variation in local neighbourhood interactions to better understand effects at the community level.

AB The seasonal climate drivers of the carbon cycle in tropical forests remain poorly known, although these forests account for more carbon assimilation and storage than any other terrestrial ecosystem. Based on a unique combination of seasonal pan-tropical data sets from 89 experimental sites (68 include aboveground wood productivity measurements and 35 litter productivity measurements), their associated canopy photosynthetic capacity (enhanced vegetation index, EVI) and climate, we ask how carbon assimilation and aboveground allocation are related to climate seasonality in tropical forests and how they interact in the seasonal carbon cycle. We found that canopy photosynthetic capacity seasonality responds positively to precipitation when rainfall is < 2000 mm yr(-1) (water-limited forests) and to radiation otherwise (light-limited forests). On the other hand, independent of climate limitations, wood productivity and litterfall are driven by seasonal variation in precipitation and evapotranspiration, respectively. Consequently, light-limited forests present an asynchronism between canopy photosynthetic capacity and wood productivity. First-order control by precipitation likely indicates a decrease in tropical forest productivity in a drier climate in water-limited forest, and in current light-limited forest with future rainfall < 2000 mm yr(-1).

AB Symbiotic di-nitrogen (N-2) fixation is a critical biogeochemical process in tropical forests, yet it remains unresolved how fixation is controlled by the availability of soil nitrogen and phosphorus, two nutrients often considered limiting in terrestrial ecosystems. We examine whether individual N-2-fixing trees can overcome nitrogen and phosphorus constraints by employing different strategies of nutrient acquisition and use: N-2 fixation, phosphatase exudation, mycorrhizal symbiosis and changes in root-shoot ratio or tissue stoichiometry. We grew a common and widespread N-2 fixer, Inga punctata, in a full factorial nitrogen and phosphorus addition experiment (each nutrient at three levels) and evaluated whether trees adjusted their strategies of nutrient acquisition to overcome limitation. N-2 fixation was controlled by nitrogen availability in phosphorus-sufficient soils, but both fixation and plant growth were constrained by phosphorus in the unamended native phosphorus-poor soils. Despite the investment in both extracellular phosphatases and mycorrhizal symbionts, plants were unable to overcome phosphorus limitation. Our findings support the hypotheses that: (i) N-2 fixation is proximately controlled by nitrogen availability, consistent with a facultative fixation strategy, and (ii) N-2 fixation and N-2 fixer biomass growth are ultimately constrained by soil phosphorus. We found no support for the hypothesis that fixers can overcome phosphorus limitation by trading fixed N-2 for soil phosphorus. Synthesis. This study provides new knowledge about how nitrogen and phosphorus interact to regulate tropical N-2 fixation by examining a suite of strategies that plants may employ to overcome nutrient limitation. These findings, focused at the organismal level, have broader implications for biogeochemical controls at the ecosystem level in tropical forests.

AB Overhunting has caused severe decline or local extinction in many large-bodied mammals with direct consequences on plant regeneration, yet little is known about indirect impacts of selective defaunation on commensal species. Cascading effects of species extinction across dependent species groups are likely to occur in coprophagous beetles, because these invertebrates rely on mammal dung for food and nesting material. Both mammals and dung beetles provide important ecosystem services and cascading effects are likely to lead to rapid functional losses. In this study, we described changes in dung beetle communities across a gradient of selective defaunation in continuous Brazilian Atlantic rain forest. We compared the dung beetle assemblages in seven sites with different mammalian biomass and composition. The reduction in the mammalian biomass had a major effect on dung beetle communities by (1) increasing dung beetle abundance with decreasing overall mammal, primate and large mammal biomasses, (2) decreasing dung beetle species richness with decreasing overall mammal biomass and (3) decreasing dung beetle size with decreasing large mammal biomass. Moreover, our study demonstrated the importance of the composition of mammal communities in structuring dung beetle communities. This study documented how selective changes in mammalian biomass and composition affect dung beetle species communities, which in turn may have cascading consequences for the ecosystem. Since most of tropical ecosystems are facing dramatic changes in mammalian composition, it is urgent to evaluate the functional losses associated with such co-extinctions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Globally, fire maintains many mesic habitats in an open canopy state by killing woody plants while reducing the size of those able to resprout. Where fire is frequent, tree saplings are often suppressed by a "fire trap" of repeated topkill (death of aerial biomoass) and resprouting, preventing them from reaching adult size. The ability to tolerate repeated topkill is an essential life-history trait that allows a sapling to persist until it experiences a long fire-free interval, during which it can escape the fire trap. We hypothesized that persistence in the fire trap results from a curvilinear relationship between pre-burn size and resprout size, which causes a plant to approach an equilibrial size in which post-fire biomass recovery is equal to fire-induced biomass loss. We also predicted that the equilibrial stem size is positively related to resource availability. To test these hypotheses, we collected data on pre-burn and resprout size of five woody plant species at wetland ecotones in longleaf pine savanna subjected to frequent burning. As expected, all species exhibited similar curvilinear relationships between pre-burn size and resprout size. The calculated equilibrial sizes were strong predictors of mean plant size across species and growing conditions, supporting the persistence equilibrium model. An alternative approach using matrix models yielded similar results. Resprouting was less vigorous in dry sites than at wet sites, resulting in smaller equilibrial stem sizes in drier sites; extrapolating these results provides an explanation for the absence of these species in xeric uplands. This new framework offers a straightforward approach to guide data collection for experimental, comparative, and modeling studies of plant persistence and community dynamics in frequently burned habitats.

AB Ecologists have recently interpreted patterns of phylogenetic distance among coexisting species as indicative of processes affecting community assembly during forest succession. We investigated plant community phylogenetic structure along a successional gradient in New Guinean lowland rain forest. We surveyed all trees with diameter at breast height = 5 cm in nineteen 0.25 ha plots representing younger secondary, older secondary, and primary forest. We estimated plant community phylogeny from rbcL gene sequences to quantify change in phylogenetic structure during succession. Mean phylogenetic distance among co-occurring trees increased with total basal area per plot, a proxy for forest age. Significant phylogenetic clustering was detected in secondary forest whereas primary forest was significantly over-dispersed relative to null expectations. We examined the sensitivity of these patterns to various methods of branch length estimation and phylogenetic uncertainty. Power to detect community phylogenetic patterns when equal branch lengths were assumed was weak in comparison to direct molecular and time-calibrated measures of divergence. Inferred change during forest succession was also robust to phylogenetic uncertainty so long as temporal information was incorporated in estimates of divergence. The observed patterns are consistent with processes of environmental filtering during tropical forest succession giving way to other processes in primary forests including density-dependence.

AB Species should only persist in local communities if they have functional traits that are compatible with habitat-specific environmental conditions. Consequently, pronounced regional environmental gradients should produce environmental filtering, or a trait-based spatial segregation of species. It is critical to quantify the links between species' functional traits and their environment in order to reveal the relative importance of this process to community assembly and promote understanding of the impacts of ongoing environmental changes. We investigated this relationship using epigaeic ants in an environmentally heterogeneous region of Florida. We found evidence for environmental filtering as environmental conditions such as groundcover, surface temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and plant diversity were strongly correlated with assemblage composition. Certain species traits appeared particularly important to persistence: (1) ants in environments with less groundcover have relatively longer legs but do not differ in size, (2) ants in hotter environments exhibit greater thermal tolerances, and (3) ants in hotter and drier environments do not exhibit greater desiccation resistance. These findings show surface complexity and temperature may interact with morphology and physiology to impact the spatial distribution of ants and underscore the importance of climate change. Climate warming is predicted to alter assemblage composition, competitive dynamics, and consequently impact ecosystem processes. We suggest environmental filters acting at regional scales, as shown here, act in tandem with more frequently studied local-scale competitive interactions to delimit ant community assemblages.

AB Conservation investments are increasingly being implemented through payments for ecosystem services (PES) for the protection and restoration of ecosystem services around the world. Previous studies suggested that social norms have substantial impacts on environmental behaviors of humans, including enrollment of PES programs. However, it is still not well understood how social norms are affected by the design of PES programs and how the evolution of social norms may affect the efficiency of conservation investments. In this paper, we developed an agent-based simulation model to demonstrate the evolution and impacts of social norms on the enrollment of agricultural land in a PES program. We applied the model to land plots that have been enrolled in China's Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP) to examine reenrollment in an alternative payment program when the current payments ceased. The study was conducted in Wolong Nature Reserve where several thousand plant and animal species, including giant pandas, may benefit from the reenrollment. We found that over 15% more GTGP land can be reenrolled at the same payment if social norms were leveraged by allowing more than 10 rounds of interactions among landholders regarding their reenrollment decisions. With only three rounds of interactions, an additional 7.5% GTGP land was reenrolled at the same payment due to the effects of social norms. In addition, the effects of social norms were largest at intermediate payments and were smaller at much higher or much smaller payments. Even in circumstances where frequent interactions among landholders about their enrollment decisions are not feasible, policy arrangements that divide households into multiple waves for sequential enrollment can enroll over 11% more land at a given payment level. The approach presented in this paper can be used to improve the efficiency of existing PES programs and many other conservation investments worldwide. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the last years a new tool has become widely used in ecological studies: species distribution models. These models analyze the spatial patterns of presence of organisms objectively, by means of statistical and cartographic procedures based on real data. They infer the presence of potentially suitable areas according to their environmental characteristics. Data stored in natural history collections can be used for this purpose, which gives new opportunities to use to these types of data. The models have evolved from the analysis of single species to the study of hundreds or thousands of taxa which are combined for the assessment of biodiversity and species richness. In this paper we review the variety of methods used, their potential and weaknesses, and the limiting factors that influence the interpretation of species distribution models.

AB Tropical species are vulnerable to global warming because they live at, or near to, their upper thermal threshold limits. Therefore, the predicted increase in the frequency of warming events in the tropics is expected to be critical for the survival of local species. This study explored the major environmental variables which were thought to be correlated with body temperatures (BTs) of the tropical snail Littoraria scabra at the niche level. A correlation between BT and substrate temperature (ST) was detected from field observations which suggests a possible causal relationship between both substrate and BTs. In contrast, there was no correlation between BT and air temperature. Field observations suggest that 33.4 degrees C may be L. scabra upper limit of substrate surface temperature, although further experiments are needed to assess if the upper limit of physiological tolerance is actually different. As L. scabra individuals were free to choose their substrata, the observed distribution pattern at the niche level is related to L. scabra's behavior. Additionally, substrate surface temperatures were very heterogeneous at centimeter scale (i.e. from 22.5 to 53.1 degrees C) and L. scabra was shown to select specific STs (i.e. between 22.5 and 33.4 degrees C) rather than microhabitat type. Therefore, L. scabra did not seem to behaviorally thermoregulate through microhabitat selection nor aggregation. In contrast, behavioral experiments showed that L. scabra has the ability to actively select a thermally favorable site over short temporal scale (i.e. individual average speed of 1.26 cm min-1) following exposure to high temperatures above 33.4 degrees C. Hence, this study supports the crucial need to integrate intertidal invertebrate behavioral responses to thermal constraints in climate change studies.

AB The distribution of species on elevational gradients challenges our understanding of ecological processes, particularly in the context of biotic responses to climate change. We report here the distribution of leaf-litter ants on the Barva Transect, a continuous gradient of wet forest on Costa Rica's Atlantic slope. Seven sites were sampled, distributed from 50 to 2000 m. Worker density and microsite occupancy were high and relatively constant from 50 m to 1500 m and then abruptly dropped to near zero at 2000 m. Species density at the 1 m(2) scale was high and constant to 1070 m and then declined at higher elevations. Species richness of assemblages at the 1 km(2) scale was constant or rose slightly from 50 m to 500 m and then steeply declined. Because assemblage richness and species density declined more rapidly than worker density, density compensation with elevation is suggested and supported by a measure of mean population density. Statistically, temperature was the best predictor of both species richness and worker density. Relative humidity, soil nutrients, elevation-specific regional area, and the mid-domain effect were poor predictors of richness. Sites from 50 m to 500 m were similar in species composition. In contrast, assemblages at 1070 m, 1500 m, and 2000 m were highly differentiated. Thus elevational ranges were narrow for species at mid to upper elevations and broad for those at the lowest elevations.
   Density compensation at higher elevation suggests that if temperature or productivity are influencing the decline in diversity it must be indirectly through speciation and extinction processes, rather than by greater numbers of individuals. The broad ranges of lowland species may be a response to as yet unmeasured environmental factors (e.g., NPP) or to climate changes associated with the current interglacial period. Interglacial warming may have driven species to higher elevations, but the lack of competitors at the lower range margins may have allowed the lowest-elevation species to move upslope without a concomitant contraction of the lower range boundary. Global warming threatens a loss of narrowly-distributed montane species, but lowland biotic attrition may be ameliorated by range expansion among lowland species.

AB It is widely recognised that microhabitats are important for a variety of marine organisms, yet this knowledge has rarely been applied in the construction of engineered structures as a means of enhancing biodiversity or populations of species at risk. Here we examined the influence of microhabitats on the distribution and survival of the exploited limpet Patella candei on natural shores before determining the effect of introducing such habitats to an artificial seawall. On natural shores individuals were associated with pits (a natural feature of volcanic rocky shores). Animals inhabiting pits showed reduced mortality and were smaller than those on open rock. Microhabitat utilisation was similar over the vertical range of distribution of A candei. Following observation of natural patterns, we applied this knowledge by experimentally drilling pits at varying densities and sizes in a seawall that had been constructed with simple topographical complexity. Overall, the number of animals increased in areas with experimentally increased microhabitat area. There was evidence that this was the result of immigration (larger animals) but also of increased recruitment. This study demonstrates one cost-effective way of conciliating the need to protect our coastlines while promoting the conservation and stock enhancement of over-exploited species.

AB Humans have altered much of the natural land cover, resulting in ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss worldwide. Many countries have implemented conservation payment programs for agricultural land conversion to counter this trend. However, the sustainability of ecosystem services from these programs is unknown due to uncertainty about land uses when payments cease. We studied post-program land use plans for China's Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP), one of the world's largest ecosystem service payment programs, in Wolong Nature Reserve for giant pandas. Although farmers in the reserve planned to reconvert only 22.6% of the land that was enrolled in the GTGP to agriculture after payments cease, these GTGP plots are distributed across the landscape and may be important for many ecosystem services. Along with regional differences, the amount of GTGP land households planned to reconvert was significantly reduced by the respondent's age and off-farm household income and was significantly increased by the number of household laborers and total amount of land the household had enrolled in the GTGP. Thus, regional, demographic and economic factors should be considered to more efficiently sustain conservation benefits from payment for ecosystem service programs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Long-term fire experiments in savannnas are rare, given the difficulties and demands of operation. Controlled fire experiments date from colonial times in West Africa, although the largest and best-known is located in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. The achievements of these experiments are assessed from examples in Africa, South America and Australia. A less well-known experiment in Zimbabwe was sited at the Marondera Grassland Research Station and ran from 1953 to 1991. Some of the preliminary results on the impact of fire on vegetation are analysed and compared with further vegetation surveys in 2007. Studies on tree growth in this miombo savanna woodland indicate that the plots burned at three- and four-year intervals recovered to,greater mean heights than the unburned control plots. There was no significant variation between treatments, suggesting that the few trees that did survive in the frequently burned plots were large specimens. Brachystegia and Julbernadia dominated the plots throughout and after the experiment. Basal area and stocking density were highest in the four-yearly burned plots but there was a high variability throughout the experiment, suggesting that many trees may have attained heights and bark thicknesses sufficient to protect from fire damage. Fire also affected the composition of the herbaceous plant community, but not the number of species. By the end of the experiment some grass and sedge species had flourished while others revealed greater susceptibility to fire, and fire-tolerant species predominated in the most frequently burned areas. The experimental design appeared to cope well with the variability between plots and indicated the soundness of the initial design and its implementation.

AB In the last decades, South American ecosystems underwent important functional modifications due to climate alterations and direct human intervention on land use and land cover. Among remotely sensed data sets, NOAA-AVHRR "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index" (NDVI) represents one of the most powerful tools to evaluate these changes thanks to their extended temporal coverage. In this paper we explored the possibilities and limitations of three commonly used NOAA-AVHRR NDVI series ( PAL, GIMMS and FASIR) to detect ecosystem functional changes in the South American continent. We performed pixel-based linear regressions for four NDVI variables ( average annual, maximum annual, minimum annual and intra-annual coefficient of variation) for the 1982-1999 period and ( 1) analyzed the convergences and divergences of significant multi-annual trends identified across all series, ( 2) explored the degree of aggregation of the trends using the O-ring statistic, and ( 3) evaluated observed trends using independent information on ecosystem functional changes in five focal regions. Several differences arose in terms of the patterns of change ( the sign, localization and total number of pixels with changes). FASIR presented the highest proportion of changing pixels (32.7%) and GIMMS the lowest (16.2%). PAL and FASIR data sets showed the highest agreement, with a convergence of detected trends on 71.2% of the pixels. Even though positive and negative changes showed substantial spatial aggregation, important differences in the scale of aggregation emerged among the series, with GIMMS showing the smaller scale (<= 11 pixels). The independent evaluations suggest higher accuracy in the detection of ecosystem changes among PAL and FASIR series than with GIMMS, as they detected trends that match expected shifts. In fact, this last series eliminated most of the long term patterns over the continent. For example, in the "Eastern Paraguay" and "Uruguay River margins" focal regions, the extensive changes due to land use and land cover change expansion were detected by PAL and FASIR, but completely ignored by GIMMS. Although the technical explanation of the differences remains unclear and needs further exploration, we found that the evaluation of this type of remote sensing tools should not only be focused at the level of assumptions (i.e. physical or mathematical aspects of image processing), but also at the level of results (i.e. contrasting observed patterns with independent proofs of change). We finally present the online collaborative initiative "Land ecosystem change utility for South America", which facilitates this type of evaluations and helps to identify the most important functional changes of the continent.

AB We experimentally investigated interacting effects of canopy gaps, understory vegetation and leaf litter on recruitment and mortality of tree seedlings at the community level in a 20-year-old lowland forest in Costa Rica, and tested several predictions based on results of previous studies. We predicted that experimental canopy gaps would greatly enhance tree seedling recruitment, and that leaf litter removal would further enhance recruitment of small-seeded, shade-intolerant seedlings in gaps. We created a large (320-540 m(2)) gap in the center of 5 out of 10 40 m x 40 m experimental plots, and applied the following treatments bimonthly over a 14-month-period in a factorial, split-split plot design: clipping of understory vegetation (cut, uncut), and leaf litter manipulations (removal, addition, control). As expected, experimental gaps dramatically increased tree seedling recruitment, but gap effects varied among litter treatments. Litter addition reduced recruitment in gaps, but enhanced recruitment under intact canopy. Species composition Of recruits also differed markedly between gap treatments: several small-seeded pioneer and long-lived pioneer species recruited almost exclusively in gaps. In contrast, a few medium-to-large-seeded shade-tolerant species recruited predominantly under intact canopy. Leaf litter represents a major barrier for seedling emergence and establishment of small-seeded, shade-intolerant species, but enhances emergence and establishment of large-seeded, shade-tolerant species, possibly through increased humidity and reduced detection by predators. Periodic clipping of the understory vegetation marginally reduced tree seedling mortality, but only in experimental gaps, where understory vegetation cover was greatly enhanced compared to intact canopy conditions. Successful regeneration of commercially valuable long-lived pioneer trees that dominate the forest canopy may require clear-cutting, as well as weeding and site preparation (litter removal) treatments in felling clearings. Management systems that mimic natural canopy gaps (reduced-impact selective logging) could favor the regeneration of shade-tolerant tree species, potentially accelerating convergence to old-growth forest composition. In contrast, systems that produce large canopy openings (clear-cutting) may re-initiate succession, potentially leading to less diverse but perhaps more easily managed "natural plantations" of long-lived pioneer tree species.

AB We documented the history of land-use change and migration in eastern Bolivia in five temporal periods: pre-1976, 1976-1986, 1986-1991, 1991-2001, and 2001-2004. We included all land-cover types located below the natural montane tree line (similar to 3000 m), including forest, savanna, scrubland, seasonal wetland, second-growth forest, pasture, and cropland. The rate of land-use change has increased from approximately 4.7 x 10(4) ha/yr in the 1960s to > 2.9 x 10(5) ha/yr in the most recent period. Land-use change was quantified for 10 groups within which cultural traditions and production systems are shared, including three nonmechanized indigenous groups, four mechanized farming groups, two cattle ranching groups, and the forest products sector. Mechanized Cruceno farmers and Andean indigenous colonists were responsible for most land-use change in the 1960s and 1970s; deforestation by the latter group increased to twice that by all other groups during 1986-1991, declined in the 1990s, and then increased again in the most recent period. In the last 15 years, land-use change by agro-industrialists specializing in soybean has become important, and cattle ranching based on cultivated pastures has surpassed land use by all other groups. When the rates of change increased for the three indigenous nonmechanized groups, they tended to decrease for the four nonindigenous mechanized groups, and vice versa.

Within the study area (similar to 196 km(2)) a total of 9747 individuals of 177 bird species were recorded. Our goal was to identify associations between species traits and environmental variables. This can help us to understand the causes of disturbance and predict whether species with given traits will persist under changing environmental conditions. Logging, slope position, and a number of habitat structure variables including canopy cover and liana abundance were significantly related to variation in bird composition. In addition to environmental variables, spatial variables also explained a significant amount of variation. However, environmental variables, particularly in relation to logging, were of greater importance in structuring variation in composition. Environmental change following logging appeared to have a pronounced effect on the feeding guild and size class structure but there was little evidence of an effect on restricted range or threatened species although certain threatened species were adversely affected. For example, species such as the terrestrial insectivore Argusianus argus and the hornbill Buceros rhinoceros, both of which are threatened, were rare or absent in recently logged forest. In contrast, undergrowth insectivores such as Orthotomus atrogularis and Trichastoma rostratum were abundant in recently logged forest and rare in unlogged forest. Logging appeared to have the strongest negative effect on hornbills, terrestrial insectivores, and canopy bark-gleaning insectivores while moderately affecting canopy foliage-gleaning insectivores and frugivores, raptors, and large species in general. In contrast, undergrowth insectivores responded positively to logging while most understory guilds showed little pronounced effect. Despite the high species richness of logged forest, logging may still have a negative impact on extant diversity by adversely affecting key ecological guilds. The sensitivity of hornbills in particular to logging disturbance may be expected to alter rainforest dynamics by seriously reducing the effective seed dispersal of associated tree species. However, logged forest represents an increasingly important habitat for most bird species and needs to be protected from further degradation. Biodiversity management within logging concessions should focus on maintaining large areas of unlogged forest and mitigating the adverse effects of logging on sensitive groups of species.

AB It was predicted that relationships of leaf mass per area (LMA) with juvenile shade tolerance will depend on leaf habit, and on whether species are compared at a common age as young seedlings, or at a common size as saplings. A meta-analysis of 47 comparative studies (372 species) was used to test predictions, and the effect of light environment on this relationship. The LMA of evergreens was positively correlated with shade tolerance, irrespective of ontogeny or light environment. The LMA of young seedlings (<= 1 yr) of deciduous species in low light was also positively correlated with shade tolerance; more weakly so in high light. By contrast, size-specific comparisons of deciduous saplings gave negative correlations of LMA with shade tolerance. Independent contrasts and cross-species analyses yielded broadly similar results. We conclude that ontogeny strongly influences the relationship of LMA with shade tolerance of deciduous trees, but has little impact on that of evergreens. Size-specific comparisons reveal opposing trends in deciduous and evergreen taxa: the negative relationship of LMA with shade tolerance of deciduous species is probably dominated by interspecific differences in palisade thickness, whereas patterns in evergreens are probably shaped more by the degree of structural reinforcement, linked to wide variation in leaf lifespan.

AB Global-scale changes in anthropogenic nutrient input into marine ecosystems via terrestrial runoff, coupled with widespread predator removal via fishing, have created greater urgency for understanding the relative role of top-down versus bottom-up control of food web dynamics. Yet recent large-scale studies of community regulation in marine ecosystems have shown dramatically different results that leave this issue largely unresolved. We combined a multiyear, large-scale data set of species abundances for 46 species in kelp forests from the California Channel Islands with satellite-derived primary production and found that top-down control explains 7- to 10-fold more of the variance in abundance of bottom and mid-trophic levels than does bottom-up control. This top-down control was propagated via a variety of species-level direct and indirect responses to predator abundance. Management of top-down influences such as fishing may be more important in coastal marine ecosystems, particularly in kelp forest systems, than is commonly thought.

AB The growing emphasis on including invertebrates in global biodiversity conservation efforts has prompted air increase in the study of invertebrate assemblages. Invertebrate sampling designs and the bias of individual methods, nevertheless, remain poorly understood for a variety of habitats. We used a structured inventory approach to sampling ants in five upland ecosystems in Florida. We evaluated the efficiency of quantitative and nonquantitative methods for sampling ants. We also evaluated the performance of four species richness estimators. A total of 3,774 species occurrences were distributed among 1,732 samples that contained 94 species from 31 genera. Twenty unique species and 10 duplicate species were collected. Compared with a comprehensive species list for Florida, sampling captured approximate to 66% of the regional fauna and approximate to 70-90% of species within the ecosystems studied. Combinations of sampling methods were much more effective for assessing species richness. Individual methods were complementary and sampled only part of the entire assemblage. Nonparametric estimators (air incidence-based coverage estimator [ICE I and a jackknife estimator [Jack-2]) performed better than lognormal fitting, and Michaelis-Menten curve extrapolation. However, none of the estimators was stable, and their estimates should be viewed with skepticism. The results of this study provide support for the use of the Ants of the Leaf Litter (ALL) protocol for thoroughly sampling ant assemblages in temperate and subtropical ecosystems. Furthermore, our results indicate that even in relatively species-poor (compared with the tropics) temperate and subtropical regions, a large sampling effort that includes multiple sampling methods is the most effective manner of thoroughly sampling an ant assemblage. Therefore, we suggest that structured inventory should be adopted for a wider variety of terrestrial invertebrate studies.

AB As one of the world's prime megadiverse countries, Brazil holds an immense number of terrestrial invertebrates. Current knowledge of this biota is very heterogeneous. Several taxa are sufficiently well known to be used as indicators of ecological integrity or of endemism. The current Brazilian national and regional red lists include 130 terrestrial invertebrate species, of which 42% are butterflies. These lists are contingent on available knowledge, and many taxa that are omitted certainly include species at risk. Knowledge of various biomes and habitats is also quite irregular, with the Caatinga and Pantanal in need of more study, compared with the Atlantic Forest, the Amazon, and Cerrado. Canopy, host-associated, and soil faunas also need further intensive study. Invertebrate conservation will be promoted more effectively by habitat preservation and management rather than single-species initiatives. To this end, better geographic surveys of entire taxonomic or functional assemblages are needed. An improved understanding of the invertebrate role in ecosystem processes will strengthen enormously the case for their conservation.

AB Protected area managers have limited resources and so need fine-scale information to decide where to focus their budgets for law enforcement and community outreach. This study used satellite imagery to map and analyse forest loss in an area that overlaps with Kerinci Seblat National Park, Sumatra, to identify areas most susceptible to illegal logging. Between 1985 and 1992, forest located at lower elevation and close to roads was most vulnerable to clearance. These factors were also significant between 1992 and 1999, along with distance to newly created logging roads. The presence of these roads probably explained why the deforestation rate increased from 1.1% per year to 3.0% per year over the two study periods. The accuracy of the 1985-1992 model was measured in the field and successfully predicted subsequent deforestation patterns, suggesting that this methodology could be used to identify where future patrolling effort and community outreach programmes should be focussed. In addition, this approach could be used more widely in conservation planning to prioritise the protection of vulnerable sites.

AB [1] We combine general circulation modeling (GCM), remote sensing, and field results to identify a positive feedback loop in which clearing of tropical savannas results in warmer and drier climate, accelerated fire frequencies, and further tree cover loss. The GCM simulations indicate that ongoing clearing of tropical savannas increases temperatures and wind speeds and decreases precipitation and relative humidity, substantially increasing fire frequency. Using NOAA-12 satellite images and meteorological data, we estimate that complete savanna clearing will increase fire frequency by 42%. Combining these data with long-term fire studies, we demonstrate that this fire-mediated feedback may already be contributing to declining tree densities in the world's savannas and will become increasingly important as vegetation change continues in the coming century.

AB 1. A functional growth analysis was used to determine the duration of strict dependency on seed reserves for energy and nitrogen in three woody Bignoniaceae species (Tabebuia rosea DC., Challichlamys latifolia K. Schum. and Pithecoctenium crucigerum A. Gentry) which differed in cotyledon function (photosynthetic, semi-photosynthetic and storage) and shade tolerance (probability of seedling establishment and survival in the understorey).
   2. Seedlings were raised from seeds in sand culture under combinations of three nitrogen levels (daily supply of nutrient solution containing 100, 10 and 0% of 2.6 mm N) and two irradiances (27 and 1% full sun). Time course of biomass, non-cotyledonous biomass and leaf area for 40 days post-germination were compared to identify when the external availability of nitrogen or light began to affect seedling growth.
   3. Seedlings of all species became dependent on external energy supply earlier than they did on nitrogen supply. In all species seed nitrogen was sufficient to support positive seedling growth for 40 days in shade, but not in sun.
   4. Tabebuia rosea with photosynthetic cotyledons responded to light availability earlier than more shade-tolerant species with storage cotyledons. Challichlamys latifolia , the most shade-tolerant species, had the highest nitrogen concentration in seeds and was the last to respond to external nitrogen availability. Thus seedlings of the most shade-tolerant species depended on seed reserves for the longest period for both energy and nitrogen.
   5. Relative growth rate after seedlings initiated autotrophic growth was in a trade-off relationship with seedling survivorship in the understorey across the three species. Tabebuia rosea , the least shade-tolerant species, had the highest positive net carbon balance in sun and shade.
   6. Functional morphology of cotyledons and concentration of seed nitrogen deserve as much attention as seed size as correlates of contrasting seedling regeneration strategies.

AB An objective of biodiversity conservation activities is to minimize the exposure of biodiversity features to threatening processes and to ensure, as far as possible, that biodiversity persists in the landscape. We discuss how issues of vulnerability and persistence can and should be addressed at all stages of the conservation planning and implementation process. Procedures for estimating the likelihood of persistence and for measuring degrees of vulnerability at different spatial and temporal scales using subjective assessments, rules of thumb and analytical and simulation models are reviewed. The application of information on vulnerability and persistence to conservation planning and management is discussed under the headings of natural dynamics, replication of protection, levels of representation, source and sink population structures, refuges and critical resources, reserve design, habitat fragmentation and levels of management.

AB Riparian forest is protected under federal legislation in Brazil. In the Amazon Basin, numerous streams and rivers provide huge potential for increasing the conservation value of deforested and fragmented landscapes through the protection of linear remnants along watercourses. However, the potential of such remnants to be used as faunal habitat and possibly as movement corridors has never been fully investigated. We surveyed small mammal and litter-frog communities in linear remnants of primary rainforest ranging from 140 to 190 m in width, and in adjacent continuous rainforest, to compare their species richness, composition, and abundance. No significant differences were found in any aspect of community structure or species abundance. This suggests that linear remnants along watercourses provide suitable habitat for at least some forest vertebrates, a conclusion reinforced by the fact that many frogs and small mammals were found reproducing and moving in the remnants. These results highlight the potential of linear remnants to serve as habitat for small forest vertebrates and suggest they could function as corridors for some species to increase landscape connectivity.

AB Because seaweeds uncontrolled by herbivores can overgrow and kill corals, competition can exclude corals from temperate latitudes where herbivores generally fail to control seaweed biomass. In this study, we show that the coral Oculina arbuscula persists on reefs in temperate North Carolina where seaweeds are common by harboring the omnivorous crab Mithrax forceps, which removes seaweeds and invertebrates growing on or near the coral. In the field, corals from which crabs art: experimentally removed develop a dense cover of epibionts, exhibiting reduced growth and increased mortality relative to corals with crabs, which remain epibiont-free. This crab is unusual in that it readily consumes all local seaweeds in laboratory choice assays and is not deterred by chemical defenses that suppress feeding by local fishes, sea urchins, and other crabs. This allows Mithrax to defend corals from overgrowth by chemically noxious seaweeds like Dictyota and Sargassum that are avoided by most local herbivores. However, further field manipulations under reduced light conditions demonstrate that the outcome of the crab-coral interaction is context-dependent: crabs only benefit corals in well-lit areas where seaweeds are abundant. Field observations and tethering experiments show that, by living in association with Oculina, Mithrax gains a refuge from predation. Additionally, crabs grow faster when associated with live corals than with structurally equivalent dead corals, apparently because they are able to consume lipid-rich coral mucus. This mucus provides a dietary supplement that may help corals attract and retain low-mobility symbionts such as Mithrax, securing for the coral long-term and predictable protection against competitors.
   Structurally complex but competitively inferior organisms. like some corals and coralline algae, provide the biogenic habitat complexity upon which many other species depend. Because these sessile organisms may be dependent on symbionts to remove superior competitors, mutualisms can play an important, but currently underappreciated, role in structuring marine communities where biotic interactions ape intense. In this study, the mutualism between Oculina and Mithrax promotes the persistence of both species in habitats from which they might otherwise be excluded by competition and predation.

AB In nature, seagrass beds can occur as a mosaic of differently sized patches in a matrix of unvegetated sediments. While continuous, extensive seagrass meadows are recognized far their importance in providing refuge for a variety of organisms, the refuge potential of smaller (1-10 m across) vegetated patches has not been widely investigated. The degree of protection afforded by small seagrass patches may vary with patch size due to changes in edge to interior ratios and/or changes in plant characteristics. In mark-recapture experiments conducted at three separate sites, survivorship (i.e., those not lost to predation) of juvenile hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) varied among sites and increased with the areal extent of natural seagrass cover at all sites. At least 40% more clams were recovered live from one site than from the other two sites. Twice as many clams were recovered live from large patches of seagrass (5-10 m across) than from small (ca 1 m across), 18 times more were recovered live from large patches than from unvegetated sediments, and approximately eight times as many were recovered live from small patches than from unvegetated sediments. These patterns in clam survivorship were positively, but not significantly, correlated to patterns in below-ground biomass and shoot density among sites and seagrass patch-size treatments. When below-ground biomass and overall shoot density were held constant by using artificial seagrass mats there was no significant difference in the proportion of clams recovered live between 1 x 2 m and 4 x 4 m patches of seagrass. These results suggest that the refuge potential of natural patches of seagrass for infaunal prey species changes with patch size due to differences in the structural characteristics of the vegetation, not changes in the areal extent of the habitat.

AB Eco-compensation is the most important form of compensatory conservation in China. However, this compensatory mechanism is criticized for vague definition and massive government participation. For better understanding of eco-compensation in China, this paper compares theories and practices of compensatory mechanisms in China and abroad. The analysis of theoretical backgrounds shows that eco-compensation in China is a combination of 'ecological compensation' and 'payments for ecosystem services'. Ten compensatory projects in China and abroad are assessed to reveal characteristics and problems of eco-compensation in China. The results show that compensatory projects in China lagged behind mature foreign compensatory projects in clarity of property rights, responsibility fulfillment, executive efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and equality. The massive participation of the government is the major reason for the poor performance of compensatory projects in China. However, government participation is necessary at the present stage in China for the income gap and beneficiaries' low willingness to pay. For the improvement of eco-compensation in China, suggestions are given on the choice of non-market valuation methods, the creation of property rights and the establishment of market mechanisms.

AB The rapid expansion of the production of agricultural commodities such as beef, cocoa, palm oil, rubber and soybean is associated with high rates of deforestation in tropical forest landscapes. Many state, civil society and market sector actors are engaged in developing and implementing innovative interventions that aim to enhance the sustainability of commodity supply chains by affecting where and how agricultural production occurs, particularly in relation to forests. These interventions - in the form of novel or moderated institutions and policies, incentives, or information and technology - can influence producers directly or achieve their impacts indirectly by influencing consumer, retailer and processor decisions. However, the evidence base for assessing the impacts of these interventions in reducing the negative impacts of commodity agriculture production in tropical forest landscapes remains limited, and there has been little comparative analysis across commodities, cases, and countries. Further, there is little consensus of the governance mechanisms and institutional arrangements that best support such interventions. We develop a framework for analyzing commodity supply chain interventions by different actors across multiple contexts. The framework can be used to comparatively analyze interventions and their impacts on commodity production with respect to the spatial and temporal scales over which they operate, the groups of supply chain actors they affect, and the combinations of mechanisms upon which they depend. We find that the roles of actors in influencing agricultural production depends on their position and influence within the supply chain; that complementary institutions, incentives and information are often combined; and that multi-stakeholder collaborations between different groups of actors are common. We discuss how the framework can be used to characterize different interventions using a common language and structure, to aid planning and analysis of interventions, and to facilitate the evaluation of interventions with respect to their structure and outcomes. Studying the collective experience of multiple interventions across commodities and spatial contexts is necessary to generate more systematic understandings of the impacts of commodity supply chain interventions in forest-agriculture landscapes.

AB P> Widespread hunting throughout Amazonia threatens the persistence of large primates and other vertebrates. Most studies have used models of limited validity and restricted spatial and temporal scales to assess the sustainability.
   We use human-demographic, game-harvest and game-census data to parameterize a spatially explicit hunting model. We explore how population growth and spread, hunting technology and effort, and source-sink dynamics impact the density of black spider monkeys Ateles chamek over time and space in the rainforests of south-eastern Peru.
   In all scenarios, spider monkey populations, which are vulnerable to hunting, persist in high numbers in much of Manu National Park over the next 50 years. Nonetheless, shotguns cause much more depletion than traditional bow hunting by Matsigenka (Machiguenga) indigenous people.
   Maintenance of the current indigenous lifestyle (dispersed settlements, bow hunting) is unlikely to deplete spider monkeys and, by extension, other fauna, despite rapid human population growth. This helps explain why large, pre-Colombian human populations did not drive large primates to extinction. When guns are used, however, spider monkeys quickly become depleted around even small settlements, with depletion eventually reversing the short-term harvest advantage provided by shotgun hunting. Thus, our models show that when guns are used, limits on settlement numbers can reduce total depletion.
   Synthesis and applications. Our framework lets us visualize the future effects of hunting, population growth, hunting technology and settlement spread in tropical forests. In Manu Park, the continued prohibition of firearms is important for ensuring long-term hunting sustainability. A complementary policy is to negotiate limits on new settlements in return for development aid in existing settlements. The advantage of the latter approach is that settlement numbers are more easily monitored than is hunting effort or technology. Similar policies could help to reduce landscape-scale depletion of prey species in human-occupied reserves and protected areas throughout the Amazon.

AB In southern Bahia, Brazil, large land areas are used for the production of cocoa (Theobroma cacao), which is predominantly grown under the shade of native trees in an agroforestry system locally known as cabruca. As a dominant forest-like landscape element of the cocoa region, the cabrucas play an important role in the conservation of the region's biodiversity. The purpose of this review is to provide the scientific basis for an action plan to reconcile cocoa production and biodiversity conservation in southern Bahia. The available research collectively highlights the diversity of responses of different species and biological groups to both the habitat quality of the cabrucas themselves and to the general characteristics of the landscape, such as the relative extent and spatial configuration of different vegetation types within the landscape mosaic. We identify factors that influence directly or indirectly the occurrence of native species in the cabrucas and the wider landscape of the cocoa region and develop recommendations for their conservation management. We show that the current scientific knowledge already provides a good basis for a biodiversity friendly management of the cocoa region of southern Bahia, although more work is needed to refine some management recommendations, especially on shade canopy composition and density, and verify their economic viability. The implementation of our recommendations should be accompanied by appropriate biological and socioeconomic monitoring and the findings should inform a broad program of adaptive management of the cabrucas and the wider cocoa landscape.

AB 1. We investigated patterns in the dispersion (i.e. spread and spacing) of plant species traits that are frequently associated with competitive ability, in an old-field plant community. In contrast with previous studies, we found no evidence for significant over- or under-dispersion of maximum plant height, maximum plant biomass, or seed mass.
   2. These findings hold across three plot sizes (10 x 10 cm, 30 x 30 em, 50 x 50 cm), and when plot size is measured in terms of number of ramets (50 ramets, 250 ramets or 500 ramets) rather than per unit area. Plot size, however, significantly affected the direction of dispersion observed across test statistics, supporting previous studies that have observed that trait dispersion patterns are sensitive to plot size.
   3. While no significant dispersion was detected, dispersion direction, measured as the tendency for a two-tailed test to indicate trends for a given trait, was more frequently observed when analyses were weighted by abundance. Abundance weighted analyses had significantly different dispersion directions compared with presence/absence analyses for one of three traits considered. These findings suggest that abundance weighted analyses may yield more consistent trait dispersion patterns.
   4. Synthesis. Our results may be interpreted as evidence for limited, if any, functional niche partitioning between co-occurring species via size-mediated differences in rooting depth or physical space niches (i.e. limiting similarity). Alternatively, some species with large differences in competitive traits may avoid competition through niche separation, while others may simply compete asymmetrically, leading to overall patterns of dispersion that cannot be distinguished from random. This interpretation supports recent perspectives that niche and neutral theoretical concepts are not mutually exclusive; both, working together, can be applied to the interpretation of plant community assembly and structure.

AB [ 1] Measurements of atmospheric trace gases provide evidence that fire emissions increased during the 1997/1998 El Nino event and these emissions contributed substantially to global CO2, CO, CH4, and delta(13) CO2 anomalies. Interpretation and effective use of these atmospheric observations to assess changes in the global carbon cycle requires an understanding of the amount of biomass consumed during fires, the molar ratios of emitted trace gases, and the carbon isotope ratio of emissions. Here we used satellite data of burned area, a map of C-4 canopy cover, and a global biogeochemical model to quantitatively estimate contributions of C-3 and C-4 vegetation to fire emissions during 1997 - 2001. We found that although C-4 grasses contributed to 31% of global mean emissions over this period, they accounted for only 24% of the interannual emissions anomalies. Much of the drought and increase in fire emissions during the 1997/1998 El Nino occurred in tropical regions dominated by C-3 vegetation. As a result, the delta(13) CO2 of the global fire emissions anomaly was depleted (-23.9 parts per thousand), and explained approximately 27% of the observed atmospheric decrease in delta(13) CO2 between mid-1997 and the end of 1998 ( and 61% of the observed variance in delta(13) CO2 during 1997 - 2001). Using fire emissions that were optimized in an atmospheric CO inversion, fires explained approximately 57% of the observed atmospheric delta(13) CO2 decrease between mid-1997 and the end of 1998 ( and 72% of the variance in delta(13) CO2 during 1997 - 2001). The severe drought in tropical forests during the 1997/ 1998 El Nino appeared to allow humans to ignite fires in forested areas that were normally too moist to burn. Adjacent C-4 grasses ( in woodlands and moist savannas) also burned, but emissions were limited, in part, by aboveground biomass levels that were 2 orders of magnitude smaller than C-3 biomass levels. Reduced fuel availability in some C-4 ecosystems may have led to a negative feedback on emissions.

AB Most tropical forest will not be conserved, but instead will be used in some way, most often for logging, agriculture, or both. Management of tropical forest landscapes for diversity depends upon an understanding of how many and which species can persist in different types of managed ecosystems. I compared the effects of logging and conversion of forest to agriculture or pasture on ant, bird, and lepidoptera, species richness by combining data from 34 studies from tropical forests in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Forest conversion to agriculture or pasture decreased the species richness of ants and of animals overall, whereas logging did not decrease species richness overall or of ants, birds or lepidoptera. After sites were abandoned, the diversity of logged sites did not change over time. In contrast, the diversity of old fields increased with time. Ants, birds, and lepidoptera responded similarly to forest clearance or disturbance, whether it be for logging or conversion to agriculture or pasture. In terms of faunal diversity, selective logging appears to have much less impact on faunal diversity than does forest conversion, both initially and after sites are abandoned. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Phylogenetic analyses of Meliaceae, including representatives of all four currently recognized subfamilies and all but two tribes (32 genera and 35 species, respectively), were carried out using DNA sequence data from three regions: plastid genes rbcL, matK (partial), and nuclear 26S rDNA (partial). Individual and combined phylogenetic analyses were performed for the rbcL, matK, and 26S rDNA data sets. Although the percentage of informative characters is highest in the segment of matK sequenced, rbcL provides the greatest number of informative characters of the three regions, resulting in the best resolved trees. Results of parsimony analyses support the recognition of only two subfamilies (Melioideae and Swietenioideae), which are sister groups. Melieae are the only tribe recognized previously that are strongly supported as monophyletic. The members of the two small monogeneric subfamilies, Quivisianthe and Capuronianthus, fall within Melioideae and Swietenioideae, respectively, supporting their taxonomic inclusion in these groups. Furthermore, the data indicate a close relationship between Aglaieae and Guareeae and a possible monophyletic origin of Cedreleae of Swietenioideae. For Trichilieae (Melioideae) and Swietenieae (Swietenioideae) lack of monophyly is indicated.

AB We investigated the effects of recent fires on the native ant communities in two habitats of north-west Patagonia that differ in vegetation structural complexity. Using bait traps, we sampled ants in replicated scrub and steppe areas including paired burned and unburned sites. Fires significantly reduced plant cover and ant diversity only in scrub sites. The drop in diversity was due to (a) a reduction in the abundance of rare species associated with woody vegetation, and (b) an increase in the abundance of the dominant species, which thrive in more xeric microclimatic conditions. Consequently, ant assemblage structure of burned scrub approaches that of steppe sites. Our findings suggest that the effects of disturbances on ant assemblages depends both on habitat characteristics, which in turn determine the extent of the changes induced by the disturbance, and on the regional context of the ant fauna, which in turn determines the ability of the ants to deal with the post-disturbance conditions.

AB Animals often modify their behavior in response to changing environmental conditions. As physical conditions become more severe animals in stressful habitats pay higher costs and should expend additional resources to search for less stressful habitats. We tested whether conditions resulting in more severe thermal and desiccation stress increased selection of more protective microhabitats by the intertidal gastropod Littorina sitkana, Philippi. We found that complex microhabitats such as barnacles and macroalgae were better on warm days because they provided cooler temperatures than less complex microhabitats such as crevices and bare rock surfaces. On warm days on the shore, snails foraged for shorter periods before selecting a microhabitat and large snails chose more complex microhabitats such as barnacles and algae more often than on cool days. We then used artificial substrates made entirely of clay in a laboratory experiment to show that this microhabitat selection by the snails was based on a preference for high topographic complexity. In this experiment snails that selected microhabitats early in the observation period chose topographically complex microhabitats significantly more often than snails that selected microhabitats late; and this became even more marked at higher temperatures. These results demonstrated state-dependent microhabitat selection by L. sitkana. The short-term cost of selecting stressful microhabitats on the shore was increased dehydration during low tide. The long-term costs of remaining in less complex areas without barnacles were lower rates of growth and survivorship. Pie conclude that topographically complex microhabitats allow the persistence of L. sitkana in the high intertidal zone. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Architecture and leaf display were compared in saplings of six rain forest tree species differing in shade tolerance. Saplings were selected along the whole light range encountered in a forest environment. Species differed largely in realized height and crown expansion per unit support biomass, but this could not be related to differences in shade tolerance. The results demonstrate that there exist various solutions to an effective expansion of plant height and crown area. It is argued that choice of the study species and the ontogenetic trajectory regarded determine to a large extent the outcome of interspecific comparisons. No evidence was found that pioneers were characterized by a multilayered and shade tolerants by a monolayered leaf distribution. Yet, sun plants had a similar crown area, a deeper crown, and a higher leaf area index compared to shade plants and their leaves were more evenly distributed along the stem. This suggests that differences in leaf layering are found between plants growing in different light environments, rather than between species differing in shade tolerance.

AB The relationship between seedling recruitment (under and away from parent trees) and the behaviour of seed dispersers and predators, was explored in a three-year study in Kibale National Park, Uganda. On the basis of 1261 hours of observation, the foraging activity of the diurnal frugivores which fed on fruit from six tree species was quantified. The fate of dispersed and non-dispersed seeds and seedlings was examined experimentally. The findings suggest that a trade-off exists between factors that promote seedling growth in areas with high seedling density and factors that promote dispersal by frugivores. For example, dispersal of Mimusops bagshawei increases both seed and seedling survival; seeds placed away from adult conspecifics had a 8% lower probability of disappearing than seeds placed under adults and seedlings away from adults had a 30% greater probability of surviving than seedlings grown under adults. In contrast, for Uvariopsis congensis, dispersed seeds had a 56% greater probability of disappearing than seeds directly under a parent tree, while the survival of dispersed and non-dispersed seedlings was similar. Non-dispersed seed and seedling disappearance were correlated with the percentage of the Fruit crop removed from focal trees, suggesting that the ability to survive under an adult maybe related to other aspects of the tree's life history.

AB Wildlife management in tropical areas inhabited by rural people requires an understanding of the interactions between game choice of hunters and the biology of game species. This paper presents an analysis that combines information on game use and game biology in an attempt to understand better the game hunting system and its effect on mammalian populations. Game choice by non-tribal inhabitants was studied in the northeastern Peruvian Amazon within the Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo (RCTT). The correlation between game preferences and actual harvests was calculated using Ivlev's index of selectivity. Hunters preferred large-bodied mammals and mammals with high economic value. Actual harvests did not reflect preferences of hunters, but were correlated with reproductive productivity of game species, measured as the species r(max). Impact of hunting on the biomass of game was not correlated with preferences of hunters or actual harvests. Both game choice by hunters and susceptibility of species to hunting depended mainly on the reproductive productivities of game species. Thus, game management in the RCTT must consider the dominating effects of reproductive biology and consider variance in r(max) when determining harvests.

AB Demographic consequences of the commensal lifestyle for shrimps Synalpheus spp. were assessed by sampling sponges and coral rubble on reefs in Caribbean Panama. Eight of 22 species were found solely or primarily within the internal canals of sponges. Among these sponge-dwellers, host specificity ranged from generalism (occurrence in greater-than-or-equal-to 4 host species) to specialization on a single host species, and sponges used in the field were also preferred in laboratory choice assays. Living in sponges had important consequences for shrimp populations. Parasitism by epicaridean isopods averaged 6 times higher in obligate sponge-dwellers (17 %) than in free-living species (2.5 %). Sponge species differed in the mean size and size range of habitable spaces they provide, number of potentially competing Synalpheus species they support, and vulnerability of associated shrimps to parasitism. Similarly, conspecific shrimp populations occupying different hosts differed demographically. Specifically, populations of Synalpheus brooksi in the sponge Spheciospongia vesparium were significantly less dense, less parasitized, had larger body sizes, and tended toward higher proportions of mature females than conspecifics in the co-occuring sponge Agelas clathrodes. High host specificity, regional variation in host use, and demographic and genetic differentiation among conspecific shrimps in different host species suggest that the commensal lifestyle has pervasive, and potentially evolutionarily important, consequences for the population biology of this diverse group of shrimps.

AB Trophic interactions involving plants and animals in tropical mangrove forests have important controlling influences on several population, community and ecosystem-level processes.  Insect herbivores remove up to 35% of leaf area from some mangrove tree species and can cause the death of seedlings.  Leaf chemistry and toughness and soil nutrient status all appear to be important in explaining the between- and among-species variance in leaf damage.  Insects also attack and damage, mainly by boring, a large proportion of mangrove seeds.  Shadehouse experiments have shown that such post-dispersal predation can have a significant effect on seedling survival, growth and biomass allocation to leaves, stems and roots.  Sesarmid crabs are also responsible for severe post-dispersal seed predation.  In field trials, crabs consumed more than 70% of the seeds of five tree species.  For four of these five species there was an inverse relationship between seed predation rate and the dominance of conspecific adult trees, while the within-site distribution pattern of one tree species appears to be partially controlled by crabs.  The same crab species also consume 30-80% (depending on forest type and intertidal elevation) of the annual litter fall in mangrove forests and, thus, have an important role in controlling the rate of remineralization of detritus within forests and the export of particulate matter from the forests to other nearshore habitats.  The other major component of litter in the forests is wood, which is broken down relatively rapidly by teredinid molluscs (shipworms).  More than 90% of the weight loss from decomposing trunks of Rhizophora species during the first four years of decay is through ingestion by teredinids.  The annual turnover of dead wood mass in Rhizophora forests is equivalent to that of the processing of leaf detritus by crabs.  Because of the relatively low species richness of trees and consumers in tropical mangrove forests, they are likely to serve as productive sites for further investigations of the influence of plant-animal interactions on the dynamics of tropical forests.

AB Despite efforts to reduce deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, there has been an up-turn in clearing rates since 2012. These increases are in part due to failures in deforestation control. Soybean planters, cattle ranchers, and timber merchants find ways to circumvent agreements and legislation. Here we explain some of the key problems with the implementation of the principal agreements and Brazilian laws that should be keeping clearing rates under control. To combat increased clearing in the Amazon, we suggest an urgent need to strengthen Brazilian environmental agencies, improve technologies used to monitor the effectiveness of clearing-reduction programmes, better integrate agrarian and environmental policies and integrate environmental enforcement across federal, state and municipal governments, as well as improve transparency along global supply chains and raise awareness among consumers to put market pressure on producers to avoid new deforestation.

AB Ecological disturbance is fundamental to the dynamics of biological communities, yet a conceptual framework for understanding the responses of faunal communities to disturbance remains elusive. Here, I propose five principles for understanding the disturbance dynamics of ants-a globally dominant faunal group that is widely used as bioindicators in land management, which appear to have wide applicability to other taxa. These principles are as follows: (1) The most important effects of habitat disturbance on ants are typically indirect, through its effects on habitat structure, microclimate, resource availability and competitive interactions; (2) habitat openness is a key driver of variation in ant communities; (3) ant species responses to disturbance are to a large degree determined by their responses to habitat openness; (4) the same disturbance will have different effects on ants in different habitats, because of different impacts on habitat openness; and (5) ant community responses to the same disturbance will vary according to ant functional composition and biogeographical history in relation to habitat openness. I illustrate these principles using results primarily from studies of ant responses to fire, a dominant agent of disturbance globally, to provide a common disturbance currency for comparative analysis. I argue that many of the principles also apply to other faunal groups and so can be considered as general ecological "laws." As is the case for ants, many impacts of habitat disturbance on other faunal groups are fundamentally related to habitat openness, the effects of disturbance on it and the functional composition of species in relation to it.

AB Animal populations have undergone substantial declines in recent decades. These declines have occurred alongside rapid, human-driven environmental change, including climate warming. An association between population declines and environmental change is well established, yet there has been relatively little analysis of the importance of the rates of climate warming and its interaction with conversion to anthropogenic land use in causing population declines. Here we present a global assessment of the impact of rapid climate warming and anthropogenic land use conversion on 987 populations of 481 species of terrestrial birds and mammals since 1950. We collated spatially referenced population trends of at least 5years' duration from the Living Planet database and used mixed effects models to assess the association of these trends with observed rates of climate warming, rates of conversion to anthropogenic land use, body mass, and protected area coverage. We found that declines in population abundance for both birds and mammals are greater in areas where mean temperature has increased more rapidly, and that this effect is more pronounced for birds. However, we do not find a strong effect of conversion to anthropogenic land use, body mass, or protected area coverage. Our results identify a link between rapid warming and population declines, thus supporting the notion that rapid climate warming is a global threat to biodiversity.

   BEHAVIOR
AB Large benthic decapods play an increasingly important role in commercial fisheries worldwide, yet their roles in the marine ecosystem are less well understood. A synthesis of existing evidence for 4 infraorders of large benthic marine decapods, Brachyura (true crabs), Anomura (king crabs), Astacidea (clawed lobsters) and Achelata (clawless lobsters), is presented here to gain insight into their ecological roles and possible ecosystem effects of decapod fisheries. The reviewed species are prey items for a wide range of invertebrates and vertebrates. They are omnivorous but prefer molluscs and crustaceans as prey. Experimental studies have shown that decapods influence the structuring of benthic habitat, occasionally playing a keystone role by suppressing herbivores or space competitors. Indirectly, via trophic cascades, they can contribute to the maintenance of kelp forest, marsh grass, and algal turf habitats. Changes in the abundance of their predators can strongly affect decapod population trends. Commonly documented non-consumptive interactions include interference-competition for food or shelter, as well as habitat provision for other invertebrates. Anthropogenic factors such as exploitation, the creation of protected areas, and species introductions influence these ecosystem roles by decreasing or increasing decapod densities, often with measurable effects on prey communities. Many studies have investigated particular ecosystem effects of decapods, but few species were comprehensively studied in an ecosystem context. A simplified synthetic framework for interpreting ecosystem roles of decapods was derived from the available evidence; however, more experimental and long-term observational studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms and shed light on the long-term consequences of decapod fisheries.

AB An ecosystem is a complex composition of physical, chemical and biological components. This complex system remains in a healthy state if the system can maintain the ecological equilibrium among its components. Anthropogenic disturbances are the prime stressors that affect this equilibrium through creating fragmentation, ecosystem sensitivity, loosening landscape connectivity and disrupting ecological integrity. As different types of ecosystem are interconnected, a comprehensive monitoring and evaluating criteria is needed for measuring its integrity at regional level for conservation planning. A Regional Index of Ecological Integrity can be a suitable approach for sustainable management of regional ecosystem. Therefore, this paper presents (i) the characteristics of ecological integrity, (ii) the spatial processes induced by anthropogenic stressors and (iii) an approach to develop a composite Regional Index of Ecological Integrity (RIEI). The prime objective is to establish a thought and a way to develop a composite index of ecological integrity at the regional level. Here, we demonstrate different compositional, structural and functional indicators/indices related to fragmentation, representativeness of protected area, ecosystem sensitivity, and landscape connectivity for the development of a Regional Index of Ecological Integrity (RIEI).

AB Global food and feed demands have been projected to double in the 21st century, which will further increase the pressure on the use of land, water and nutrients. At the same time, the political decisions to support renewable energy sources are accelerating the use of biomass, including grain, sugar, oilseed, and lignocellulosic crops for biofuel and power generation. Government directives - incited by climate change, high oil prices and geo-political tensions - promote partial replacement of fossil fuel by biofuels. Prices and availability of commodities used as staple food and feed are becoming already affected by the growing demand for bioenergy. Many implications of this demand for biofuel on the resource base (land, water, biodiversity), environment, rural economy, food prices and social impacts are unknown. The present study reviews and discusses the opportunities and limits of crops and resources for food, feed and biofuel production. There are gaps in our knowledge regarding the global capacity for sustainable plant-based bioenergy production, while maintaining food security; commercial biomass production will compete with food crops for arable land and scarce fresh water resources. The rapidly growing demand for food, feed and fuel will require a combination of further increases in crop yields (ca. 2% per annum) and a doubling or tripling of resource-use efficiencies, especially of nitrogen-use efficiency and water productivity in production systems with high external inputs, over the next 20 to 30 years. Adaptation of cropping systems to climate change and a better tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses by genetic improvement and by managing diverse cropping systems in a sustainable way will be of key importance. An integrated assessment of resource-use efficiencies, ecological services and economic profitability may guide the choice of crop species and cultivars to be grown in a target environment and region, depending on the added value for specific purposes: food, feed or fuel. To avoid negative impacts on food security, governments should give high priority to 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation technologies for bioenergy.

AB 1. Many current biodiversity theories assume that resource competition determines niche segregation and thus coexistence within communities (i.e. at the alpha-scale). However, the action of disturbance, creating heterogeneous environments and suppressing potential dominants, may also be important for biodiversity maintenance.
   2. Hypothesis: subordinate species exhibit primarily opportunistic (ruderal) survival strategies, with increasing disturbance intensity constraining dominant species - favouring opportunistic strategies and thus functional and species diversity.
   3. The diversity, character and frequency of strategies in an alpine sedge-dominated vascular plant community were quantified in situ using CSR (competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal) classification, and compared with a pasture in the same alpine vegetation belt (i.e. with additional disturbance). Adaptive trends were confirmed by independent multivariate analysis [detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)].
   4. The extremely stress-tolerant sedge Carex curvula (C : S : R = 17.2 : 72.9 : 9.9%) dominated the relatively undisturbed community (frequency = 52%), with 32 subordinates (typically < 5%) exhibiting a functional spectrum encompassing stress tolerance to ruderalism, but not competitive strategies. With grazing, the community exhibited weaker co-dominance by five species, greater biodiversity (76 species) and greater functional diversity, characterized by larger numbers of ruderals and some competitive-ruderals. The principal variation in both DCA1 and NMDS1 for both communities directly reflected CSR strategy spectra, confirmed by Spearman's correlation.
   5. Dominance by stress-tolerators and restricted functional diversity demonstrates habitat-level (beta-scale) functional convergence in response to stress. A spectrum of S to R strategies demonstrates alpha-scale functional divergence in response to differential stress and disturbance. Grazing suppresses potentially dominant species and favours diversity, with the additional presence of competitive-ruderals suggestive of a more intricate niche topology including more relaxed abiotic opportunities.
   6. Natural communities are not necessarily structured according to the rules of resource competition models, as these fail to account for disturbance and facilitation processes.

AB Fire, elephants, and frost are important disturbance factors in many African savannas, but the relative magnitude of their effects on vegetation and their interactions have not been quantified. Understanding how disturbance shapes savanna structure and composition is critical for predicting changes in tree cover and for formulating management and conservation policy. A simulation model was used to investigate how the disturbance regime determines vegetation structure and composition in a mixed Kalahari sand woodland savanna in western Zimbabwe. The model consisted of submodels for tree growth, tree damage caused by disturbance, mortality, and recruitment that were parameterized from field data collected over a two-year period. The model predicts that, under the current disturbance regime, tree basal area in the study area will decline by two-thirds over the next two decades and become dominated by species unpalatable to elephants. Changes in the disturbance regime are predicted to greatly modify vegetation structure and community composition. Elephants are the primary drivers of woodland change in this community at present-day population densities, and their impacts are exacerbated by the effects of. re and frost. Frost, in particular, does not play an important role when acting independently but appears to be a key secondary factor in the presence of elephants and/ or. re. Unlike. re and frost, which cannot suppress the woodland phase on their own in this ecosystem, elephants can independently drive the vegetation to the scrub phase. The results suggest that elephant and. re management may be critical for the persistence of certain woodland communities within dry- season elephant habitats in the eastern Kalahari, particularly those dominated by Brachystegia spiciformis and other palatable species.

AB Edge effects are caused by the penetration of abiotic and biotic conditions from the matrix into forest interiors. Although edge effects influence the biogeography of many tropical organisms, they have not been studied directly in primates. Edge effects are particularly relevant to lemurs due to the loss of 80-90% of forests in Madagascar. In this study, data are presented on how biotic edge effects influenced the distribution and density of lemurs in the Vohibola III Classified Forest in southeastern Madagascar. In total, 415 lemur surveys were conducted during June-October 2003 and May-September 2004 along six 1,250-m transects that ran perpendicular to the forest edge. Data were also collected on lemur food trees along the six transects (density, height, diameter at breast height, area, volume, and distance to forest edge). Four nocturnal species (Avahi laniger, Cheirogaleus major, Lepilemur microdon, and Microcebus rufus) and four diurnal species (Eulemur rubriventer, Eulemur fulvus rufus, Hapalemur grisesus griseus, and Propithecus diadema edwardsi) were sighted during surveys. Regression analyses of lemur densities as a function of distance to forest edge provided edge tolerances for A. laniger (edge-tolerant), M. rufus (edge-tolerant), E. rubriventer (edge-tolerant or omnipresent), and H. g. griseus (omnipresent). The density and distribution of M. rufus and their foods trees were correlated. Edge-related variations in food quality and predation pressures may also be influencing lemurs in Vohibola III. Tolerance for edge effects may explain, in part, how lemurs have survived extreme habitat loss and forest fragmentation in southeastern Madagascar. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Because of their small body size, tamarins are potentially vulnerable to a wide range of predator species. This paper examines the general patterns of predator avoidance of the Avila-Pires saddle-back tamarin (Saguinus fuscicollis avilapiresi) and the red-cap moustached tamarin (Saguinus mystax pileatus) in the upper Urucu river, Amazonas, Brazil. One highly stable mixed-species group of these species suffered an average of 1 attack by carnivorous raptors every 8.8 days of activity. Although none of these attacks was successful, tamarins occasionally fall prey to raptors or terrestrial predators. The two tamarin species exhibited a high degree of coordination in their anti-predation tactics. Saddle-back tamarins accounted for most of the vigilance and detection of terrestrial and scansorial threats, whereas moustached tamarins scanned for and detected most aerial and arboreal threats. Of the two species, however, moustached tamarins contributed a significantly greater proportion of scanning time after predation attempts, during pre-retirement periods and at other times. Moreover, their substantially larger groups (1.6 times larger than those of saddle-back tamarins) accounted for a further increase in their effective vigilance effort. The anti-predation benefits gained by saddle-back tamarins from joining mixed-species groups with moustached tamarins thus appeared to be greater than the reverse, because the latter provide greater protection to the group, particularly against aerial sources of threat. However, the greater vigilance of saddle-back tamarins towards potential terrestrial predators cannot be discounted, because these may on rarer occasions pose a real threat to either species. Collective protection against predators may thus represent an important factor maintaining the widespread and bilaterally reinforced interspecific associations observed with Amazonian tamarins.

AB Ecosystemservice value (ESV) included some contributions of ecological environments to human health and living, and provide cultural and economic benefits for sustaining and fulfilling living organisms. The author selected the Ebinur lake Wetland Nature Reserve as our study site to analyze the spatial distribution and dynamics of ecosystem services, and we used 1972, 1998, 2006, 2014 and 2016 images to study land use/cover change (LUCC) over these periods. LUCC is one of the key drivers that affect ecosystem services. Firstly, in 1972-2030, land use/cover (LULC) significantly changed, with all LUCC practices increasing except for the categories of water area, bare land area and barren land/other. Secondly, changes in ESV were significant during the last 60 years. The total annual ESV in the study area decreased by 50.89% between 1972 and 2030, mostly attributable to the 6.82% growth of saline land, 0.09% growth of desert, 1% decrease of wetlands and 0.95% decrease of water bodies. Thirdly, the spatial-temporal variation of ESV was prominent. Spatial correlation was significant, and the degree of spatial clustering was relatively high in the study area, which was mainly distributed in the water body and wetland regions, and these high-value regions exhibited a decreasing trend. Low values occurred around the lake areas, which increased over time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Brazilian Cerrado is the second largest biome in Latin America, extending over more than 200 million ha and hosts some of the most intensive agricultural activities for grain and beef production in the world. Because of the biodiversity richness and high levels of endemism, Cerrado is considered one of world's hotspot for biodiversity conservation. The objectives of this study are three-fold: to present a comprehensive division of Cerrado into different ecoregions that reflect the environmental heterogeneity within the biome; to analyze the ecoregions in terms of biophysical characteristics, protected areas, environmental liability in riparian permanent protection areas along watercourses, and priorities for biodiversity conservation; and to rank the ecoregions in terms of endangerment for biodiversity conservation and restoration. A previous study that delineated 22 ecoregions using geomorphology, vegetation, soil, geology, and plant diversity maps was revised using topography, vegetation, precipitation, and soil maps. Our new ecoregion map consists of 19 units that are unique in terms of landscape characteristics and has been adjusted to the current official boundary map of Cerrado. Some of the ecoregions consist of only one geomorphological compartment, whereas others are heterogeneous, consisting of up to eight compartments. Ferralsols comprise the dominant soil type in 14 of the ecoregions. The percentage of protected areas within ecoregions ranges from 1.7% to 51.5%. The most endangered ecoregion, where land use change critically threatens habitat integrity, is the Depressao Carstica do Sao Francisco (states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, and Piaui), where environmental liability along riparian permanent protection areas amounts to 85.6% of the total area. Our proposed ecoregion map provides a spatial framework for regional and local assessments to improve decision-making processes to reconcile conservation and restoration planning, sustainable agriculture, and provision of ecosystem services. Besides de adjustment of the previous Cerrado's ecoregion map to the official biome boundary (relevant for the implementation of public policies of conservation as those regulated by the Brazilian Forest Code), the new analyses of the ecoregion map represent a substantial improvement in comparison to the ones conducted by the previous study in 2003. In addition, current web resources allow us to make all the information used or derived from this study available to other users. This opens the possibility of additional improvements of our findings by the scientific community or to be used effectively by decision makers.

AB Leaf-cutting ants, being the principal herbivores and ecosystem engineers in the Neotropics, have been considered to be a keystone species in natural ecosystems and agroecosystems, due to the direct and indirect effects of their plant defoliation activities. This review summarizes current concepts of the biological and ecological importance of leafcutting ants. The ants' pest status is briefly assessed from both ecological and evolutionary points of view. A general overview of control measures is provided. Leaf-cutting ants have evolved physical, symbiotic and behavioural mechanisms that allow them to overcome the chemical, biological, mechanical and cultural methods that have been used to manage their populations. Given the highly complex ecology of these ants, simple methods of control should not be expected. Sound management strategies must alternate between, and combine, different methods.

AB Payments for Environmental Services (PES) have been claimed as a more efficient way of accomplishing conservation and development goals than other indirect strategies, reaching their optimum when the buyer pays the opportunity costs of the foregone benefits. Different inefficient situations have been described, like lack of additionality, where payments are given for practices that would have been adopted anyway. Trade-offs between efficiency and equity of PES have usually emerged as well. In this paper we assess the equity, additionality and stakeholders' perceptions of a PES scheme in a Mexican community inside a Biosphere Reserve. We applied structured interviews to all adults, a total of 66 people from 31 households. Our results show a dual response in equity and additionality, depending on land tenure. PES have an egalitarian effect within landowners and landless groups, but it broadens the gap between them. Additionality is low for landowners and high for the landless people in the community, even though the former are the ones with full decision over the land. Although the scheme does not seem efficient under the classical PES paradigm, it is perceived as a reward, reinforcing conservation attitudes even though most of the interviewees claim it to be insufficient.

AB Large-scale soy agriculture in the southern Brazilian Amazon now rivals deforestation for pasture as the region's predominant form of land use change. Such landscape-level change can have substantial consequences for local and regional hydrology, but these effects remain relatively unstudied in this ecologically and economically important region. We examined how the conversion to soy agriculture influences water balances and stormflows using stream discharge (water yields) and the timing of discharge (stream hydrographs) in small (2.5-13.5 km2) forested and soy headwater watersheds in the Upper Xingu Watershed in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. We monitored water yield for 1 year in three forested and four soy watersheds. Mean daily water yields were approximately four times higher in soy than forested watersheds, and soy watersheds showed greater seasonal variability in discharge. The contribution of stormflows to annual streamflow in all streams was low (< 13% of annual streamflow), and the contribution of stormflow to streamflow did not differ between land uses. If the increases in water yield observed in this study are typical, landscape-scale conversion to soy substantially alters water-balance, potentially altering the regional hydrology over large areas of the southern Amazon.

AB Understanding the forces that allow multiple species to coexist remains a central focus of community ecology. Building evidence that evolutionary changes frequently occur on timescales relevant for ecological dynamics suggests that a complete understanding of the maintenance of diversity is likely to require incorporation of evolutionary dynamics. Coexistence mechanisms can be classified into two groups on the basis of whether they reduce inherent differences in species performance (equalizing effects) or buffer against extinction by providing advantages to rare species (stabilizing effects). Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that rapid evolution can increase equalizing and/or stabilizing effects in several ways. Directional evolutionary changes can result in new ecological conditions that are more equal or stable than the initial state. Additionally, coevolution between competitors or consumers can lead to cyclic dynamics that provide novel evolutionary equalizing or stabilizing effects.

AB The new approaches advocated by the conservation community to integrate conservation and livelihood development now explicitly address landscape mosaics composed of agricultural and forested land rather than only protected areas and largely intact forests. We refer specifically to a call by Harvey et al. (2008) to develop a new approach based on six strategies to integrate biodiversity conservation with sustainable livelihoods in Mesoamerican landscape mosaics. We examined the applicability of this proposal to the coffee agroforests of the Western Ghats, India. Of the six strategies, only one directly addresses livelihood conditions. Their approach has a clear emphasis on conservation and, as currently formulated risks repeating the failures of past integrated conservation and development projects. It fails to place the aspirations of farmers at the core of the agenda. Thus, although we acknowledge and share the broad vision and many of the ideas proposed by this approach, we urge more balanced priority setting by emphasizing people as much as biodiversity through a careful consideration of local livelihood needs and aspirations.

AB Tree planting in the tropics is conducted for a number of reasons including carbon sequestration, but often competes with increasingly scarce water resources. The basics of forest and water relations are frequently said to be well understood but there is a pressing need to better understand and predict the hydrological effects of land-use and climate change in the complex and dynamic landscapes of the tropics. This will remain elusive without the empirical data required to feed hydrological process models. It is argued that the current state of knowledge is confused by too broad a use of the terms 'forest' and '(af)forestation', as well as by a bias towards using data generated mostly outside the tropics and for nondegraded soil conditions. Definitions of forest, afforestation and reforestation as used in the climate change community and their application by land and water managers need to be reconciled.

AB We analyze the impact of grazing on dung beetle diversity at the Barranca de Metztitlan Biosphere Reserve, a xeric ecosystem in central Mexico with a long history of use by humans. We compared the community structure, as well as the alpha and beta diversity between two cover conditions (open and closed vegetation) that represent the impact of grazing within a habitat, and between habitat types (submountainous and crassicaule scrublands). From 576 samples we collected 75,605 dung beetles belonging to 20 taxa. While mean species richness and diversity were different between habitat types, cumulative species richness was not. The effects of grazing on vegetation structure influenced the cumulative species richness and diversity of dung beetles in the submountainous scrubland, where grazing has created land mosaics of a grassland matrix with scrubland patches. This was not the case in the crassicaule scrubland where the impact of grazing is not as evident. Beta diversity significantly responds to the effects of grazing on habitat conditions. We discuss the ecological factors that may promote these responses by landscape diversity components. We also identify the species that could act as useful indicators to monitor the effect of land management on biodiversity. Our results indicate cattle farming maintains a diversified land mosaic, and these areas support more diverse dung beetle ensembles than homogeneous areas of closed, shrubby vegetation cover. Thus, controlled grazing activity could certainly favour the conservation of dung beetle biodiversity and improve ecosystem functioning by maintaining dung decomposition rates.

AB Ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) assemblages were sampled with pitfall traps in three different habitats associated with a rehabilitated mine district and in undisturbed forests in Tuscany, Italy. The four habitats were (1) open fields (3-4 years old); (2) a middle-age mixed plantation (10 years); (3) an old-age mixed plantation (20 years); and (4) an oak woodland (40 years) not directly affected by mining activities. The aim of the study was to analyze ant recolonization patterns in order to provide insights on the use of Mediterranean ant fauna as indicators of restoration processes. Species richness and diversity were not significantly different among the four habitats. However, multivariate analyses showed that the assemblages in the different habitats were clearly differentiated, with similarity relationships reflecting a successional gradient among rehabilitated sites. The observed patterns of functional group changes along the gradient broadly accord with those of previous studies in other biogeographic regions. These were (1) a decrease of dominant Dolichoderinae and opportunists; (2) an increase in the proportion of cold-climate specialists; and (3) the appearance of the Cryptic species in the oldest plantations, with a maximum of abundance in the woodland. In conclusion, the results of our study supported the use of Mediterranean ants as a suitable tool for biomonitoring of restoration processes, and in particular, the functional group approach proved a valuable framework to better interpret local trends in terms of global ecological patterns. Further research is, however, needed in order to obtain a reliable classification of Mediterranean ant functional groups.

AB An important challenge for riparian management is to determine the extent to which landscape context influences the faunal assemblages of riparian habitats. We examined this challenge in the variegated landscapes of southeastern Queensland, Australia where riparian vegetation is surrounded by both extensive grazing and intensive cropping. We investigated whether riparian habitats adjacent to different landuses support similar bird assemblages. Three types of riparian habitat condition were sampled (uncleared ungrazed; uncleared grazed; cleared grazed) in four different land-use contexts (ungrazed woodland; grazed woodland; native pasture; crop) although only six of the 12 possible treatment combinations were available. Eighty percent of bird species responded significantly to changes in both riparian habitat condition and landscape context, while fewer than 50% of species were significantly influenced by landscape context alone. The influence of landscape context on the bird assemblage increased as the surrounding land use became more intensive (e.g., woodland to native pasture to crop). Riparian zones have been shown to have consistently high biodiversity values relative to their extent. These findings suggest it is not enough to conserve riparian habitats alone, conservation and restoration plans must also take into consideration landscape context, particularly when that context is intensively used land.

AB Matrix quality affects probability of persistence in habitat patches in landscape simulation models while empirical studies show that both urban and agricultural land uses affect forest birds. However, due to the fact that forest bird abundance and species richness can be strongly influenced by local habitat factors, it is difficult to analyze matrix effects without confounding effects from such factors. Given this, our objectives were to (1) relate human-dominated land uses to forest bird abundance and species richness without confounding effects from other factors; (2) determine the scale at which forest birds respond to the matrix; and (3) identify whether certain bird migratory strategies or habitat associations vary in richness or abundance as a function of urban and agriculture land uses. Birds were surveyed at a single point count site 100 m from the edge of 23 deciduous forest patches near Ottawa, Ontario. Land uses surrounding each patch were measured within increasingly large circles from 200 to 5000 m radius around the bird survey site. Regression results suggest that effects of urban and agricultural land uses on forest birds (1) are not uniformly positive or negative, (2) can occur at different spatial scales, and (3) differentially affect certain groups of species. In general, agriculture appeared to affect species at a broad spatial scale (within 5 km), while urban land use had an impact at both a narrower spatial scale (within 1.8 km) and at the broad scale. Neotropical and short distance migrant birds seemed to be the most sensitive to land use intensification within the matrix. Limiting urban land use within approximately 200-1800 m of forest patches would be beneficial for Neotropical migrant birds, which are species of growing conservation concern in temperate North America.

AB 1. Prescribed burning is a key tool used in prairie and savanna restoration projects. The timing and frequency of prescribed fires are important variables to consider because they can differentially affect the survival of individual plant species, including noxious exotic species.
   2. We used annual censuses and population matrix analysis to evaluate the demographic consequences of burning on populations of the invasive species spotted knapweed Centaurea maculosa in a Michigan, USA, prairie restoration experiment. We compared spring, summer and autumn burns at two frequencies: annually (2000-03) and in alternate years (2001, 2003). We examined the effects of different seasons and frequencies of prescribed fire on the survival, growth and reproduction of C. maculosa populations, and used life-table response experiments and elasticity analyses to determine how season of fire affects population growth rates.
   3. We found that annual summer burning was the only treatment that significantly reduced overall population growth rates.
   4. The life-table response experiment analysis indicated which life stages contributed the most to changes in population growth rates under the different treatments. The summer burn treatments reduced population growth by reducing reproduction.
   5. The different burn treatments altered the elasticity structure of populations, but in general reproduction of adults as well as survival of non-reproductive adults and juveniles remained important in all treatments. This indicates that future attempts to control C. maculosa should focus on combinations of treatments targeting these life stages.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Management decisions regarding prescribed burning in grassland restoration projects should consider the responses of individual species already present in the system. In particular, it is important to consider the effects of burning on noxious invasive species that may or may not have different life histories and responses to fire compared with native species. Population matrix modelling provides a more complete picture of the effects of management on population responses compared with other measures based only on community composition and relative abundance. Depending on the goals of a restoration, non-traditional management options, such as summer burning in mid-west USA prairies, may be effective management tools for the control of invasive species.

AB Spix's disc-winged bats, Thyroptera tricolor, roost in young, rolled leaves of Heliconia or Calathea plants. In this paper, we examined how the combination of high habitat availability, low occupancy rate and short longevity of those roosts may affect the pattern of interactions among individuals in the population. We regularly censused a 5.69-ha study area in northeastern Costa Rica and examined patterns of association using mark-recapture data. Thyroptera tricolor formed behaviourally cohesive social groups of mixed sex, ranging in size from four to 14 individuals. Approximately 85% of dyads maintained associations over time periods of up to 100 days, and 40% of dyads maintained longer-term associations of at least 420 days across sex classes. Individuals within social groups did not always roost together, but they shared a small common roosting home range, which averaged just 0.19 ha. Members of different social groups rarely associated, although limited associations between members of select social groups in one subunit were observed. However, roosting home ranges of adjacent social groups often overlapped (up to 39% of home ranges, and up to 92% of the area of the smaller home range), and home range centres were situated less than 100 m apart. Thus, social groups rarely interacted but overlapped in space. The features of this social system are unique among bats and mammals in general, and point to groupings based on kinship or cooperation.

AB Genetic diversity was examined at 16 allozyme loci in 21 wild populations of the medicinal plant American ginseng, Panax quinquefolius L. (Araliaceae). This species has been harvested from forests in North America for more than 250 years. Average expected heterozygosity was significantly greater within protected populations (H-c = 0.076) than within populations in which harvesting was permitted (H-c = 0.070). More notably genetic structure was greater among Unprotected populations (G(ST) = 0.491) than among protected populations (G(ST) = 0.167). These differences in the level and distribution of genetic diversity in American ginseng populations indicate that harvesting may have significant evolutionary implications lot this species. Age class structure also shifted toward smaller. nonreproductive plants in Unprotected populations. Juvenile plants had lower genetic diversity (H-c = 0.067) than reproductive plants (H-c = 0.076) suggesting that conserving it proportion of the largest (oldest) plants in each population is important to protect reproductive fitness and the evolutionary potential of the species. Due to its high genetic structure. conservation recommendations include protecting populations throughout the range of P. quinquefolius.

AB I present the results of a 2-year experiment comparing seed predation, seed germination, and seedling survivorship patterns of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata in forest fragments and continuous forest. These empirical results were compared with natural patterns of recruitment in permanent 5,000 m(2) demographic plots adjacent to experimental areas. The number of naturally occurring seedlings established in demographic plots was 1.5-6 times greater in continuous forest than it was in 1-ha or 10-ha fragments. This result mirrors the pattern of seedling establishment in experimental transects, in which seeds in fragments were 3-7 times less likely to become established than those in continuous forest. Predation of experimentally sown seeds was extremely low at all sites, and is therefore not responsible for the observed pattern. Instead, reductions in seedling abundance in forest fragments are probably due to lower levels of seed germination. Forest fragments have higher air and soil temperatures, lower relative humidity, and increased leaf-litter accumulation, all of which can alter the cues used to initiate germination. While the growth of seedlings was similar in forest fragments and continuous forest, seedling survivorship in fragments was highly variable. These results suggest that altered environmental conditions may exacerbate reductions in plant recruitment resulting from modified plant-animal interactions. Strategies aimed at reducing the intensity of abiotic edge effects should therefore be incorporated into plant conservation efforts.

AB Plants potentially compete for seed dispersal. Selection may favour temporally segregated fruiting phenologies to minimize this competition and also to maintain resident populations of dispersal agents. Alternatively, selection may favour temporally aggregated fruiting phenologies when the effectiveness of seed dispersal agents varies seasonally or when large, synchronous fruit displays enhance dispersal. These evolutionary scenarios assume that plants share seed dispersal agents. This assumption and temporal overlap in fruiting phenologies were evaluated for the Miconia and Psychotria of central Panama. These two genera accounted for 18 and 27%, respectively, of 1096 fleshy fruits found in regurgitation or faecal samples taken from 2054 birds of 103 species netted in the forest understorey. Two species of manakins accounted for 62% (123/200) of all Miconia fruit taken. Three species of manakins and three species of migratory thrushes accounted for 97% (282/292) of all Psychotria fruits taken. There is a high potential for intrageneric competition for seed dispersal for both plant genera. Null model analyses showed that the fruiting phenologies of Miconia (14 species) are segregated in time, while fruiting of Psychotria (21 species) is highly aggregated. The Miconia were found in up to 24% of the diet samples for the two manakin species, suggesting that Miconia may be a critical resource for both species. The Psychotria fruited when the diversity of understorey fruits was greatest, suggesting a high potential for both intra- and extrageneric competition. The abundance and nomadism of the six bird species that consumed most Psychotria fruit peaked when the Psychotria fruited, supporting the enhancement hypothesis.

AB Canopy gap size can play a major role in determining composition of tree regeneration after disturbance. The effect of different positions within gaps and within the intact forest has received less study. We seeded six tree species onto two substrates (organic and undisturbed moss) in three positions along a north-south gradient within eight replicate 600-m(2) canopy gaps and in the intact forest south of each gap (the gap positions), in 1995 and 1996. Emergence of all species was strongly affected by gap position, seedbed substrate, and year, but there was little evidence of partitioning by gap position among the species. Average emergence was higher in the shady southern position in gaps and within the intact forest and significantly higher on organic than undisturbed moss substrates (with the exception of Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt., which showed no preference for seedbed). Seedling survival was greatest for all species in the south end of the gap, where soil moisture remained highest and light levels of approximately 20% full sun were adequate for survival. A species trade-off was observed in the understory of the intact forest, where differential survival based on shade-tolerance ranking occurred. To predict regeneration success in these forests, for either silvicultural purposes or to permit a better understanding of community dynamics and succession, it is important to consider the influence of position inside and outside of gaps and the nature of the seedbed substrate.

AB Structural heterogeneity of habitats is thought to influence spatial patterns of seed dispersal and of seed survival, two critical processes influencing seedling recruitment. Using the wind-dispersed tree Cercocarpus ledifolius in northeastern Utah, USA, we investigated patterns of initial seed arrival, seed survival, and longer-term seed accumulation among four structurally distinct microhabitats (beneath Cercocarpus, Juniperus, and woody shrubs, and in open interspaces). Initial density of seedfall into seed traps was generally greater beneath Cercocarpus than in the remaining microhabitats, which did not differ from one another. Patterns of initial seedfall density appear to be more affected by distance from a seed source than by the physical structure of the microhabitat. The total numbers of seeds arriving in a microhabitat type. however, likely differ greatly among sites due to large differences in the relative abundances of microhabitat types. Experiments with tethered seeds indicated that overall levels of post-dispersal seed predation were low. However, seed loss in 1995 differed significantly among microhabitats, with open microhabitats generally having greatest seed loss. Patterns of accumulated seeds on the ground, in the litter, and in the soil showed greater differences among microhabitats than did patterns of initial seed arrival. Open microhabitats had the fewest accumulated seeds and beneath C. ledifolius had the most. The redistribution of the reed shadow through time is likely a consequence of both secondary seed movement over winter and the disproportionately high levels of post-dispersal seed predation in open microhabitats. By following seeds through multiple phases of early recruitment, we demonstrated that seed distributions and the processes affecting seeds are heterogenous in space and temporally dynamic. These findings are important for understanding processes leading to the ultimate quantity and patterning of adult plant populations.

AB Tropical hummingbirds often forage in mixtures of several plant species. As a result, pollen is often transferred among heterospecific flowers. The ''Sexual Architecture Hypothesis,'' a paradigm of pollination ecology and angiosperm evolution, suggests that the severity of such interspecific pollen transfer should reflect the similarity in the architecture of sexual structures (specifically, placement of stigma and anthers) among the flowers involved. We evaluated the hypothesis with six species of Costa Rican cloud-forest plants varying greatly in sexual architecture but all pollinated by the same hummingbird, Lampornis calolaema. Captive Lampornis visited five long-styled, ''pollen-donor'' flowers of distylous, self-incompatible Palicourea lasiorrachis (Rubiaceae), then 20 short-styled recipient flowers of Palicourea, with or without five flowers of a second species intervening. We assessed intraspecific pollen transfer from Palicourea donors by counting pollen tubes in styles of the recipients. We examined interspecific pollen transfer between Palicourea and each of the five other species by counting heterospecific grains deposited on stigmas of Palicourea recipients, and Palicourea grains deposited on stigmas and anthers of the heterospecific flowers. In a separate experiment, we examined how mixed-species flower visits modified the pollen loads actually carried by birds. Results did not uphold the Sexual Architecture Hypothesis. A single visit to any heterospecific flower greatly affected the hummingbird's prior load of Palicourea pollen, regardless of where the second species placed its own pollen on the bird. Interspecific pollen transfer occurred consistently, but (1) heterospecific grains usurped little space on stigmas of Palicourea recipients and had no discernible effect on pollen-tube growth, whereas (2) few Palicourea grains landed specifically on anthers and stigmas of heterospecific flowers. Instead, numerous Palicourea grains apparently were scraped off on other floral structures such as the corolla. Consequently, every species of intervening flowers, regardless of its sexual architecture per se, strongly reduced pollen transfer from donor to recipient Palicourea flowers, on average by 76%. In fact, the most drastic reductions resulted from the two species whose sexual architectures least resembled that of Palicourea.
   Results imply that ''pollen scraping'' by floral structures other than anthers and stigmas may be important and widespread among some animal-pollinated flowers. Thus, except in cases where no other floral structures contact pollinators, the positions of anthers and stigmas alone may have little bearing on the severity of interspecific pollen transfer and competitive interactions among plants sharing pollinators.

AB Long-term human-induced impacts have significantly changed the Amazonian landscape. The most dramatic land cover and land use (LCLU) changes began in the early 1970s with the establishment of the Trans-Amazon Highway and large government projects associated with the expansion of agricultural settlement and cattle ranching, which cleared significant tropical forest cover in the areas of new and accelerated human development. Taking the changes in the LCLU over the past four decades as a basis, this study aims to determine the consequences of land cover (forest and savanna) and land use (pasturelands, mining and urban) changes on the hydroclimatology of the Itacaitinas River watershed area of the located in the southeastern Amazon region. We analyzed a multi-decadal Landsat dataset from 1973, 1984,1994, 2004 and 2013 and a 40-yr time series of water discharge from the Itacaitinas River, as well as air temperature and relative humidity data over this drainage area for the same period. We employed standard Landsat image processing techniques in conjunction with a geographic object-based image analysis and multi-resolution classification approach. With the goal of detecting possible long-term trends, non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was applied, based on a Sen slope estimator on a 40-yr annual PREC, TMED and RH time series, considering the spatial average of the entire watershed. In the 1970s, the region was entirely covered by forest (99%) and savanna (similar to 0.3%). Four decades later, only similar to 48% of the tropical forest remains, while pasturelands occupy approximately 50% of the watershed area. Moreover, in protected areas, nearly 97% of the tropical forest remains conserved, while the forest cover of non-protected areas is quite fragmented and, consequently, unevenly distributed, covering an area of only 30%. Based on observational data analysis, there is evidence that the conversion of forest cover to extensive and homogeneous pasturelands was accompanied by systematic modifications to the hydro climatology cycle of the Itacaignas watershed, thus highlighting drier environmental conditions due to a rise in the region's air temperature, a decrease in the relative humidity, and an increase in river discharge.

AB Recent analyses of Amazon runoff and gridded precipitation data suggest an intensification of the hydrological cycle over the past few decades in the following sense: wet season precipitation and peak river runoff (since approximate to 1980) as well as annual mean precipitation (since approximate to 1990) have increased, while dry season precipitation and minimum runoff have slightly decreased. There has also been an increase in the frequency of anomalously severe floods and droughts. To provide context for the special issue on Amazonia and its forests in a warming climate we expand here on these analyses. The contrasting recent changes in wet and dry season precipitation have continued and are generally consistent with changes in catchment-level peak and minimum river runoff as well as a positive trend of water vapor inflow into the basin. Consistent with the river records, the increased vapor inflow is concentrated to the wet season. Temperature has been rising by 0.7 degrees C since 1980 with more pronounced warming during dry months. Suggestions for the cause of the observed changes of the hydrological cycle come from patterns in tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Tropical and North Atlantic SSTs have increased rapidly and steadily since 1990, while Pacific SSTs have shifted during the 1990s from a positive Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) phase with warm eastern Pacific temperatures to a negative phase with cold eastern Pacific temperatures. These SST conditions have been shown to be associated with an increase in precipitation over most of the Amazon except the south and southwest. If ongoing changes continue, we expect forests to continue to thrive in those regions where there is an increase in precipitation with the exception of floodplain forests. An increase in flood pulse height and duration could lead to increased mortality at higher levels of the floodplain and, over the long term, to a lateral shift of the zonally stratified floodplain forest communities. Negative effects on forests are mainly expected in the southwest and south, which have become slightly drier and hotter, consistent with tree mortality trends observed at the RAINFOR Amazon forest plot network established in the early 1980s consisting of approximately 150 regularly censused 1ha plots in intact forests located across the whole basin.

AB We undertake a review of academic literature that examines the effectiveness and equity-related performance of PES initiatives targeting biodiversity conservation in tropical and sub-tropical countries. We investigate the key features of such analyses as regards their analytical and methodological approach and we identify emerging lessons from PES practice, leading to a new suggested research agenda. Our results indicate that analyses of PES effectiveness have to date focused on either ecosystem service provision or habitat proxies, with only half of them making explicit assessment of additionality and most describing that payments have been beneficial for land cover and biodiversity. Studies evaluating the impact of PES on livelihoods suggest more negative outcomes, with an uneven treatment of the procedural and distributive considerations of scheme design and payment distribution, and a large heterogeneity of evaluative frameworks. We propose an agenda for future PES research based on the emerging interest in assessing environmental outcomes more rigorously and documenting social impacts in a more comparative and contextually situated form.

AB The relationship between tree height and diameter is fundamental in determining community and ecosystem structure as well as estimates of biomass and carbon storage. Yet our understanding of how tree allometry relates to climate and whole organismal function is limited. We used the Forest Inventory and Analysis National Program database to determine height-diameter allometries of 2,976,937 individuals of 293 tree species across the United States. The shape of the allometric relationship was determined by comparing linear and nonlinear functional forms. Mixed-effects models were used to test for allometric differences due to climate and floristic (between angiosperms and gymnosperms) and functional groups (leaf habit and shade tolerance). Tree allometry significantly differed across the United States largely because of climate. Temperature, and to some extent precipitation, in part explained tree allometric variation. The magnitude of allometric variation due to climate, however, had a phylogenetic signal. Specifically, angiosperm allometry was more sensitive to differences in temperature compared to gymnosperms. Most notably, angiosperm height was more negatively influenced by increasing temperature variability, whereas gymnosperm height was negatively influenced by decreasing precipitation and increasing altitude. There was little evidence to suggest that shade tolerance influenced tree allometry except for very shade-intolerant trees which were taller for any given diameter. Tree allometry is plastic rather than fixed and scaling parameters vary around predicted central tendencies. This allometric variation provides insight into life-history strategies, phylogenetic history, and environmental limitations at biogeographical scales.

AB Global demand for agricultural products is expected to double in the next decades, putting tremendous pressure on agriculture to produce more. The bulk of this increase will come from developing countries, which host most biodiversity-rich areas of the planet. Whilst most biodiversity is found in production landscapes shared with people, where agriculture represents an increasing threat, international conservation organisations continue to focus on the maintenance and expansion of the network of protected areas. When conservation organisations partner with agricultural programmes, they promote low input, extensive agriculture. Combined with the focus on protected areas, this may exacerbate rather than mitigate conflicts between biodiversity conservation and agricultural production. Two models have been proposed to increase agricultural production whilst minimising the negative consequences for biodiversity: 'land sparing' and 'land sharing'. Although often polarized in debates, both are realistic solutions, depending on the local circumstances. We propose a number of criteria that could guide the choice towards one or the other. We conclude that general principles to be considered in both land sparing and land sharing are: managing spillover effects, maintaining resilience and ecosystem services, accounting for landscape structure, reducing losses and wastes, improving access to agricultural products in developing countries and changing consumption patterns in developed countries, and developing supportive markets and policies.

AB Originating most likely in the early Cretaceous, ants have diversified to become the world's most successful eusocial insects, occupyingmost terrestrial ecosystems and acquiring a global ecological footprint. Recent advances in our understanding of ant evolutionary history have been propelled by the use of molecular phylogenetic methods, in conjunction with a rich (and still growing) fossil record. Most extant ants belong to the formicoid clade, which contains similar to 90% of described species and has produced the most socially advanced and dominant forms. The remaining ants are old lineages of predominantly cryptobiotic species whose relationships to one another and to the formicoids remain unclear. Rooting the ant tree is challenging because of (a) a long branch separating ants from their nearest outgroup, and (b) heterogeneity in evolutionary rates and base composition among ant lineages. These factors will need to be given careful consideration in future phylogenomic studies of ants.

AB Global factors, such as climate change, international trade and introductions of exotic species are often elicited as contributors to the unprecedented rate of disease emergence, but few studies have partitioned these factors for global pandemics. Although contemporary correlative species distribution models (SDMs) can be useful for predicting the spatial patterns of emerging diseases, they focus mainly on the fundamental niche (FN) predictors (i.e. abiotic climate and habitat factors), neglecting dispersal and propagule pressure predictors (PP, number of non-native individuals released into a region). Using a validated, predictive and global SDM, we show that both FN and PP accounted for significant, unique variation to the distribution of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a pathogen implicated in the declines and extinctions of over 200 amphibian species worldwide. Bd was associated positively with vegetation, total trade and introduced amphibian hosts, nonlinearly with annual temperature range and non-significantly with amphibian leg trade or amphibian species richness. These findings provide a rare example where both FN and PP factors are predictive of a global pandemic. Our model should help guide management of this deadly pathogen and the development of other globally predictive models for species invasions and pathogen emergence influenced by FN and PP factors.

AB Land cover and land use surrounding, fragmented habitat can greatly impact species persistence by altering resource availability, edge effects, or the movement of individuals throughout a landscape. Despite the potential importance of the landscape matrix, ecologists still have limited understanding of the relative effects of different types of land cover and land uses on species patterns and processes in natural systems. Here we investigated whether Neotropical resident bird communities in limestone forest patches differed if they were embedded in three different human-dominated matrix types (agriculture, pert-urban development, and bauxite mining) relative to sites in continuous forest in central Jamaica. We found that species richness, community composition, and abundances were matrix-dependent, with agricultural landscapes supporting greater avian diversity and more intact community assemblages than either pen-urban or bauxite landscapes. Abundance of almost 70% of species differed in forest embedded in the different landscape matrix types. Traits related to resource use best predicted species responses, including diet guild, nest height, habitat association, and foraging strata. Insectivores, frugivores, canopy nesters, understory and canopy foragers, and forest-restricted species rarely observed in matrix habitats had lower abundances in forest fragments embedded in human-dominated matrix types than in continuous forest. In contrast, nectarivores, omnivores, granivores, ground and multi-strata nesters, ground foragers, and species regularly in matrix habitats were least sensitive to forest fragmentation. Results suggest that structure, composition, and land use disturbance regimes in matrix areas impact overall habitat quality in landscapes by potentially mediating resource availability inside as well as outside forest habitat. This study reinforces the importance of differentiating among land cover and land uses in fragmentation research and lends support to the hypothesis that resource availability may be a primary factor driving Neotropical bird responses to fragmentation.

ID AMAZONIAN FORESTS; EMISSIONS; DEFORESTATION; BIOMASS
AB Global awareness of the significance of the role that tropical forests play in the global carbon cycle has never been greater, but much uncertainty still exists as to the exact magnitude of this role. Here I review and attempt to synthesise the latest evidence of both the carbon source from tropical forest conversion, and the carbon sink in tropical vegetation. Tropical biome conversion is estimated to be a source of 1.3 +/- 0.2 Pg C year(-1) to the atmosphere in both periods 1990-1999 and 2000-2005, whereas intact tropical biomes were estimated to be a net carbon sink of 1.1 +/- 0.3 Pg C year(-1). The ratios of carbon source to carbon sink are very different for the different tropical continents, reflecting different rates of conversion and different area of forest cover, with tropical Asia probably a strong net carbon source and tropical Africa probably a strong net sink. The net balance of the tropical forest biomes is estimated to be +0.2 +/- 0.4 Pg C year(-1) (not significantly different from zero) over both periods 1990-1999 and 2000-2005; this result is consistent with that from atmospheric inversion models that better represent vertical CO2 profiles (+0.1 +/- 0.3 Pg C year(-1)).

AB We used households as the primary unit of analysis to synthesize agrobiodiversity research in small-scale coffee farms and cooperatives of Nicaragua and El Salvador. Surveys, focus groups, and plant inventories were used to analyze agrobiodiversity and its contribution to livelihoods. Households managed high levels of agrobiodiversity, including 100 shade tree and epiphyte species, food crops, and medicinals. Small farms contained higher levels of agrobiodiversity than larger, collectively managed cooperatives. Households benefited from agrobiodiversity through consumption and sales. To better support agrobiodiversity conservation, our analysis calls for a hybrid approach integrating bottom-up initiatives with the resources from top-down projects.

AB Following catastrophic disturbances, succession and vegetation development occur, but in the prolonged absence of these disturbances a decline (retrogressive) phase follows in which nutrient availability and tree biomass declines considerably. We measured plant diversity across six long-term chronosequences that each included retrogressive stages in Australia, New Zealand, Alaska, Hawaii and Sweden. In contrast to theories predicting negative or hump-shaped responses of tree diversity to biomass or soil fertility, tree species richness often peaked coincidentally with tree basal area (a surrogate of tree biomass), and declined during retrogression. Similar patterns were found regardless of whether or not species richness estimates were rarefraction-adjusted to correct for variation in stem densities across plots. The Shannon-Weiner diversity index sometimes showed the same pattern, but in two chronosequences was least when tree basal area peaked; this was driven by the domination of total basal area by single tree species in both cases. The decline in tree diversity during retrogression was often associated with reduced relative amounts of total phosphorus in soil. In contrast, total vascular plant species richness often increased during retrogression. These results demonstrate that forests with high tree diversity and biomass do not persist indefinitely in the long-term absence of catastrophic disturbance, and that similar patterns occur across the boreal, temperate and subtropical zones.

AB Spatial and temporal variation in recruitment can be the leading determinant of population fluctuations in species with pelagic larval stages. Characterizing and identifying the causes of such variation is, therefore, necessary to understand population dynamics, and to develop conservation and management strategies. We examined spatial patterns in settlement and recruitment of the intertidal barnacles Jehlius cirratus, Notochthamalus scabrosus and Notobalanus flosculus, and their relationships with environmental variables operating at meso- (sea surface temperature, SST) and small (local topography) scales. Settlement and recruitment were studied over 6 mo at biweekly intervals at 16 sites along 120 km of coastline in central Chile. All species showed similar temporal patterns, with a peak in settlement and recruitment during austral spring. We decomposed the spatial patterns into their corresponding meso-scale trend (from a few to 10s of kilometers) and into their small-scale (site) residual variation. Recruitment of chthamaloid species was highly and positively correlated at meso- and small-scales, and the among-site rankings showed consistency of the spatial structure throughout the recruitment season. SST explained a significant fraction of the variance in recruitment of the chthamaloids at the meso-scale, and spatial analysis showed coincident decorrelation scales of about 35 km for SST and recruitment. In contrast, recruitment of balanoid species did not show a clear spatial structure, was not associated with meso-scale variation in SST, and local topography seemed to play a significant role in their settlement. Topographically modified upwelling dynamics over scales of 10s of kilometers is the most plausible factor shaping meso-scale variation in recruitment of chthamaloid barnacles, whereas settlement and recruitment of balanoid species seem mort strongly influenced by processes acting at local scales. The spatial scale and structure of recruitment provide guidelines for the placement and spacing of protected areas in the region.

AB Irradiance is highly dynamic in many plant canopies. Photosynthesis during sunflecks provides 10-90% of daily carbon gain. The survivorship of tree seedlings in the deeply shaded understorey of tropical rain forests is limited by their ability to maintain a positive carbon balance. Dipterocarp seedlings from the SE Asian rain forest were used as a model system to test novel aspects of the physiological and ecological significance of sunflecks. First, understorey seedlings experienced leaf temperatures up to 38 degreesC in association with sunflecks. Under controlled environment conditions, the inhibition of carbon gain at 38 degreesC, compared with 28 degreesC, was significantly greater during a sequence of sunflecks (-59%), than under uniform irradiance (-40%), providing the same total photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Second, the relative enhancement effects of elevated [CO2] were greater under sunflecks (growth +60%, carbon gain +89%), compared with uniform irradiance (growth +25%, carbon gain +59%), supplying the same daily PPFD. Third, seedling growth rates in the forest understorey were 4-fold greater under a dynamic irradiance treatment characterized by long flecks, compared with a regime of short flecks. Therefore, stresses associated with dynamic irradiance may constrain photosynthetic carbon gain. Additionally, seedling photosynthesis and growth may be more responsive to interactions with abiotic factors, including future changes in climate, than previously estimated. The sensitivity of seedling growth to varying patterns of dynamic irradiance, and the increased likelihood of species-specific responses through interactions with environmental factors, indicates the potential for sunflecks to influence regeneration processes, and hence forest structure and composition.

AB 1. Australia's savannas typically are burnt every 1-3 years. Although there are concerns about the effect of frequent fire on recruitment of Australian savanna species, there is a lack of information. This research aimed to determine whether seed or microsite availability limits seedling recruitment of the overstorey tree Eucalyptus miniata and the midstorey shrub Acacia oncinocarpa, whether seed or microsite availability is affected by frequent fire, and the consequent effect on seedling recruitment.
   2. Quadrats were established in unburnt areas. Experimental manipulations were addition of seed and/or disturbance of the soil surface to increase the number of microsites suitable for germination. In a second experiment, seed was added to quadrats established in three fire regimes after the annual burning event (unburnt, burnt early in the dry season, burnt late in the dry season).
   3. In unburnt areas, seedling regeneration was limited by both seed supply and microsite availability. Both burning regimes reduced seedling emergence, possibly because the reduced canopy cover caused unfavourable microclimate, the increased grass and forb ground cover increased competition for resources, and there was increased loss of seed to seed harvesters.
   4. The results indicate that sexual regeneration of these common species is disadvantaged by current burning practices because both seed supply and the number of microsites are reduced. Thus, long-term changes in savanna floristic structure seem likely unless fire managers aim to increase the fire-free intervals. The relative abundance of species able to reproduce vegetatively may increase under frequent fire regimes. Such a change may take a long time to detect given the fire-resistant and long-lived nature of overstorey species, and the capacity for vegetative regeneration in many savanna species. The impacts of fire on limiting seedling regeneration will require savanna managers to consider fire-free intervals of several years for effective recruitment of dominant woody species.

AB This paper synthesises information on the food requirements of soil macroinvertebrates and some of their effects on soil organic matter dynamics. Some clues to techniques that would optimise their activities through organic matter management are suggested. Soil macroinvertebrates can consume almost any kind of organic residues in mutualistic association with soil microflora. Significant amounts estimated at several T per ha of predominantly easily assimilable C are used yearly in natural ecosystems as energy to sustain these activities. Sources of C used are highly variable depending on the feeding regime. The largest part of the energy assimilated (e.g., 50% by the tropical earthworm Millsonia anomala) is actually spent in burrowing and soil transport and mixing. Bioturbation often affects several thousand tons of soil per hectare per year and several tenth of m(3) of voids are created in soil. A great diversity of biogenic structures accumulate and their nature and persistance over time largely controls hydraulic soil properties. The OM integrated into the compact biogenic structures (termite mounds, earthworm globular casts) is often protected from further decomposition. Most management practices have negative effects on the diversity and abundance of macroinvertebrate communities. Structures inherited from faunal activities may persist for some weeks to years and the relationship between their disappearance and soil degradation is rarely acknowledged. When SOM supply is maintained but diversity is not, the accumulation in excess of structures of one single category may have destructive effects on soil. It is therefore essential to design practices that provide the adequate organic sources to sustain the activity and diversity of invertebrates. Special attention should also be paid to the spatial array of plots and rotations in time.

ID PRIMATE
AB We provide the first documented case of the extinction in the twentieth century of a widely recognized primate taxon. During surveys in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire in 1993-1999, we were unable to find any surviving populations of Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey (Procolobus badius waldroni) a primate taxon endemic to the forests of this part of West Africa We conclude that this monkey, which at least one authority considers worthy of species status, is probably extinct. Hunting by humans appears to be the ultimate cause of the extinction. Until our surveys began, little attention had been paid to the plight of this red colobus monkey, despite its listing as endangered by the World Conservation Union. The extinction of other large animals in the Upper Guinea rainforest region is likely to follow soon unless more attention is paid to the full range of endangered forms and more resources are devoted to their rigorous protection.

AB Reproductive traits of tropical tree species vary predictably in relation to successional stage, but this variation may be due to the species' phylogenetic histories rather than selective pressures imposed by regeneration requirements. Reproductive phenology, tree size at the onset of reproduction, and fecundity of 11 sympatric, closely related Macaranga species were studied to investigate within-species variation in reproductive traits in relation to resource availability, and among-species variation in relation to other life-history traits (shade tolerance, seed size and maximum tree size, H-max) and consequently the requirements for forest-gap colonization. Nine species reproduced in synchronous episodes, and two species reproduced continuously over 32 mo. Episodic reproduction was most intense in 1992 following a severe drought. For several species, reproductive trees had greater light availability, lower fecundity in lower light levels, and lower growth rates than nonreproductive trees, reflecting resource-limited reproduction. Among species, H-max was negatively correlated with shade tolerance and seed size. Tree size at the onset of reproduction and fecundity was strongly linked to this axis of life-history variation, but phenological pattern was not. Absolute tree size at the onset of reproduction was positively correlated with H-max and negatively correlated with shade tolerance. Relative size at reproductive onset was not correlated with shade tolerance or H-max. Fecundity ranged four orders of magnitude among species and was correlated positively with H-max and negatively with seed size and shade tolerance. The interrelationships among these reproductive and other life-history traits are strongly correlated with the species' requirements for gap colonization.

AB Large-scale (>100 m(2)/day) raids by tropical army ants have been linked to litter ant patchiness and diversity. In three Neotropical forests, densities of litter ants vary 10-20 fold at the 1-m(2) scale. A survey of Barro Colorado Island, Panama, revealed that most army ant raids also occur on a 1-m(2) scale with fronts less than or equal to 1 m wide. To explore the role that such small scale disturbance may play in creating litter ant patchiness, all litter ant nests were removed from 1-m(2) plots. Control and disturbance plots were resampled 3 months later. In contrast to a previous study of large litter gaps, ant foundresses did not appear to prefer these smaller gaps. Nest densities, species richness, and species composition differed most from controls in a dry hilltop forest in Panama, second most in a wetter ravine forest nearby, and least in a Costa Rican wet forest. Disturbance may not leave a lasting signature in the wetter forests due to higher background levels of disturbance, faster recovery, or both.

AB Seedlings of Inga fagifolia (L.) Willd. and I. pezizifera Benth. were planted into the understory of a Costa Rican rain forest to test whether the proximity of large-leaved dwarf plams and cyclanths affects seedling growth and survival and if so, whether that effect is primarily due to above or belowground processes. In two sites, seedlings were planted either near palms (or palm-like Cyclanthaceae) or nearby in sites with no overarching vegetation under 1.5 m. Half of the seedlings in each treatment were trenched to a depth of 30 cm by cutting all roots 25 cm from the seedling. The proximity of palms or cyclanths significantly affected growth and survival of both species. However, most of this effect could be attributed to loss of stem length due to herbivore or pathogen damage rather than to differences in growth rates. There was no significant effect of trenching on seedling growth. Vegetation data from ten widely distributed sites in the forest showed that seedling density was inversely correlated with the abundance of understory palms and cyclanths. Our data suggest that understory vegetation, especially broad-leaved palms and palm-like cyclanths, acts as a filter affecting the distribution and abundance of establishing seedlings.

AB Ethnopharmacological importance: The use of medicinal plants for treatment, cure and prevention of diseases has been described by many people since time immemorial. Because of this use, commercial and scientific interests have emerged, making it necessary to realize ethnobotanical surveys of medicinal plants species, which is important for subsequent chemical and pharmacological bioprospections. Aim of the study: This study aimed at surveying, identifying, cataloging and documenting the medicinal plants species used in the Valley of Juruena, Northwestern Mato Grosso, Legal Amazon Brazil for the treatment of various human diseases, as well as assessed the species of interest for bioprospecting potential.
   Materials and methods: Informants were interviewed using semi-structured form to capture information on socio-demographic and ethnopharmacological data of medicinal plants such as vernacular name, uses, geographic origin, habit, form of preparation and part used.
   Results were analyzed using descriptive and quantitative means: indices of use-report (Ur) and informant consensus factor (ICF), for the selection of plant species with therapeutic potential. Results: Three hundred and thirty two (332) plants species belonging to 90 families were reported for medicinal purposes and totaling 3973 use-reports were reported by 365 (92.9%) of the people interviewed. Asteraceae (32.2%), Fabaceae (26.7%) and Lamiaceae (24.4%) families were the most represented, with majority being species native (64.45%) to Brazil. Leaves (64.5%) were the part of the plant most used and infusion (45.7%) was the most utilized form. Gastrointestinal disorders followed by respiratory complaints topped the list of use-reports. The native or naturalized plants with the highest use reports in the order of decreasing absolute frequency per each emic-category are Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapfc (104), Mentha pulegium L (94), Arrabidaea chica (Humb. 82 Bonpl.) B. Verl. (97), Altemanthera brasiliana (L) Kuntze (71), Baccharis crispa Spreng (57), Phyllanthus niruri L (48), Gossypium barbadense L. (44), Solidago microglossa DC. (40) and Bauhinia forficata L. (20). And the most cited exotics are: Chenopodium ambrosioides L (151), Aloe vera (L) Burm. E, (89) and Rosmarinus officinalis L (72). In some cases, high ICF values were found, which reflects high degree of homogeneity of consensus among informants in this region on medicinal plants.
   Conclusion: The population of Valle of Juruena makes use of a wide array of medicinal plants distributed in all use categories with predominance of those use in the treatments of gastrointestinal and respiratory ailments. The therapeutic potential of some of the species of medicinal importance extensively utilized by the population of the region have been scientifically validated, and are therefore promising prototype of new drugs. However, there are some of these species whose ethnomedicinal uses are yet to be scientifically verified and thus constitute an unexplored terrain for future biological/pharmacological studies.

AB Overfishing and environmental change have triggered many severe and unexpected consequences. As existing communities have collapsed, new ones have become established, fundamentally transforming ecosystems to those that are often less productive for fisheries, more prone to cycles of booms and busts, and thus less manageable. We contend that the failure of fisheries science and management to anticipate these transformations results from a lack of appreciation for the nature, strength, complexity, and outcome of species interactions. Ecologists have come to understand that networks of interacting species exhibit nonlinear dynamics and feedback loops that can produce sudden and unexpected shifts. We argue that fisheries science and management must follow this lead by developing a sharper focus on species interactions and how disrupting these interactions can push ecosystems in which fisheries are embedded past their tipping points.

AB In order to achieve conservation and development, direct strategies, such as Payments for Environmental Services (PES), have been claimed to be potentially more effective than indirect strategies, like Integrated Conservation and Development Projects (ICDPs). However, PES have raised some concerns on the commodification of nature and the potential replacement of non-chrematistic forms of valuing ecosystems. This article evaluates PES and ICDPs in La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, by analyzing the programs' fund allocation, examining conservation perceptions based on 731 structured interviews and presenting a detailed assessment of ICDP/PES preferences in a community with the longest participation in both schemes. People receiving PES tend to make the future of conservation contingent on monetary and utilitarian reasons, this preference increasing with the number of years receiving PES. These are preferred for their directness and short-term results, although raising concerns about the little social capital they generate. ICDPs are appreciated for arising environmental awareness, being linked with long term conservation, productive capacity and social capital building. Negative perceptions of ICDPs are related to past economic failures. Our results suggest that the real issue is not PES vs. ICDPs but how to combine them to find the proper sequence while reinforcing intrinsic value-based attitudes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

   PHOTOSYNTHESIS
AB Engineering higher photosynthetic efficiency for greater crop yields has gained significant attention among plant biologists and breeders. To achieve this goal, manipulation of metabolic targets and canopy architectural features has been heavily emphasized. Given the substantial variations in leaf anatomical features among and within plant species, there is large potential to engineer leaf anatomy for improved photosynthetic efficiency. Here we review how different leaf anatomical features influence internal light distribution, delivery of CO2 to Rubisco and water relations, and accordingly recommend features to engineer for increased leaf photosynthesis under different environments. More research is needed on (a) elucidating the genetic mechanisms controlling leaf anatomy, and (b) the development of a three dimensional biochemical and biophysical model of leaf photosynthesis, which can help pinpoint anatomical features required to gain a higher photosynthesis.

AB The fate of much of the world's terrestrial biodiversity is linked to the management of human-modified forest landscapes in the humid tropics. This Special Issue presents the first pan-tropical synthesis of research on the prospects for biodiversity in such systems, with eight individual regional summaries covering Mesoamerica, Amazonia, Atlantic forest of South America, West Africa, Madagascar, Western Ghats, Southeast Asia and Oceania. Two additional papers compare the state of conservation science in tropical forests with both temperate forests and savannah systems. This overview paper provides a comparative analysis of the threats and opportunities facing tropical forest biodiversity, thereby helping to identify the most pressing areas of future research and region-specific factors that contribute towards the effectiveness of individual conservation initiatives. While many of the threats facing tropical forest biodiversity are commonplace they vary markedly in their relative importance across different regions. There is a critical lack of comparable data to understand scale dependent processes, or the relative importance of varying geographic and historical contexts in determining present-day patterns. Conservation science has a key role to play in safeguarding the future of tropical forest biodiversity, but needs to become more effectively embedded in the context of real-world conservation challenges and opportunities. Significant progress can be achieved by improving the cost-effectiveness of research as well as the exchange of ideas and data amongst scientists working in different, often isolated parts of the world. We hope this special issue goes some way top achieving this exchange of knowledge. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Long-term climate-growth relationships, were examined in tree rings of four co-occurring tree species from semi-arid Acacia savanna woodlands in Ethiopia. The main purpose of the study was to prove the presence of annual tree rings, evaluate the relationship between radial growth and climate parameters, and evaluate the association of El Nino and drought years in Ethiopia. The results showed that all species studied form distinct growth boundaries, though differences in distinctiveness were revealed among the species. Tree rings of the evergreen Balanites aegyptiaca were separated by vessels surrounding a thin parenchyma band and the growth boundary of the deciduous acacias was characterized by thin parenchyma bands. The mean annual diameter increment ranged from 3.6 to 5.0 mm. Acacia senegal and Acacia seyal showed more enhanced growth than Acacia tortilis and B. aegyptiaca. High positive correlations were found between the tree-ring width chronologies and precipitation data, and all species showed similar response to external climate forcing, which supports the formation of one tree-ring per year. Strong declines in tree-ring width correlated remarkably well with past El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and drought/famine periods in Ethiopia. Spectral analysis of the master tree-ring chronology indicated occurrences of periodic drought events, which fall within the spectral peak equivalent to 2-8 years. Our results proved the strong linkage between tree-ring chronologies and climate, which sheds light on the potential of dendrochronological studies developing in Ethiopia. The outcome of this study has important implications for paleoclimatic reconstructions and in restoration of degraded lands.

AB Soil dwelling ants are important soil engineers that have a large impact on the soil ecosystem. This is reflected in the alteration of soil properties by ants due to burrowing activities, the accumulation of organic matter and other nutrients in the soil, which, in turn, alters soil physical, chemical and (micro) biological processes. A review of recent literature on these fine scale soil changes resulting from ant activity is presented in this paper. However, ants do not only affect soil properties at the fine scale but also have effects at the hillslope and catchment scales with respect to surface hydrological processes and ecosystem functioning. At the finest scale, most studies showed changed soil textures, lowered bulk densities and increased infiltration where ant burrows or mineral mounds are prominent. Only a few studies investigated the effects of ants on soil properties such as soil structure and aggregate stability, which were improved by ant activity. Nutrients were generally considered to be concentrated in nests, and increased nutrient cycling involving microbial processes were reported. On a broader scale, the information on nest densities and patterns is crucial to understand the impacts of ants, but this information is scarcely available. It has been reported that the activity of ants increases the heterogeneity of soil infiltration rates and nutrient concentrations at the landscape scale, which in turn has consequences for the redistribution of sediments and nutrients by geomorphological and biotic processes. A hierarchical descriptive model focusing on dry land ecosystems is presented to incorporate small-scale ant activity into broader scale hillslope and catchment processes. However, this model has to be tested and more research is needed, especially on these broader scale aspects, to be able to fully understand the role of ants on the ecosystem and landscape scale.

AB Fragmentation is a severe threat to tropical rainforests. However the habitat loss and less extensive fragmentation caused by roads can also be a threat, not only through allowing access to remote areas, but also through a suite of insidious associated impacts. These include abiotic and biotic edge effects adjacent to road clearings, the disturbance impacts caused by vehicle operation, invasions by weeds, feral and alien fauna and disease, and faunal mortality from vehicle collisions. In combination, these can create a significant barrier to movements of rainforest biota. Impacts can be ameliorated through clever road design and sustainable vehicle operation.

AB We analysed the composition and configuration patterns of the forested landscape in the Cantabrian range (NW Spain) determining how different forest communities are currently affected by long-term fragmentation process. We also evaluated the regional reserve network in relation to forest fragmentation and forest heterogeneity at the landscape level. The current landscape scenario is characterised by low forest habitat cover (22%) and a fragment size distribution strongly skewed towards small values (< 10 ha). Forest classes differ strongly in fragment size, internal heterogeneity, shape, dispersion and isolation. Beech forests were less fragmented than other types, being the dominant class in terms of surface and fragment occurrence. Fragmentation was heavier in forests occurring in agriculture-suitable areas (i.e. valley bottoms, southern exposures), such as ash-maple and oak forests, as well as in second-growth forests developed after tree-line deforestation for pastures (i.e. holly and rowan forests). The current reserve network in the Asturias region covers preferentially bigger and less isolated forest fragments. This was a consequence of protection biased towards beech forests, to the detriment of an adequate representativeness of most other forest types, some of them with high ecological value. Future expansion of the reserve network should be based on landscape information, to promote both the protection of well-conserved, less-fragmented forests as well as the inclusion of under-represented target forest types.

AB Theoretical and empirical ecologists have long acknowledged that information about the intensity or strength of the interaction between species is crucial for an understanding of community dynamics. In communities in which predation is an important structuring process, and some predator species are commercially exploited, quantitative estimates of predation by different predator species within a guild are necessary to make even the simplest recommendations about conservation and resource management. Here, we evaluated per capita and population level components of predation intensity of three intertidal predators that feed on monospecific stands of barnacles and mussels at wave exposed sites in the rocky intertidal zone of central Chile. These prey species represent the two most distinctive stages of the mid-intertidal seascape, with mussels being competitively dominant. Our results showed that the commercially exploited gastropod Concholepas concholepas and the sea star Heliaster helianthus have similarly large per capita and population effects on the competitively dominant mussel Perumytilus purpuratus. Their per capita (by average size individual) and population effects on mussels were more than two orders of magnitude larger than those of Acanthocyclus gayi crabs and likely even larger than the effect of other predator species in this system (other crabs, whelks, birds, fish). The overall pattern of predation on barnacles was similar to that on mussels, but some differences occurred in the way different components of predation intensity were distributed across predator species. Despite the roughly similar pattern of population predation intensity between prey species, the expected consequences for the prey population, and hence the rest of the community, were acutely different for mussels and barnacles.

AB We studied the dispersal system of the tree Commiphora guillaumini (Burseraceae) in a dry deciduous forest of western Madagascar by measuring tree visitation, fruit consumption, and seed dispersal rates of primary dispersers and the modification of the primary seed shadow by secondary dispersers. The seed dispersal system of C. guillaumini is unusually simple because primary seed dispersal and secondary seed dispersal are each effectively carried out by a single species: primary dispersal by the Lesser Vasa Parrot, Coracopsis nigra, and secondary dispersal by the ant Aphaenogaster swammerdami. The quality of seed dispersal by each disperser was measured by comparing seed distributions with seedling distributions. Although parrots dispersed only 7.9 +/- 6.0% (mean +/- 1 SD) of the seeds away from the crown, these seeds had a probability of becoming established as seedlings that was 35.4 times higher than that of seeds that were dropped beneath the crown or that simply fell from the crown. Ants secondarily dispersed 45.1 +/- 23.2% of the seeds. However, ants increased the establishment success of seedlings more weakly and less consistently than did parrots. Establishment success of seeds dispersed by ants was 4.5 times higher in one year but only 1.1 times higher in another year than that of seeds not dispersed by ants. Although secondary seed dispersal by ants played an important role in the redistribution of seeds and affected the establishment of seedlings, the importance of primary dispersers exceeded that of secondary dispersers by an order of magnitude.

AB 1. The relationship between seed and seedling spatial patterns of abundance was examined for five tree species in a deciduous forest of north-eastern North America. In this low-diversity forest, seed shadows (from different individuals of a given tree species) may overlap to a significant extent. The selective advantages of greater seed dispersal ability in order to avoid high predation and pathogen attack and intraspecific competition at proximity to the parent tree is unclear in this context.
   2. On the study site, there were no strong and consistent relationships between seed and seedling spatial patterns of abundance for any of the tree species studied. Dispersion patterns of seeds or seedlings varied between quadrats and did not necessarily correspond within any one quadrat: e.g. clumped seeds and randomly dispersed seedlings. Seeds of Betula alleghaniensis were positively associated, but its seedlings were negatively associated, with those of the other tree species. Good seed dispersal ability and highly specific germination microsites may partly explain these latter observations.
   3. Seed or seedling mortality for Acer saccharum was not strongly related to seed or seedling abundance, leading to rejection of the hypothesis that seed and seedling mortality was density dependent for this species on the study site. Moreover, seed mortality was spatially uncoupled from seedling mortality. Spatial and temporal variation in the relative importance of mortality factors (e.g. predation, pathogen attack and competition) on seeds and seedlings may account for these results. Because many factors seem to control seed and seedling spatial patterns of abundance and mortality on any one site. and because the significance of these factors appears to vary over time, the relationship between seed and seedling spatial patterns in old-growth forests may often be obscure.

AB Payments for Environmental Services (PES) has become a popular means to neoliberalize biodiversity conservation throughout the world. Yet research on PES is increasingly focused on debating exactly how neoliberal programmes really are, documenting complexities in PES implementation and concluding that few programmes are very market-based in practice. While we agree that ideal neoliberal implementation of PES does not and cannot exist, we argue that focusing (only) on micro-politics misunderstands the importance of analysing PES as a form of neoliberal conservation. The question is not just whether PES is innately neoliberal but how it functions within a broader neoliberal political economy. By focusing on the overarching governance and power structures that gave rise to PES in the first place, we more clearly see what we call 'the PES conceit', namely that the approach implicitly accepts neoliberal capitalism as both the problem and the solution to the ecological crisis. This strategy is not only contradictory but also commonly fails to achieve intended outcomes, falling far short of conservation objectives while also often exacerbating socioeconomic inequality. This problematic conceit, we conclude, cannot be addressed through only micro-oriented studies; it demands connecting micro- and macro political economic analyses to confront broader neoliberal power structures.

AB Multiple niche-based processes including conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) determine plant regeneration and community structure. We ask how interspecific and intraspecific density-dependent interactions relate to plant life histories and associated functional traits. Using hierarchical models, we analysed how such interactions affected first-year survival of seedling recruits of 175 species in a tropical forest, and how species abundances and functional traits are related to interspecific variation in density-dependent effects. Conspecific seedling neighbour effects prevailed over the effects of larger conspecific and all heterospecific neighbours. Tolerance of seedling CNDD enhanced recruit survival and subsequent abundance, all of which were greater among larger seeded, slow-growing and well-defended species. Niche differentiation along the growth-survival trade-off and tolerance of seedling CNDD strongly correlated with regeneration success, with manifest consequences for community structure. The ability of larger seeded species to better tolerate CNDD suggests a novel mechanism for CNDD to contribute to seed-size variation and promote species coexistence through a tolerance-fecundity trade-off.

AB This study provides an approximation of the potential impact of fuelwood harvesting in one of the most threatened tropical biodiversity conservation hotspots, the northern portion of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We test the relationship between fuelwood consumption and per capita income for 270 households distributed over 7 rural settlements. In general 76% of the households use fuelwood regularly and consume on average 686 kg/person/year of tree biomass, poorer people, however, consume 961 kg/person/year. Harvesting is concentrated to a few early successional species. Yet, annual rural population demand from 210 municipalities may reach 303,793 tons, equivalent to 1.2 to 2.1 thousand hectares of tropical forest. Fuelwood harvesting cannot be ignored as a major and chronic source of forest degradation in highly fragmented and densely populated landscapes and conciliating biodiversity conservation with poverty amelioration is an urgent task.

AB Elevation gradients provide opportunities to explore environmental controls on forest structure and functioning. We used airborne imaging spectroscopy and lidar (light detection and ranging) to quantify changes in three-dimensional forest structure and canopy functional traits in twenty 25 ha landscapes distributed along a 3300m elevation gradient from lowland Amazonia to treeline in the Peruvian Andes. Elevation was positively correlated with lidar-estimated canopy gap density and understory vegetation cover, and negatively related to canopy height and the vertical partitioning of vegetation in canopies. Increases in canopy gap density were tightly linked to increases in understory plant cover, and larger gaps (20-200 m(2)) produced 2530 times the response in understory cover than did smaller gaps (< 5 m(2)). Vegetation NDVI and photosynthetic fractional cover decreased, while exposed non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare soil increased, with elevation. Scaling of gap size to gap frequency (lambda) was, however, nearly constant along the elevation gradient. When combined with other canopy structural and functional trait information, this suggests near-constant canopy turnover rates from the lowlands to treeline, which occurs independent of decreasing biomass or productivity with increasing elevation. Our results provide the first landscape-scale quantification of forest structure and canopy functional traits with changing elevation, thereby improving our understanding of disturbance, demography and ecosystem processes in the Andes-to-Amazon corridor.

AB P> Many hypotheses about species coexistence involve differential resource use and trade-offs in species' life-history traits. Quantifying resource use across most species in diverse communities, although, has seldom been attempted.
   We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the light dependence of recruitment in 263 woody species in a 50-ha long-term forest census plot in Panama. Data on sapling recruitment were obtained using the 1985-1990 and 1990-1995 census intervals. Available light was estimated for each recruit from yearly censuses of canopy density.
   We use a power function (linear log-log relationship) to model the light effect on recruitment. Different responses of recruitment to light are expressed by the light effect parameter b. The distribution of b had a central mode at 0.8, suggesting that recruitment of many species responds nearly linearly to increasing light.
   Nearly every species showed increases in recruitment with increasing light. Just nine species (3%) had recruitment declining with light, while 198 species (75%) showed increasing recruitment in both census intervals. Most of the increases in recruitment were decelerating, i.e. the increase was less at higher light (b < 1). In the remaining species, the response to light varied between census intervals (24 species) or species did not have recruits in both intervals (41 species).
   Synthesis. Nearly all species regenerate better in higher light, and recruitment responses to light are spread along a continuum ranging from modest increase with light to a rather strict requirement for high light. These results support the hypothesis that spatio-temporal variation in light availability may contribute to the diversity of tropical tree species by providing opportunities for niche differentiation with respect to light requirements for regeneration.

AB One of the main consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation is the increase in patch isolation and the consequent decrease in landscape connectivity. In this context, species persistence depends on their responses to this new landscape configuration, particularly on their capacity to move through the interhabitat matrix. Here, we aimed first to determine gap-crossing probabilities related to different gap widths for two forest birds (Thamnophilus caerulescens, Thamnophilidae, and Basileuterus culicivorus, Parulidae) from the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. These values were defined with a playback technique and then used in analyses based on graph theory to determine functional connections among forest patches. Both species were capable of crossing forest gaps between patches, and these movements were related to gap width. The probability of crossing 40 m gaps was 50% for both species. This probability falls to 10% when the gaps are 60 m (for B. culicivorus) or 80 m (for T caerulescens). Actually, birds responded to stimulation about two times more distant inside forest trials (control) than in gap-crossing trials. Models that included gap-crossing capacity improved the explanatory power of species abundance variation in comparison to strictly structural models based merely on patch area and distance measurements. These results highlighted that even very simple functional connectivity measurements related to gap-crossing capacity can improve the understanding of the effect of habitat fragmentation on bird occurrence and abundance.

AB Hunting can change abundances of vertebrate seed predators and seed dispersers, causing species-specific changes in seed dispersal and seed predation and altering seedling communities. What are the consequences of these changes for the adult plant community in the next generation and beyond ? Here, I derive equations showing how reduced seed dispersal reduces plant reproduction by intensifying kin competition, increasing vulnerability to natural enemies, and reducing the proportion of seeds passing through disperser guts. I parameterize these equations with available empirical data to estimate the likely effects on next-generation abundances. I then consider the indirect effects and longer-term feedbacks of changed seed or adult abundances on reproductive rates due to density-dependent interactions with natural enemies and mutualists, as well as niche differentiation with competitors, and discuss their likely qualitative effects. The factors limiting seed disperser and seed predator populations in natural and hunted forests emerge as critical for determining the long-term effects of hunting on rates of seed dispersal and seed predation. For example, where seed dispersers are held to a constant abundance by hunters, decreases in the availability of their preferred food plants are expected to lead to increased per-seed dispersal probabilities, potentially to the point of compensating for the initial disperser decline. I close by discussing the likely reversibility of hunting-induced changes in tropical forests and key questions and directions for future research.

TI Conservation and biological monitoring of tropical forests: the role of

AB 1. The demise of tropical rain forests will lead to a large-scale extinction of genetic diversity, particularly of arthropods. Curtailing these trends might be facilitated by (i) reducing rates of habitat loss and degradation, (ii) enhancing systematics and (iii) increasing the flow of primary information on tropical biodiversity.
   2. We emphasize the need to examine alternative approaches that could generate a constant stream of data from tropical ecosystems. We argue that data collecting by parataxonomists (local assistants trained by professional biologists) represents one of the most efficient approaches to the study of tropical ecosystems available to date.
   3. Parataxonomists can provide high-quality biological specimens and ecological information; statistical power will be high due to large sample sizes of data; database growth will be rapid and results will be published in a timely manner; and there will be collateral education of local people in conservation biology by the parataxonomists themselves.
   4. We stress that training local parataxonomists to inventory and monitor biodiversity is a promising and efficient strategy that deserves more attention in conservation biology. In particular, it may be one of the most feasible approaches for the biological monitoring of small and cryptic organisms in species-rich environments, such as invertebrates in tropical rain forests.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Permanent botanical plots yield a wealth of data on the organization of tropical forests, and their numbers should be increased to monitor tropical biodiversity. Likewise, augmenting the number of local parataxonomist groups in various tropical countries and networking these contingents to monitor functionally diverse taxa may provide an efficient biological monitoring system in tropical forests.

AB 1. We report hydraulic lift in the savanna vegetation of central Brazil (Cerrado). Both heat-pulse measurements and isotopic (deuterium) labelling were used to determine whether hydraulic lift occurred in two common species, and whether neighbouring small shrubs and trees were utilizing this water.
   2. Both techniques showed water uptake by tap-roots and reverse flow of water in lateral roots. Roots transferred hydraulically lifted water to the soil, and small shrubs and trees neighbouring the labelled individuals were labelled by deuterated water.
   3. Isotopic mass-balance equations and sap-flow measurements showed that water taken up by the central tap-root in each individual constituted only a small percentage of total flux of water through the treated plants. Mass-balance equations also indicated that small shrubs and trees neighbouring the treated plants utilized only a few thousandths of a per cent of the label.
   4. The small proportion of water uptake by the tap-root of these two species may be limiting hydraulic lift in this system, unless sinker roots descending from lateral roots contribute to hydraulic lift.

AB This study aims at testing whether whole plant and aerial metamer traits of Rubia peregrina L., a small clonal shrub, differed in magnitude of response to variations in light, nutrient or water availability, comparing plants at the same age. The second aim was to test whether it was possible to identify a limited set of traits to assess phenotypic plasticity. Almost all traits significantly differed among treatments. These differences were partly due to changes in plant size for two whole plant and one metamer traits. No difference in grand plasticity, calculated with adjusted means correcting for size effect, was found between whole plant and aerial metamer traits. Some traits responded only to one resource (e.g. mean internode length to light) or two resources (e.g. SLA to light and nutrient). Root Mass Ratio was the most responsive of traits showing similar magnitude of plasticity to each of the three resources. These results suggest that (i) no clear difference in plasticity exists between whole plant and aerial metamer traits; (ii) allocation-related traits are of more general value than aerial metamer traits to assess the plasticity of a species.

AB We examined the patterns of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) variation among seven Prunus mahaleb (Rosaceae) populations extending over approximate to 100 km(2) to examine local differentiation in relation to spatial isolation due to both geographical distance and differences in elevation. No less than 51.4% of the RAPD loci were polymorphic, but very few were fixed and among-population variation accounted for 16.46% of variation in RAPD patterns. Mean gene diversity was 0.1441, with mean Nei's genetic diversity for individual populations ranging between 0.089 and 0.149. Mean G(ST) value across loci was 0.1935 (range, 0.0162-0.4685), giving an average estimate for Nm of 1.191. These results suggest extensive gene flow among populations, but higher G(ST) and lower Nm values relative to other outcrossing. woody species with endozoochorous dispersal, also suggest a process of isolation by distance. The combined effect of both geographical and elevation distances and nonoverlapping flowering and fruiting phenophases on the G(ST) matrix was partially significant, revealing only marginal isolation of the P. mahaleb populations. The matrix correlation between estimated Nm values among populations and the geographical + elevation distance matrices (r = -0.4623, P = 0.07), suggests a marginal trend for more isolated populations to exchange less immigrants. Long-distance seed dispersal by efficient medium-sized frugivorous birds and mammals is most likely associated to the high levels of within-population genetic diversity. However, vicariance factors and demographic bottlenecks (high postdispersal seed and seedling mortality) explain comparatively high levels of local differentiation.

AB Plant developmental responses to shade are the combination of reductions in photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and changes in spectral quality (reductions in the quantum ratio of red to far-red band widths, R:FR). We studied the seedling development of six Asian tropical rain forest trees, Dryobalanops aromatica, Endospermum malaccense, Hopea wightiana, Parkia javanica, Shorea singkawang, and Sindora echinocalyx under varying PPFD and R:FR. Seedlings were grown in replicated shadehouse treatments: (1) 40% solar PPFD and 1.25 R:FR; (2) 11% PPFD and 1.25 R:FR; (3) 11% PPFD and 0.24 R:FR; (4) 3% PPFD and 1.25 R:FR; and (5) 3% PPFD and 0.23 R:FR. Species differed in the influence of light variables on seedling (I) total height; (2) internode distance; (3) branch to trunk internodes; (4) stem length/mass; (5) leaf area/stem length; (6) percent allocation to leaf, stem and root mass; (7) specific leaf mass; (8) mean leaf area; (9) leaf thickness; (10) petiole length; and (11) stomatal density. The simple factorial design of treatments 2-5 allowed a two-way ANOVA and the calculation of coefficients of determination of the treatment effects. The characters in most taxa were primarily influenced by light intensity, but spectral quality also influenced characters in many cases. The taxa that responded most strongly to the light treatments were the most shade-intolerant: E. malaccense and P. javanica; the former species responded strongly to R:FR, particularly in stem mass allocation and leaf area/stem length. The four taxa with moderate-to-extreme shade tolerance varied considerably in responses of individual characters to R:FR and PPFD. The patterns of morphological responses to reduced PPFD and R:FR help explain how the shade tolerances of the seedlings of rain forest trees vary in a continuous manner. Recommendations concerning seedling shade tolerance for sylviculture or nursery practice may need revision if they were based on shade trials using spectrally neutral shade fabrics or slat houses. Future research on the effects of shading on tree seedling development and ecology must consider the potential influence of changes in spectral quality under canopy shade.

AB Brazil's environmental legislation obliges private properties to retain a fixed proportion of their total area with native vegetation, the so-called "Legal Reserves". Those areas represent practically one third of the country's native vegetation and are well known for their role in biodiversity protection and in the provisioning of a wide range of ecosystem services for landowners and society. Despite their relevance, this instrument has been criticized by part of the agribusiness sector and its representatives in the Brazilian Congress. The Legal Reserve requirement is said to be too restrictive and to impede the full expansion of agricultural activities, and thus to be detrimental for the development of the country. Here, we critically analyze the arguments employed in the justification of a recently proposed bill that aims to completely extinguish Legal Reserves. We demonstrate that the arguments used are mostly unsupported by data, evidence or theory, besides being based on illogical reasoning. Further, we synthesize the principal benefits of Legal Reserves, including health and economic benefits, and emphasize the importance of these reserves for water, energy, food, and climate securities, in addition to their primary function of assisting in the maintenance of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We also highlight that Legal Reserves are a key-component for effective and less expensive nature-based solutions, and thus should be considered as assets for the development of Brazil rather than liabilities. Based on available sound scientific evidence and agreement on their relevance, we strongly oppose any attempt to extinguish or weaken the maintenance of Brazil's Legal Reserves.

AB Phosphate (Pi) deficiency in soil system is a limiting factor for rice growth and yield. Majority of the soil phosphorus (P) is organic in nature, not readily available for root uptake. Low Pi-inducible purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) are hypothesized to enhance the availability of Pi in soil and cellular system. However, information on molecular and physiological roles of rice PAPs is very limited. Here, we demonstrate the role of a novel rice PAP, OsPAP21b in improving plant utilization of organic-P. OsPAP21b was found to be under the transcriptional control of OsPHR2 and strictly regulated by plant Pi status at both transcript and protein levels. Biochemically, OsPAP21b showed hydrolysis of several organophosphates at acidic pH and possessed sufficient thermostability befitting for high-temperature rice ecosystems with acidic soils. Interestingly, OsPAP21b was revealed to be a secretory PAP and encodes a distinguishable major APase (acid phosphatase) isoform under low Pi in roots. Further, OsPAP21b-overexpressing transgenics showed increased biomass, APase activity and P content in both hydroponics supplemented with organic-P sources and soil containing organic manure as sole P source. Additionally, overexpression lines depicted increased root length, biomass and lateral roots under low Pi while RNAi lines showed reduced root length and biomass as compared to WT. In the light of these evidences, present study strongly proposes OsPAP21b as a useful candidate for improving Pi acquisition and utilization in rice.

AB 1. Habitat structure is important in explaining species diversity patterns for many animal groups. If we could map habitat structure over large spatial scales, we could use habitat structure-species diversity (HS-SD) relationships to model species diversity and inform conservation planning and management. Traditional approaches for measuring habitat structure cannot be applied over entire landscapes, but remote sensing tools are now able to overcome this limitation. Here, we explore the potential of airborne lidar for the assessment and monitoring of animal species diversity in terrestrial environments.
   2. We review the habitat attributes commonly recorded in the study of HS-SD relationships and the spatial scale of their measurement, in papers published between 1960 and 2013. We also gather evidence for the use of lidar to make relevant measurements at similar scales.
   3. Eight out of 15 attributes of habitat structure commonly used in published studies relate to the vertical dimension of habitat. The core strength of lidar is that it is a vertical profiler, and this technology can be used to derive estimates of all but one of these structural attributes. Lidar can also be used to improve the measurement of the four commonly used attributes focusing on the horizontal heterogeneity of habitat patches. The spatial grain and extent of HS-SD studies is usually within the operational capability of airborne lidar; when a vertical measure of habitat structure has been employed, this is true in 84% of published studies. The potential efficacy of lidar in this field of biodiversity studies is underlined by several published examples of lidar modelling of animal species diversity.
   4. We conclude that lidar remote sensing is fit for the purpose of biodiversity assessment and monitoring through its ability to characterize habitat structure, a key driver of animal species diversity, over large spatial scales. We advocate wider application of lidar-based HS-SD indicators to help tackle the current biodiversity crisis. In combination with other remote sensing products, these indicators may support the implementation and monitoring of environmental legislation, inform gap analyses and the planning of management actions for protected areas and species, and drive greater synergy with forest-based climate change mitigation.

TI Leaf adaptations of evergreen and deciduous trees of semi-arid and humid

AB 1. Drought stress selects for a suite of plant traits at root, stem and leaf level. Two strategies are proposed for trees growing in seasonally water-stressed environments: drought tolerance and drought avoidance. These are respectively associated with evergreen phenology, where plants retain their leaves throughout the year, and deciduous phenology, where plants drop their leaves during dry seasons. Evergreen species are thought to have leaf traits supporting lower photosynthesis and transpiration rates, in order to conserve water during dry periods.
   2. We evaluated 18 morphological, chemical and physiological leaf traits of 51 abundant savanna tree species that differed in leaf habit (deciduous and evergreen), selected from two climate types (semi-arid and humid) in three continents (Australia, Africa and South America) (annual rainfall range: 500-1550 mm), and grown in a common garden experiment. We hypothesised that evergreen species have more conservative water use and differ more across climate types than deciduous species because evergreen species are forced to endure extended water deficits during dry seasons.
   3. Trait shifts between semi-arid and humid savannas did not differ between evergreen and deciduous species.
   4. Evergreen species had similar assimilation rates but lower photosynthetic water-use efficiency (PWUE) than deciduous species, possibly to extend their leaf lifespans by protecting their photosynthetic machinery from overheating through evaporative cooling.
   5. Species of humid and semi-arid environments did not differ with respect to assimilation rate or PWUE, but semi-arid species did have smaller leaf sizes and greater leaf potassium and phosphorus concentrations. These traits may enable semi-arid species to maximize growth during episodes of favourable moisture availability.
   6. Species from the three continents differed in their leaf traits. These probably reflect the greater proportion of evergreen species in Australia as compared to the other continents and generally infertile soils in the South American sampling sites compared to the wider fertility range in the African sites.
   7. Synthesis: Water stress in savannas does not select for more conservative water use, but may select for rapid adjustment to prevailing water conditions and for heat avoidance mechanisms.

AB P>1. In a faunally intact lowland Amazonian rain forest stand, we conducted a long-term multi-species experiment aimed at determining the primary mechanistic basis of seedling establishment patterns. We deployed a total of 1050 experimental seedlings, representing 11 common tree species in mixed compositions and at fixed, highly elevated densities in shaded understorey sites, representing extremes of distance from large conspecific trees. We used mesh exclosures to isolate the effects of distinct classes of natural enemies, and monitored survival for up to 45 months.
   2. Final seedling survival of all species pooled represented a 40% increase at sites located far from ('F' sites) versus close to ('N' sites) large conspecific trees, and median seedling lifetime was 75% longer. These differences between N and F sites were significant for all species pooled, and for five out of 11 (survivorship) and four out of nine (lifetime) individual species examined. Survival analysis based on multiple censuses revealed that a 'distance effect' persisted and intensified over time, with the onset of significant distance-related differential mortality differing amongst species.
   3. The use of mesh exclosures (< 2 mm mesh size) and a factorial experimental design revealed that host-specific organisms < 2 mm in size and/or below-ground soil-borne organisms are more strongly distance-responsive and depress seedling establishment primarily in the vicinity of large conspecific adults whereas above-ground organisms > 2 mm in size appear to have a negative impact on seedling establishment at all distances.
   4. No evidence was found for the effect of intra-cohort resource competition on seedling establishment even though initial density of experimental seedlings at all sites was elevated to c. 25 times the mean natural density of the mixed-species seedling layer in this forest.
   5. Synthesis. Our study provides strong, multi-species support for the influence of host-specific distance-responsive natural enemies on seedling establishment, and suggests that negative density-dependent patterns of tree recruitment in tropical rain forests are at least partly produced at early life stages as an outcome of processes described by the classic Janzen-Connell model.

AB Application of island biogeography theory to prediction of species extinctions resulting from habitat loss is based on the assumption that the transformed landscape matrix is completely inhospitable to the taxa considered, despite evidence demonstrating the nontrivial influence of matrix on populations within habitat remnants. The island biogeography paradigm therefore needs refining to account for specific responses of taxa to the area of habitat "islands" and to the quality of the surrounding matrix. We incorporated matrix effects into island theory by partitioning the slope (z value) of species-area relationships into two components: gamma, a constant, and sigma, a measure of taxon-specific responses to each component of a heterogeneous matrix. We used our matrix-calibrated model to predict extinction and endangerment of bird species resulting from land-use change in 20 biodiversity hotspots and compared these predictions with observed numbers of extinct and threatened bird species. We repeated this analysis with the conventional species-area model and the countryside species-area model, considering alternative z values of 0.35 (island) or 0.22 (continental). We evaluated the relative strength of support for each of the five candidate models with Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The matrix-calibrated model had the highest AIC weight (w(1) = 89.21%), which means the weight of evidence in support of this model was the optimal model given the set of candidate models and the data. In addition to being a valuable heuristic tool for assessing extinction risk, our matrix-calibrated model also allows quantitative assessment of biodiversity benefits (and trade-offs) of land-management options in human-dominated landscapes. Given that processes of secondary regeneration have become more widespread across tropical regions and are predicted to increase, our matrix-calibrated model will be increasingly appropriate for practical conservation in tropical landscapes.

AB The spatial changes in species composition are closely related to the environmental aspects associated to habitat variation. The natural landscapes of Minas Gerais are organized in mosaics, associated to anthropic action or natural factors. Here we study dung beetles in the Perdizes Plateau, Carrancas (Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil). The area of study has a landscape composed mainly by four phytophysiognomies: Brazilian savannah, altitudinal grasslands, rupestrian fields and forests. The objective of our study was to detect the spatial distribution in composition of dung beetles and estimate beta diversity between phytophysiognomies. The dung beetles were collected in four areas of each phytophysiognomy, using pitfall traps baited with carrion or human feces. A total of 2,363 individuals of 52 species were collected: 1,247 individuals of 29 species at the forest, 20 exclusive to this phytophysiognomy; 352 individuals of 17 species at the grassland, with four exclusive species; 386 individuals of 19 species at the Brazilian savannah, with five exclusive species; and 378 individuals of 20 species at the rupestrian field, with five exclusive species. The traps baited with feces were the most efficient in capturing dung beetles, and the forest was the phytophysiognomy with the highest diversity and abundance. This pattern indicates that plant-covering influences the structure of the dung beetle community. High beta diversity indicates that phytophysiognomies are complementary. However, the other phytophysiognomies are also important for conservation, once species composition occurring at each environment is essential for the maintenance of the regional diversity.

AB Forest fragmentation is viewed as a serious threat to primates, yet whether or not it can disrupt food resources and cause energetic stress remains largely untested. I present the results of a 12-mo study of the feeding ecology of Propithecus diadema in fragmented and continuous forest at Tsinjoarivo, eastern Madagascar. Two continuous forest groups had higher dietary diversity and ate more fleshy fruit, but during the dry season, diversity was reduced and they relied heavily on mistletoe (Bakerella clavata). In contrast, 2 groups in fragments employed the lean season strategy of eating mistletoe year-round; the fruiting tree species that sustain continuous forest groups through the rainy season were largely absent. As expected, intersite dietary overlap was highest in the dry season. The level of specialization was high: fragment groups devoted 30-40% of feeding time to Bakerella clavata, compared to 28-30% in continuous forest. The major characteristic of Bakerella clavata enabling it to be an important fallback or staple resource, or both, is its extended phenology. The difference in resource utilization between sites may have important implications for nutritional status, as well as ranging and social behavior, largely owing to the small size and high abundance of feeding patches of Bakerella. Understanding resource shifts in fragments can shed light on socioecological questions by providing comparisons between continuous forest and fragment populations with differing diets and resource distributions. In addition, understanding dietary shifts in fragments can aid in species-specific conservation efforts, while contributing to a better understanding of the considerable interspecific variability of primates in responses to fragmentation.

AB Lianas (woody vines) contribute substantially to the diversity and structure of most tropical forests, yet little is known about the importance of habitat specialization in maintaining tropical liana diversity and the causes of variation among forests in liana abundance and species composition. We examined habitat associations, species diversity, species composition, and community structure of lianas at Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia in northeastern Borneo among three soil types that give rise to three distinct forest types of lowland tropical rain forest: alluvial, sandstone hill, and kerangas (heath) forest. Alluvial soils are more nutrient rich and have higher soil moisture than sandstone soils, whereas kerangas soils are the most nutrient poor and drought prone. Lianas >= 0.5-cm in diameter were measured, tagged, and identified to species in three square 0.25-ha plots in each forest type. The number of lianas >= 0.5 cm did not differ significantly among forest types and averaged 1348 lianas ha(-1), but mean liana stem diameter, basal area, estimated biomass, species richness, and Fisher's alpha diversity index were all greater for plots in alluvial than sandstone or kerangas forests. Liana species composition also differed greatly among the three habitats, with 71% of species showing significant positive or negative habitat associations. Sandstone forests were intermediate to alluvial and kerangas forests in most aspects of liana community structure and composition, and fewer species showed significant habitat associations with this forest type. Ranking of forest types with respect to liana density, biomass, and diversity matches the ranking in soil fertility and water availability (alluvial > sandstone hill > kerangas). These results suggest that edaphic factors play an important role in maintaining liana species diversity and structuring liana communities.

AB Previous studies in tropical rain forests suggest that most small mammal species reach their highest densities in disturbed habitats; however, only a few sites have been examined. Consequently, habitat and resource use for many species is poorly understood. This is especially true in the Amazon Basin, where no studies of microhabitat associations of small mammals have been undertaken. We studied relationships with habitat variables and resource abundances for 5 species of marsupials and 9 species of rodents at a site in southeastern Amazonia. Small mammals were sampled with traps placed both on the ground and in the understory. Eight habitat variables were measured to quantify habitat structure. Measures of insect biomass were collected by the use of sticky traps, and fruit abundance was quantified. Patterns of habitat use were examined using logistic regression, multiple regression, and ordinations. Many species showed increased abundances with habitat features indicative of edge-affected or disturbed habitats, showing negative relationships with understory openness, understory woody-stem density, tree density, and tree size; and positive relationships with number of vines per tree, mean log size, number of logs, and volume of downed wood. We obtained support for the hypothesis that the cause of this pattern is increased resource abundances in these areas, because both insect biomass and number of fruiting trees showed similar relationships. However, for many species, measures of resource abundance were not important once habitat features were entered into the models, indicating that the relationship to resources is an indirect one.

AB Chilean benthic fisheries involve thousands of artisanal fishers, about 50 target species (most significantly loco, Concholepas concholepas (Bruguiere)), and a coastline spanning 38 latitudinal degrees. An overfishing crisis led to a closure of the loco fishery (1989-1992), and to the incorporation of territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFS) into fisheries legislation. Organizations of artisanal fishers are entitled to co-manage parcels of seabed with the state. We used old and new data on the loco fishery of Region IV (the cradle of the system) to investigate the performance of TURFs, which presently encompass 36% of the prime habitat that contributed close to 82% of historical yield. Abundance within TURFS and legal catch are stabilized, the fishery looks orderly, and perception of TURFS is generally positive. The system is dual, however, and at least half of the catch is illegal, originating from background areas outside the TURFS. Corrective action requires incentives that would eliminate the illegal catch, increase fishermen's participation, and provide simple feedback decision rules driven by data and more flexibility allowing fishermen to experiment and diversify activities. Attention is needed to biological processes at scales that transcend the boundaries of locally managed TURFS and to values and priorities other than biological sustainability that may be of societal significance.

AB Studies of interspecific competition and niche separation have formed some of the seminal works of ecology. I conducted an 18-mo study comparing the feeding ecologies of 2 sympatric, closely-related ripe-fruit specialists, Humboldt's woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagotricha poeppigii), and the white-bellied spider monkeys (Ateles belzebuth belzebuth) in Amazonian Ecuador. Woolly monkeys in the terra firme forest live at roughly triple the density of spider monkeys (31 versus 11.5 animals/km(2)). Woolly monkeys spend 17% of their time foraging, while spider monkeys spend only 1% of their time foraging. Spider monkeys alone fed on soil and termitaria, which are rich in phosphorus. Woolly monkeys are not hard-fruit specialists. Their fruit diet is significantly more diverse than that of spider monkeys. Dietary overlap between the 2 species is high, yet each specializes to some degree on a different set of fruit resources. Woolly monkeys visit more food sources per unit of time, feed lower in the canopy, visit more small food patches, and prey on more seeds. Spider monkeys feed on fewer, richer food sources and are more than twice as likely to return to a particular fruit source than woolly monkeys are. Spider monkeys maximize fruit pulp intake, carrying more intact seeds in their guts, while woolly monkeys minimize seed bulk swallowed through more careful food processing. Surprisingly, several preferred spider monkey foods with high fat content and large seeds are avoided by woolly monkeys. I outline the different ecological dimensions involved in niche separation between the 2 species and discuss the possible impetus for their evolutionary divergence.

AB To test if some leaf parameters are predictors of productivity in a range of Populus deltoides (Bartr.) Marsh. x P. nigra L. clones, we assessed leaf traits and productivity in 2-month-old rooted cuttings from 31 clones growing in 4-1 pots in a greenhouse, under conditions of controlled temperature and optimal irrigation. We evaluated four groups of variables describing (1) productivity (total biomass), (2) leaf growth (total leaf number increment and total leaf area increment rate), (3) leaf structure (specific leaf area and nitrogen and carbon contents) and (4) carbon isotope discrimination (A), which is negatively correlated with time-integrated water-use efficiency. High-yielding clones did not necessarily display high leaf growth rates, but they displayed a larger total leaf area, lower specific leaf area and lower leaf nitrogen concentration than clones with low productivity. Total leaf area was mainly controlled by maximal individual leaf area and total leaf area increment rate (r = 0.51 and 0.56, respectively). Carbon isotope discrimination did not correlate with total biomass, but it was associated with total number of leaves and total leaf area increment rate (r = 0.39 and 0.45, respectively). Therefore, leaf area and specific leaf area were better indicators of productivity than leaf growth traits. The observed independence of A from biomass production provides opportunities for selecting poplar clones combining high productivity and high water-use efficiency.

AB By mapping translated metagenomic reads to a microbial metabolic network, we show that ruminal ecosystems that are rather dissimilar in their taxonomy can be considerably more similar at the metabolic network level. Using a new network bi-partition approach for linking the microbial network to a bovine metabolic network, we observe that these ruminal metabolic networks exhibit properties consistent with distinct metabolic communities producing similar outputs from common inputs. For instance, the closer in network space that a microbial reaction is to a reaction found in the host, the lower will be the variability of its enzyme copy number across hosts. Similarly, these microbial enzymes that are nearby to host nodes are also higher in copy number than are more distant enzymes. Collectively, these results demonstrate a widely expected pattern that, to our knowledge, has not been explicitly demonstrated in microbial communities: namely that there can exist different community metabolic networks that have the same metabolic inputs and outputs but differ in their internal structure.

AB Understanding of the role of body mass in structural-functional relationships is pressing, particularly because species losses often occur non-randomly with respect to body size. Our study examined the effects of dung beetle body mass on dung removal at two levels. First, we used the lab experiment to evaluate the efficiency of eight dung beetle species belonging to two functional groups (tunnelers, dwellers) on dung removal. Second, the same species employed in the lab were used in field mesocosms to examine the effects of the two functional groups on dung removal maintaining realistic differences in the total body mass between tunneler and dweller assemblages. Furthermore, the experimental assemblages contained one and four species within each functional group, so the effect of body mass heterogeneity was examined. We used a statistical approach (offset method) which took into account a priori constraints due to the study design allowing us to analyse the effect of larger species in mesocosm style experiments. Body size played a crucial role in dung removal: large beetles were more efficient than small ones and the percentage of removed dung increased with higher body mass heterogeneity. Tunnelers were more efficient than dwellers over both short and long time periods (one month and one year). Significant effects of dwellers were found only after one year. Moreover, our study showed that not including the body mass as an offset in the model resulted in sometimes different results, as the offset expresses dung removal independently of the body mass. This approach confirmed that body size is likely a pivotal factor controlling dung removal efficiency at multiple levels, from single species to overall dung beetle assemblages. Even though other specific traits should be examined, this study has begun to address the consequences of losing individuals with specific traits that are especially sensitive to perturbations.

AB Precipitation pulses in arid ecosystems can lead to temporal asynchrony in microbial and plant processing of nitrogen (N) during drying/wetting cycles causing increased N loss. In contrast, more consistent availability of soil moisture in mesic ecosystems can synchronize microbial and plant processes during the growing season, thus minimizing N loss. We tested whether microbial N cycling is asynchronous with plant N uptake in a semiarid grassland. Using N-15 tracers, we compared rates of N cycling by microbes and N uptake by plants after water pulses of 1 and 2 cm to rates in control plots without a water pulse. Microbial N immobilization, gross N mineralization, and nitrification dramatically increased 1-3 days after the water pulses, with greatest responses after the 2-cm pulse. In contrast, plant N uptake increased more after the 1-cm than after the 2-cm pulse. Both microbial and plant responses reverted to control levels within 10 days, indicating that both microbial and plant responses were short lived. Thus, microbial and plant processes were temporally synchronous following a water pulse in this semiarid grassland, but the magnitude of the pulse substantially influenced whether plants or microbes were more effective in acquiring N. Furthermore, N loss increased after both small and large water pulses (as shown by a decrease in total N-15 recovery), indicating that changes in precipitation event sizes with future climate change could exacerbate N losses from semiarid ecosystems.

AB Phylogenetic ecology has identified patterns of diversity in communities that may find explanation in trophic interactions, and yet there have been few attempts to directly relate such patterns among trophic levels. Density-dependent processes involving pests and pathogens, for example, have been invoked to account for plant community phylogenetic patterns, but relatively little is known about how plant relatedness might affect community structure at other trophic levels. We examined the degree to which the abundance of herbivores in a rain forest community is explained by the phylogeny and functional traits of host plants. We destructively sampled all stems >= 5 cm diameter in two 1-ha plots of New Guinea primary and secondary lowland forest to test predicted relationships between herbivore abundance and plant resources. We analyzed per-tree caterpillar and leaf miner abundance, total leaf biomass (kg), percentage of immature foliage, specific leaf area (cm(2)/g), leaf nitrogen content (percentage of dry mass), and presence of exudates in the context of a plant community phylogeny estimated from DNA barcodes.
   Apart from nitrogen content and exudates, neither plant resources nor herbivore abundance showed evidence of phylogenetic signal in our community sample. The plant traits we measured could account for only 30% and 16% of variation in caterpillar and leaf miner abundance, respectively, among individual trees. Leaf biomass was a stronger predictor of herbivore abundance than either resource quality (leaf nitrogen content) or palatability (percentage of immature foliage, specific leaf area). The primary importance of resource quantity was also observed at the plant species level in analyses of species means and phylogenetic generalized least-squares regression. Plant relatedness did not account for much variation in herbivore abundance, but significant effects of exudates and leaf nitrogen content on caterpillar abundance illustrate how conserved traits at one trophic level may influence community-wide patterns at another.

AB A recent debate has contrasted two conservation strategies in agricultural landscapes; either "land sparing'' farm development combining intensive production practices with forest set-asides, or "wildlife-friendly'' farming with greater on-farm habitat value but lower yields. We argue that in established mosaic landscapes including old cacao production regions where natural forest has already been reduced to relatively small fragments, a combination of both strategies is needed to conserve biodiversity. After reviewing the evidence for the insufficiency of either strategy alone if applied to such landscapes, the paper focuses on the cacao production landscape of southern Bahia, Brazil, once the world's second largest cacao producer. Here, small remaining areas of Atlantic Forest are embedded in a matrix dominated by traditional cacao agroforests, resulting in a landscape mosaic that has proven favorable to the conservation of the region's high biodiversity. We show that current land use dynamics and public policies pose threats but also offer opportunities to conservation and describe a three- pronged landscape conservation strategy, consisting of (i) expansion of the protected areas system, (ii) promotion of productive yet biodiversity-friendly cacao farming practices, and (iii) assistance to land users to implement legally mandated on-farm reserves and voluntary private reserves. We discuss recent experiences concerning the implementation of this strategy, discuss likely future scenarios, and reflect on the applicability of the Bahian experience to biodiversity rich cacao production regions elsewhere in the tropics.

AB Tropical forests will experience relatively large changes in temperature and rainfall towards the end of this century. Little is known about how tropical trees will respond to these changes. We used tree rings to establish climate-growth relations of a pioneer tree, Mimosa acantholoba, occurring in tropical dry secondary forests in southern Mexico. The role of large-scale climatic drivers in determining interannual growth variation was studied by correlating growth to sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Annual growth varied eightfold over 1970-2007, and was correlated with wet season rainfall (r=0.75). Temperature, cloud cover and solar variation did not affect growth, although these climate variables correlated with growth due to their relations with rainfall. Strong positive correlations between growth and SSTA occurred in the North tropical Atlantic during the first half of the year, and in the Pacific during the second half of the year. The Pacific influence corresponded closely to ENSO-like influences with negative effects of high SSTA in the eastern Pacific Nino3.4 region on growth due to decreases in rainfall. During El Nino years growth was reduced by 37%. We estimated how growth would be affected by the predicted trend of decreasing rainfall in Central America towards the end of this century. Using rainfall predictions of two sets of climate models, we estimated that growth at the end of this century will be reduced by 12% under a medium (A1B) and 21% under a high (A2) emission scenario. These results suggest that climate change may have repercussions for the carbon sequestration capacity of tropical dry forests in the region.

AB P>1. Worldwide loss of biodiversity necessitates a clear understanding of the factors driving population declines as well as informed predictions about which species and populations are at greatest risk. The biggest threat to the long-term persistence of populations is the reduction and changes in configuration of their natural habitat.
   2. Inconsistencies have been noted in the responses of populations to the combined effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. These have been widely attributed to the effects of the matrix habitats in which remnant focal habitats are typically embedded.
   3. We quantified the potential effects of the inter-patch matrix by estimating occupancy and colonization of forest and surrounding non-forest matrix (NF). We estimated species-specific parameters using a dynamic, multi-species hierarchical model on a bird community in southwestern Costa Rica.
   4. Overall, we found higher probabilities of occupancy and colonization of forest relative to the NF across bird species, including those previously categorized as open habitat generalists not needing forest to persist. Forest dependency was a poor predictor of occupancy dynamics in our study region, largely predicting occupancy and colonization of only non-forest habitats.
   5. Our results indicate that the protection of remnant forest habitats is key for the long-term persistence of all members of the bird community in this fragmented landscape, including species typically associated with open, non-forest habitats.
   6.Synthesis and applications. We identified 39 bird species of conservation concern defined by having high estimates of forest occupancy, and low estimates of occupancy and colonization of non-forest. These species survive in forest but are unlikely to venture out into open, non-forested habitats, therefore, they are vulnerable to the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. Our hierarchical community-level model can be used to estimate species-specific occupancy dynamics for focal and inter-patch matrix habitats to identify which species within a community are likely to be impacted most by habitat loss and fragmentation. This model can be applied to other taxa (i.e. amphibians, mammals and insects) to estimate species and community occurrence dynamics in response to current environmental conditions and to make predictions in response to future changes in habitat configurations.

AB Pre-Columbian farmers of the Neotropical lowlands numbered an estimated 25 million by 1492, with at least 80 percent living within forest biomes. It is now well established that significant areas of Neotropical forests were cleared and burned to facilitate agricultural activities before the arrival of Europeans. Paleoecological and archaeological evidence shows that demographic pressure on forest resources-facilitated by anthropogenic burning-increased steadily throughout the Late Holocene, peaking when Europeans arrived in the late fifteenth century. The introduction of Old World diseases led to recurrent epidemics and resulted in an unprecedented population crash throughout the Neotropics. The rapid demographic collapse was mostly complete by 1650, by which time it is estimated that about 95 percent of all indigenous inhabitants of the region had perished. We review fire history records from throughout the Neotropical lowlands and report new high-resolution charcoal records and demographic estimates that together support the idea that the Neotropical lowlands went from being a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere before Columbus to a net carbon sink for several centuries following the Columbian encounter. We argue that the regrowth of Neotropical forests following the Columbian encounter led to terrestrial biospheric carbon sequestration on the order of 2 to 5 Pg C, thereby contributing to the well-documented decrease in atmospheric CO2 recorded in Antarctic ice cores from about 1500 through 1750, a trend previously attributed exclusively to decreases in solar irradiance and an increase in global volcanic activity. We conclude that the post-Columbian carbon sequestration event was a significant forcing mechanism of Little Ice Age cooling.

AB Although extensive areas of tropical forest are selectively logged each year, the responses of bat communities to this form of disturbance have rarely been examined. Our objectives were to (1) compare bat abundance, species composition, and feeding guild structure between unlogged and low-intensity selectively logged (1-4 logged stems/ha) sampling grids in the southeastern Amazon and (2) examine correlations between logging-induced changes in bat communities and forest structure. We captured bats in understory and canopy mist nets set in five 1-ha study grids in, both logged and unlogged forest. We captured 996 individuals, representing 5 families, 32 genera, and 49 species. Abundances of neclarivorous and frugivorous taxa (Glossophaginae, Lonchopbyllinae, Stenodermatinae, and Carolliinae) were higher at logged sites, where canopy openness and understory foliage density were greatest. In contrast, insectivorous and omnivorous species (Emballonuridae, Mormoopidae, Phyllostominae, and Vespertilionidae) were more abundant in unlogged sites, where canopy foliage density and variability in. the understory stratum were greatest. Multivariate analyses indicated that understory bat species composition differed strongly between logged and unlogged sites but provided little evidence of logging effects for the canopy fauna, Different responses among feeding guilds and taxonomic groups appeared to be related to foraging and echolocation strategies and to changes in canopy cover and understory foliage densities. Our results suggest that even low-intensity logging modifies habitat structure, leading to changes in bat species composition.

AB We examined light as a niche partitioning factor between the late-successional European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and the mid-successional downy oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.), two dominant species in the sub-Mediterranean area of southern France. For these species we estimated sapling growth models (in radius and in height) as a function of light availability. Beech had a higher growth in low light and a higher asymptotic growth rate than oak. We estimated species-specific growth-mortality functions. Beech showed a higher tolerance to slow growth than oak. By linking light-growth functions and growth-mortality functions, we found that beech had a lower mortality at low light than oak. Beech saplings had a higher probability of survival than oak at low and at high light levels. Beech exhibited the highest plasticity of morphological traits (i.e., biomass allocation, leaf morphology, and architectural traits) as a function of light. Since beech has higher growth and survival than oak at variable light regimes, we conclude that niche partitioning for light cannot explain the coexistence of these two species. We propose that disturbance and water stress should be explicitly taken into account to understand niche partitioning and succession in the sub-Mediterranean area.

AB Lepiotaceous fungi form relatively fragile basidiocarps with white, rarely coloured, spores. Most are saprotrophic forest-floor dwellers that grow in the lower litter layers of the soil, and probably decompose lignin and cellulose. They occur worldwide, with many representatives in tropical and temperate regions, and a few species in arctic-alpine areas and in deserts. Most taxa are agaricoid, though a relatively small number of secotioid variants exist. Because of their relative rarity, the clustering together of many species in limited habitats, and the differences in species composition along latitudinal transects, lepiotaceous fungi may be vulnerable to changes in the environment, both on a local (habitat destruction) and on a global scale (climate change). Sister taxa occur in different parts of the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere, indicating that vicariance events might have played a role in speciation. A few species have a very extended distribution, and those species occur either in man-made habitats or else in cooler habitats. Many ecological features of the lepiotaceous fungi are unknown, including the survival rates and colonization success of spores, nutrient and temperature requirements, longevity and size of genets. Conservation of existing diversity calls for policies underpinned by new ecological research, more taxonomical studies, and more recording projects.

AB Numerous oceanographic processes involved in the transport and survival of larval stages of marine organisms, as well as, in nutrient and phytoplankton delivery, occur in nearshore waters. Yet, while large-scale oceanographic patterns are relatively well known for central Chile, little information exists on temporal and spatial variation in the nearshore environment. In this study, we examined the inner shelf hydrography of two sites in central Chile separated by 15 km and with slightly different coastline orientation. Our results show that both sites follow the general oceanographic patterns described for the region, with a well mixed water column and spatial homogeneity in winter months and the onset of a thermocline in spring and through the summer, when upwelling favorable winds intensified. However, despite the proximity of the sites, persistent differences in surface temperature, salinity, stratification, and chlorophyll-a concentration, as well as in the intensity of wind forcing were detected. Time series and cross-correlation analyses between wind and temperature, as well as satellite images, suggest that the intensity and frequency of upwelling varies between these sites, probably due to differences in coastline orientation. The potential existence of a localized upwelling shadow at one site and the influence of riverine input are discussed. The meso-scale oceanographic differences described in this study can have important consequences on the dynamics of nearshore ecosystems and should be born in mind when designing conservation or management strategies.

AB In tropical moist forests, length of the dry period may have a profound influence on leaf dynamics, plant growth and survival. To evaluate the role of light and water availability oil seedling performance, a 1-y experiment was carried out in a tropical moist forest in the Bolivian Amazon in which seedlings of three tree species (Brosimum lactescens, Cedrela odorata and Schizolobium amazonicum) were planted in gaps and the understorey. Variation in length of the dry period was simulated by subjecting part of the seedlings to a water treatment at the end of the dry period. Gaps and understorey had a similar soil moisture content which varied between 39% in the wet season and 16% in the dry season. Height and leaf growth rates were higher in gap compared to understorey plants, and in the wet compared to the dry season. A high growth during the wet season provided gap plants with a decisive size advantage over understorey plants during the dry season. Their larger root system allowed gap plants to explore a larger surface area and deeper soil layers for water. Consequently, gap plants of Cedrela experienced a shorter deciduous period (22 d) compared to understorey plants (61 d). Watering at the end of the dry season cued the flushing of new leaves by Cedrela, although it did not lead to a higher plant growth.

AB The composition, density, and fruiting phenology of arborescent palms were examined in a remote term firme forest site near the upper Urucu river, Amazonas, Brazil. A total of 248 individuals with a diameter at breast height (DBH) greater-than-or-equal-to 10 cm, including 8 single-stemmed and 1 multistemmed species, occurred within a 5-ha area (twelve 0.25-ha plots and two 1-ha plots). Using a point-quadrant method, an additional 75 palms were tagged along 4.9 km of transects. Arborescent palms accounted for 7 percent of 4915 trees, and comprised the sixth most abundant tree family. The combined density of all palm species was substantially greater in relatively patchy areas of poorly drained to waterlogged soils within creekside forest (81 ind./ha) than on well-drained, high forest soils (36 ind./ha). Palm species appeared to segregate according to habitat topography, resulting in two relatively distinct subcommunities. Jessenia bataua, the most common species, accounted for 42 percent of the arborescent palms. Immature and mature fruits of this and other palm species were available throughout the year, and represented an important food source for frugivores during the dry season, when ripe fleshy fruits of nonpalm trees became rare or nonexistent. The reproductive phenology of arborescent palms is discussed in terms of its role in sustaining frugivores through periods of generalized ripe fruit scarcity.

AB The littorinid gastropod, Nodilittorina pyramidalis (Quoy & Gaimard), is commonly found at the top of rocky shores in New South Wales, Australia. On sandstone shores around Sydney, the snails are usually restricted to patches of topographically complex rock during low tide and are mainly found within the pits and crevices in these patches. Differences in densities and size-structures of populations on adjacent patches suggest little intermixing of these populations. Experiments showed that adult Nodilittorina had limited dispersal which tended to retain them within these topographically complex patches. This was a response to the topographic complexity of the habitat, but other factors were necessary to retain populations within these patches for more than a few days. Small snails were more responsive to the complexity of the habitat than large snails. In addition, Nodilittorina actively avoided topographically simple areas on these shores and rapidly returned to complex patches after experimental transplantation. These patterns of behaviour differed from those shown by the co-existing littorinid, Littorina unifasciata Gray, although both species are found in the same areas of the shore and feed in the same way on the same source of food.

AB The pattern of a few abundant species and many rarer species is a defining characteristic of communities worldwide. These abundant species are often referred to as dominant species. Yet, despite their importance, the term dominant species is poorly defined and often used to convey different information by different authors. Based on a review of historical and contemporary definitions we develop a synthetic definition of dominant species. This definition incorporates the relative local abundance of a species, its ubiquity across the landscape, and its impact on community and ecosystem properties. A meta-analysis of removal studies shows that the loss of species identified as dominant by authors can significantly impact ecosystem functioning and community structure. We recommend two metrics that can be used jointly to identify dominant species in a given community and provide a roadmap for future avenues of research on dominant species. In our review, we make the case that the identity and effects of dominant species on their environments are key to linking patterns of diversity to ecosystem function, including predicting impacts of species loss and other aspects of global change on ecosystems.

AB Secondary forests (SFs) regenerating on previously deforested land account for large, expanding areas of tropical forest cover. Given that tropical forests rank among Earth's most important reservoirs of carbon and biodiversity, SFs play an increasingly pivotal role in the carbon cycle and as potential habitat for forest biota. Nevertheless, their capacity to regain the biotic attributes of undisturbed primary forests (UPFs) remains poorly understood. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of SF recovery, using extensive tropical biodiversity, biomass, and environmental datasets. These data, collected in 59 naturally regenerating SFs and 30 co-located UPFs in the eastern Amazon, cover >1,600 large- and small-stemmed plant, bird, and dung beetles species and a suite of forest structure, landscape context, and topoedaphic predictors. After up to 40 years of regeneration, the SFs we surveyed showed a high degree of biodiversity resilience, recovering, on average among taxa, 88% and 85% mean UPF species richness and composition, respectively. Across the first 20 years of succession, the period for which we have accurate SF age data, biomass recovered at 1.2% per year, equivalent to a carbon uptake rate of 2.25 Mg/ha per year, while, on average, species richness and composition recovered at 2.6% and 2.3% per year, respectively. For all taxonomic groups, biomass was strongly associated with SF species distributions. However, other variables describing habitat complexity-canopy cover and understory stem density-were equally important occurrence predictors for most taxa. Species responses to biomass revealed a successional transition at approximately 75 Mg/ha, marking the influx of high-conservation-value forest species. Overall, our results show that naturally regenerating SFs can accumulate substantial amounts of carbon and support many forest species. However, given that the surveyed SFs failed to return to a typical UPF state, SFs are not substitutes for UPFs.

AB We studied fungal succession in decaying wood by compiling time-series data of fruit body observations. We tested the hypothesis that the presence of a primary species affects the probability of a succeeding species occurring later on the same log. Significant associations were detected for 15 species pairs; these were consistent with earlier findings on co-occurrence patterns in single time surveys. We used enrichment analysis to test if species with particular life-history attributes were more often associated with the occurrence of a succeeding species, or vice versa. White rot fungi and fungi abundant as mycelia were more often associated with the occurrence of succeeding species, compared to brown rot fungi and species with low mycelial abundance. Our results indicate that certain primary species cause priority effects and non-random co-occurrence patterns in the field. These successional patterns are likely to be connected both with substrate modification and species interactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

AB Published in 2001, The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (UNTB) emphasizes the importance of stochastic processes in ecological community structure, and has challenged the traditional niche-based view of ecology. While neutral models have since been applied to a broad range of ecological and macroecological phenomena, the majority of research relating to neutral theory has focused exclusively on the species abundance distribution (SAD). Here, we synthesize the large body of work on neutral theory in the context of the species abundance distribution, with a particular focus on integrating ideas from neutral theory with traditional niche theory. First, we summarize the basic tenets of neutral theory; both in general and in the context of SADs. Second, we explore the issues associated with neutral theory and the SAD, such as complications with fitting and model comparison, the underlying assumptions of neutral models, and the difficultly of linking pattern to process. Third, we highlight the advances in understanding of SADs that have resulted from neutral theory and models. Finally, we focus consideration on recent developments aimed at unifying neutral- and niche-based approaches to ecology, with a particular emphasis on what this means for SAD theory, embracing, for instance, ideas of emergent neutrality and stochastic niche theory. We put forward the argument that the prospect of the unification of niche and neutral perspectives represents one of the most promising future avenues of neutral theory research.

AB Both local- and landscape-scale processes drive succession of secondary forests in human-modified tropical landscapes. Nonetheless, until recently successional changes in composition and diversity have been predominantly studied at the patch level. Here, we used a unique dataset with 45 randomly selected sites across a mixed-use tropical landscape in central Panama to study forest succession simultaneously on local and landscape scales and across both life stages (seedling, sapling, juvenile and adult trees) and life forms (shrubs, trees, lianas, and palms). To understand the potential of these secondary forests to conserve tree species diversity, we also evaluated the diversity of species that can persist as viable metapopulations in a dynamic patchwork of short-lived successional forests, using different assumptions about the average relative size at reproductive maturity. We found a deterministic shift in the diversity and composition of the local plant communities as well as the metacommunity, driven by variation in the rate at which species recruited into and disappeared from the secondary forests across the landscape. Our results indicate that dispersal limitation and the successional niche operate simultaneously and shape successional dynamics of the metacommunity of these early secondary forests. A high diversity of plant species across the metacommunity of early secondary forests shows a potential for restoration of diverse forests through natural succession, when trees and fragments of older forests are maintained in the agricultural matrix and land is abandoned or set aside for a long period of time. On the other hand, during the first 32 years the number of species with mature-sized individuals was a relatively small and strongly biased sub-sample of the total species pool. This implies that ephemeral secondary forests have a limited role in the long-term conservation of tree species diversity in human-modified tropical landscapes.

AB Community-based ecotourism (CBET) is presented as a tool for conservation and sustainable development by conservation practitioners and development agencies, but is reported to have achieved little. Several scholars argue that many problems stem from inadequate power relationships between external actors and local communities, leading to low community participation. This study opens a debate on governance and social enterprise in CBET by examining a bottom-up approach to community-based ecotourism based on a small-scale CBET initiative in an amenity-poor remote indigenous community in Papua New Guinea. This initiative is unique in the following aspects: it was initiated by a community member; external assistance was advisory only; no external financial assistance was given; and it has taken place in a non-monetised economy. Participant observation and in-depth interviews with local key informants were used to identify community-defined positive/negative impacts and community participation processes. Overall, there was substantial support for the project; it contributed to community welfare, generated economic benefit, had positive conservation outcomes and from the viewpoint of the community had no adverse cultural impacts. One of the keys for success was the development of a strong community agency that led to high community participation and individual rather than the community ownership.

AB Global deforestation and forest degradation have led to massive loss of biodiversity and decline of ecosystem services. Against this prospect, it is important not only to protect, but also to restore forest ecosystems. The paper analyzes the current and future role of the restoration of forests and degraded lands starting with the definition of various techniques, scales and objectives of forest restoration. Three key motivations for and targets of forest restoration are then discussed: forest biodiversity protection, biomass production, climate change mitigation and adaptation. The paper also briefly discusses three tools of increasing relevance for supporting forest restoration policies: the development of forest nursery techniques and the improvement of quality of forest reproductive material, the use of standard and certification tools, and financing of restoration investments, including projects aimed at reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. We conclude by making some final remarks on the future challenges of forest restoration policies.

AB Understanding actor-specific responsibility for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is key in adjusting policy and resource allocation in the face of current forest destruction. However, previous research shows that there is great variability in such assessments. To contribute to the ongoing discussions on forest conservation and rural development policies in the Amazon, this paper studies actor-specific deforestation and its environmental effects in four municipalities situated along the Transamazon Highway. We used spatially explicit methods that integrate a database of 8281 georeferenced properties with a time series of remote-sensing data covering four periods between 1986 and 2007. We also included landscape ecology metrics as improved indicators of the complex environmental effects of forest fragmentation. The analysis demonstrates that smallholders (defined as colonists who own less than 100 ha of land) were responsible for 23% of total deforestation in the study region while accounting for 55% of the total properties. We also explored the relationship between property size and deforestation at the property level, finding that it closely follows a power distribution. Property deforestation increased with property size, while the percentage of property deforestation decreased. In spite of this, compliance with current legal requirements to maintain 50% of property forest cover was not statistically different between smallholders and largeholders. In comparison to municipalities dominated by medium- and large-scale ranchers, the smallholder-dominated municipality of Medicilandia showed better performance in all applied landscape metrics with well-established relationships with the provision of important environmental goods and services. Although all studied municipalities showed severe accumulated deforestation, Medicilandia experienced an abrupt decrease in municipal deforestation after 1999 to just 0.03% year(-1), while municipalities dominated by larger holders maintained or increased their previous deforestation rates to between 0.90% and 1.34% year(-1) in the same period. This indicates that the smallholders' productions schemes in our study area might present potential for agricultural frontier stabilization based on improved land-use efficiency. The policy implications of our findings are discussed, especially with regard to the role of smallholders in productive forest conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Inferences about species loss following habitat conversion are typically drawn from short-term surveys, which cannot reconstruct long-term temporal dynamics of extinction and colonization. A long-term view can be critical, however, to determine the stability of communities within fragments. Likewise, landscape dynamics must be considered, as second growth structure and overall forest cover contribute to processes in fragments. Here we examine bird communities in 11 Amazonian rainforest fragments of 1-100 ha, beginning before the fragments were isolated in the 1980s, and continuing through 2007. Using a method that accounts for imperfect detection, we estimated extinction and colonization based on standardized mist-net surveys within discreet time intervals (1-2 preisolation samples and 4-5 post-isolation samples). Between preisolation and 2007, all fragments lost species in an area-dependent fashion, with loss of as few as,10% of preisolation species from 100-ha fragments, but up to 70% in 1-ha fragments. Analysis of individual time intervals revealed that the 2007 result was not due to gradual species loss beginning at isolation; both extinction and colonization occurred in every time interval. In the last two samples, 2000 and 2007, extinction and colonization were approximately balanced. Further, 97 of 101 species netted before isolation were detected in at least one fragment in 2007. Although a small subset of species is extremely vulnerable to fragmentation, and predictably goes extinct in fragments, developing second growth in the matrix around fragments encourages recolonization in our landscapes. Species richness in these fragments now reflects local turnover, not long-term attrition of species. We expect that similar processes could be operating in other fragmented systems that show unexpectedly low extinction.

AB Hunting often impacts rain forest mammal communities but little is known about its indirect effects on other taxa. We examined dung beetle assemblages using pitfall and flight-intercept traps at six rain forest sites in Panama that ranged in hunting intensity. Heavily hunted sites showed altered community composition, significantly fewer species (based on rarefaction), and lower abundances of dung beetles than did sites with little hunting. Our results suggest that intensive hunting affects nontarget forest taxa and is potentially altering ecosystem functioning.

AB In biologically mega-diverse countries that are undergoing rapid human landscape transformation, it is important to understand and model the patterns of land cover change. This problem is particularly acute in Colombia, where lowland forests are being rapidly cleared for cropping and ranching. We apply a conceptual model with a nested set of a priori predictions to analyse the spatial and temporal patterns of land cover change for six 50-100 km(2) case study areas in lowland ecosystems of Colombia. Our analysis included soil fertility, a cost-distance function, and neighbourhood of forest and secondary vegetation cover as independent variables. Deforestation and forest regrowth are tested using logistic regression analysis and an information criterion approach to rank the models and predictor variables. The results show that: (a) overall the process of deforestation is better predicted by the full model containing all variables, while for regrowth the model containing only the auto-correlated neighbourhood terms is a better predictor; (b) overall consistent patterns emerge, although there are variations across regions and time; and (c) during the transformation process, both the order of importance and significance of the drivers change. Forest cover follows a consistent logistic decline pattern across regions, with introduced pastures being the major replacement land cover type. Forest stabilizes at 2-10% of the original cover, with an average patch size of 15.4 (+/- 9.2) ha. We discuss the implications of the observed patterns and rates of land cover change for conservation planning in countries with high rates of deforestation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Tropical Asia (i.e. the Oriental biogeographic region) is the most densely populated and degraded region on Earth with the highest deforestation rates in the tropics. Flow regulation is a significant threat to riverine biodiversity in the region, and its impacts are combined with overharvesting, pollution and other sources of habitat degradation. In addition to these immediate threats, the potential impacts of exotic species and climate change are difficult to predict. Uncertainty about impact effects arises also from the fact that knowledge of the rich freshwater biodiversity of tropical Asia is incomplete, and up-to-date national or regional inventories are lacking. In part, this reflects taxonomic constraints, and a limited representation of Asian science in the international limnological and conservation literature. A survey of recent ( 1992 - 2001) international journals dealing with freshwater ecology and limnology in general, on one hand, and conservation biology on the other, reveal that the representation of scientists based in tropical Asia was extremely low. Scientists from tropical Asia authored fewer than 2% of more than 4500 papers dealing with freshwater biology; 57% of them were published in Hydrobiologia. Less than 0.1% of freshwater biology papers dealt with the conservation of biodiversity in tropical Asian fresh waters. The representation of Asian freshwater science in the conservation biology literature was also poor; 0.6% of 1880 papers surveyed. Such limited dissemination of information reflects a variety of constraints ( e. g. manpower, funding, language, and entrenched attitudes), arising from sources both within and outside the region. Even the data that are published are not effectively deployed toward conservation ends. Awareness of some of the more egregious examples of overharvesting ( e. g. of river turtles) in the region has increased, but strategies for the protection of riverine biodiversity remain underdeveloped. Where legislation to protect water resources has been put in place, it has been directed towards enhancing human use of water - not biodiversity conservation - and enforcement is weak. Exceptionally, the Chinese government has produced national 'Red Data Books' for endangered freshwater vertebrates, and legislation aimed at protecting species at risk, particularly from overharvesting, are in place. Huge obstacles remain, especially in the management of rivers crossing international boundaries. The Mekong River Commission (MRC) provides an example of a model for an international drainage basin that hasmade significant progress in establishing appropriate structures and mechanisms for sustainable development in a challenging political landscape. Not all of the Mekong riparian states participate in the MRC, and this will be essential for sustainable management. However, even within national borders, local interests can override drainage-basin perspectives. In many places in Asia, preservation of near-pristine freshwater environments is not a realistic option. Sustaining human livelihoods is an over-riding concern, and recognition of this fact must be built in to biodiversity conservation efforts. This has special implications for the management of exotic species, as the example of fish introductions to the Sepik River in Papua New Guinea shows. Notwithstanding the various factors that constrain publication by scientists in tropical Asia, we must recognise that poor dissemination research results will have consequences for the long-term preservation of the habitats and biodiversity that we study.
   A change in research strategy that establishes priorities, recognises the inevitability of trade-offs, and includes greater emphasis on engagement and partnerships - as in the MRC - is mandated.

AB Tropical deforestation is a progressive process resulting in the conversion of rain forest into a mosaic of mature forest fragments, pasture, and degraded habitat. Understanding the long-term effects of habitat fragmentation on tropical plant community structure is critical to predicting how alterations to the landscape will impact tropical biodiversity. The objective of this study was to examine fragmentation effects on the composition, abundance, and species richness of epiphyllous (leaf- inhabiting) bryophytes. I conducted this research in an experimentally fragmented forest reserve in central Amazonia where data on the distriblition and abundance of 65 bryophyte taxa were analyzed from 16 1-ha sample plots located in continuous forest and fragments. Epiphyll communities inhabiting small (1- and 10-ha) fragments exhibited lower species richness, abundance, and among-site compositional variation than those from 100-ha fragments and continuous forest plots. Reduced epiphyll diversity in small fragments is not simply a statistical artifact of low epiphyll densities, but rather due to a disproportionate loss of regionally common taxa. In contrast, rare taxa responded marginally to fragmentation, and in most cases were more abundant in fragments than in continuous forest habitat. Because epiphyllous bryophytes rapidly establish species-rich communities on spatially discrete habitat patches, they are an ideal plant group for addressing the long-term (multigeneration) impact of habitat fragmentation on plant communities.

AB Subsistence hunting among the Waimiri Atroari Indians in central Amazonia, Brazil, was studied from September 1993 to October 1994 to assess the current levels of resource exploitation. Hunting effort, harvesting yields and species composition of the hunt were recorded daily in five villages varying in number of people, location and age of the settlement. The Waimiri Atroari harvested a total of 3004 individuals of 41 species in one year. Lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), collared peccary (T. tajacu) and spider monkey (Ateles paniscus) represented 87% of the total yearly game weight. Sex ratios of spider monkeys killed were heavily biased towards females indicating a stronger hunting pressure on those individuals. Harvesting yields was proportional to hunting efforts indicating no evident game depletion in the study period. However, capture per unit of effort was significantly different among villages. Differences in total game mass harvested may be explained by local resource depletion associated with age and size of the settlement. However, this relationship is confounded by the capacity of some villages to exploit distant hunting sites. Data obtained in one village showed that harvest rates were higher in hunting sites located far from settlement indicating game depletion in hunting sites surrounding the village.

AB To detect the factors that affect sapling species composition in gaps, we investigated 55 gaps in an old-growth temperate deciduous forest in Ogawa Forest Reserve, central Japan. Gap size, gap age, gap maker species, topographic location, adult tree composition around gaps, and saplings of tree species growing in the gaps were censused. For gaps greater than or equal to 5 m(2), mean gap size was 70 m(2) and the maximum was 330 m(2). Estimated ages of gaps had a tendency to be concentrated in particular periods relating to strong wind records in the past. The sapling composition in gaps was highly and significantly correlated to that under closed canopy, indicating the importance of advance regeneration in this forest. However, some species showed significant occurrence biases in gaps or under closed canopy, suggesting differences in shade tolerance. The result of MANOVA showed that gap size and topography were important factors in determining the sapling composition in gaps. Species of gap makers affected the sapling composition indirectly by influencing gap size. The existence of parent trees around gaps had effects on sapling densities of several species. Gap age did not have clear influences on sapling composition. Variations in gap size and topography were considered as important factors that contribute to maintenance of species diversity in this forest.

AB The phenological pattern of flowering at the community level was studied in a Greek phryganic ecosystem near Athens for 4 consecutive years. Flowering is strongly seasonal: 80% of the insect-pollinated flora, which consists of 133 species, blooms between February and June. There is a variably expressed secondary flowering period in autumn. The pollinating fauna follows a strongly correlated pattern of abundance. Two types of plants were distinguished: pauciflorous species bearing <10 flowers that are large compared to the plant body, and multiflorous species with many small flowers. Pauciflorous species flower in the winter half of the year, while multiflorous species flower mainly in the summer half. The mean flower life spans are 9 and 3 days, respectively. The duration of flowering (DF) for each species is 55 days on average, which is long compared to other communities. The DF shows year-to-year variations, concomitant with the vicissitudes of the climate. The start of flowering of a species is statistically correlated with the temperature in the previous month, not with rainfall; its end date of flowering only partly compensates for the time gained or lost. DF is maximal in winter. The average flower life span of species flowering at any given date varies strongly and independently of the average DF. We tested the hypothesis that flowering phenology is set by phylogenetic and life form constraints. This could not be corroborated for phylogeny, evidently because of the overriding influence of the mediterranean climate, and probably also for biogeographical reasons. In contrast, life forms and multiflorous and pauciflorous species show strong differences. Many (51) of the species are therophytes; we tested the hypothesis that because of their annual habit they would be more dependent on pollination than perennials. Thus we anticipated that therophytic species would be differentiated from perennials in their flowering phenologies. This is not corroborated. We therefore conclude that the seed bank plays a role that is analogous to that of a perennial plant body.

AB The simplest theories often have much merit and many limitations, and, in this vein, the value of neutral theory (NT) of biodiversity has been the subject of much debate over the past 15 years. NT was proposed at the turn of the century by Stephen Hubbell to explain several patterns observed in the organization of ecosystems. Among ecologists, it had a polarizing effect: There were a few ecologists who were enthusiastic, and there were a larger number who firmly opposed it. Physicists and mathematicians, instead, welcomed the theory with excitement. Indeed, NT spawned several theoretical studies that attempted to explain empirical data and predicted trends of quantities that had not yet been studied. While there are a few reviews of NT oriented toward ecologists, the goal here is to review the quantitative aspects of NT and its extensions for physicists who are interested in learning what NT is, what its successes are, and what important problems remain unresolved. Furthermore, this review could also be of interest to theoretical ecologists because many potentially interesting results are buried in the vast NT literature. It is proposed to make these more accessible by extracting them and presenting them in a logical fashion. The focus of this review is broader than NT: new, more recent approaches for studying ecological systems and how one might introduce realistic non-neutral models are also discussed.

AB In many human-modified tropical landscapes, biodiversity conservation and the provision of ecosystem services require large-scale restoration initiatives. Such initiatives must be able to augment the amount and the quality of remaining natural habitats. There is thus a growing need for long-term, multi-stakeholder and multi-purpose initiatives that result in multiple ecological and socioeconomic benefits at the biome scale. The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact (AFRP) is a coalition of 260+ stakeholders, including governmental agencies, private sector, NGOs and research institutions, aimed at restoring 15 million ha of degraded and deforested lands by 2050. By articulating, and then integrating common interests, this initiative has allowed different sectors of society to implement an ambitious vision and create a forum for public and private concerns regarding forest restoration. The AFRP adopts a set of governance tools so multiple actors can implement key processes to achieve long-term and visionary restoration goals. Having overcome some initial challenges, AFRP now has to incorporate underrepresented stakeholders and enhance its efforts to make forest restoration more economically viable, including cases where restoration could be less expensive and profitable. The AFRP experience has resulted in many lessons learned, which can be shared to foster similar initiatives across tropical regions.

AB Tropical forests are diminishing in extent due primarily to the rapid expansion of agriculture, but the future magnitude and geographical distribution of future tropical deforestation is uncertain. Here, we introduce a dynamic and spatially-explicit model of deforestation that predicts the potential magnitude and spatial pattern of Amazon deforestation. Our model differs from previous models in three ways: (1) it is probabilistic and quantifies uncertainty around predictions and parameters; (2) the overall deforestation rate emerges "bottom up", as the sum of local-scale deforestation driven by local processes; and (3) deforestation is contagious, such that local deforestation rate increases through time if adjacent locations are deforested. For the scenarios evaluated-pre- and post-PPCDAM ("Plano de Acao para Protecao e Controle do Desmatamento na Amazonia")-the parameter estimates confirmed that forests near roads and already deforested areas are significantly more likely to be deforested in the near future and less likely in protected areas. Validation tests showed that our model correctly predicted the magnitude and spatial pattern of deforestation that accumulates over time, but that there is very high uncertainty surrounding the exact sequence in which pixels are deforested. The model predicts that under pre-PPCDAM (assuming no change in parameter values due to, for example, changes in government policy), annual deforestation rates would halve between 2050 compared to 2002, although this partly reflects reliance on a static map of the road network. Consistent with other models, under the pre-PPCDAM scenario, states in the south and east of the Brazilian Amazon have a high predicted probability of losing nearly all forest outside of protected areas by 2050. This pattern is less strong in the post-PPCDAM scenario. Contagious spread along roads and through areas lacking formal protection could allow deforestation to reach the core, which is currently experiencing low deforestation rates due to its isolation.

AB The highly diverse intestinal microbiota forms a structured community engaged in constant communication with itself and its host and is characterized by extensive ecological interactions. A key benefit that the microbiota affords its host is its ability to protect against infections in a process termed colonization resistance (CR), which remains insufficiently understood. In this review, we connect basic concepts of CR with new insights from recent years and highlight key technological advances in the field of microbial ecology. We present a selection of statistical and bioinformatics tools used to generate hypotheses about synergistic and antagonistic interactions in microbial ecosystems from metagenomic datasets. We emphasize the importance of experimentally testing these hypotheses and discuss the value of gnotobiotic mouse models for investigating specific aspects related to microbiota-host-pathogen interactions in a well-defined experimental system. We further introduce new developments in the area of single-cell analysis using fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with metabolic stable isotope labeling technologies for studying the in vivo activities of complex community members. These approaches promise to yield novel insights into the mechanisms of CR and intestinal ecophysiology in general, and give researchers the means to experimentally test hypotheses in vivo at varying levels of biological and ecological complexity.

AB Fishing activities worldwide have dramatically affected marine fish stocks and ecosystems. Marine protected areas (MPAs) with no-take zones may enhance fisheries, but empirical evidence of this is scant. We conducted a 4-year survey of fish catches around and within an MPA that was previously fully closed to fishing and then partially reopened under regulated comanaged fishing. In collaboration with the fishers and the MPA authority, we set the fishing effort and selected the gear to limit fishing impact on key fish predators, juvenile fish stage, and benthic communities and habitats. Within an adaptive comanagement framework, fishers agreed to reduce fishing effort if symptoms of overfishing were detected. We analyzed the temporal trends of catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of the whole species assemblages and CPUE of the four most valuable and frequent species observed inside the opened buffer zone and outside the MPA investigated. After the comanaged opening, CPUE first declined and then stabilized at levels more than twice that of catches obtained outside the MPA. Our results suggest that working closely with fishers can result in greater fisheries catches. Partial protection of coastal areas together with adaptive comanagement involving fishers, scientists, and managers can effectively achieve conservation and fishery management goals and benefit fishing communities and alleviate overfishing.

TI Payments for Ecosystem Services as a Framework for Community-Based

ID ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; POPULATION; AFRICA; PARKS
AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) are an increasingly promoted approach to conservation. These approaches seek to develop financial mechanisms that create economic incentives for the maintenance of ecosystems and associated biodiversity by rewarding those who are responsible for provision of ecological services. There are, however, few cases in which such schemes have been used as a strategy for conserving wildlife in developing countries and very few operational examples of such schemes of any sort in sub-Saharan Africa. In savannah ecosystems, large mammal populations generally depend on seasonal use of extensive areas and are widely declining as a result of habitat loss, overexploitation, and policies that limit local benefits from wildlife. Community-based conservation strategies seek to create local incentives for conserving wildlife, but often have limited impact as a result of persistent institutional barriers that limit local rights and economic benefits. In northern Tanzania, a consortium of tourism operators is attempting to address these challenges through an agreement with a village that possesses part of a key wildlife dispersal area outside Tarangire National Park. The operators pay the community to enforce voluntary restrictions on agricultural cultivation and permanent settlement in a defined area of land. The initiative represents a potentially cost-effective framework for community-based conservation in an ecologically important area and is helping to reconcile historically conflicting local and national interests relative to land tenure, pastoralist livelihoods, and conservation. Wider adaptation of payments for ecosystem services approaches to settings where sustaining wildlife populations depends on local stewardship may help address current challenges facing conservation outside state-protected areas in savannah ecosystems in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the world.

AB The replacement of undisturbed tropical forest with cattle pasture has the potential to greatly modify the hydrology of small watersheds and the fluxes of solutes. We examined the fluxes of water, Cl-, NO3--N: SO42---S, NH4+-N, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ in different flow paths in similar to 1 ha catchments of undisturbed open tropical rainforest and a 20 year-old pasture established from forest in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon state of Rondonia. Storm flow discharge was 18% of incident rainfall in pasture, but only 1% in forest. Quickflow predominated over baseflow in both catchments and in both wet and dry seasons. In the pasture, groundwater and quickflow were important flow paths for the export of all solutes. In the forest, quickflow was important for NO3--N export, but all other solutes were exported primarily by groundwater outflow. Both catchments were sinks for SO42--S and Ca2+, and sources of Na+. The pasture catchment also lost K+ and Mg2+ because of higher overland flow frequency and volume and to cattle excrement. These results show that forest clearing dramatically influences small watershed hydrology by increasing quickflow and water export to streams. They also indicate that tropical forest watersheds are highly conservative for most solutes but that pastures continue to lose important cations even decades after deforestation and pasture establishment.

AB Xylem density is a physical property of wood that varies between individuals, species and environments. It reflects the physiological strategies of trees that lead to growth, survival and reproduction. Measurements of branch xylem density, rho(x), were made for 1653 trees representing 598 species, sampled from 87 sites across the Amazon basin. Measured values ranged from 218 kg m(-3) for a Cordia sagotii (Boraginaceae) from Mountagne de Tortue, French Guiana to 1130 kg m(-3) for an Aiouea sp. (Lauraceae) from Caxiuana, Central Para, Brazil. Analysis of variance showed significant differences in average rho(x) across regions and sampled plots as well as significant differences between families, genera and species. A partitioning of the total variance in the dataset showed that species identity (family, genera and species) accounted for 33% with environment (geographic location and plot) accounting for an additional 26%; the remaining "residual" variance accounted for 41% of the total variance. Variations in plot means, were, however, not only accountable by differences in species composition because xylem density of the most widely distributed species in our dataset varied systematically from plot to plot. Thus, as well as having a genetic component, branch xylem density is a plastic trait that, for any given species, varies according to where the tree is growing in a predictable manner. Within the analysed taxa, exceptions to this general rule seem to be pioneer species belonging for example to the Urticaceae whose branch xylem density is more constrained than most species sampled in this study. These patterns of variation of branch xylem density across Amazonia suggest a large functional diversity amongst Amazonian trees which is not well understood.

AB We examined the role of cattle grazing, plants, and soil attributes on species richness, abundance, and composition of ground-dwelling ants in northern California serpentine and nonserpentine grasslands. In addition, we analyzed the relationship between three numerically dominant ant species and overall ant species richness and abundance. We used pitfall traps to collect worker ants at 80 sites over a 2-wk period in May 2002. Twenty species of ants were identified from a total of 5,149 worker ants; 80% of all individuals belonged to three dominant species: Messor andrei (Mayr), Pheidole californica Mayr, and Solenopsis xyloni McCook. Ant species richness was negatively affected by grazing on nonserpentine soils only. In general, soil chemistry and texture formed the most consistent associations with the ant community. Plants were less important than soil attributes in explaining variation in overall ant species richness and abundance, but the abundance of the three dominant ant species was significantly correlated with plant biomass or plant richness. Based on logistic regression analysis, the presence or absence of each dominant ant species was negatively correlated with the abundance of the other two dominants. However, the three numerically dominant ant species did not correlate with overall ant species richness or abundance.

AB Nests of the harvester ant Pogonomyrinex borbatus typically contain higher concentrations of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus than surrounding soils. The difference between nest soils and surrounding soils is due, at least in part, to ant foraging behavior. Ants retrieve seeds from the environment and concentrate seed nutrients in the vicinity of the nest. But elevated nutrient concentrations in nests may also reflect initial conditions, if nest-founding queens are more likely to choose or survive in soils with high organic matter and nutrient content. By measuring the soil nutrient content and surface area of P. barbatus nests ranging from 1 to 20 years of age over two sampling periods, we (a) investigated the relationship between nest soil characteristics and colony age, and (b) tested the hypothesis that nest soils differ from background soils when nests are established. Nest surface area increased with colony age until age 5-10 years and leveled off thereafter. Relative to surrounding soils, concentrations of total nitrogen and orthophosphate increased, and pH decreased, with increasing colony age. The difference between nest soils and surrounding soils in total nitrogen, nitrate, and ammonium concentrations also increased over a 9-month interval between sampling bouts. Extrapolations from regressions of soil chemical variables against colony age provided no evidence that nest founding and early colony survival is more likely to occur in high-nutrient soils.

AB While recent research indicates that human health is affected by the gut microbiome, the functional mechanisms that underlie host-microbiome interactions remain poorly resolved. Metagenomic clinical studies can address this problem by revealing specific microbial functions that stratify healthy and diseased individuals. To improve our understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiome and health, we conducted the first integrative functional analysis of nearly 2,000 publicly available fecal metagenomic samples obtained from eight clinical studies. We identified characteristics of the gut microbiome that associate generally with disease, including functional alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and beta-dispersion. Using regression modeling, we identified specific microbial functions that robustly stratify diseased individuals from healthy controls. Many of these functions overlapped multiple diseases, suggesting a general role in host health, while others were specific to a single disease and may indicate disease-specific etiologies. Our results clarify potential microbiome-mediated mechanisms of disease and reveal features of the microbiome that may be useful for the development of microbiome-based diagnostics.
   IMPORTANCE The composition of the gut microbiome associates with a wide range of human diseases, but the mechanisms underpinning these associations are not well understood. To shift toward a mechanistic understanding, we integrated distinct metagenomic data sets to identify functions encoded in the gut microbiome that associate with multiple diseases, which may be important to human health. Additionally, we identified functions that associate with specific diseases, which may elucidate disease-specific etiologies. We demonstrated that the functions encoded in the microbiome can be used to classify disease status, but the inclusion of additional patient covariates may be necessary to obtain sufficient accuracy. Ultimately, this analysis advances our understanding of the gut microbiome functions that constitute a healthy microbiome and identifies potential targets for microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

AB One of the major challenges in ecology is to understand how ecosystems respond to changes in environmental conditions, and how taxonomic and functional diversity mediate these changes. In this study, we use a trait-spectra and individual-based model, to analyse variation in forest primary productivity along a 3.3km elevation gradient in the Amazon-Andes. The model accurately predicted the magnitude and trends in forest productivity with elevation, with solar radiation and plant functional traits (leaf dry mass per area, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentration, and wood density) collectively accounting for productivity variation. Remarkably, explicit representation of temperature variation with elevation was not required to achieve accurate predictions of forest productivity, as trait variation driven by species turnover appears to capture the effect of temperature. Our semi-mechanistic model suggests that spatial variation in traits can potentially be used to estimate spatial variation in productivity at the landscape scale.

AB A key question in the literature on payments for ecosystem services (PES) is how payments incentivize conservation action and, in particular, how they interact with other motivations, including motivations for environmental stewardship. Related to this question are concerns about the temporal sustainability of PES: what happens when payments cease and whether a 'no pay, no care' environmental ethic is fostered. I present empirical research from a case study in western Uganda, where forest-adjacent communities are paid in exchange for planting trees on private lands, for carbon sequestration. The study demonstrates the range of values people have for trees in the landscape and the range of motivations for participating in PES schemes. However, the analysis shows that payments are clearly the main motivation for involvement, except in one area where people are more motivated by aesthetic and existence values for trees. Given the widespread importance of money in motivating involvement, I investigate the profitability of participation over time. This profitability analysis, in combination with qualitative data on perceptions of, and plans for, the future, contributes to understanding the temporal sustainability of PES. I draw on various strands of evidence to argue that the way participants prioritize payments may constitute a threat to the long-term maintenance of PES activities, particularly in situations such as in this case study, in which there is a mismatch between payments and contract length.

AB In tropical forests, hunting nearly always accompanies logging. The entangled nature of these disturbances complicates our ability to resolve applied questions, such as whether secondary and degraded forest can sustain populations of tropical animals. With the expansion of logging in central Africa, conservation depends on knowledge of the individual and combined impacts of logging and hunting on animal populations. Our goals were (1) to decouple the effects of selective logging and hunting on densities of animal guilds, including apes, duikers, monkeys, elephant, pigs, squirrels, and large frugivorous and insectivorous birds and (2) to compare the relative importance of these disturbances to the effects of local-scale variation in forest structure and fruit abundance. In northern Republic of Congo, we surveyed animals along 30 transects positioned in forest disturbed by logging and hunting, logging alone, and neither logging nor hunting. While sampling transects twice per month for two years, we observed 47 179 animals of 19 species and eight guilds in 1154 passages (2861 km). Species densities varied by as much as 480% among forest areas perturbed by logging and/or hunting, demonstrating the strong effects of these disturbances on populations of some species. Densities of animal guilds varied more strongly with disturbance type than with variation in forest structure, canopy cover, and fruit abundance. Independently, logging and hunting decreased density of some guilds and increased density of others: densities varied from 44% lower (pigs) to 90% higher (insectivorous birds) between logged and unlogged forest and from 61% lower (apes) to 77% higher (frugivorous birds) between hunted and unhunted forest. Their combined impacts exacerbated decreases in populations of some guilds (ape, duiker, monkey, and pig), but counteracted one another for others (squirrels, insectivorous and frugivorous birds). Together, logging and hunting shifted the relative abundance of the animal community away from large mammals toward squirrels and birds. Logged forest, even in the absence of hunting, does not maintain similar densities as unlogged forest for most animal guilds. To balance conservation with the need for economic development and wild meat in tropical countries, landscapes should be spatially managed to include protected areas, community hunting zones, and production forest.

AB P>1. Ants are ubiquitous ecosystem engineers and generalist predators and are able to affect ecological communities via both pathways. They are likely to influence any other terrestrial arthropod group either directly or indirectly caused by their high abundance and territoriality.
   2. We studied the impact of two ant species common in Central Europe, Myrmica rubra and Lasius niger, on an arthropod community. Colony presence and density of these two ant species were manipulated in a field experiment from the start of ant activity in spring to late summer.
   3. The experiment revealed a positive influence of the presence of one ant colony on densities of decomposers, herbivores and parasitoids. However, in the case of herbivores and parasitoids, this effect was reversed in the presence of two colonies.
   4. Generally, effects of the two ant species were similar with the exception of their effect on Braconidae parasitoid densities that responded positively to one colony of M. rubra but not of L. niger.
   5. Spider density was not affected by ant colony manipulation, but species richness of spiders responded positively to ant presence. This effect was independent of ant colony density, but where two colonies were present, spider richness was significantly greater in plots with two M. rubra colonies than in plots with one colony of each ant species.
   6. To test whether the positive ecosystem engineering effects were purely caused by modified properties of the soil, we added in an additional experiment (i) the soil from ant nests (without ants) or (ii) unmodified soil or (iii) ant nests (including ants) to experimental plots. Ant nest soil on its own did not have a significant impact on densities of decomposers, herbivores or predators, which were significantly, and positively, affected by the addition of an intact nest.
   7. The results suggest an important role of both ant species in the grassland food web, strongly affecting the densities of decomposers, herbivores and higher trophic levels. We discuss how the relative impact via bottom-up and top-down effects of ants depends on nest density, with a relatively greater top-down predatory impact at higher densities.

AB Munessa Forest is a mountain forest in south-eastern Ethiopia experiencing seasonal rainfall variation. We investigated seasonal cambial activity and dormancy from increment rates of four different tree species belonging to varying life forms, namely, evergreen native conifer (Podocarpus falcatus), evergreen introduced conifer (Pinus patula), evergreen broadleaved tree (Prunus africana) and deciduous broadleaved tree (Celtis africana). Measurements of stem radius fluctuations were registered with the help of high-resolution electronic dendrometers. Daily amplitudes of stem diameter variations and daily and monthly net growth rates were determined and related to climatic variables measured at local climate stations. Thin sections of wood collected with a microcorer every 3-6 weeks allowed a visual control of newly formed wood cells during consecutive time intervals. Lack of water availability during the long dry season induced cambial dormancy of 5-7 months depending on life forms. After the onset of the short rainy season, stem swelling started quite synchronously with a variation of only single days in all studied species. Evergreen tree species were able to initiate wood formation during the short rainy season, whereas growth in the deciduous broadleaved species started in the long rainy season. The acquired data provide a basis for delineating the species-specific growth boundaries and the duration of the cambial growing season.

AB Despite the growing interest in conservation approaches that include payments for environmental services (PES), few evaluations of the influence of such interventions on behaviors of individuals have been conducted. We used self-reported changes in six legal and illegal forest-use behaviors to investigate the way in which a PES for biodiversity conservation intervention in Menabe, Madagascar, influenced behavior. Individuals (n = 864) from eight intervention communities and five control communities answered questions on their forest-use behaviors before and after the intervention began, as well as on their reasons for changing and their attitudes to various institutions. The payments had little impact on individuals' reported decisions to change behaviors, but it had a strong impact on individuals' attitudes. Payments appeared to legitimize monitoring of behaviors by the implementing nongovernmental organization (NGO), but did not act as a behavioral driver in their own right. Although there were no clear differences between changes in behaviors in the intervention and control communities, the intervention did influence motivations for change. Fear of local forest associations and the implementing NGO were strong motivators for changing behavior in communities with the PES intervention, whereas fear of the national government was the main reason given for change in control communities. Behavioral changes were most stable where fear of local organizations motivated the change. Our results highlight the interactions between different incentives people face when making behavioral decisions and the importance of considering the full range of incentives when designing community-based PES interventions.

AB Although negative conspecific density dependence among neighbours is widely studied, the general prevalence of the effects is still poorly understood due to a lack of studies from zonal forests other than the tropics. In addition, the detection of density dependence may be confounded by the influence of habitat heterogeneity. Here we examined the spatial distributions of 47 common tree species (diameter at breast height >= 1 cm) using the pair-correlation function g(r) in a fully mapped 24-ha subtropical forest in China. We first investigated whether habitat heterogeneity influenced tree distributions, and then examined the conspecific tree patterns and density dependence after removing the effects of habitat heterogeneity. We found that the forest plot exhibited strong large-scale heterogeneity in the distribution of both large adult trees of different growth forms and individual species. After the habitat heterogeneity was accounted for, 39 of the 47 species (83.0%) were found to exhibit density dependence predominantly at close distances among neighbors. Our findings highlight density dependence as a prevalent mechanism for regulating the population spatial structure of most tree species in the species-rich subtropical forest studied here. Furthermore, the occurrence of density dependence is closely associated with species abundance and the strength of conspecific aggregation at local scales. Abundant species with high strength of conspecific aggregation tend to show density dependence.

AB In the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, host-specific natural enemies enhance species diversity and influence the structure of plant communities. This study tests the explicit assumption of host specificity for soil pathogens of the genus Pythium that cause damping-off disease of germinating seeds and seedlings. We isolated Pythium spp. from soil of a tropical forest in Panama. Then, in an inoculation experiment, we determined the pathogenicity of 75 tropical isolates of unknown pathogenicity and seven pathogenic temperate isolates of Pythium on seeds and/or seedlings of eight tropical tree species. Only three tropical isolates, one identified as P. ultimum and two as P. aphanidermatum, were pathogenic. Tropical pathogenic isolates were pathogenic on 4-6 of eight tree species. Temperate isolates were pathogenic on 0-4 of eight species, indicating that some tropical tree species are susceptible to novel isolates of Pythium. No tree species was susceptible to all isolates and two species were not susceptible to any isolate. Collectively, these results indicate that these Pythium isolates vary widely in their pathogenicity, causing differential mortality of potential host species; likewise, the tree species vary in their susceptibility to a given Pythium isolate. These differences in pathogenicity and susceptibility indicate some support for the Janzen-Connell assumption of host specificity. While they are not restricted to a single species, their intermediate level of specificity suggests that Pythium spp. have the potential to have some effect on forest community structure and diversity.

AB Secondary succession was studied in a Mexican cloud forest region along a chronosequence of 15 abandoned pastures (0.25-80 y). Our objective was to determine the effects of distance from the forest border on successional vegetation structure and woody species richness along the chronosequence. Vegetation structure similar to that of mature forests recovered over 40-50 y, both close to (0-10 m) and away from (40-50 m) the border. Total woody species richness was similar for both distances but species composition differed significantly. When primary forest species were analysed separately, basal area, height, abundance and richness were all significantly higher close to the forest border. Primary species such as Quercus spp. (barochorous-synzoochorous) and Carpinus caroliniana (anemochorous) had lower basal area, density and height away from the border than close to it. Secondary species such as Lippia myriocephala (anemochorous) and Myrsine coriacea (endozoochorous) did not differ in their rate of colonization between distances. The limitation of seed dispersal and establishment for primary woody species away from forest borders suggests that propagules need to be introduced to accelerate forest restoration.

AB Replicated circular openings ranging in size from 0.1 to 1 ha were cleared on a Sierran mixed conifer forest in 1996 at the Blodgett Forest Research Station, California and planted with seedlings of six native species. After 3 years of growth, heights of all trees were measured and analyzed according to species, opening size, and location within the opening. To determine the cause of the edge influence on height, we measured differences along north-south transects in extension growth, pre-dawn water potential, and light availability for three species of trees: giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and Douglas-fir (Ptseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii). The sequence of mean height from tallest to shortest based on species was: giant sequoia > incense cedar > Douglas-fir > ponderosa pine > white fir > sugar pine. For all species combined, a ten-fold increase in the area of the opening corresponded to a 34% increase in mean height. Trees were tallest on average in the north rows and shortest in the south rows. There was no difference in height between trees in the east and west rows. As expected, resource availability was greatest near the center and least near the edges with north edges receiving significantly more light than southern edges. In general, observed edge effects on sapling height growth were correlated with light and water supply. However there were important differences between species in the nature of the co-limitation. Giant sequoia growth was most sensitive to light and water availability. Together they explained more than 47% of the observed variation in giant sequoia height. In contrast, only light was a significant predictor of ponderosa pine performance. Douglas-fir heights were significantly related to both light and water but there was more unexplained variability in the Douglas-fir model compared to the other species. These highly controlled experimental group openings provide a standard reference for silviculturalists using the group selection method of regeneration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Relating patterns of species abundance to the processes that determine them at local and regional spatial scales is one of the central aims of ecological research. To examine the relationship between distribution and growth in tropical rain forest, seasonal and annual changes in tree diameter of two tree species with contrasting distribution patterns, Celtis mildbraedii and Strombosia glaucescens, were monitored across topographic gradients in moist semi-deciduous and moist evergreen forest in Ghana over 2 years, 1997-9. Concurrent measurements were made of soil water availability, and during 1997/8, of rainfall, nutrient availability and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The two sites received similar, low, total rainfall during 1997/8, but soil water availability in the dry season at the evergreen site exceeded that at the semi-deciduous forest site. Soil water availability was higher during 1998/9 at both sites. During 1997/8, PAR was similar at the two sites. The evergreen site had soils of lower pH, available P, Mg, Ca and K concentrations than the semi-deciduous forest site. Water availability and the sand content of the soil increased and concentrations of total N and C decreased, from summit to valley positions at both sites. Celtis mildbraedii had significantly faster growth rates than S. glaucescens, and growth of both species was greater at the semi-deciduous than the evergreen forest site during the wet year (1998/9) but not during the dry year (1997/8). Celtis mildbraedii in semi-deciduous forest grew less in valley than summit and slope positions. We conclude that in the absence of a severe dry season, growth is higher in semi-deciduous than evergreen forest, and is related to the higher soil fertility in more seasonal forest. The patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that concentrations of available P and/or cations in the soil limit growth in evergreen forest, while concentrations of N in valley soils limit growth of C. mildbraedii in semi-deciduous forest. There was no evidence that variation in PAR influenced growth rates in these forests. A reduction in growth rate on less fertile soils may be a factor determining the distribution limit of dry forest species, such as C. mildbraedii, in evergreen forest.

AB 1. Overgrazing by exotic herbivores has a widespread impact on plant communities. We used the removal of exotic European rabbits, goats and donkeys from the San Benito Islands, Mexico, as an experimental manipulation to examine the importance of top-down and bottom-up processes in the impact and recovery of an island plant community.
   2. Using a paired approach, we removed herbivores from one island, while they remained temporarily on an adjacent, similar island. We combined this large-scale manipulation with smaller-scale mechanistic experiments: herbivore food-preference trials and herbivore exclosures on the control island.
   3. El Nino-related precipitation dominated vegetation dynamics early in the study. Differences in plant community structure due to selective herbivory between the experimental and control islands were detectable in the second year. Results from food-preference trials accurately predicted changes in the perennial plant community. When herbivores were removed from the experimental island, the abundance of their preferred plants increased while unpalatable species decreased. On the control island (herbivores present), we observed the opposite trend. However, we saw no recovery of vegetation inside the exclosures on the control island, constructed after the El Nino rains, probably due to the absence of rainfall.
   4. While the relationship between herbivore food preference and changes in plant cover is strong evidence of a top-down effect by exotic species, the influence of El Nino precipitation highlights the importance of bottom-up factors, such as water availability, in the recovery of and plant communities from long-term disturbance.

AB Cumulative impacts of logging and road building in a previously undisturbed tract of tropical rain forest in French Guiana were assessed by random sampling of the bird community and 1-km(2) plot counts of diurnal raptors. Similar surveys were carried out during road construction and 15 years later within 5km of the road and were also compared with the undisturbed bird community of a nearby primary forest. The main disturbance was the change in forest structure brought about by logging and secondarily the road opening, the roadside second growth and the depletion of large vertebrates by hunting pressure. The responses of different bird guilds were highly divergent according to their natural habitat requirements, their diet and their vulnerability to hunting. They resulted in a moderate decrease in overall species richness and equitability. All species pooled, the abundance of 118 species was lowered, that of 45 species did not change appreciably and 89 were favored or even appeared. The guilds most affected were those with large body sizes, from terrestrial foragers to canopy frugivores, mostly by hunting, and the open understorey specialists, notably large insectivores and mixed flock members, because of changes in forest structure after logging. The guilds favored by logging and road opening were many of the hummingbirds, upper canopy frugivores and omnivores, and gap, edge or low secondary growth specialists. Recommendations to minimize the negative consequences of human exploitation in rain forests include reducing the width of deforested roadsides to no more than 10-15m on either side, implementing much more careful logging practices and strongly limiting hunting pressure in newly opened areas.

AB Identity, quantity and seasonal variation in recruiting invertebrate larvae were investigated at Signy Island, Antarctica. Nine settlement panels were deployed at each of three sites at depths ranging between five and 25 m over a two year experimental period. Longer-term community development was followed using three panels continuously immersed for up to 21 months at each site, with monthly photographs taken in situ. Shorter-term variations in recruitment were studied by regular replacement of triplicate panels, which enabled the measurement of seasonality of recruitment onto artificial substrata in Antarctica, for the first time. Cyclostomatid and cheilostomatid bryozoans, and spirorbinid polychaetes were the dominant colonising taxa both in terms of numbers and area covered. Very low rates of colonisation were observed: < 2% of the panels at 5 m, and < 6% of the panel areas at 25 m, were covered after 15 months. Whilst little seasonality of recruitment was observed in spirorbinids, that of cheilostomatid bryozoans showed a significant peak between June and February. Successful recuitment levels of colonising taxa suggested seasonal and interannual variation, although not conclusively. Measurement of growth of individual bryozoan colonies was assessed by image analysis of the in situ monthly photographs. Mean growth ranging between 1.7 mm(2) (Lacerna eatoni) and 7.1 mm(2) (Arachnopusia inchoata) per month were recorded. There was considerable inter- and intra-specific variation of growth of the encrusting cheilostomatid species investigated and this is the first report of such measurements having been made in Antarctica.

AB Models that combine seed demography and forest dynamics to predict seed densities in forest patches of different disturbance ages are proposed. Two models are derived from a generalized Lefkovitch model with immigration. The first model assumes constant seed rain; the second one considers seed rain as a function of the forest mosaic configuration that changes according to a Markov-chain process. This theoretical framework was used to analyze data for the pioneer tree Cecropia obtusifolia at Los Tuxtlas rain forest. Our first model suggests that despite low soil-seed survival rates, high seed densities in all patch types in a forest mosaic may be explained by the abundant seed rain typical of pioneer species. We found that an abundant seed rain to all patches enables the regeneration of this species despite high seed predation and pathogen attack rates in the soil. Analysis of the second model suggests that increased gap formation in sites 2-35 yr since disturbance seems to alter seed availability of pioneers and patch dynamics less than an equal increase in gap formation in mature patches (> 35 yr since disturbed). Extensive deforestation that alters seed-rain regimes will prevent regeneration of secondary species such as C. obtusifolia that have fast seed-bank turnover rates. A comparison with previous works calls for more quantitative studies on the input and loss dynamics of soil seeds in different patches for particular tropical species.

AB Elevated ultraviolet (UV) radiation has been demonstrated to stimulate litter decomposition. Despite years of research, it is still not fully understood whether the acceleration in litter degradation is primarily attributed to abiotic photodegradation or the combined effects of abiotic photodegradation and microbial decomposition. In this study, we used meta-analysis to synthesize photodegradation studies and compared the effects of UV radiation on litter decomposition between abiotic and biotic conditions. We also conducted a microcosm experiment to assess the effects of UV radiation on litter biodegradability and microbial activity. Overall, our meta-analysis found that under abiotic photodegradation, UV radiation reduced the remaining litter mass by 1.44% (95% CI: 0.85% to 2.08%), did not affect the remaining lignin and increased the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration by 14.01% (1.49-23.67%). Under combined abiotic photodegradation and microbial decomposition, UV radiation reduced the remaining litter mass and lignin by 1.60% (0.04-3.58%) and 16.07% (9.27-24.23%), respectively, but did not alter DOC concentration. UV radiation had no significant impact on soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), but it reduced microbial respiration by 44.91% (2.26-78.62%) and altered the composition of the microbial community. In addition, UV radiation reduced nitrogen (N) immobilization by 19.44% (4.77-37.92%). Our microcosm experiment further indicated that DOC concentration and the amount of respired C in UV-treated litter increased with UV exposure time, suggesting that longer UV exposure resulted in greater biodegradability. Overall, our study suggested that UV exposure could increase litter biodegradability by increasing the microbial accessibility of lignin, as well as the labile carbon supply to microbes. However, the remaining litter mass was not different between the abiotic and biotic conditions, most likely because the positive effect of UV radiation on litter biodegradability was offset by its negative effect on microbial activity. Our results also suggested that UV radiation could alter the N cycle during decomposition, primarily by inhibiting N immobilization.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; CONSERVATION; ECONOMICS; WORLDS
AB Payment for ecosystem services (PES) is commonly defined as a market based environmental policy instrument to efficiently achieve ecosystem services provision. However, an increasing body of literature shows that this prescriptive conceptualization of PES cannot be easily generalized and implemented in practice, and that the commodification of ecosystem services (ES) is problematic and may lead to unfair situations for relevant PES actors. This paper synthesizes case studies in Indonesia, the Philippines and Nepal to provide empirical observations on emerging PES mechanisms in Asia. Lessons learned show that fairness and efficiency objectives must be achieved simultaneously in designing and implementing a sustainable PES scheme, especially in developing country contexts. Neither fairness nor efficiency is a primary aim but an intermediate 'fairly efficient and efficiently fair' PES may bridge the gap between PES theory and practice to increase sustainable ES provision and improve livelihoods.

AB Phosphorus (P) is essential for plant growth and productivity. It is one of the most limiting macronutrients in soil because it is mainly present as unavailable, bound P whereas plants can only use unbound, inorganic phosphate (Pi), which is found in very low concentrations in soil solution. Some ectomycorrhizal fungi are able to release organic compounds (organic anions or phosphatases) to mobilize unavailable P. Recent studies suggest that bacteria play a major role in the mineralization of nutrients such as P through trophic relationships as they can produce specific phosphatases such as phytases to degrade phytate, the main form of soil organic P. Bacteria are also more effective than other microorganisms or plants at immobilizing free Pi. Therefore, bacterial grazing by grazers, such as nematodes, could release Pi locked in bacterial biomass. Free Pi may be taken up by ectomycorrhizal fungus by specific phosphate transporters and transferred to the plant by mechanisms that have not yet been identified. This mini-review aims to follow the phosphate pathway to understand the ecological and molecular mechanisms responsible for transfer of phosphate from the soil to the plant, to improve plant P nutrition.

AB Recent studies suggest the long-standing discrepancy between measured and modeled leaf litter decomposition in drylands is, in part, the result of a unique combination of abiotic drivers that include high soil surface temperature and radiant energy levels and soil-litter mixing. Temperature and radiant energy effects on litter decomposition have been widely documented. However, under field conditions in drylands where soil-litter mixing occurs and accelerates decomposition, the mechanisms involved with soil-litter mixing effects are ambiguous. Potential mechanisms may include some combination of enhanced microbial colonization of litter, physical abrasion of litter surfaces, and buffering of litter and its associated decomposers from high temperatures and low moisture conditions. Here, we tested how soil-litter mixing and soil moisture interact to influence rates of litter decomposition in a controlled environment. Foliar litter of two plant species (a grass [Eragrostis lehmanniana] and a shrub [Prosopis velutina]) was incubated for 32 weeks in a factorial combination of soil-litter mixing (none, light, and complete) and soil water content (2, 4, 12% water-filled porosity) treatments. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were quantified one week into the experiment to evaluate initial microbial colonization. A complementary incubation experiment with simulated rainfall pulses tested the buffering effects of soil-litter mixing on decomposition.
   Under the laboratory conditions of our experiments, the influence of soil-litter mixing was minimal and primarily confined to changes in PLFAs during the initial stages of decomposition in the constant soil moisture experiment and the oscillating soil moisture conditions of the rainfall pulse experiment. Soil-litter mixing effects on CO2 production, total phospholipid concentrations, and bacterial to total PLFA ratios were observed within the first week, but responses were fairly weak and varied with litter type and soil moisture treatment. Across the entire 32-week incubation experiment, soil moisture had a significant positive effect on mass loss, but soil-litter mixing did not. The lack of strong soil-litter mixing effects on decomposition under the moderate and relatively constant environmental conditions of this study is in contrast to results from field studies and suggests the importance of soil-litter mixing may be magnified when the fluctuations and extremes in temperature, radiant energy and moisture regimes common dryland field settings are in play.

AB Tree species are predicted to track future climate by shifting their geographic distributions, but climate-mediated migrations are not apparent in a recent continental-scale analysis. To better understand the mechanisms of a possible migration lag, we analyzed relative recruitment patterns by comparing juvenile and adult tree abundances in climate space. One would expect relative recruitment to be higher in cold and dry climates as a result of tree migration with juveniles located further poleward than adults. Alternatively, relative recruitment could be higher in warm and wet climates as a result of higher tree population turnover with increased temperature and precipitation. Using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data at regional scales, we jointly modeled juvenile and adult abundance distributions for 65 tree species in climate space of the eastern United States. We directly compared the optimal climate conditions for juveniles and adults, identified the climates where each species has high relative recruitment, and synthesized relative recruitment patterns across species. Results suggest that for 77% and 83% of the tree species, juveniles have higher optimal temperature and optimal precipitation, respectively, than adults. Across species, the relative recruitment pattern is dominated by relatively more abundant juveniles than adults in warm and wet climates. These different abundance-climate responses through life history are consistent with faster population turnover and inconsistent with the geographic trend of large-scale tree migration. Taken together, this juvenile-adult analysis suggests that tree species might respond to climate change by having faster turnover as dynamics accelerate with longer growing seasons and higher temperatures, before there is evidence of poleward migration at biogeographic scales.

AB The assertion that the spatial location of different species is independent of each other is fundamental in major ecological theories such as neutral theory that describes a stochastic geometry of biodiversity. However, this assertion has rarely been tested. Here we use techniques of spatial point pattern analysis to conduct a comprehensive test of the independence assertion by analysing data from three large forest plots with different species richness: a species-rich tropical forest at Barro Colorado Island (Panama), a tropical forest in Sinharaja (Sri Lanka), and a temperate forest in Changbaishan (China). We hypothesize that stochastic dilution effects owing to increasing species richness overpower signals of species associations, thereby yielding approximate species independence. Indeed, the proportion of species pairs showing: (i) no significant interspecific association increased with species richness, (ii) segregation decreased with species richness, and (iii) small-scale interspecific interaction decreased with species richness. This suggests that independence may indeed be a good approximation in the limit of very species-rich communities. Our findings are a step towards a better understanding of factors governing species-rich communities and we propose a hypothesis to explain why species placement in species-rich communities approximates independence.

AB For a better understanding of the influence of external growth factors on the wood structure, samples of 139 tropical trees were analysed across plant families and a wide climatic gradient. For all samples a unique data set on climate, site and forest stand conditions is available. Different vessel variables as well as the relative cross-sectional area of vessel, parenchyma and fibre tissue were studied in individual tree rings of varying sizes. High within-species and within-site variation of wood anatomical variables was observed which was higher than inter-species and -site variation. In addition, between-ring variation within many individuals was higher than variation between individuals. The differences within individuals show how trees can adapt or adjust to environmental variability and can provide information about the plasticity of a species under changing environmental conditions. The variable 'vessel diameter' showed the strongest and most significant correlations to other wood anatomical variables, but also to climate parameters and tree morphology. Thereby tree size (DBH & height) and crown exposure to light had the strongest impact on vessel size and consequently on hydraulic stem architecture. General climate conditions only showed a weak influence on vessel variables. The principal component analyses revealed a strong influence of tree morphology and a weaker influence of climate on the hydraulic stem architecture. In contrast the general climatic site conditions strongly influenced fibre and parenchyma tissue.

AB The generalization that plant communities increase in flammability as they age and invariably lead to resilient self-organized landscape mosaics is being increasingly challenged. Plant communities often exhibit rapidly saturating or even hump-shaped age-flammability trajectories and landscapes often display strong non-linear behaviors, abrupt shifts, and self-reinforcing alternative community states. This plethora of fire-landscape interactions calls for a more general model that considers alternative age-flammability rules. We simulated landscape dynamics assuming communities that (1) increase in flammability with age and (2) gain flammability up to a certain age followed by a slight and moderate loss to a constant value. Simulations were run under combinations of ignition frequency and interannual climatic variability. Age-increasing fire probability promoted high resilience to changes in ignition frequency and climatic variability whereas humpbacked-shaped age-flammability led to strong non-linear behaviors. Moderate (20%) reductions in mature compared to peak flammability produced the least resilient behaviors. The relatively nonflammable mature forest matrix intersected by young flammable patches is prone to break up and disintegrate with slight increases in ignition/climate variability causing large-scale shifts in the fire regime because large fires were able to sweep through the more continuous young/flammable landscape. Contrary to the dominant perception, fire suppression in landscapes with positive feedbacks may effectively reduce fire occurrence by allowing less flammable later stage communities composed of longer lived, obligate seeders to replace earlier stages of light demanding, often more flammable resprouters. Conversely, increases in anthropogenic ignitions, a common global trend of many forested regions may, in synergism with increased climate variability, induce abrupt shifts, and large-scale forest degradation.

AB Relatively, little is known about the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in forests, especially in the tropics. We describe the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment: a large-scale, long-term field study on the island of Borneo. The project aims at understanding the relationship between tree species diversity and the functioning of lowland dipterocarp rainforest during restoration following selective logging. The experiment is planned to run for several decades (from seed to adult tree), so here we focus on introducing the project and its experimental design and on assessing initial conditions and the potential for restoration of the structure and functioning of the study system, the Malua Forest Reserve. We estimate residual impacts 22 years after selective logging by comparison with an appropriate neighbouring area of primary forest in Danum Valley of similar conditions. There was no difference in the alpha or beta species diversity of transect plots in the two forest types, probably owing to the selective nature of the logging and potential effects of competitive release. However, despite equal total stem density, forest structure differed as expected with a deficit of large trees and a surfeit of saplings in selectively logged areas. These impacts on structure have the potential to influence ecosystem functioning. In particular, above-ground biomass and carbon pools in selectively logged areas were only 60 per cent of those in the primary forest even after 22 years of recovery. Our results establish the initial conditions for the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment and confirm the potential to accelerate restoration by using enrichment planting of dipterocarps to overcome recruitment limitation. What role dipterocarp diversity plays in restoration only will become clear with long-term results.

AB Global climate change and invasive species represent two of the biggest threats to the environment. Biological communities are responding to global climate change through poleward shifts in distribution, and changes in abundance and phenology of both native and non-native species. An increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events is predicted with global climate change. Much is known about mortality events of marine organisms in relation to warm thermal stress with relatively little known about cold thermal stress, particularly in the tropics. Intertidal species are particularly susceptible to fluctuations in aerial conditions and many are considered indicators of climate change. Perna viridis is a recent invader to the United States where it fouls hard substrates and soft sediment habitats. During winter 2007/08, a mortality event was observed for P. viridis across Tampa Bay, Florida. This mortality event coincided with extreme weather conditions when air temperatures dropped below 2 degrees C for a period of 6 h during low water. The minimum air temperature recorded was 0.53 degrees C. During this period water temperature remained relatively constant (similar to 20 degrees C). We provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that thermal stress relating to exposure to cold air temperatures during emersion was the primary factor underpinning the mortality event. Similar mortality events occurred in 2009 and 2010, also coinciding with prolonged exposure to low air temperatures. In the short term, weather may be responsible for the temporary trimming back of populations at the edge of their geographic range but in the longer-term, it is expected that climate warming will trigger the poleward movement of both native and non-native species potentially facilitating biotic homogenisation of marine communities. The challenge now is to devise adaptive management strategies in order to mitigate any potential negative impacts to native biodiversity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This review paper evaluates the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing for assessing species diversity in homogeneous (non-tropical) and heterogeneous (tropical) forest, an increasingly urgent task. Existing studies of species distribution patterns using hyperspectral remote sensing have used different techniques to discriminate different species, in which the wavelet transforms, derivative analysis and red edge positions are the most important of them. The wavelet transform is used based on its effectiveness and determined as the most powerful technique to identify species. Furthermore, estimations of relationships between spectral values and species distributions using chemical composition of foliage, tree phenology, selection of signature training sites based on field measured canopy composition, selection of the best wavelet coefficient and waveband regions may be useful to identify different plant species. This paper presents a summary on the feasibility, operational applications and possible strategies of hyperspectral remote sensing in forestry, especially in assessing its biodiversity. The paper also reviews the processing and analysis of techniques for hyperspectral data in discriminating different forest tree species.

AB Coexistence among species that lack genetic barriers to hybridization usually depends on pre-mating isolating barriers. It has been difficult to explain coexistence among African Aloe species because they readily hybridize, often flower simultaneously and are mostly bird-pollinated. Here we show that co-flowering aloes in a succulent thicket community in South Africa partition the fauna of flower-visiting birds. Aloe species with small amounts of concentrated nectar in long corolla tubes were pollinated primarily by long-billed sunbirds. These species co-flowered with species with large amounts of dilute nectar in short corolla tubes which were pollinated primarily by short-billed, generalist nectarivores. Aloe species which share pollinators tend to have divergent flowering times and differences in pollen placement on birds. Without these isolating barriers, genetic dissolution of sympatric Aloe species would be likely.

AB Rapid losses and degradation of natural habitats in the tropics are driving catastrophic declines and extinctions of native biotas, including angiosperms. Determining the ecological and life-history correlates of extinction proneness in tropical plant species may help reveal the mechanisms underlying their responses to habitat disturbance, and assist in the pre-emptive identification of species at risk from extinction. We determined the predictors of extinction proneness in 1884 locally extinct (n = 454) and extant (n = 1430) terrestrial angiosperms (belonging to 43 orders, 133 families, and 689 genera) in the tropical island nation of Singapore (699.4 km(2)), which has lost 99.6% of its primary lowland evergreen rainforest since 1819. A wide variety of traits such as geographical distribution, pollination system, sexual system, habit, habitat, height, fruit/seed dispersal mechanism, and capacity for vegetative re-sprouting were used in the analysis. Despite controlling for phylogeny (as approximated by family level classification), we found that only a small percentage of the variation in the extinction probability could be explained by these factors. Epiphytic, monoecious, and hermaphroditic species and those restricted to inland forests have higher probabilities of extinction. Species dependent on mammal pollinators also probably have higher extinction probabilities. More comparative studies that use species traits to identify extinction-prone plant species are needed to guide the enormous, but essential task of identifying species most in need of conservation action.

AB S. P. Hubbell's unified neutral theory of biodiversity has stimulated much new thinking about biodiversity. However, empirical support for the neutral theory is limited., and several observations are inconsistent with the predictions of the theory, including positive correlations between traits associated with competitive ability and species abundance and correlations between species diversity and ecosystem functioning. The neutral theory can be extended to explain these observations by allowing species to differ slightly in their competitive ability (fitness). Here, we show that even slight differences in fecundity can greatly reduce the time to extinction of competitors even when the community size is large and dispersal is spatially limited. In this case, species richness is dramatically reduced, and a markedly different species abundance distribution is predicted than under pure neutrality. In the nearly neutral model, species co-occur in the same community not because of, but in spite of, ecological differences. The more competitive species with higher fecundity tend to have higher abundance both in the metacommunity and in local communities. The nearly neutral perspective provides a theoretical framework that unites the sampling model of the neutral theory with theory of biodiversity affecting ecosystem function.

AB The importance of neutral dynamics is contentiously debated in the ecological literature. This debate focuses onneutral theory's assumption offitness equivalency among individuals, which conflicts with stabilizing fitness that promotes coexistence through niche differentiation. I take advantage of competition - colonization trade-offs between species of aquatic micro-organisms ( protozoans and rotifers) to show that equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms can operate simultaneously. Competition trials between species with similar colonization abilities were less likely to result in competitive exclusion than for species further apart. While the stabilizing mechanism( colonization differences) facilitates coexistence at large spatial scales, species with similar colonization abilities also exhibited local coexistence probably due to fitness similarities allowing weak stabilizing mechanisms to operate. These results suggest that neutral-and niche-based mechanisms of coexistence can simultaneously operate at differing temporal and spatial scales, and such a spatially explicit view of coexistence may be one way to reconcile niche and neutral dynamics.

AB The plant functional group approach has the potential to clarify ecological patterns and is of particular importance in simplifying the application of ecological models in high biodiversity ecosystems. Six functional groups (pasture grass, pasture sapling, top-canopy tree, top-canopy liana, mid canopy tree, and understory tree) were established a priori based on ecosystem inhabited, life form, and position within the forest canopy profile on eastern Amazonian region. Ecophysiological traits related to photosynthetic gas exchange were then used to characterize such groups. The ecophysiological traits evaluated showed considerable variations among groups. The pasture grass functional group (a C-4 photosynthetic pathway species) showed high instantaneous water use efficiency (A (max)/g (s)@A (max)), high photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (A (max)/N (area)), and high ratio of A (max) to dark respiration (A (max)/R (d)). Among the species with the C-3 photosynthetic pathway, the top-canopy liana group showed the highest mean of A (max)/g (s)@A (max), statistically distinct from the lowest average presented by the understory tree group. Furthermore, the pasture sapling group showed the lowest average of A (max)/R (d), statistically distinct from the high average observed for the understory tree group. Welch-ANOVAs followed by Games-Howell post hoc tests applied to ecophysiological traits produced reasonable distinctions among functional groups, although no significant distinction was detected between the groups top-canopy tree and pasture sapling. Species distribution within the functional groups was accurately reproduced by discriminant analyses based on species averages of ecophysiological traits. The present work convincingly shows that the functional groups identified have distinct ecophysiological characteristics, with the potential to respond differently to environmental factors. Such information is of great importance in modeling efforts that evaluate the effects of dynamic changes in tropical plant communities over ecosystem primary productivity.

AB Questions: 1. How does the composition and diversity of established seedlings compare to that of larger size classes in tropical forests? 2. How do species abundances in the seedling layer vary with adult abundance and life history strategies'?
   Location: Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama.
   Methods: We inventoried woody seedlings 2:20 cm tall and < 1 cm DBH in ca. 20 000 1-m(2) quadrats within the BCI 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot, where all trees and shrubs > 1 cm DBH have been identified. We compared diversity and composition of seedlings to that of larger size classes and tested whether adult abundance, growth form, and shade tolerance contributed to variation in seedling abundance among species.
   Results: We encountered 60056 seedlings of 332 tree, shrub, and liana species. Diversity of tree seedlings was lower than that of trees 2: 1 cm DBH. Species abundances in the seedling layer increased non-linearly with reproductive adult abundance, such that per capita seedling abundance declined with adult abundance. Per capita seedling abundance was highest for canopy tree species and lowest for understorey trees. For canopy trees, shade-tolerant species had significantly higher per capita seedling abundance than more light-demanding species.
   Conclusions: The woody seedling layer on BCI is composed of a subset of the species present in larger size classes. Most species were present in less than 1% of seedling plots, suggesting strong recruitment limitation. Tree species abundance in the seedling layer is largely a function of reproductive adult abundance, but is also influenced by life history strategies and compensatory processes.

AB IT IS WIDELY ANTICIPATED THAT HABITAT LOSS will cause a mass extinction of tropical forest species. To evaluate this possibility, Wright & Muller-Landau (2006, henceforth WML) project future net tropical forest loss from United Nations projections of human population growth and present day relationships between human population density and the percentage of original forest cover remaining for 45 countries that support 89.6 percent of extant, humid tropical forest. Absolute rates of deforestation (area/yr) are predicted to decline in this analysis, and urbanization is predicted to accelerate the decline to the extent that rural populations control forest cover change. These projections suggest that large areas of tropical forest cover will remain in 2030 and beyond, and thus that habitat loss will threaten extinction for a smaller proportion of tropical forest species than previously predicted. Brook et al. (2006, henceforth BBKS) object. BBKS repeat caveats presented by WML and raise additional objections. Here, we show why we believe most of these new objections are unfounded.

AB Available empirical evidence suggests that many primate populations are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic actions and we present evidence to indicate that Africa is a continent of particular concern in terms of global primate conservation. We review the causes and consequences of decline in primate diversity in Africa and argue that the major causes of decline fall into four interrelated categories: deforestation, bushmeat harvest, disease and climate change. We go on to evaluate the rarity and distribution of species to identify those species that may be particularly vulnerable to threats and examine whether these species share any characteristic traits. Two factors are identified that suggest that our current evaluation of extinction risk may be overly optimistic; evidence suggests that the value of existing forest fragments may have been credited with greater conservation value in supporting primate populations than they actually have and it is clear that the extinction debt from historical deforestation has not being adequately considered. We use this evaluation to suggest what future actions will be advantageous to advance primate conservation in Africa and evaluate some very positive conservation gains that are currently occurring.

AB Natural habitats adjacent to human-modified areas often suffer edge effects stemming from physical disturbance, elevated predator densities, or invasive species. Although seldom documented, detrimental edge effects can also occur at natural ecological boundaries. Here I examine the spatial pattern and ecological effects of a biological invasion at well-delineated and abrupt edges between riparian corridors and coastal sage scrub at 10 sites in southwestern California. The invasive Argentine ant Linepithema humile thrives in moist riparian corridors but decreases greatly in number with increasing distance into adjacent dry scrub habitats. As L. humile numbers decrease, both the number of native ant workers and the number of native ant species captured in pitfall traps increase. Argentine ants appear to suppress native ants within at least 50 m of riparian corridors, but these effects diminish to undetectable levels by 200 m. At comparable uninvaded sites neither the number of native ant workers nor the number of native ant species captured in pitfall traps varies significantly across riparian-scrub edges. Areas subject to this edge effect may be sinks both for native ants and for organisms that depend on them for food or services. In general edge effects occurring at natural boundaries should receive increased attention as they might disrupt ecosystems not greatly altered by human activity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB 1. Tropical biodiversity is seriously threatened by deforestation but few studies have quantified its impact. We aimed to measure the impact of forest clearance and different methods of establishing Terminalia Norensis (Combretaceae) forest plantations on the abundance, richness and composition of ants. the most abundant group of arthropods in tropical forest canopies, in the Mblamayo Forest Reserve in Cameroon. For canopy ants, we quantified the effects of different methods of plantation establishment by sampling two sets of plots subjected to complete clearance, partial mechanical clearance and partial manual clearance relative to uncleared forest reference plots. For leaf-litter ants, we quantified the impacts of different levels of forest disturbance along a gradient from near primary forest to complete forest clearance.
   2. A total of 97 ant species was recorded from the canopy (from approximately 48 500 individuals), at an average of 213 (+/-45) ants m(-2). Jack-knife estimates of species richness showed that at one site. Bilik. 87% more species occurred in the partial manual clearance plot than the complete clearance plot, with the partial mechanical clearance plot intermediate. At the other site. Ebogo, ant richness did not vary between treatments. Ants were 20 times more abundant in the partial manual clearance plot in Ebogo than the partial manual clearance plot in Bilik, largely due to a numerous Technomyrmex species that might have reduced ant richness on this plot.
   3. Cluster analysis of the similarities in ant species composition between plots, calculated by the Morisita index, showed that site and treatment affected species composition. Neither treatment nor site affected the relative number of species in different nesting categories.
   4. A total of I I I ant species (from 3650 individuals) was recorded from the leaf litter, at an average of 52 (+/-4.6) ants m(-2). Species numbers were greatest in the two partial clearance plots in Ebogo (52-53 species), lowest in the two complete clearance plots (37), and intermediate and most variable in the three uncleared forest plots (40-52). Cluster analysis showed that species composition was not affected by treatment, while neither treatment nor site affected the relative number of ant species in different feeding categories.
   5. Despite some local effects by dominant species, our results support the view that deforestation can reduce arthropod species richness. This study is unique in showing that reforestation methods (using a single tree species) can have a marked effect on arthropod species richness and composition. Specifically, it reveals that ant species richness can be greater in plantations established after partial manual clearance than complete clearance.

AB Large mammals often play important roles in determining the structure and composition of plant communities. This study focused on the extent to which wild pigs (Sus scrofa) influence the dynamics of tree seedlings and saplings in a lowland rain forest at Pasoh Forest Reserve in West Malaysia. Native wild pigs are common in the study area and may significantly influence growth and survivorship of woody plants in the understorey through several activities - namely, nest building, soil rooting and seed predation. To test experimentally the impact of pigs on the plant community, eight 49-m(2) exclosures were constructed. After 2 y, the number of recruits inside exclosures was three times greater than in unfenced control plots. Stem density was highly correlated with species richness, which also increased significantly inside exclosures. Height growth of plants was greater in the exclosures by 52.5% for trees between 1 and 7 m tall. Trees less than 1 m tall, however, exhibited no differences in growth. Mortality of plants also did not differ between treatments. The observed differences between exclosure and control plots can be attributed to soil-rooting and seed predation, suggesting that these two behaviours of wild pigs are important to plant dynamics in the understorey.

AB We analysed two potential effects of post-dispersal seed predation on recruitment of the wild olive tree (Olea europaea var. sylvestris), a Mediterranean bird-dispersed tree: (a) the limitation of abundance and distribution of seedlings after dispersal, and (b) the selection of certain seed characteristics of the recruited plants. An observational approach was used to compare seed rain among microhabitats, and how it was affected by seed predation. The relation of microhabitat, scrub density, and seed size with predation risk uas explored by a field experiment. Seed density ranged from 0 seeds/m(2) in open places to 93.2 seeds/m(2) under O. europaea. The overall predation rate was low, as shown in the observational approach (35%). The mean percentage of predation in the experimental approach was 51%, ranging across microhabitats between 28% and 88%. It was higher in dense scrub patches (67%) than in sparse ones (33%), and lower for large seeds (42%) than for medium and small ones (57% and 55%, respectively). Finally, seed density near seed depots did not increase their probability of being detected by rodents or the predation rate. Although predation rates were low, wild olive seeds could be frequently found by rodents due to their spatial ubiquity and local abundance. Together with the efficient foraging strategy of predators (92% of experimental seed depots a ere found), this allowed a widespread post-dispersal predation, but it did not modify the relative distribution of seeds among microhabitats. Thus? in our study, the seed dispersal pattern of the wild olive tree was not reshaped by post-dispersal predation. because (1) rodents did not alter significantly its initial spatial distribution and (2) mice did not seem to limit the number of recruits. Finally, our results indicate that, as a consequence of seed size preferences of rodents, large seeds have a higher probability to survive post-dispersal predation. Thus. seed size may be a key trait to determine the identity of the future recruits in the wild olive tree, ai least affecting the characteristics of the seeds that reach the soil seed bank.

AB The threat to tropical forests is often gauged in terms of deforestation rates and the total area remaining. Recently, however, there has been a growing realization that forest can appear intact on a satellite image yet be biologically degraded or vulnerable to degradation. The array of direct threats to humid tropical forest biodiversity, in addition to deforestation, includes: selective extraction of plants; selective extraction of animals, biological invasion; fragmentation; climate change; changing atmospheric composition; and increasing tree turnover rates. The threats are linked to one another by a poorly understood network of causality and feedback effects. Moreover, their potential impacts on forest biodiversity are hard to assess because each threat is as likely to precipitate indirect effects as direct effects, and because several threats are likely to interact synergistically with one another. In spite of the uncertainties, it is clear that the biological health of tropical forests can become seriously degraded as a result of these threats, and it is unlikely that any tropical forest will escape significant ecological changes. Some groups of plants and animals are likely to benefit at the expense of others. Species diversity is expected to decline as a consequence of the changes in forest ecology. In the 21st century scientists and conservationists will be increasingly challenged to monitor, understand, prevent and head off these threats.

AB Seasonal variation in species and percentage cover of macroalgae was investigated over a 15-month period on a semi-exposed tropical rocky shore. Cages were used to manipulate herbivore access in mid and low shore areas. Algal species richness and abundance showed a marked seasonal pattern, peaking during the winter months and decreasing in the summer. At both mid and low shore the number of species and abundance of algae was greatest in herbivore exclusion treatments and the effect was more pronounced in the low shore where there was a consistent difference between treatments throughout the year. In the mid shore there was a difference in the cover of algae between treatments in the winter months only; for the remaining period there was little difference. Algal abundance and species numbers declined dramatically in all treatments as the temperature increased with the onset of summer, although the decline was less pronounced in the lower shore treatments. The results indicate that at higher tidal levels physical factors influence algal abundance to a greater extent than lower on the shore where herbivory is important, although lower on the shore the physical extremes of a tropical summer are also strong limiting factors.

AB 1. The effects of gap age and size on understorey herb communities and their light environments (indirect skylight and direct sunlight estimated from hemispherical canopy photographs) were investigated in a tropical rain forest in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. Thirteen gaps, ranging in size from 70 to 700 m2 and ranging in age from young (1-2 years old) to old (much greater than 5 years old), were studied.
   2. The mean amounts of relative indirect skylight and relative direct sunlight were 0.083 and 0.116, respectively. Both kinds of light increased significantly with gap size and decreased significantly with gap age, but a significant interaction indicated that size was more important in new gaps than in intermediate-aged gaps.
   3. Herbaceous communities were very diverse; 52 species were found in total. Most species occurred at low frequencies in most sites. The number of species per gap (mean = 15.2) was not affected significantly by gap age or size, although the Shannon - Weaver diversity index H' (mean = 2.1) was significantly highest in young gaps (mean = 2.4) followed by intermediate-aged gaps (mean = 2.1).
   4. Total standing leaf area produced by herbs (mean = 0.795 m2 m-2) was significantly affected by both gap size and age; it was highest in intermediate-aged, medium-sized gaps (1.935 m2 m-2).
   5. Hemiepiphytic aroids were numerically important at most sites. Terrestrial aroids and large monocots were also found to be important groups at many sites, not numerically, but by their relative contributions to total standing leaf area.
   6. Species assemblages differed considerably between sites (mean proportional similarity, PS = 40.8%). Intermediate-aged gaps were more similar to each other (mean PS = 52-7%) than young gaps were to each other (mean PS = 35.3%). Mature forest sites were the least similar to all the other sites (mean PS = 28.9%).
   7. Gaps of the same age and size were more similar in species assemblages than those that differed in size or age, but this trend was only of marginal significance.
   8. There were reproductives at all sites; the highest relative number was in the intermediate-aged sites, not the bright sites, new gaps or young gaps.
   10. The influence of gap size on the light environment is important in understanding the dynamics of the herbaceous communities. Gaps of intermediate age, the part of the forest that is in the 'building phase', are just as critical as the new-gap phase of the forest dynamics.

AB In the context of a recent massive increase in research on plant root functions and their impact on the environment, root ecologists currently face many important challenges to keep on generating cutting-edge, meaningful and integrated knowledge. Consideration of the below-ground components in plant and ecosystem studies has been consistently called for in recent decades, but methodology is disparate and sometimes inappropriate. This handbook, based on the collective effort of a large team of experts, will improve trait comparisons across studies and integration of information across databases by providing standardised methods and controlled vocabularies. It is meant to be used not only as starting point by students and scientists who desire working on below-ground ecosystems, but also by experts for consolidating and broadening their views on multiple aspects of root ecology. Beyond the classical compilation of measurement protocols, we have synthesised recommendations from the literature to provide key background knowledge useful for: (1) defining below-ground plant entities and giving keys for their meaningful dissection, classification and naming beyond the classical fine-root vs coarse-root approach; (2) considering the specificity of root research to produce sound laboratory and field data; (3) describing typical, but overlooked steps for studying roots (e.g. root handling, cleaning and storage); and (4) gathering metadata necessary for the interpretation of results and their reuse. Most importantly, all root traits have been introduced with some degree of ecological context that will be a foundation for understanding their ecological meaning, their typical use and uncertainties, and some methodological and conceptual perspectives for future research. Considering all of this, we urge readers not to solely extract protocol recommendations for trait measurements from this work, but to take a moment to read and reflect on the extensive information contained in this broader guide to root ecology, including sections I-VII and the many introductions to each section and root trait description. Finally, it is critical to understand that a major aim of this guide is to help break down barriers between the many subdisciplines of root ecology and ecophysiology, broaden researchers' views on the multiple aspects of root study and create favourable conditions for the inception of comprehensive experiments on the role of roots in plant and ecosystem functioning.

AB We have a limited understanding of the relative contributions of different processes that regulate microbial communities, which are crucial components of both natural and agricultural ecosystems. The contributions of selective and neutral processes in defining community composition are often confounded in field studies because as one moves through space, environments also change. Managed ecosystems provide an excellent opportunity to control for this and evaluate the relative strength of these processes by minimising differences between comparable niches separated at different geographic scales. We use next-generation sequencing to characterize the variance in fungal communities inhabiting adjacent fruit, soil and bark in comparable vineyards across 1000 kms in New Zealand. By compartmentalizing community variation, we reveal that niche explains at least four times more community variance than geographic location. We go beyond merely demonstrating that different communities are found in both different niches and locations by quantifying the forces that define these patterns. Overall, selection unsurprisingly predominantly shapes these microbial communities, but we show the balance of neutral processes also have a significant role in defining community assemblage in eukaryotic microbes.

AB Canopy gaps express the time-integrated effects of tree failure and mortality as well as regrowth and succession in tropical forests. Quantifying the size and spatial distribution of canopy gaps is requisite to modeling forest functional processes ranging from carbon fluxes to species interactions and biological diversity. Using high-resolution airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), we mapped and analyzed 5,877,937 static canopy gaps throughout 125,581 ha of lowland Amazonian forest in Peru. Our LiDAR sampling covered a wide range of forest physiognomies across contrasting geologic and topographic conditions, and on depositional floodplain and erosional terra firme substrates. We used the scaling exponent of the Zeta distribution (lambda) as a metric to quantify and compare the negative relationship between canopy gap frequency and size across sites. Despite variable canopy height and forest type, values of lambda were highly conservative (lambda (mean) = 1.83, s = 0.09), and little variation was observed regionally among geologic substrates and forest types, or at the landscape level comparing depositional-floodplain and erosional terra firme landscapes. lambda-values less than 2.0 indicate that these forests are subjected to large gaps that reset carbon stocks when they occur. Consistency of lambda-values strongly suggests similarity in the mechanisms of canopy failure across a diverse array of lowland forests in southwestern Amazonia.

AB Total income and income from forest resources among rural dwellers in tropical forest regions are influenced not only by market access, prices, but also organizational, institutional, and social factors. These factors influence the diversity of resources to which the poor have access and result in specializations in livelihood strategies. We analyzed the relation between forest dependence and livelihood strategies in the Bolivian Amazon, applying the SLF. We tested for the differences across strategies with respect to financial, human, physical, social, and natural livelihood assets. Results show that forest income is highly related to cash income from Brazil nut, while income from agriculture and timber exploitation is associated with higher levels of education. Brazil nuts serve as a safety net and start-up capital for certain livelihood strategies in our study region. Livelihood strategies that are based on the commercialization of multiple products from forests and agriculture and services inside and outside communities depend less on forests. Livelihoods can be supported by investing in sustainable livelihood asset endowments. Our results demonstrate that activities that aim to support community forest management and to enhance household income should explicitly consider a differentiated support for different strategies. This will result in a more effective outcome of development efforts from which the poorest people would benefit most. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Plant organ biomass partitioning has been hypothesized to be driven by resources, such that species from drier environments allocate more biomass to roots than species from wetter environments to access water at greater soil depths. In savanna systems, fire may select for greater allocation to root biomass, especially in humid environments where fire is more frequent. Therefore, species from drier environments may have been under selection pressure to reach deeper soil water more effectively than species from humid environments, through faster root extension, more efficient depth penetration, and faster plant growth rates to respond rapidly to variable rainfall events. 2. We compared biomass partitioning, root morphology traits [root extension rate, RER; specific taproot length (STRL)] and relative growth rate (RGR) of seedlings of 51 savanna tree species, sampled from three continents (Africa, Australia and South America) in a greenhouse experiment. We used phylogenetically corrected and uncorrected analyses to compare the traits of the groups. We conducted a permanova on the combined traits to establish whether species could be distinguished on the basis of their combined traits. 3. On average, species from humid environments allocated more biomass to roots and less to stems than species from semi-arid environments, consistent with the expectation that fire pressure selects for greater allocation to roots in humid environments. However, some species from humid environments had fast growth rates instead of high allocation to roots. Both RER and STRL were greater among species of semi-arid environments than among species of humid environments, and also differed between continents. Differences between strategies under each climate type appear to be associated with leaf habit. 4. Synthesis. Plant biomass partitioning has been selected by defoliation pressure and the effects of this selection pressure can supersede any selection in response to local water constraints. Root morphological adaptations, but not plant growth rate, of tree seedlings, have been selected in response to water deficits.

AB Changes in land use and management practices to store and sequester carbon are becoming integral to global efforts that both address climate change and alleviate poverty. Knowledge and evidence gaps nevertheless abound. This paper analyses the most pressing deficiencies in understanding carbon storage in both soils and above ground biomass and the related social and economic challenges associated with carbon sequestration projects. Focusing on the semi-arid and dry sub-humid systems of sub-Saharan Africa which are inhabited by many of the world's poor, we identify important interdisciplinary opportunities and challenges that need to be addressed, in order for the poor to benefit from carbon storage, through both climate finance streams and the collateral ecosystem service benefits delivered by carbon-friendly land management. We emphasise that multi-stakeholder working across scales from the local to the regional is necessary to ensure that scientific advances can inform policy and practice to deliver carbon, ecosystem service and poverty alleviation benefits.

AB This paper discusses the potential application of Payment for Ecosystem Services-like schemes to tackle market failures associated with the public good characteristics of agrobiodiversity conservation services. So called payments for agrobiodiversity conservation services (PACS) would increase the private benefits from utilizing local plant and animal genetic resources on-farm through voluntary reward mechanisms, so as to sustain their on-farm conservation. Theoretical and applied insights about PACS are discussed and attention drawn to some of the challenges to be overcome in implementing PACS. In particular, these relate to the identification of potential buyers, the complex institutional setting in which PACS might operate and the articulation of a meaningful conservation goal based on a safe minimum standard approach. The latter is urgently needed, so as to ensure that additional agrobiodiversity services are generated. Relative to a fixed pricing approach, PACS schemes that seek to overcome information asymmetries through the use of conservation auctions may be associated with significant efficiency gains. However, potential trade-offs between ecological effectiveness, economic efficiency, and social equity considerations need to be carefully evaluated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In ecological communities, the outcome of plant-plant interactions represents the net effect of positive and negative interactions occurring above and below ground. Untangling these complex relationships can provide a better understanding of mechanisms that underlie plant-plant interactions and enhance our ability to predict population, community, and ecosystem effects of biotic interactions. In forested ecosystems, tree seedlings interact with established vegetation, but the mechanisms and outcomes of these interactions are not well understood. To explore such mechanisms, we manipulated above-and belowground interactions among tree seedlings, shrubs, and trees and monitored seedling survival and growth of six species (Pinus banksiana, Betula papyrifera, P. resinosa, Quercus rubra, P. strobus, and Acer rubrum) in mature pine-dominated forest in northern Minnesota, USA. The forest had a moderately open canopy and sandy soils. Understory manipulations were implemented in the forest interior and in large gaps and included removal of shrubs (no interactions), tieback of shrubs (belowground), removal of shrubs with addition of shade (aboveground), and unmanipulated shrubs (both below-and aboveground). We found that shrubs either suppressed or facilitated seedling survival and growth depending on the seedling species, source of interaction (e.g., above-or belowground), and ecological context (e.g., gap or forest interior). In general, shrubs strongly influenced survival and growth in gaps, with more modest effects in the forest interior. In gaps, the presence of shrub roots markedly decreased seedling growth and survival, supporting the idea that belowground competition may be more important in dry, nutrient-poor sites. Shrub shade effects were neutral for three species and facilitative for the other three. Facilitation was more likely for shade-tolerant species. In the forest interior, shrub shade negatively affected seedling survival for the most shade-intolerant species. For several species the net effect of shrubs masked the existence of both positive and negative interactions above and below ground. Our results highlight the complexity of plant-plant interactions, demonstrate that outcomes of these interactions vary with the nature of resource limitation and the ecophysiology of the species involved, and suggest that ecological theory that rests on particular notions of plant-plant interactions (e.g., competition) should consider simultaneous positive and negative interactions occurring above and below ground.

AB Eupatorium adenophorum is one of the more noxious invasive plants worldwide. However, the mechanisms underlying its invasiveness are still not well elucidated. In this study, we compared the invader with its two native congeners (E. heterophyllum and E. japonicum) at four irradiances in terms of growth, biomass allocation, morphology, and photosynthesis. The higher light-saturated photosynthetic rate (P (max)) and total leaf area of the invader may contribute to its higher relative growth rate (RGR) and total biomass compared with its native congeners. Total biomass and RGR increased significantly with the increase of P (max) and total leaf area. The higher support organ mass fraction and the lower root mass fraction of the invader may also contribute to its higher RGR and biomass through increasing carbon assimilation and reducing respiratory carbon loss, respectively. The higher growth rate of the invader increased its total leaf area, ramet number, and crown area. These traits may help the invader to form dense monoculture, outshading native plant species. However, consistently higher leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, and leaf mass fraction were not found across irradiances for the invader compared with its native congeners. Higher plasticity in response to irradiance was also not found for the invader. The invader retained advantages over the natives across irradiances, while its performance decreased with lower irradiance. The results indicate that the invader may be one of the few super invaders. Reducing irradiance may inhibit its invasions.

AB Forest fires constitute one of the most serious environmental problems in several forested regions of India. In the Indian sub-continent, relatively few studies have focused on the assessment of biophysical and anthropogenic controls of forest fires at a landscape scale and the spatial aspects of these relationships. In this study, we used fire count data sets from satellite remote sensing data covering 78 districts over four different states of the Deccan Plateau, India, for assessing the underlying causes of fires. Spatial data for explanatory variables of fires pertaining to topography, vegetation, climate, anthropogenic and accessibility factors have been gathered corresponding with fire presence/absence. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the probability of the presence of fires as a function of the explanatory variables. Results for fire area estimates suggested that, of the total fires covering 47,043 km(2) that occurred during the year 2000 for the entire Indian region, 29.0% occurred in the Deccan Plateau, with Andhra Pradesh having 13.5%, Karnataka 14.7%, Kerala 0.1%, and Tamilnadu 1.15%. Results from the logistic regression suggest that the strongest influences on the fire occurrences were the amount of forest area, biomass densities, rural population density (PD), average precipitation of the warmest quarter, elevation (ELE) and mean annual temperature (MAT). Among these variables, biomass density (BD) and average precipitation of the warmest quarter had the highest significance, followed by others. These results on the best predictors of forest fires can be used both as a strategic planning tool to address broad scale fire risk concerns, and also as a tactical guide to help forest managers to design fire mitigation measures Lit the district level.

AB 1. Differential species responses to canopy gap formation may dominate organization of understorey plant community composition in many forests. Gap creation may enhance heterogeneity in understorey plant communities and could influence biodiversity patterns in young managed forests.
   2. Our objective was to determine whether understorey plant communities exhibit patterns indicative of gap partitioning and to quantify environmental variables related to these patterns.
   3. Patterns in understorey vegetation were studied on transects across harvested canopy gaps in four young, Douglas-fir (Psuedotsuga menziesii) dominated forest stands in western Oregon. Variation in ground-layer disturbance and resource gradients in relation to patterns in understorey plant community composition was also assessed.
   4. Understorey plant community composition differed significantly by location relative to gap in 0.4-ha gaps, but not 0.1-ha gaps, supporting the gap-size partitioning hypothesis.
   5. The concurrent effects of ground-layer disturbance, gap size-related differences in resource gradient intensity, and pre-gap community composition and vegetation structure interact to influence the existence of gap partitioning in understorey plant communities.
   6. Gap creation can influence small-scale heterogeneity in understorey plant communities and thus could be an important management tool in efforts to increase heterogeneity and biodiversity in stands and landscapes dominated by young, second growth forests.

AB 1. South-east Asia has the highest relative rate of habitat loss and degradation in the humid tropics. The responses of less 'charismatic' groups, including butterflies, to habitat disturbance remain relatively poorly understood. Many South-east Asian butterflies are endemic to the region and face global extinction if current levels of deforestation were to continue.
   2. Here, I highlight South-east Asia as a region urgently in need of butterfly conservation research and review empirical studies of the responses of South-east Asian butterflies to land use change. Additionally, I discuss some methodological pitfalls for such studies. Furthermore, I argue for the importance of identifying the ecological correlates of sensitivity of butterfly species to forest modification and the potential biological mechanisms underlying their responses to land use change.
   3. There has been no consensus among previous studies on the effects of land use change on butterfly communities in South-east Asia. Of the 20 studies I reviewed, seven reported higher species richness/diversity in undisturbed (or the least disturbed) forest than in disturbed habitats, nine reported the opposite trend, three reported no difference and one reported a strong influence of seasonality on the impacts of logging.
   4. Some of these studies may contain inherent methodological biases resulting from the failure to control for sampling effects, the lack of consideration for the spatial scale of analysis and incomplete sampling of the vertical strata in tropical rainforests.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Empirical studies of the effects of land use change on tropical forest insects are sorely lacking from South-east Asia. Butterflies are an ideal taxonomic group for such investigations. Future studies should be designed carefully to avoid the methodological pitfalls highlighted here. Determining the ecological correlates of sensitivity of butterflies to forest modification is important for the pre-emptive identification of species of conservation concern and for generating testable hypotheses on the differential responses of species to forest modification. Experimental studies are needed to determine the mechanisms underlying the responses of species to land use change in order to develop effective strategies for the conservation of butterflies in human disturbed landscapes.

AB A study was conducted to determine whether asymmetries in both resource-holding potential (RHP) and resource value (RV) influence dominance and fighting behavior in the hermit crab Pagurus longicarpus. A total of 120 groups of three crabs were observed for 10 min in four experiments that tested all diverse combinations of equal/different RHP (i.e. 'body size') and equal/different RV (i.e. 'shell size' and 'shell quality'). In a fifth experiment, dominant and subordinate individuals of the same size category (26 groups) were forced to enter shells of opposite quality than those previously occupied, and then the behavior of the reconstituted original groups was observed for additional 10 min. As expected, crabs in lower quality shells were more willing to initiate and to escalate fights. However, their attacks were directed to any crab of the group, independently of the defender's shell quality, and the fight duration did not vary with the different value of the resources at stake. This may indicate that P. longicarpus is unable to assess the quality of the shells available in its social environment but bases its tactical decisions during fights solely on its own resource. This suggestion was confirmed by the change in the fighting behavior of crabs whose shell quality was experimentally altered. This manipulation induced an overall increase in the intensity of aggression, drastic modification of crab behavior, and inversion of the hierarchy even though these crabs have had previous experiences of wins/losses and were familiar to the other members of the group. In this species, large crab size and/or the occupancy of adequate (and oversized) shells appeared to be the most likely determinant of contest resolution. Individuals seemed to retain a memory of the previously held resource and behaved accordingly.

AB Low growth rates of atmospheric CO2 were observed following the 1991 Pinatubo (Luzon) volcanic eruption. One hypothesis for this CO2 anomaly is that since diffuse light is more efficiently used by forests than direct light, the increase in the diffuse fraction of sunlight due to scattering by volcanic sulfur aerosol in the years following the eruption substantially increased forest net primary production (NPP). However, other observations suggest a decrease in northern forest NPP because of the cooler conditions following the eruption. Here we used a global database of dated tree ring widths (which correlate with forest NPP) to test this hypothesis. Ice core records of sulfur deposition allowed us to identify the timing and magnitude of 23 Pinatubo-scale eruptions since 1000 CE. We found a significant decrease in ring width for trees in middle to high northern latitudes (north of 45degreesN) following eruption sulfur peaks. Decreases in tree ring widths were in the range of 2-8% and persisted for similar to8 years following sulfur peaks, with minima at around 4-6 years. Ring width changes at lower latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (30degreesN to 45degreesN) and in the Southern Hemisphere (30degreesS to 56degreesS) were not significant. In the tropics (30degreesN to 30degreesS) the paucity of tree ring records did not permit the evaluation of NPP changes. Given that elevated aerosol levels and summer cooling last only similar to2-3 years after an eruption, the persistence of declines in northern tree growth for up to 8 years after eruptions implies some additional mechanism that links these shorter-lived global eruption effects to sustained changes in tree physiology, biogeochemistry, or microclimate. At least for this sample of trees, the beneficial effect of aerosol light scattering appears to be entirely offset by the deleterious effect of eruption-induced climate change.

AB Frugivores are thought to influence plant recruitment by creating initial seed deposition templates. However, post-deposition processes (e.g., predation) may obscure these initial patterns. Few studies have examined successive life-history stages of animal-dispersed plants to evaluate how initial frugivore seed deposition influences early life stages of plant recruitment. We addressed this issue by quantifying seed removal and seedling recruitment of Monodora myristica (Annonaceae), a tropical, low-fecundity, forest tree in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Fruit morphology suggests that this species. is dispersed by only the largest arboreal frugivores. We determined which frugivores removed fruit during focal tree watches and quantified seed fate in experiments designed to mimic natural deposition. We estimated stage-specific transition probabilities of survivorship to seedling establishment and determined expected seedling recruitment from each deposition condition., To evaluate spatial and temporal variation, these methods were conducted at two sites, 15 km apart, over two years. Finally, we compared frugivore abundance between sites to expected seedling and standing seedling, sapling, and pole abundances. We found that large-bodied primates were critical for seed dispersal. They were the only frugivores that opened the hard-husked fruits and were estimated to disperse >85% of mature seeds. Seeds placed away from parents had higher germination and establishment probabilities than those under parents, indicating that seed dispersal is advantageous. Single seeds away from parents (mimicking small-bodied primate seed, spitting) had the highest cumulative seedling-recruitment probability. However, in three of four site-by-year combinations, 86-94% of estimated recruits came from seeds placed in clumps in dung (mimicking large-bodied primates). High recruitment in the latter condition is. due to the large number of seeds estimated to,be deposited by large-bodied primates. Despite this concordance, germination and establishment probabilities were highly variable between sites and years. Germination was a limiting step in recruitment, and high seed mortality from beetles and rodents indicates the importance of predation. The site with higher frugivorous primate abundance had higher standing seedling abundance, but lower expected seedling recruitment and lower sapling and pole abundances. Thus, even in a system where frugivores are critical for dispersal, spatial and temporal variation in post-deposition processes reduces predictability of frugivore actions on seedling recruitment.

TI The trophic structure and predation impact of a low latitude midwater
   fish assemblage
SO PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Review
AB The trophic ecology of a midwater fish assemblage was investigated in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, a regime exhibiting the principal physical-biological characteristics of oligotrophic low latitude ecosystems. In all, the diets of 164 species of midwater fishes were examined, with data for 121 being sufficient for analytical comparisons. Cluster analysis grouped the assemblage into 15 feeding guilds, with these falling into two major groups, those including zooplanktivores with largely crustacean diets, and those including predators on large prey, most of which were piscivores. Among the zooplanktivores, the principal predators were the Myctophidae, Sternoptychidae and Gonostomatidae which, respectively, consumed 31%, 27% and 14% of the food biomass eaten daily by the midwater fish assemblage. The myctophids alone accounted for 53% of the copepod and 40% of the euphausiid biomass ingested. The copepod genus Pleuromamma was especially important forage, constituting 40% of the copepod biomass consumed by the midwater fish assemblage. The Stomiidae were the dominant piscivores and accounted for 20% of the total food ingested daily and 61% of the fish eaten, with the majority of their prey being myctophids. Literature comparisons reveal that diet patterns for the eastern Gulf midwater assemblage closely resemble those for mid-to-low latitude oligotrophic regimes in general.
   Daily consumption of the entire assemblage is estimated at 2.5-4.3 kg C km(2) in the upper 1000 m. Four fifths of this is zooplankton while the balance is large prey, mostly fishes. The ingestion rate accounts for only 5-10% of the daily production of zooplankton, but 95% of fish daily production. While the latter is obviously an overestimate it does suggest a tighter nutritional coupling of the midwater fish assemblage with the upper trophic levels of the ecosystem than with zooplankton. Midwater fishes and shrimps, the two dominant groups of micronekton, together account for only 25% of zooplankton daily production consumed in the eastern Gulf and it remains unresolved as to which midwater ecosystem components are responsible for most of the utilization of zooplankton food resources.

AB We studied the pre-germination loss of seeds to invertebrate and vertebrate seed predators of 5 species of Amazonian trees (Astrocaryum macrocalyx - Palmae; Bertholletia excelsa - Lecithydaceae; Calatola venezuelana - Icacinaceae; Dipteryx micrantha - Leguminosae (Papilionoidae); Hymenaea courbaril -Leguminosae (Caesalpinoidae)). These five species were selected from a large tree flora on several criteria. All possess large (3-10 cm) well-protected seeds that might plausibly be attractive to mammalian seed predators. The reproductive biology of three of the species, or close congeners, had been studied elsewhere in the Neotropics (Astrocaryum, Dipteryx, Hymenaea); one is important to the economy of southeastern Peru (Bertholletia); and one, despite large and apparently edible seeds, appeared to suffer no pre-germination loss to predators (Calatola). We conducted the research in mature forests in the Manu National Park of southeastern Peru where mammal densities are unperturbed by human activities. Densities of adult trees of the five species in our area range from very high (> 30 per ha: Astrocaryum) to very low (much less than 1 per ha: Hymenaea).
   Loss of seeds to all causes, and to mammalian seed predators in particular, was determined for seeds placed in 2-square meter mammal exclosures and in open controls located at 10 m (near) and 50 m (far) from a large mature individual of the target species (with minor variations in the design for Astrocaryum and Calatola). The exclosures were of two types: impermeable - designed to exclude all mammals, but not invertebrate seed predators, and semipermeable - designed to admit small (< 500 g), but not large mammals. Experimental and control plots were stocked with apparently viable seeds during the dry-wet transition period (October-November) and scored one year later.
   A significant distance effect (higher predation near vs far from a large conspecific adult) was found in only one of the species (Astrocaryum), the only one to be attacked with high frequency by invertebrate seed predators. The absence of any detectable distance effect attributable to mammals suggests that mammals, over the course of a year, thoroughly search the forest floor for seeds. Invertebrates may thus be responsible for most pre-germination distance (density) effects. With respect to the treatments, we found three qualitatively distinct results: seeds of three species (Astrocaryum, Bertholletia, Dipteryx) were significantly protected by the impermeable, but not semipermeable exclosures, implicating small mammals in seed loss; the seeds of one species (Hymenaea) were significantly protected by exclosures of both types, implicating large mammals; and the seeds of one species (Calatola) exhibited 100% survival, whether or not protected by exclosures. The importance of large mammals as seed predators is generally underestimated in these experiments because semipermeable exclosures may serve as foraging reserves for small mammals. Finally, we noted no relationship between the intensity of mammalian seed predation (as suggested by the survival of unprotected seeds) and the abundance of adults of the five species in the environment. The diversity of results obtained for the five species reveals that large-seeded tropical trees may display a wide range of demographic patterns, and points to the likely importance of post-germination bottlenecks in the population biology of many species, even those that may experience severe pre-germination seed loss.

AB In this overview (introductory article to a special issue including 14 papers), we consider all main types of natural and artificial inland freshwater habitas (fwh). For each type, we identify the main biodiversity patterns and ecological features, human impacts on the system and environmental issues, and discuss ways to use this information to improve stewardship. Examples of selected key biodiversity/ecological features (habitat type): narrow endemics, sensitive (groundwater and GDEs); crenobionts, LIHRes (springs); unidirectional flow, nutrient spiraling (streams); naturally turbid, floodplains, large-bodied species (large rivers); depth-variation in benthic communities (lakes); endemism and diversity (ancient lakes); threatened, sensitive species (oxbow lakes, SWE); diverse, reduced littoral (reservoirs); cold-adapted species (Boreal and Arctic fwh); endemism, depauperate (Antarctic fwh); flood pulse, intermittent wetlands, biggest river basins (tropical fwh); variable hydrologic regime-periods of drying, flash floods (arid-climate fwh). Selected impacts: eutrophication and other pollution, hydrologic modifications, overexploitation, habitat destruction, invasive species, salinization. Climate change is a threat multiplier, and it is important to quantify resistance, resilience, and recovery to assess the strategic role of the different types of freshwater ecosystems and their value for biodiversity conservation. Effective conservation solutions are dependent on an understanding of connectivity between different freshwater ecosystems (including related terrestrial, coastal and marine systems).

AB Insecure land tenure plagues many developing and tropical regions, often where conservation concerns are highest. Conservation organizations have long focused on protected areas as tenure interventions, but are now thinking more comprehensively about whether and how to incorporate other land tenure strategies into their work, and how to more soundly ground such interventions on evidence of both conservation and human benefits. Through a review of the literature on land tenure security as it relates to conservation practice, predominantly in the tropics, we aim to help conservation practitioners consider and incorporate more appropriate land tenure security interventions into conservation strategies. We present a framework that identifies three common ways in which land tenure security can impact human and conservation outcomes, and suggest practical ways to distill tenure and tenure security issues for a given location. We conclude with steps for considering tenure security issues in the context of conservation projects and identify areas for future research.

AB Numerous protected areas (PAs) have been created in Africa to safeguard wildlife and other natural resources. However, significant threats from anthropogenic activities and decline of wildlife populations persist, while conservation efforts in most PAs are still minimal. We assessed the impact level of the most common threats to wildlife within PAs in tropical Africa and the relationship of conservation activities with threat impact level. We collated data on 98 PAs with tropical forest cover from 15 countries across West, Central and East Africa. For this, we assembled information about local threats as well as conservation activities from published and unpublished literature, and questionnaires sent to long-term field workers. We constructed general linear models to test the significance of specific conservation activities in relation to the threat impact level. Subsistence and commercial hunting were identified as the most common direct threats to wildlife and found to be most prevalent in West and Central Africa. Agriculture and logging represented the most common indirect threats, and were most prevalent in West Africa. We found that the long-term presence of conservation activities (such as law enforcement, research and tourism) was associated with lower threat impact levels. Our results highlight deficiencies in the management effectiveness of several PAs across tropical Africa, and conclude that PA management should invest more into conservation activities with long-term duration.

AB Restoration of tropical forest depended in large part on seed dispersal by fruit-eating animals that transported seeds into planted forest patches. We tested effectiveness of dispersal agents as revealed by established recruits of tree and shrub species that bore seeds dispersed by birds, bats, or both. We documented restoration of dispersal processes over the first 76 months of experimental restoration in southern Mexico. Mixed-model repeated-measures randomized-block ANOVAs of seedlings recruited into experimental controls and mixed-species plantings from late-secondary and mature forest indicated that bats and birds played different roles in the first years of a restoration process. Bats dispersed pioneer tree and shrub species to slowly regenerating grassy areas, while birds mediated recruitment of later-successional species into planted stands of trees and to a lesser extent into controls. Of species of pioneer trees and shrubs established in plots, seven were primarily dispersed by birds, three by bats and four by both birds and bats. Of later-successional species recruited past the seedling stage, 13 were of species primarily dispersed by birds, and six were of species dispersed by both birds and bats. No later-successional species primarily dispersed by bats established in control or planted plots. Establishment of recruited seedlings was ten-fold higher under cover of planted trees than in grassy controls. Even pre-reproductive trees drew fruit-eating birds and the seeds that they carried from nearby forest, and provided conditions for establishment of shade-tolerant tree species. Overall, after 76 months of cattle exclusion, 94% of the recruited shrubs and trees in experimental plots were of species that we did not plant.

TI "Carbon rights", REDD plus and payments for environmental services

DT Article
DE Carbon rights; Conservation easements; REDD; Payments for environmental
   services
ID DEFORESTATION; PROPERTY
AB Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has become a central dimension of the contemporary international forest regime. The mechanism seeks to reward actors for keeping or restoring forests as a means to reduce carbon emissions. Carbon rights, here understood as title to carbon credits, have an odd status in the REDD+ debate. They are closely associated with the belief that REDD+ will generate (economic) "rents" - i.e. revenues exceeding the full cost of the corresponding effort which means framing the discussion in terms of entitlement to revenues beyond mere financial compensations. We suggest that, in an "ideal" REDD+ scheme, the possibility of obtaining rents in REDD+ would be very limited. In the real world, rent could be created by strategic behaviours by setting a reference emission level (what would occur under a business-as-usual scenario) and by possible acceptance, for political reasons, of inappropriate rules such as being remunerated for the full stock of carbon. The carbon rights rhetoric leads to rent-seeking since remunerations could be disconnected from the active contribution to the production of emission reductions, which is a public good by nature. Another interpretation of carbon rights is the right to benefit from the sale of carbon credits, a framework within which what is at stake is sharing the benefits deriving from the human production and the sale of these benefits, a traditional social issue. In this case, we argue, the concept of-carbon rights is useless and even misleading. Compensating for easements would be a more appropriate framework for designing incentive schemes such as payments for environmental services (PES). Reforming land tenure codes to allow individuals, families and communities to claim property or collective tenure rights on the land and the trees is the issue that matters in order to start tackling fairness in REDD+ and PES initiatives.

AB Systematic evaluation of the environmental and socioeconomic effects of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs is crucial for guiding policy design and implementation. We evaluated the performance of the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP), a national PES program of China, in the Wolong Nature Reserve for giant pandas. The environmental effects of the NFCP were evaluated through a historical trend (1965-2001) analysis of forest cover to estimate a counter-factual (i.e., without-PES) forest cover baseline for 2007. The socioeconomic effects of the NFCP were evaluated using data collected through household interviews carried out before and after NFCP implementation in 2001. Our results suggest that the NFCP was not only significantly associated with increases in forest cover, but also had both positive (e.g., labor reduction for fuelwood collection) and negative (e.g., economic losses due to crop raiding by wildlife) effects on local households. Results from this study emphasize the importance of integrating local conditions and understanding underlying mechanisms to enhance the performance of PES programs. Our findings are useful for the design and implementation of successful conservation policies not only in our study area but also in similar places around the world. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Soil extracellular enzymes mediate organic matter turnover and nutrient cycling yet remain little studied in one of Earth's most rapidly changing, productive biomes: tropical forests. Using a long-term leaf litter and throughfall manipulation, we explored relationships between organic matter (OM) inputs, soil chemical properties and enzyme activities in a lowland tropical forest. We assayed six hydrolytic soil enzymes responsible for liberating carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), calculated enzyme activities and ratios in control plots versus treatments, and related these to soil biogeochemical variables. While leaf litter addition and removal tended to increase and decrease enzyme activities per gram soil, respectively, shifts in enzyme allocation patterns implied changes in relative nutrient constraints with altered OM inputs. Enzyme activity ratios in control plots suggested strong belowground P constraints; this was exacerbated when litter inputs were curtailed. Conversely, with double litter inputs, increased enzymatic investment in N acquisition indicated elevated N demand. Across all treatments, total soil C correlated more strongly with enzyme activities than soluble C fluxes, and enzyme ratios were sensitive to resource stoichiometry (soil C:N) and N availability (net N mineralization). Despite high annual precipitation in this site (MAP similar to 5 m), soil moisture positively correlated with five of six enzymes. Our results suggest resource availability regulates tropical soil enzyme activities, soil moisture plays an additional role even in very wet forests, and relative investment in C, N and P degrading enzymes in tropical soils will often be distinct from higher latitude ecosystems yet is sensitive to OM inputs.

AB The geographic distributions of many taxonomic groups remain mostly unknown, hindering attempts to investigate the response of the majority of species on Earth to climate change using species distributions models (SDMs). Multi-species models can incorporate data for rare or poorly-sampled species, but their application to forecasting climate change impacts on biodiversity has been limited. Here we compare forecasts of changes in patterns of ant biodiversity in North America derived from ensembles of single-species models to those from a multi-species modeling approach, Generalized Dissimilarity Modeling (GDM). We found that both single- and multi-species models forecasted large changes in ant community composition in relatively warm environments. GDM predicted higher turnover than SDMs and across a larger contiguous area, including the southern third of North America and notably Central America, where the proportion of ants with relatively small ranges is high and where data limitations are most likely to impede the application of SDMs. Differences between approaches were also influenced by assumptions regarding dispersal, with forecasts being more similar if no-dispersal was assumed. When full-dispersal was assumed, SDMs predicted higher turnover in southern Canada than did GDM. Taken together, our results suggest that 1) warm rather than cold regions potentially could experience the greatest changes in ant fauna under climate change and that 2) multi-species models may represent an important complement to SDMs, particularly in analyses involving large numbers of rare or poorly-sampled species. Comparisons of the ability of single- and multi-species models to predict observed changes in community composition are needed in order to draw definitive conclusions regarding their application to investigating climate change impacts on biodiversity.

AB A positive correlation between species diversity and genetic diversity has been proposed, consistent with neutral predictions in macroecology. We assessed the species-genetic diversity correlation in tenebrionid beetle communities of the Aegean archipelago on 15 islands of different sizes, distances to mainland, and ages of isolation. Alpha and beta diversity of species and haplotypes were assessed using sequences of 11,000 individuals (mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 and nuclear muscular protein 20). We show that (i) there is a strong species-area and haplotype-area relationship; (ii) species richness in island communities is correlated with intraspecific genetic diversity in the constituent species except when island size or distance to mainland is factored out in partial correlations; (iii) community similarity declines exponentially at an increasing rate when calculated on the basis of species, nuclear, and mtDNA haplotypes; and (iv) distance decay of community similarity is slower in dispersive sand-dwelling lineages compared with less dispersive lineages that are not sand obligate. Taken together, these correlated patterns at the species and haplotype level are consistent with individual-based stochastic dispersal proposed by neutral theories of biodiversity. The results also demonstrate the utility of haplotype data for exploring macroecological patterns in poorly known biota and predicting large-scale biodiversity patterns based on genetic inventories of local samples.

AB Human factors more than ecology dictate conservation opportunity and the subsequent success of implementation. This is particularly true in places such as the Solomon Islands where most terrestrial and coastal marine areas remain in community ownership. However, factors such as community support are not reliably predictable, nor easy to map, and therefore challenging to incorporate into systematic conservation plans. Here, we describe how the Lauru Land Conference of Tribal Communities and The Nature Conservancy have worked with the communities of Choiseul Province, Solomon Islands, to develop a conservation planning process that reconciles community-driven conservation opportunities, with a systematic and representation-based approach to prioritization. We suggest how sophisticated prioritization software can be used collaboratively in a community setting, to dynamically assess and guide conservation opportunities as they arise; a process of informed opportunism.

AB Question: How do soils and topography influence Amazonian tree diversity, a region with generally nutrient-starved soils but some of the biologically richest tree communities on Earth?
   Location: Central Amazonia, near Manaus, Brazil.
   Methods: We evaluated the influence of 14 soil and topographic features on species diversity of rain forest trees (>= 10 cm diameter at breast height), using data from 63 1-ha plots scattered over an area of similar to 400 km(2).
   Results: An ordination analysis identified three major edaphic gradients: (1) flatter areas had generally higher nutrient soils (higher clay content, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, pH and exchangeable bases, and lower aluminium saturation) than did slopes and gullies; (2) sandier soils had lower water storage (plant available water capacity), phosphorus and nitrogen; and (3) soil pH varied among sites. Gradient 2 was the strongest predictor of tree diversity (species richness and Fisher's alpha values), with diversity increasing with higher soil fertility and water availability. Gradient 2 was also the best predictor of the number of rare (singleton) species, which accounted on average for over half (56%) of all species in each plot.
   Conclusions: Although our plots invariably supported diverse tree communities (>= 225 species ha(-1)), the most species-rich sites (up to 310 species ha(-1)) were least constrained by soil water and phosphorus availability. Intriguingly, the numbers of rare and common species were not significantly correlated in our plots, and they responded differently to major soil and topographic gradients. For unknown reasons rare species were significantly more frequent in plots with many large trees.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; EASEMENTS; PAYMENTS
AB Ecosystem services can bridge biodiversity conservation and development needs, but there is little information available on how conservation organizations implement such projects. We documented 103 ecosystem service projects - from 37 countries - implemented by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). These projects commonly involved traditional conservation tactics, such as land purchase and restoration, but also adopted new approaches, such as targeting working landscapes, using new financial tools, and drawing new funding and partners from the corporate sector. We identified nine specific project types, characterized by consistent combinations of tools and activities. TNC and WWF used project types differently; TNC focused more on land purchase, whereas WWF concentrated more on developing markets. Both organizations showed some alignment of project type with socioeconomic conditions. For example, land purchases were used in countries with relatively secure property rights, while access to clean water or food was targeted when these human needs were unmet.

AB Habitat fragmentation may strongly affect species density, species interactions, and the rate of ecosystem processes. It is therefore important to understand the observed variability among species responses to fragmentation and the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we compare density-area relationships (DARs) for 344 lepidopteran species belonging to 22 families (butterflies and moths). This analysis suggested that the DAR(slope) is generally positive for moths and negative for butterflies. The differences are suggested to occur because moths are largely olfactory searchers, whereas most butterflies are visual searchers. The analysis also suggests that DARs vary as a function of habitat specialization and body size. In butterflies, generalist species had a more negative DAR(slope) than specialist species because of a lower patch size threshold. In moths, the differences in DAR(slope) between forest and open habitat species were large for small species but absent for large species. This difference is argued to occur because the DAR(slope) in large species mainly reflects their search mode, which does not necessarily vary between moth groups, whereas the slope in small species reflects population growth rates.

AB Habitat heterogeneity has often been acknowledged as a key factor determining which species occur in a landscape, but we still know little on the nature and relative importance of the processes controlling species distribution and abundance within complex landscape mosaics. We used a framework defined by the compensation, supplementation and complementation models to study the distribution of four species of passerines typical of steppe habitats and identify the degree to which landscape context accounts for their distribution in the steppe-agriculture mosaic of the Crau, southern France. Steppe habitat was the best predictor of species distribution in all cases and that densities were highest in steppe. One of these species, the Calandra lark, is strictly tied to the natural steppe habitats independently of its context. For another species, the Tawny pipit, we document a significant positive effect of the presence, near steppe habitat, of extensive pastoral habitats, such as fallows and grazed crops. Finally, the abundance of the two remaining species, Skylark and Short-toed lark, was negatively affected by the presence of non-herbaceous habitats in the vicinity of steppe habitat. This suggests that the quality of the steppe habitat, as perceived by these species is conditional to the nature of adjacent habitats. Our results suggest that the management of the context in which steppe habitat is imbedded will significantly affect the distribution and abundance of this group of passerines and determine both habitat quality and conservation value at a landscape scale.

AB We hypothesized that severe drought affects the structure of tropical forests by favouring seedlings of some species or groups at the expense of others. To test this hypothesis, we irrigated naturally occurring woody seedlings during an El Nino-related drought in seasonal moist tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We predicted that irrigated plots would retain greater species richness than control plots, and that the benefits of irrigation would increase with the abundance of: trees relative to lianas, wet-forest seedlings relative to dry-forest seedlings, and rare species relative to common species. We also hypothesized that the strength of this filter would increase with increased moisture limitation, predicting that the benefits of irrigation would increase with seedling density and light availability, and decrease with mean seedling age.
   Irrigation did reduce species losses, but not by limiting the loss of drought-sensitive species as predicted. Instead, mortality in irrigated plots was density dependent, whereas species losses in control plots were well predicted by random thinning, suggesting that density dependence weakened as abiotic stress increased.
   Irrigation increased seedling growth, but did not affect seedling mortality. Contrary to our predictions, irrigation increased growth in plots dominated by dry-forest species relative to those dominated by wet-forest species, suggesting that dry-forest seedlings either occur in moisture-limited microsites or are more able to utilize dry-season precipitation. The strength of the filter did increase with potential moisture limitation, as irrigation increased seedling growth more in higher light environments.
   Annual precipitation has declined over much of the humid tropics during the 20th century. Our results suggest that this trend may reduce tropical forest diversity by weakening density-dependent mechanisms that maintain diversity. In addition, plots dominated by dry-forest species experienced higher growth in response to irrigation and also far lower dry-season mortality relative to plots dominated by wet-forest species. While we cannot disentangle the effects of microsite from species composition, these results suggest that dry-forest species may benefit from any increase in dry season length or severity.
   Research conducted during 'normal' conditions may overlook the impact of severe events and thus fail to identify critical mechanisms structuring ecological communities.

AB Despite their vulnerability to forest disturbances in the Neotropics, the consequences of forest perturbation on mixed species flocks are poorly understood in the threatened Southeast Asian rainforests. We examined the effects of local-scale habitat disturbance on mixed species flocks along an escalating gradient of anthropogenic modification (i.e., forest interior, forest edge, and urban) in a sub-montane tropical rainforest in Peninsular Malaysia that is presently experiencing low intensity development. Mixed species flocks in the forest interior and forest edge habitats (9.3 +/- 2.3 and 8.4 +/- 2.3, respectively) had significantly higher number of species than those observed in the urban habitat (5.1 +/- 1.7). Flock participation was influenced by environmental characteristics (e.g., canopy cover). Flocking species sensitive to habitat disturbance were likely to be from the Families Corvidae, Nectariniidae, and Sylviidae: had narrow to restricted altitudinal ranges; and were exclusively dependent on primary forest and understory micro-habitats. We conclude that sub-montane mixed species flocks are affected by even small scale urbanization and that they, particularly with species richness as a parameter, can be used as effective ecological indicators. With the looming development pressure on the sub-montane/montane habitats in Peninsular Malaysia and the Southeast Asian region, urgent conservation actions are needed for the preservation of their biotas.

AB Objective-To evaluate the efficacy of trap-neuter-return and trap-euthanatize management strategies for controlling urban free-roaming cat populations by use of matrix population models.
   Design-Prospective study.
   Sample Population-Estimates of free-roaming cat populations in urban environments.
   Procedure-Data from the literature describing the biology of free-roaming cat populations in urban environments were gathered. A matrix population model was developed with a range of high and low survival and fecundity values and all combinations of those values. The response of population growth rate to a range of management actions was assessed with an elasticity analysis.
   Results-All possible combinations of survival and fecundity values of free-roaming cats led to predictions of rapid, exponential population growth. The model predicted effective cat population control by use of annual euthanasia of greater than or equal to 50% of the population or by annual neutering of > 75% of the fertile population. Elasticity analyses revealed that the modeled population was most susceptible to control through euthanasia.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Free-roaming cat populations have a high intrinsic growth rate, and euthanasia is estimated to be more effective at reducing cat populations than trap-neuter-return programs.

AB Mortality, growth, gas exchange and biomass distribution were measured in the seedlings of 12 Chilean temperate rainforest angiosperm trees in two contrasting artificial light environments (150 and 12 mumoles m(-2) s(-1)), in order to explore life history diversity in this forest type, and examine the physiological and/or morphological traits associated with interspecific variation in seedling performance. Gas exchange traits were measured only in the high-light treatment (150 mumoles m(-2) s(-1)), owing to the very small size of leaves in the low-light treatment. Relative growth rates (RGR) in high light were strongly correlated with photosynthetic capacity (P < 0.0001). Mortality rates in low light had a strong positive correlation with light compensation point (P = 0.007) and photosynthetic capacity (P = 0.004). Furthermore, high-light RGR was strongly positively correlated with low-light mortality (P = 0.001). Biomass distribution traits showed little relationship with mortality or growth within either light level, except for a marginally significant positive correlation (P = 0.04) between leaf area ratio and mortality in low light. In view of the large interspecific differences in final size, the weak relationships between biomass distribution parameters and plant performance could be partially attributable to ontogenetic drift in these traits. Among taxa with high mortality rates in low light, short-lived species (e.g. Aristotelia chilensis) had lower light compensation points, had greater phenotypic plasticity and grew much faster in both light environments than did longer-lived species (Nothofagus dombeyi , Weinmannia trichosperma, Eucryphia cordifolia). Results support the view that survival of first-year seedlings in low light is not enhanced by morphological traits that maximize growth potential (e.g. high leaf area ratio), and that leaf-level gas exchange traits have an important role as determinants of interspecific variation in seedling performance. However, the limited range of interspecific variation observed in light compensation points indicates that other traits apart from those that we measured (e.g. carbon storage) must also be involved in seedling shade tolerance differences. The weak relationship between longevity and shade tolerance level among our 12 species suggests that it may not be feasible to ordinate life histories of Chilean temperate rainforest trees on a single axis of trait variation.

AB The pattern of growth increment zones, the cambial growth dynamics and the structural variation in wood formation of Swietenia macrophylla King, Carapa guianensis Aubl., and Cedrela odorata L. (Meliaceae) were investigated in order to understand the relationship of site conditions and sustainable growth in Central Amazonian plantations. Trees were available from 8-, 17-, 23-, and 57-year-old plantations, and from primary forests in Manaus (Amazonia), Santarem (Para), and Aripuana (Mato Grosso). The wood anatomical structure and the annual increments of 61 Swietenia, 94 Carapa, and 89 Cedrela trees were studied for different tree heights. The curves of annual increments were cross-dated and tested for synchronisation. The cambial growth dynamics of up to 52 trees per species were dated by means of dendrometer measurements, monthly labelling by pinmarkers, and extracted cambium samples investigated using a microscope. The intraannual course of the growth and structural variation was compared with the water supply of the soil and insect attacks (Hypsipyla grandella (Zeller) Lep.).
   In Swietenia and Carapa parenchyma and vessel bands as well as bands of resin canals were observed. Within the xylem of Cedrela, alternating bands of fibres and vessels surrounded by paratracheal parenchyma were found; bands of resin canals were only occasional. In the juvenile wood of Swietenia and Carapa no synchronization of the increment curves was possible, whereas the increment curves obtained in the juvenile wood of Cedrela showed parallel run in growth. The increment curves obtained in adult wood of Swietenia and Cedrela indicate an annual formation of increment zones, whereas the number of increment zones in the xylem of Carapa was approximately 50% higher than the tree age (years) indicating that the growth increments of Carapa also were not annual during the adult phase of growth.

AB An increase in timber removals from southern bottomland forests of the United States has been predicted, warranting investigations of the effects of silvicultural alternatives on avian breeding habitat. We;studied the effects of creating group-selection openings (man-made canopy gaps) of various sizes on breeding bird habitat use in a bottomland hardwood forest in the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina, USA. We used spot mapping and mist netting to estimate bird abundance at 0.06-, 0.13-. 0.26-, and 0.5-ha gap's and at uncut control areas during the 1996, 1997, and 1998 breeding seasons (I May-1 August). There were significant increases in the number of species mapped (P = 0.0001) and netted (P = 0.0001) with successive increases in gap size. The greatest number of total spot-map detections (P = 0.0002) and mist net captures (P = 0.0004) also occurred in and around the large gaps. These patterns were the result of increased use of larger gaps by field-edge species, primarily Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), Common Yellow-throat (Geothlypis trichas), and Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), and some forest-edge species, such as White-eyed Vireo (Vireo griseus) and Northern Parula (Parula americana). Conversely, Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) Was less abundant in and adjacent to gaps. Because there were few differences in vegetation among gaps of different sizes, it is likely that birds that were detected more frequently in and adjacent to larger gaps selected those gaps based on other factors correlated with size. Creation of 0.5-ha group-selection openings in southern bottomland forests should provide breeding habitat for some field-edge species in gaps and habitat for forest-interior species and canopy-dwelling forest-edge species between gaps. provided that sufficient mature forest is maintained.

AB We compared soil nutrient availability and soil physical properties among four treatments (high-intensity fire, low-intensity fire, plant removal, and harvesting gap) and a control (intact forest understory) over a period of 18 months in a tropical dry forest in Bolivia. The effect of treatments on plant growth was tested using a shade intolerant tree species ( Anadenanthera colubrina Vell. Conc.) as a bioassay. Surface soils in high-intensity fire treatments had significantly greater pH values, concentrations of extractable calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and phosphorus (P), and amounts of resin-available P and nitrogen (N) than other treatments; however, a loss of soil organic matter during high-intensity fires likely resulted in increased bulk density and strength, and decreased water infiltration rates. Low intensity fires also significantly increased soil pH, concentrations of extractable Ca, K, Mg, and P, and amounts of resin-available P and N, although to a lesser degree than high-intensity fires. Low-intensity fires did not lower soil organic matter contents or alter soil physical properties. Plant removal and harvesting gap treatments had little effect on soil chemical and physical properties. Despite the potentially negative effects of degraded soil structure on plant growth, growth of A. colubrina seedlings were greater following high-intensity fires. Evidently, the increase in nutrient availability caused by high-intensity fires was not offset by degraded soil structure in its effects on seedling growth. Long-term effects of high intensity fires require further research.

AB 1. Several decades of frustrated attempts to prevent fires in the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) have led to deleterious ecological and management consequences. In 2014, the first Integrated Fire Management (IFM) programme was launched in three protected areas (PAs).
   2. The IFM programme considers local practices, ecological information, management options and aims to create landscape mosaics of different fire histories to conserve biodiversity, reduce the prevalence of late-dry season (LDS) wildfires, protect fire-sensitive vegetation and reduce conflicts between PA managers and local communities.
   3. The first 3years of imposed fire management regimes led to 40%-57% reduction in LDS fires, improved dialogue between researchers, managers and local communities, generating fire management learning communities.

AB The Janzen-Connell (JC) hypothesis provides a conceptual framework for explaining the maintenance of tree diversity in tropical forests. Its central tenet-that recruits experience high mortality near conspecifics and at high densities-assumes a degree of host specialization in interactions between plants and natural enemies. Studies confirming JC effects have focused primarily on spatial distributions of seedlings and saplings, leaving major knowledge gaps regarding the fate of seeds in soil and the specificity of the soilborne fungi that are their most important antagonists. Here we use a common garden experiment in a lowland tropical forest in Panama to show that communities of seed-infecting fungi are structured predominantly by plant species, with only minor influences of factors such as local soil type, forest characteristics, or time in soil (1-12 months). Inoculation experiments confirmed that fungi affected seed viability and germination in a host-specific manner and that effects on seed viability preceded seedling emergence. Seeds are critical components of reproduction for tropical trees, and the factors influencing their persistence, survival, and germination shape the populations of seedlings and saplings on which current perspectives regarding forest dynamics are based. Together these findings bring seed dynamics to light in the context of the JC hypothesis, implicating them directly in the processes that have emerged as critical for diversity maintenance in species-rich tropical forests.

AB The Amazon basin is the largest and most species-rich tropical forest and river system in the world, playing a pivotal role in global climate regulation and harboring hundreds of traditional and indigenous cultures. It is a matter of intense debate whether the ecosystem is threatened by hunting practices, whereby an "empty forest" loses critical ecological functions. Strikingly, no previous study has examined Amazonian ecosystem resilience through the perspective of the massive 20th century international trade in furs and skins. We present the first historical account of the scale and impacts of this trade and show that whereas aquatic species suffered basin-wide population collapse, terrestrial species did not. We link this differential resilience to the persistence of adequate spatial refuges for terrestrial species, enabling populations to be sustained through source-sink dynamics, contrasting with unremitting hunting pressure on more accessible aquatic habitats. Our findings attest the high vulnerability of aquatic fauna to unregulated hunting, particularly during years of severe drought. We propose that the relative resilience of terrestrial species suggests a marked opportunity for managing, rather than criminalizing, contemporary traditional subsistence hunting in Amazonia, through both the engagement of local people in community-based comanagement programs and science-led conservation governance.

AB Avian insectivores of the tropical rainforest understory ("understory insectivores") are common, diverse, and often sensitive to disturbance of tropical forest, making them useful as sentinels of rainforest ecosystem change. At the 2013 joint American Ornithologists' Union and Cooper Ornithological Society meeting in Chicago, USA, researchers convened a symposium to address the ecology and conservation of understory insectivores. This Special Issue of Biological Conservation is the result of that symposium: a collection of articles that unites our efforts to further understand and conserve understory insectivores. In this introductory paper, we review the diversity and ecology of understory insectivores, identify threats to the guild, discuss hypotheses on drivers of population declines, and make suggestions for future research. Deforestation and forest degradation are the immediate threats to this guild, with agricultural expansion (particularly oil palm plantations), urbanization, road expansion and logging leading the list. Although vulnerabilities of this guild are most evident in the Neotropics, there are few studies from Asia and fewer still from Africa we recommend increased geographic coverage. If we are to understand the vulnerabilities of understory insectivores from a pantropical perspective, researchers should prioritize understanding the most serious threats (e.g., edge effects, deforestation, fragmentation, etc.) and standardize efforts to gauge understory insectivores' response to these threats (e.g., via species richness, abundance, demographic metrics). A coordinated approach by researchers working in tropical rainforests across the globe can help us understand the ecology of understory insectivores and meaningfully apply conservation and management actions.

AB Phylogenetic community ecology combines phylogenetic hypotheses with local species composition and functional-trait information to evaluate historical and contemporary mechanisms influencing local assemblage structure. Most studies assume that, if functional traits are conserved, then patterns of trait variation should match patterns of phylogenetic structure within local assemblages. Here we evaluated if we could predict trait structure by assuming that environmental filtering or biotic interactions work primarily on phylogenetically conserved functional traits. We investigated patterns of phylogenetic assemblage structure and functional-trait variation in bill length, wing length, and body mass in 236 hummingbird assemblages (126 species) across two major gradients in northern South America: elevation and precipitation. While mean trait values for assemblages vary predictably based on empirical knowledge of hummingbird biology, the distribution of trait values within assemblages do not correspond to those predicted based on phylogenetic signal and phylogenetic structure. Instead, we were able to identify instances where assemblages have high levels of morphological variation despite their close evolutionary relatedness and vice versa. Our results provide support for both filtering and biotic interactions across gradients, as has been documented in other studies.

AB Over the past few decades, tropical timber production in many Asia-Pacific countries has been akin to the symmetric logistic distribution curve, or 'Hubbert Curve', observed in the exploitation of many non-renewable resources a rapid increase in production followed by a peak and then decline. There are three principal reasons why logging of native tropical forests resembles the mining of a non-renewable resource: the standard cutting cycle of 30-40 years is too brief to allow the wood volume to regenerate; tropical logging catalyses considerable deforestation; and the bulk of logging is undertaken by multinational corporations with little interest in long-term local sustainability. Unless something fundamental changes, we believe tropical forests will continue to be overharvested and cleared apace, leading to an inevitable global decline in tropical timbers of non-plantation origin. It has become common these days to speak of 'peak oil'. In the tropics, we suggest that we should also begin to discuss the implications of 'peak timber'. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increased predation pressure along habitat edges is often associated with increased predator activity However factors affecting predator affinity for habitat edges remain largely untested Here we tested the hypothesis that the high prevalence of mammalian predators along habitat edges arises due to increased abundance of their principal prey - small mammals Gradients in the abundance of carnivores and small mammals across a habitat edge gradient (secondary mixed forest interior vs secondary mixed forest interior/grassland edge vs grassland interior) were monitored during a 2-year survey performed in a fragmented central European landscape Our data provide support for the hypothesis that a high abundance of carnivores in habitat edges was associated with increased numbers of small mammals The abundance of mammalian predators and small mammals consistently increased in habitat edges Moreover prey densities tended to explain carnivore patch preferences even when statistically controlling for the effect of habitat type (edge vs interior habitats) suggesting a direct causality between carnivore habitat preferences and actual prey density Interestingly the small mustelids (least weasel Mustela malls and ermine stoat Mustafa erminea) exhibited lower flexibility in adjustment of their spatial activity according to prey densities in contrast to remaining carnivores We suppose that this pattern may be caused by differences in agility/home range size or performance intraguild competition between small mustelids and remaining carnivore species Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB Forest fragmentation is a common disturbance affecting biological diversity, yet the impacts of fragmentation on many forest processes remain poorly understood. Forest restoration is likely to be more successful when it proceeds with an understanding of how native and exotic vertebrates utilize forest patches of different size. We used a system of forest fragments isolated by volcanic activity 153 years ago in Hawaii to examine how long-term fragmentation, as well as fragment size and structural features affect the richness of native and exotic bird species. The total number of bird species increased rapidly with forest fragment size, with most of the native species pool found in patches <3 ha. Smaller fragments were dominated by native bird species with several exotic bird species found only in the largest fragments, suggesting that exotic bird species in this landscape show greater area-sensitivity than native species. We used airborne scanning light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to assess whether fragment area was correlated with estimates of fragment vegetation volume as well as measures of tree height. Fragment area was highly correlated with vegetation volume, maximum tree height, and canopy height heterogeneity, and these variables were strong predictors of bird richness, demonstrating that remote sensing can provide key insights into the relationship between fragment structural attributes and biodiversity indicators. Overall, this work demonstrates the value of conserving small remnant mid-elevation forest patches for native birds in Hawaii. This work also provides insight into how newly created forest patches might be used by native and exotic bird species in Hawaii. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ants play a central role in understanding the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on communities and ecosystems because of their diversity, abundance, and functional roles in ecosystems. Species interactions involving ants are widespread and include other insects, plants, and vertebrates. Ants often do not show strong relationships between species richness and habitat area, but shifts in ant species composition are a more general pattern with an average 75% turnover in species composition among habitat fragments. Shifts in ant species composition and relative abundance due to habitat fragmentation have direct and indirect effects on species interactions of ants, including sap-feeding insects, seed dispersal. and vertebrate mutualisms. The loss of some ant species from small habitat fragments may have widespread effects in ecosystems because of their function roles as keystone mutualists or in soil modification. Boundary dynamics of ants across habitat edges and the surrounding land uses are particularly important to understanding the effects of habitat fragmentation because steep abiotic and biotic gradients may facilitate invasive ant species and cause sharp changes in the abundance and species interactions of native ant species.

AB Ecologically unequal exchange theory posits that the vertical flow of exports is a structural mechanism allowing for more-developed countries to partially externalize their consumption-based environmental impacts to lesser-developed countries. It is argued that these structural relationships contribute to environmental degradation in the latter while directly suppressing resource consumption opportunities for domestic populations, often well below globally sustainable thresholds. To assess the validity of the propositions, the authors conduct fixed effects and random effects panel regression analyses of the effects of the vertical flow of primary sector exports on deforestation and a refined per capita footprint measure for two samples of less-developed countries, 1970-2000. Results support the stated arguments of ecologically unequal exchange theory and point to the need for more rigorous comparative analyses to increase our collective understanding of the environmental and human well-being consequences of such relationships for less-developed countries.

AB We studied the diversity of dung beetles in three different habitats in the Lacandona Forest, Chiapas, Mexico. We found a total of 49 species. Of these, 44 were in well-preserved forests (SC) within the limits of the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, 42 in fragmented forests (SF), and 13 in cattle pastures (PZ). These two latter habitats were part of a fragmented landscape. Even though the species richness between the two forest habitats is similar, there is a change in guild composition and structure. About 12% of the species were exclusively found in SC, while 4.1% and 2% were exclusive of SF and PZ respectively. beta diversity was the most important element for overall diversity (gamma), above that of the local richness (alpha). Within well-preserved forests, species composition changes substantially, even among neighboring sites. Species diversity within the landscape seems to depend on canopy coverage, soil temperature and geographic distance between sites. Functional groups vary with the habitat. Large-bodied, nocturnal species with specific requirements of soil temperature and compaction are more sensitive to anthropogenic changes. In cattle pastures there is a larger number of heliophilic species, with a higher percentage of small-bodied and roller beetles.

AB Seedlings of several species of gymnosperm trees, angiosperm trees, and angiosperm lianas were grown under tropical field conditions in the Republic of Panama; physiological processes controlling plant C and water fluxes were assessed across this functionally diverse range of species. Relative growth rate, r, was primarily controlled by the ratio of leaf area to plant mass, of which specific leaf area was a key component. Instantaneous photosynthesis, when expressed on a leaf-mass basis, explained 69% of variation in r (P < 0.0001, n = 94). Mean r of angiosperms was significantly higher than that of the gymnosperms; within angiosperms, mean r of lianas was higher than that of trees. Whole-plant nitrogen use efficiency was also significantly higher in angiosperm than in gymnosperm species, and was primarily controlled by the rate of photosynthesis for a given amount of leaf nitrogen. Whole-plant water use efficiency, TEc, varied significantly among species, and was primarily controlled by c(i)/c(a), the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 partial pressures during photosynthesis. Instantaneous measurements of c(i)/c(a) explained 51% of variation in TEc (P < 0.0001, n = 94). Whole-plant C-13 discrimination also varied significantly as a function of c(i)/c(a) (R-2 = 0.57, P < 0.0001, n = 94), and was, accordingly, a good predictor of TEc. The O-18 enrichment of stem dry matter was primarily controlled by the predicted O-18 enrichment of evaporative sites within leaves (R-2 = 0.61, P < 0.0001, n = 94), with some residual variation explained by mean transpiration rate. Measurements of carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios could provide a useful means of parameterizing physiological models of tropical forest trees.

AB Small-scale, local disturbance of tropical forests, for example from selective logging, is widespread, but its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem function have rarely been studied. In 3 East African tropical rainforests, we investigated the effect of different levels of local forest disturbance on the firugivore community and on tree visitation and fruit removal rates of the small-seeded tree Celtis durandii. We quantified birds and primates in little and heavily disturbed sites, distinguishing between forest specialists, forest generalists, and forest visitors. We quantified frugivorous tree visitors and seed removal rates of C. durandii trees in the same sites. Forest disturbance reduced the species richness and density of the firugivore community and of forest specialists. Frugivorous species and individuals visiting the study trees were reduced significantly, which led to a marginally significant decline in fruit removal by all frugivores and a significant reduction in removal by forest specialists. Reduction in fruit removal by forest specialists was not compensated for by increases in removal by forest generalists or visitors. Results did not differ among the 3 rainforests, which suggests they were consistent at a regional scale. So local forest disturbance led to a loss of firugivores and their seed removal services. This suggests that large-seeded tree species and trees with small firuits are losing seed dispersers. Thus, local forest disturbance appears to have a more general negative impact on firugivores and their seed dispersal services than anticipated previously.

AB The extent to which secondary forests occupying degraded and abandoned lands provide suitable habitat for forest-adapted species is an important conservation issue in times of vanishing old growth forests. We used ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), a functionally important and diverse group of invertebrates, to investigate the recovery of soil taxa during secondary forest succession in the Atlantic Forest of Southern Brazil. We compared the resilience of epigeic vs. hypogeic ant assemblages. For this purpose we established 27 sites that encompassed a chronosequence from pastures to old growth forests on two contrasting soil types. Our results are based on a collection of 35508 individuals in 40 genera.
   Richness and composition of ant assemblages in secondary forests have recovered slowly and have not approached conditions typical of old growth forests. The distribution of genera along the successional stages was arranged in a nested pattern where ant genera of younger successional stages were a subset of genera present in older stages. Edaphic conditions had no influence on the recovery process. Overall, richness of ants was lower at study sites with water-logged soils than at sites where soils did not exhibit hydromorphic properties. The hypogeic ant assemblage recovered more slowly than the epigeic assemblage.
   Our results show that secondary forests do not act as refuges for many forest-adapted animals which are currently restricted to discontinuous patches of old growth forest in the highly endangered Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Moreover, estimated recovery times of 50 to several hundred years suggest it would take much longer than previously presumed for complete recolonization. (c) Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The process of seed dispersal has a profound effect on vegetation structure and diversity in tropical forests. However, our understanding of the process and our ability to predict its outcomes at a community scale are limited by the frequently large number of interactions associated with it. Here, we outline an approach to dealing with this complexity that reduces the number of unique interactions considered by classifying the participants according to their functional similarity. We derived a classification of dispersers based on the nature of the dispersal service they provide to plants. We described the quantities of fruit handled, the quality of handling and the diversity of plants to which the service is provided. We used ten broad disperser traits to group 26 detailed measures for each disperser. We then applied this approach to vertebrate dispersers in Australia's tropical forests. Using this we also develop a classification that may be more generally applicable. For each disperser, data relating to each trait was obtained either from the field or published literature. First, we identified dispersers whose service outcomes were so distinct that statistical analysis was not required and assigned them to functional groups. The remaining dispersers were assigned to functional groups using cluster analysis. The combined processes created 15 functional groups from 65 vertebrate dispersers in Australian tropical forests. Our approach-grouping dispersers on the basis of the type of dispersal service provided and the fruit types it is provided to-represents a means of reducing the complexity encountered in tropical seed dispersal systems and could be effectively applied in community level studies. It also represents a useful tool for exploring changes in dispersal services when the distribution and abundance of animal populations change due to human impacts.

AB Aim Despite the pervasive and well-documented effects of global warming on species' ranges in terrestrial taxa and systems, the effect of sea surface warming has been poorly studied in marine systems. Here we analyse changes in the southern endpoints of distribution of rocky intertidal species (gastropods and chitons) along the Chilean coast, and trends in sea surface temperature (SST), using data collected during the last half-century.
   Location South-eastern Pacific coast, between 18degrees20' S and 42degrees35' S.
   Methods Past southern endpoints of distribution were obtained for 10 intertidal species from museum collections and literature reviews. Current endpoints are based on field sampling conducted between 1998 and 2000. Changes in the position of southern endpoints were analysed individually for each species, as well as for the entire assemblage of species included in the analysis. SST records encompassing 51-57 years were obtained from five coastal stations located between 18degrees and 36degrees S.
   Results and main conclusions Most species (eight of 10) did not show expansion of their southern endpoint. The proportion of species expanding, contracting or maintaining their southern limit did not differ from chance expectation. On average, species showed small (1degrees latitude), non-significant contractions, with low rates of decadal change (0.18degrees latitude per 10 years). This pattern can be explained by changes in SST, which showed a weak warming trend (and at some sites even cooling) along the Chilean coast during the last 57 years. Our results show that different regional warming trends occur, and suggest that generalizations about poleward shifts in species ranges cannot be made. However, our results support the hypothesis that temperature is a major determinant of species range dynamics.

AB Coastal habitats have recently received much attention from policymakers, but marine reserve theory still needs to integrate across scales, from local dynamics of communities to biogeographic patterns of species distribution, recognizing coastal ecosystems as complex adaptive systems in which local processes and anthropogenic disturbances can result in large-scale biological changes. We present a theoretical framework that provides anew perspective on the science underlying the design of marine reserve networks. Coastal marine systems may be usefully considered as metacommunities in which propagules are exchanged among components, and in which the persistence of one species depends on that of others. Our results suggest that the large-scale distribution of marine species can be dynamic and can result from local ecological processes. We discuss the potential implications of these findings for marine reserve design and the need for long-term monitoring programs to validate predictions from metacommunity models. Only through an integrated and dynamic global perspective can scientists and managers achieve the underlying goals of marine conservation.

AB Ecotones have been considered as unique environments, and the concepts of edge effect and ecotonal species have been widely used, especially in avian community ecology. We studied the patterns of bird densities across heath-wood edges at replicated sites in three locations in southeastern Australia. Multivariate analysis showed that the bird community in the ecotone was intermediate between the heath and wood communities, indicating that the ecotone contained a mixing of species rather than a unique bird community. ANOVA showed a modest increase in bird density at the wood side of the ecotone, which may be partly due to sampling biases rather than to some inherent habitat value in the ecotone. The outstanding pattern was that bird density and species richness in the wood habitat were twice as high as in the heath habitat. Of a total of 86 species, 31 occurred in sufficient numbers to categorize according to their habitat association (generalist, or heath or wood specialist) and their density at the ecotone (ecotone neutral, ecotone shy, or ecotone conspicuous). Three of these were habitat-generalist-ecotone-neutral. Fourteen species were ecotone neutral but were habitat specialists on either the wood (13 spp.) or the heath (1 sp.). Three species were ecotone shy. Although 11 species were ecotone conspicuous, they also occurred in either heath or wood or both. Thus, no species could be categorized as entirely ecotonal. We conclude that there is little evidence from this or other studies of avian communities to support an edge effect of increased density and species richness, and no evidence,of entirely ecotonal species.

AB Little is known about how climatic variability affects fragmented forests and their abrupt edges. We contrasted effects of the 1997 El Nino drought between fragmented and continuous forests in central Amazonia, using long-term data on tree mortality. For 23 permanent 1-ha plots, annualized mortality rates of trees greater than or equal to 10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were compared among a 'baseline' interval of 5-17 N, before the drought, a 12-16-month inter-Val during the drought, and a 12-13-month interval after the drought, using repeated-measures ANOVA. We also examined the size distributions of dead trees for each interval. During the drought, average annual tree mortality rose significantly in both forest edges (from 2.44% to 2.93%) and interiors (from 1.13% to 1.91%), and the magnitude of this increase did not differ significantly between edges and interiors. After the drought, tree mortality declined in all plots, but most dramatically on edges. Mortality rates were more Variable over time on edges than interiors, and there was no evidence of time lags in mortality. In forest interiors, the size distributions of trees that died did not differ significantly among the three intervals. On edges, however, relatively fewer small (10-15 cm dbh) and more medium-sized (20-30 cm dbh) trees died in the post-drought interval, compared to other intervals. Moreover, forest edges lost a significantly higher proportion of large (greater than or equal to 60 cm dbh) trees than did forest interiors. These results suggest that droughts have relatively complex effects on fragmented Amazonian forests. Drought effects in our forest fragments probably were reduced by prior floristic and structural changes near edges and by adjoining regrowth forest that partially buffered edge vegetation from desiccating conditions.

AB Soil Science integrates specific contributions from physics, chemistry, biology, and the human sciences. During the last 2 decades, these approaches, which had primarily developed separately and at different speeds, have been progressively integrated. Ecology has contributed a significant number of integrative concepts and questions, some, such as nutrient cycling and energy budgets, that are rather old, and others, such as soil engineering by macroinvertebrates, the relationship between biodiversity and soil function, and the impact of landscape fractionation, that are more recent.
   An important issue common to all disciplines in Soil Science is that of scales. Ecological studies have shown that similar activities, e.g., the building of solid structures by invertebrates for their sheltering or gut transit of soil for digestion, may affect soil function at different scales, affecting the rates of processes in sometimes opposite directions. The concept of functional domains in soil, derived from soil ecological research, defines a scale at which physical, chemical, and biological processes can be studied efficiently in a true multidisciplinary approach. Functional domains are specific sites in soils defined by a main organic resource (leaf litter or soil organic matter), a major regulator, biotic (i.e., an invertebrate 'engineer' or roots) or abiotic (like freezing/thawing or drying/rewetting alternates), a set of structures created by the regulator (for example, fecal pellets, galleries, or cracks), and a community of dependent invertebrates of smaller size and microorganisms that live in these structures. Functional domains may be physically identified in soils and specifically studied using the different disciplinary approaches. Specific micromorphologic, isotopic, and other techniques allow us to address issues at this scale adequately. Ecological research also provides a theoretical background for management of soils at the larger integrative scales of landscape and regions.
   Essential issues for the near future should use this interdisciplinary approach. Sustainability of cropping systems and maintenance of soil ecosystem services depend more on an integrated approach than do the extreme developments in single disciplines in isolation that originated the series of problems we now face: large scale soil erosion, nutrient transfers to neighboring ecosystems, threats of genetically modified organisms, or biodiversity accidents.

AB Population ecology and foraging theory can be combined to simulate the population dynamics of hunter-gatherers and their prey resources. Such simulation study is important to issues of conservation because many of the population processes that link human foragers and their prey occur over time scales that elude both ethnographic and archaeological fieldwork. To demonstrate, we used the model to examine hunter-gatherer population dynamics. We focused on a prey characteristic that affects its susceptibility to over-exploitation: the intrinsic rate of increase, r. We found that forager-prey systems can stabilize without intentional conservation behavior and that prey ''switching,'' fall-back foods, and in certain circumstances, a higher r contribute to resource species persistence. Furthermore, a prey's vulnerability to local depletion or extinction may depend on the demographic characteristics of the suite of resources harvested along with it. The model can serve as a ''null hypothesis'' for examining intentional resource conservation and presents points in concordance with, as well as divergent from tenets in conservation biology. In particular, we discuss the implications of these findings for indigenous resource conservation in Amazonia (e.g., the overhunting of large primates and avifauna and the adoption of new procurement technologies) as well as the ''Pleistocene Overkill Hypothesis.''

AB The functional trait approach has, as a central tenet, that plant traits are functional and shape individual performance, but this has rarely been tested in the field. Here, we tested the individual-based trait approach in a hyperdiverse Amazonian tropical rainforest and evaluated intraspecific variation in trait values, plant strategies at the individual level, and whether traits are functional and predict individual performance.
   We evaluated > 1300 tree saplings belonging to > 383 species, measured 25 traits related to growth and defense, and evaluated the effects of environmental conditions, plant size, and traits on stem growth.
   A total of 44% of the trait variation was observed within species, indicating a strong potential for acclimation. Individuals showed two strategy spectra, related to tissue toughness and organ size vs leaf display. In this nutrient- and light-limited forest, traits measured at the individual level were surprisingly poor predictors of individual growth performance because of convergence of traits and growth rates.
   Functional trait approaches based on individuals or species are conceptually fundamentally different: the species-based approach focuses on the potential and the individual-based approach on the realized traits and growth rates. Counterintuitively, the individual approach leads to a poor prediction of individual performance, although it provides a more realistic view on community dynamics.

AB Streams and adjacent terrestrial ecosystems are characterized by permeable boundaries that are crossed by resource subsidies. Although the importance of these subsidies for riverine ecosystems is increasingly recognized, little is known about how they may be influenced by global environmental change. Drawing from available evidence, in this review we propose a conceptual framework to evaluate the effects of global change on the quality and spatiotemporal dynamics of stream-terrestrial subsidies. We illustrate how changes to hydrological and temperature regimes, atmospheric CO2 concentration, land use and the distribution of nonindigenous species can influence subsidy fluxes by affecting the biology and ecology of donor and recipient systems and the physical characteristics of stream-riparian boundaries. Climate-driven changes in the physiology and phenology of organisms with complex life cycles will influence their development time, body size and emergence patterns, with consequences for adjacent terrestrial consumers. Also, novel species interactions can modify subsidy dynamics via complex bottom-up and top-down effects. Given the seasonality and pulsed nature of subsidies, alterations of the temporal and spatial synchrony of resource availability to consumers across ecosystems are likely to result in ecological mismatches that can scale up from individual responses, to communities, to ecosystems. Similarly, altered hydrology, temperature, CO2 concentration and land use will modify the recruitment and quality of riparian vegetation, the timing of leaf abscission and the establishment of invasive riparian species. Along with morphological changes to stream-terrestrial boundaries, these will alter the use and fluxes of allochthonous subsidies associated with stream ecosystems. Future research should aim to understand how subsidy dynamics will be affected by key drivers of global change, including agricultural intensification, increasing water use and biotic homogenization. Our conceptual framework based on the match-mismatch between donor and recipient organisms may facilitate understanding of the multiple effects of global change and aid in the development of future research questions.

AB Strong differences have been observed between the assemblages on artificial reefs and on natural hard-bottom habitats worldwide, but little is known about the mechanisms that cause contrasting biodiversity patterns. We examined the influence of spatial attributes in relation to both biogenic and topographic microhabitats, in the distribution and composition of intertidal species on both artificial and natural reefs. We found higher small-scale spatial heterogeneity on the natural reef compared with the study breakwater. Species richness and diversity were associated with a higher availability of crevices, rock pools and mussels in natural habitats. Spatial distribution of certain grazers corresponded well with the spatial structure of microhabitats. In contrast, the lack of microhabitats on the breakwater resulted in the absence of several grazers reflected in lower species richness. Biogenic and topographic microhabitats can have interactive effects providing niche opportunities for multiple species, explaining differences in species diversity between artificial versus natural reefs.

AB We model Central American migrant-sending household agricultural practices given labor losses and the concomitant infusion of remittances. Under the new economics of labor migration (NELM) framework, it is hypothesized that smallholder farm households invest remittance income in their land either to increase crop production or to transition to cattle ranching. We test this hypothesis by developing a combination of multivariate logistic, Poisson and beta regression techniques using Latin American Migration Project data to determine how agricultural land use change compared among migrant and non-migrant households in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Results indicate that a rise in months spent abroad and remittances returned do not translate into a higher percentage of farm sales, intensification or transition to cattle ranching - counter to NELM. However, farmers are investing remittances to increase row crop and pasture land holdings. These findings suggest remittance investments in quantitative increase rather than qualitative change in land use practices. Given the expansive land demands supporting low intensity smallholder agriculture and cattle, and the land degradation cattle precipitate particularly, the trend does not augur well for the sustainability of rural landscapes increasingly transformed by international remittances. Appropriate policies to champion coupled human-land system sustainability in Central America might usefully consider viable land use alternatives to remittance investments dedicated to crop and pasture expansion.

AB Neutral and niche theories give contrasting explanations for the maintenance of tropical tree species diversity. Both have some empirical support, but methods to disentangle their effects have not yet been developed. We applied a statistical measure of spatial structure to data from 14 large tropical forest plots to test a prediction of niche theory that is incompatible with neutral theory: that species in heterogeneous environments should separate out in space according to their niche preferences. We chose plots across a range of topographic heterogeneity, and tested whether pairwise spatial associations among species were more variable in more heterogeneous sites. We found strong support for this prediction, based on a strong positive relationship between variance in the spatial structure of species pairs and topographic heterogeneity across sites. We interpret this pattern as evidence of pervasive niche differentiation, which increases in importance with increasing environmental heterogeneity.

AB Functional traits, their plasticity and their integration in a phenotype have profound impacts on plant performance. We developed structural equation models (SEMs) to evaluate their relative contribution to promote invasiveness in plants along resource gradients. We compared 20 invasivenative phylogenetically and ecologically related pairs. SEMs included one morphological (root-to-shoot ratio (R/S)) and one physiological (photosynthesis nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE)) trait, their plasticities in response to nutrient and light variation, and phenotypic integration among 31 traits. Additionally, these components were related to two fitness estimators, biomass and survival. The relative contributions of traits, plasticity and integration were similar in invasive and native species. Trait means were more important than plasticity and integration for fitness. Invasive species showed higher fitness than natives because: they had lower R/S and higher PNUE values across gradients; their higher PNUE plasticity positively influenced biomass and thus survival; and they offset more the cases where plasticity and integration had a negative direct effect on fitness. Our results suggest that invasiveness is promoted by higher values in the fitness hierarchy -- trait means are more important than trait plasticity, and plasticity is similar to integration -- rather than by a specific combination of the three components of the functional strategy.

AB Mutualistic networks are crucial to the maintenance of ecosystem services. Unfortunately, what we know about seed dispersal networks is based only on bird-fruit interactions. Therefore, we aimed at filling part of this gap by investigating bat-fruit networks. It is known from population studies that: (i) some bat species depend more on fruits than others, and (ii) that some specialized frugivorous bats prefer particular plant genera. We tested whether those preferences affected the structure and robustness of the whole network and the functional roles of species. Nine bat-fruit datasets from the literature were analyzed and all networks showed lower complementary specialization (H-2' = 0.3760.10, mean 6 SD) and similar nestedness (NODF = 0.5660.12) than pollination networks. All networks were modular (M=0.32 +/- 0.07), and had on average four cohesive subgroups (modules) of tightly connected bats and plants. The composition of those modules followed the genus-genus associations observed at population level (Artibeus-Ficus, Carollia-Piper, and Sturnira-Solanum), although a few of those plant genera were dispersed also by other bats. Bat-fruit networks showed high robustness to simulated cumulative removals of both bats (R = 0.55 +/- 0.10) and plants (R = 0.68 +/- 0.09). Primary frugivores interacted with a larger proportion of the plants available and also occupied more central positions; furthermore, their extinction caused larger changes in network structure. We conclude that bat-fruit networks are highly cohesive and robust mutualistic systems, in which redundancy is high within modules, although modules are complementary to each other. Dietary specialization seems to be an important structuring factor that affects the topology, the guild structure and functional roles in bat-fruit networks.

AB P>1. Modelling growth strategies among tropical trees is an important objective in predicting the response of tree dynamics to selective logging and in gaining insights into the ecological processes that structure tree communities in managed tropical forests.
   2. We developed a disturbance index to model the effects of distance to and area of logging gaps on stem radial growth rates. This index was tested using census data of 43 neotropical tree species, representing a variety of life-history strategies and developmental stages, from a selectively logged forest at Paracou, French Guiana. Growth strategies were analyzed in light of two indicators: the inherent species growth rate (when disturbance index is null) and the species reaction (change in growth rate) to logging gaps.
   3. Across species, the predicted inherent growth rates in unlogged forest ranged from 0 center dot 25 to 6 center dot 47 mm year-1, with an average growth of 2 center dot 29 mm year-1. Ontogenetic shifts in inherent growth rate were found in 26 of the 43 species.
   4. Species growth response to logging gaps varied widely among species but was significantly positive for 27 species. The effect of ontogeny on growth response to logging was retained for 14 species, and species with inherent fast growth rate (5 mm year-1) responded less to logging gap disturbances than did species with slow inherent growth (1 mm year-1).
   5. Functional traits explained 19-42% of the variation in the inherent growth rate and in species' response across all developmental stages. Whereas maximum diameters and seed mass were strong predictors of inherent growth rate, maximum height, wood density, mode of germination and stem architecture were additionally involved in tree growth response.
   6. Synthesis and applications: This study provides a necessary framework for developing predictive post-logging growth models for the thousands of species comprising tropical forests and is sufficiently general to apply to a broad range of managed tropical forests.

AB The goal of this article is to understand strategies by which both the environmental and poverty alleviation objectives of PES programs can be achieved cost effectively. To meet this goal, we first create a conceptual framework to understand the implications of alternative targeting when policy makers have both environmental and poverty alleviation goals. We then use the Grain for Green program in China, the largest PES program in the developing world, as a case study. We also use a data set from a survey that we designed and implemented to evaluate the program. Using the data set we first evaluate what factors determined selection of program areas for the Grain for Green program. We then demonstrate the heterogeneity of parcels and households and examine the correlations across households and their parcels in terms of their potential environmental benefits, opportunity costs of participating, and the asset levels of households as an indicator of poverty. Finally, we compare five alternative targeting criteria and simulate their performance in terms of cost effectiveness in meeting both the environmental and poverty alleviation goals when given a fixed budget. Based on our simulations, we find that there is a substantial gain in the cost effectiveness of the program by targeting parcels based on the "gold standard," i.e., targeting parcels with low opportunity cost and high environmental benefit managed by poorer households.

AB Species have evolved biological rhythms in behaviour and physiology with a 24 h periodicity in order to increase their fitness anticipating the onset of unfavourable habitat conditions In marine organisms inhabiting deep water continental margins (i e the submerged outer edges of continents) day night activity rhythms are often referred to in three ways vertical water column migrations (i e pelagic) horizontal displacements within benthic boundary layer of the continental margin along bathymetric gradients (i e nektobenthic) and endobenthic movements (i e rhythmic emergence from the substrate) Many studies have been conducted on crustacean decapods that migrate vertically in the water column but much less information is available for other endobenthic and nektobenthic species Also the types of displacement and major life habits of most marine species are still largely unknown especially in deep water continental margins where steep clines in habitat factors (i e light intensity and its spectral quality sediment characteristics and hydrography) take place This is the result of technical difficulties in performing temporally scheduled sampling and laboratory testing on living specimens According to this scenario there are several major issues that still need extensive research in deep water crustacean decapods First the regulation of their behaviour and physiology by a biological clock is almost unknown compared to data for coastal species that are easily accessible to direct observation and sampling Second biological rhythms may change at different life stages (i e size related variations) or at different moments of the reproductive cycle (e g at egg bearing) based on different intra and interspecific interactions Third there is still a major lack of knowledge on the links that exist among the observed bathymetric distributions of species and selected autoecological traits that are controlled by their biological clock such as the diet rhythm of behaviour Species evolved in a photically variable environment where intra and inter specific interactions change along with the community structure over 24 h Accordingly the regulation of their biology through a biological clock may be the major evolutionary constraint that is responsible for their reported bathymetric distributions In this review our aim is to propose a series of innovative guidelines for a discussion of the modulation of behavioural rhythms of adult decapod crustaceans focusing on the deep waters of the continental margin areas of the Mediterranean as a paradigm for other marine zones of the world

AB Aim
   The size structure of a forest canopy is an important descriptor of the forest environment that may yield information on forest biomass and ecology. However, its variability at regional scales is poorly described or understood because of the still prohibitive cost of very high-resolution imagery as well as the lack of an appropriate methodology. We here employ a novel approach to describe and map the canopy structure of tropical forests.
   Location
   Amazonia.
   Methods
   We apply Fourier transform textural ordination (FOTO) techniques to subsamples of very high-resolution satellite imagery freely available through virtual globe software (e.g. Google Earth (R)) to determine two key structural variables: apparent mean crown size and heterogeneity in crown size. A similar approach is used with artificial forest canopy images generated by the light interaction model (discrete anisotropic radiative transfer, DART) using three-dimensional stand models. The effects of sun and viewing angles are explored on both model and real data.
   Results
   It is shown that in the case of canopies dominated by a modal size class our approach can predict mean canopy size to an accuracy of 5%. In Amazonia, we could evidence a clear macrostructure, despite considerable local variability. Apparent crown size indeed consistently increases from about 14 m in wet north-west Amazonia to more than 17 m for areas of intermediate dry season length (1-3 months) in south and east Amazonia, before decreasing again towards the ecotone with the Cerrado savanna biome. This general trend reflects the known variation of other forest physiognomic properties (height) reported for South America and Africa. Some regions show significantly greater canopy heterogeneity, a feature that may be related to substratum, perturbation rate and/or forest turnover rate.
   Main conclusions
   Our results demonstrate the feasibility and interest of large-scale assessment of rain forest canopy structure.

ID BIODIVERSITY; SCIENCE; FORESTS
AB There is an important analytical distinction for conservationists between the flow of ecosystem services and the stock of natural capital that underpins or constitutes them. The relationship between these two is often complex and indeterminate. Ecosystem services result from the interplay of different biological and physical processes across a variety of scales. Flows of ecosystem services may be imperfectly related to stocks of natural capital. Conservation is concerned with the protection of certain stocks of natural capital, but also with maintaining the complex web of relationships that characterize biodiversity. Despite the obvious links between ecosystem services, natural capital, and biodiversity, these are not identical. Practitioners and policy makers should be cautious in their use of the proxy indicator of ecosystem services when developing mechanisms for biodiversity conservation. Conceptual clarity is essential in order to harness the potentially important role that ecosystem service based interventions can play in mainstreaming conservation issues.

AB Matches between the bills of hummingbirds and the flowers they visit have been interpreted as examples of coadaptation and feeding specialization. Observations of birds feeding at flowers longer or shorter than their bills combined with a lack of experimental evidence for foraging trade-offs, however, fail to support these interpretations. We addressed these inconsistencies by considering a seldom-studied dimension of hummingbird-flower relationships, the shape of bills and flowers, through experiments on the Purple-throated Carib, Eulampis jugularis, and its major food plant, Heliconia, in the eastern Caribbean. Bills of male E. jugularis are considerably shorter and straighter than bills of females. We examined foraging performances and trade-offs during visits to natural heliconias and 34 artificial flowers of differing length and curvature. Supporting predictions based on matches between bill and flower morphology, handling times of females were significantly shorter than those of males at the long, curved flowers of a green morph of H. bihai. Contrary to predictions, handling times of males were not significantly shorter than handling times of females at the short flowers of H. caribaea. At artificial flowers, maximum extraction depths of females were significantly longer than maximum extraction depths of males at all curved flowers, but not at straight flowers. Handling times of females were significantly shorter than handling times of males at the longest artificial flowers for all curvatures, whereas handling times of males were significantly shorter at short, straight, artificial flowers, but only while hover-feeding without a perch. Within each sex, handling times were inversely related to bill length at long flowers for all shapes. Taken together, these performance trade-offs suggest that the long, curved bills of females are adapted for feeding from long, curved flowers, whereas the short bills of males are adapted for hover-feeding from short, straighter flowers. In addition, the finding that differences in feeding performance occur at the extremes of floral phenotypes suggests that the evolution of bill morphology may be driven by a small subset of the flowers visited by a hummingbird species.

AB Resource competition is thought to drive divergence in resource use traits (character displacement) by generating selection favoring individuals able to use resources unavailable to others. However, this picture assumes nutritionally substitutable resources (e.g., different prey species). When species compete for nutritionally essential resources (e.g., different nutrients), theory predicts that selection drives character convergence. We used models of two species competing for two essential resources to address several issues not considered by existing theory. The models incorporated either slow evolutionary change in resource use traits or fast physiological or behavioral change. We report four major results. First, competition always generates character convergence, but differences in resource requirements prevent competitors from evolving identical resource use traits. Second, character convergence promotes coexistence. Competing species always attain resource use traits that allow coexistence, and adaptive trait change stabilizes the ecological equilibrium. In contrast, adaptation in allopatry never preadapts species to coexist in sympatry. Third, feedbacks between ecological dynamics and trait dynamics lead to surprising dynamical trajectories such as transient divergence in resource use traits followed by subsequent convergence. Fourth, under sufficiently slow trait change, ecological dynamics often drive one of the competitors to near extinction, which would prevent realization of long-term character convergence in practice.

AB We compared epifaunal and epiphytic assemblages on the invasive alga, Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides, with those on native kelps, Laminaria longicruris and L. digitata, at a moderately exposed site on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia. Thalli of each algal host (Laminaria and/or Codium) were sampled in two stands with monospecific canopy cover and one mixed canopy stand (Laminaria and Codium) in June and November 2004 and February 2005. Epifaunal assemblages on both fronds and holdfasts differed between algal species and among months, but. no differences were detected between mixed and monospecific stands for each host type. Fronds of Laminaria supported greater densities of gastropods and asteroids, while amphipods, harpacticoid copepods, and a specialist herbivore (Placida dendritica) were more abundant on fronds of Codium. Holdfasts of Codium supported greater densities of nematodes and bivalves. Diversity of epifauna was greater. on fronds of Codium than Laminaria and similar on holdfasts of both species. Codium supported a greater density of epiphytes than Laminaria. Total frond area of Laminaria and/or Codium and density of epifauna per m(2) of substratum did not differ between stands. Our results suggest that habitat selection by epibionts is likely determined by specific chemical, structural and morphological characteristics of the algal species, rather than the amount of habitable area available for colonization.

AB Tidal migrations are inherent in the life histories of numerous demersal predators, and both the indirect and direct effects of these forays are important to the structure and function of littoral communities. In coastal estuaries of the Northeastern Pacific, Dungeness crabs Cancer magister are abundant and compose a significant portion of estuarine biomass. The nursery role of complex littoral habitats for young-of-the-year (0+) C. magister is well documented, yet the ecology of subsequent age classes within coastal estuarine systems, and within littoral areas in particular, remains unclear. The goal of our study was to elucidate habitat use and migratory patterns of subadult C. magister (40 to 130 mm carapace width; 1+ and > 1+ yr classes) in littoral eelgrass Zostera marina, oyster Crassostrea gigas, and unstructured littoral habitats (ULH). We employed 3 sampling techniques (trapping, acoustic telemetry, and underwater video) designed to examine various aspects of migratory behavior within Willapa Bay, Washington, a representative coastal estuary. Baited trap surveys revealed that relative catches of subadult C. magister are 30 to 50% higher on ULH than eelgrass or oyster beds, and are negatively correlated with catches of another large cancrid crab, C. productus. Ultrasonic telemetry observations suggest that subadult C. magister making nighttime foraging incursions prefer ULH to other littoral habitats, and underwater video observations show that migrations are influenced by tidal rhythms since movements are correlated with the direction and velocity of current flow in adjacent channels. Our results dramatically alter the perception of C. magister as a predominantly sublittoral predator, and underscore the significance of littoral habitats as important foraging areas.

AB Organisms respond to their surroundings at multiple spatial scales, and different organisms respond differently to the same environment. Existing landscape models, such as the "fragmentation model" (or patch-matrix-corridor model) and the "variegation model," can be limited in their ability to explain complex patterns for different species and across multiple scales. An alternative approach is to conceptualize landscapes as overlaid species-specific habitat contour maps. Key characteristics of this approach are that different species may respond differently to the same environmental conditions and at different spatial scales. Although similar approaches are being used in ecological modeling, there is much room for habitat contours as a useful conceptual tool. By providing an alternative view of landscapes, a contour model may stimulate more field investigations stratified on the basis of ecological variables other than human-defined patches and patch boundaries. A conceptual model of habitat contours may also help to communicate ecological complexity to land managers. Finally, by incorporating additional ecological complexity, a conceptual model based on habitat contours may help to bridge the perceived gap between pattern and process in landscape ecology. Habitat contours do not preclude the use of existing landscape models and should be seen as a complementary approach most suited to heterogeneous human-modified landscapes.

AB We examined the effect of seed ingestion by three ateline primates: woolly monkeys, Lagothrix lagothricha; spider monkeys, Ateles belzebuth; and, red howler, Alouatta seniculus on germination rates and latency periods of seeds of several plant species in Tinigua National Park, Colombia. We collected dispersed seeds from feces and control seeds from the parental trees and washed them for germination trials. For the majority of plants, dispersed seeds germinated as well or better than control seeds did. Although spider monkeys depend more heavily on fruits than the other monkey species do, they were not more efficient than howlers or woolly monkeys at improving germination rates. A considerable proportion of the seeds dispersed by howlers and woolly monkeys showed reduced latency periods to germination, but spider monkeys showed less effect on reducing germination time. This result may be related to longer gut retention times, but such a trend has not been observed in other primate species. We conclude that, like many other primates, ateline monkeys are effective seed dispersers in terms of their effects on the seeds they swallow because they rarely decrease their germination rates. We discuss problems that make interspecific comparisons difficult, such as inappropriate control seeds and differences associated with germination substrates, and we stress the importance of studying other components of seed dispersal effectiveness.

AB In relation to the drought-prone and nutrient-poor habitat, vascular epiphytes are routinely referred to as inherently slow-growing plants, although actual evidence is rare. To test this notion we measured in situ growth of the understorey orchid Aspasia principissa and the tank bromeliad Vriesea sanguinolenta, and, for the latter species, also the growth under favourable conditions in the greenhouse. Using growth analysis we show: (1) that in an intraspecific comparison, small to intermediate individuals yield the highest relative,growth rates (RGR) in situ A. principissa: 1.6 10(-3) d(-1); V. sanguinolenta: 3.3 10(-3) d(-1); (2) that the bromeliad reaches maximum size after ca. 15 yr, while the orchid needs at least 20 yr; and (3) small V. sanguinolenta plants exhibit a highly plastic growth response to favourable conditions in the greenhouse, reaching an almost 10-fold increase in RGR. In spite of a substantial increase in growth under more favourable conditions, our results are consistent with the notion that epiphytes are inherently slow growing organisms.

AB Habitat fragmentation is recognized as one of the main factors associated with species extinction and is particularly acute in South American forest habitats. In this study, we examined the effects of forest fragmentation on the beetle assemblage at the relict temperate forest of Fray Jorge (Chile). We evaluated the following hypotheses: (1) there is a strong edge effect, so that the number of beetle species and individuals increases away from the edge, towards the inner part of each fragment, (2) this pattern should be apparent in the larger fragments but not in the smaller ones, where edge effects are expected to be stronger, and (3) there should be a significant interaction between number of species/individuals found inside and outside fragments (i.e., in the matrix) and season, because of an increase in aridity and water stress during austral summer months. We found that the relationship between the number of individuals and number of species vs distance from the matrix towards the forest interior was affected by fragment size and season. In general, both number of species and individuals tended to increase from the matrix towards the forest edge and then either decrease, increase or maintain a constant level, depending on fragment size and season. The result of an ANOVA analysis, which used season, size, and position (inside vs outside fragments) as factors and number of individuals as the response variable, showed a significant effect of fragment size, position, and season and a significant interaction between fragment size and season, season and position, and size and position. ANOVA analysis using number of species as the response variable showed that area, season, and position all had significant effects. The results also showed a significant interaction between size and season and between season and position. Our results emphasize the existence of strong fragment-size and seasonal effects modulating both the response of beetles to fragmentation and their abundance and distribution in temperate areas. Thus, seasonal dynamic effects can be of paramount importance to demonstrate and understand the effect of habitat fragmentation upon arthropod assemblages in temperate areas.

AB 1. The Cerrado Domain of central Brazil houses the largest extent of savanna in the Neotropics, but despite its simple characterization as a giant savanna, it contains considerable vegetation heterogeneity that is poorly understood.
   2. We aimed to determine how vegetation types in the Cerrado diverge in their tree species composition and what role ecological factors play in driving compositional patterns.
   3. We used a dataset of 1,165 tree species inventories spread across the Cerrado Domain, which come from six vegetation types that have a substantial arboreal component: woody savannas, dystrophic cerradao, mesotrophic cerradao, seasonally dry tropical forests, semideciduous forests and evergreen forests. We found three extremes in terms of tree species composition, with clear underlying ecological drivers, which leads us to propose a ternary model, the Cerrado Vegetation Triangle, to characterize woody vegetation in the Cerrado. At one extreme, we found that semideciduous and evergreen forests are indistinguishable floristically and are found in areas with high water availability. At another extreme lie seasonally dry tropical forests which are found on more fertile soils. At the third extreme, we found that all types of savanna, and dystrophic cerradao, are highly similar in tree species composition and are commonly found in areas of poor soils and high flammability. Mesotrophic cerradao is transitional in tree species composition between savannas and seasonally dry tropical forest.
   4. The lack of variation in tree species composition attributed to climatic variables indicates that within homogeneous macroclimatic zones, many types of forest and savanna co-exist due to complex mosaics of local substrate heterogeneity and fire history.
   5. Synthesis. Our findings highlight the complexity of forest-savanna transitions in the Cerrado Domain, with relevance for understanding the future of Cerrado vegetation under environmental change. If nitrogen deposition is extensive, some savannas may be more likely to transition to mesotrophic cerradao or even seasonally dry tropical forest, whereas if water availability increases these same savannas may transition to semideciduous or evergreen forest. Our "Cerrado Vegetation Triangle" model offers a simple conceptual tool to frame discussions of conservation and management.

AB In tropical tree communities, processes occurring during early life stages play a critical role in shaping forest composition and diversity through differences in species' performance. Predicting the future of tropical forests depends on a solid understanding of the drivers of seedling survival. At the same time, factors determining spatial and temporal patterns of seedling survival can play a large role in permitting species coexistence in diverse communities. Using long-term data on the survival of more than 45 000 seedlings of 238 species in a Neotropical forest, we assessed the relative importance of key abiotic and biotic neighbourhood variables thought to influence individual seedling survival and tested whether species vary significantly in their responses to these variables, consistent with niche differences. At the community level, seedling survival was significantly correlated with plant size, topographic habitat, neighbourhood densities of conspecific seedlings, conspecific and heterospecific trees and annual variation in water availability, in descending order of effect size. Additionally, we found significant variation among species in their sensitivity to light and water availability, as well as in their survival within different topographic habitats, indicating the potential for niche differentiation among species that could allow for species coexistence.

AB Pollinator behaviour has profound effects on plant mating. Pollinators are predicted to minimise energetic costs during foraging bouts by moving between nearby flowers. However, a review of plant mating system studies reveals a mismatch between behavioural predictions and pollen-mediated gene dispersal in bird-pollinated plants. Paternal diversity of these plants is twice that of plants pollinated solely by insects. Comparison with the behaviour of other pollinator groups suggests that birds promote pollen dispersal through a combination of high mobility, limited grooming, and intra-and interspecies aggression. Future opportunities to test these predictions include seed paternity assignment following pollinator exclusion experiments, single pollen grain genotyping, new tracking technologies for small pollinators, and motion-triggered cameras and ethological experimentation for quantifying pollinator behaviour.

AB AimSpatial and temporal biases in species-occurrence data can compromise broad-scale biogeographical research and conservation planning. Although spatial biases have been frequently scrutinized, temporal biases and the overall quality of species-occurrence data have received far less attention. This study aims to answer three questions: (1) How reliable are species-occurrence data for flowering plants in Africa? (2) Where and when did botanical sampling occur in the past 300 years? (3) How complete are plant inventories for Africa?
   LocationAfrica.
   MethodsBy filtering a publicly available dataset containing 3.5 million records of flowering plants, we obtained 934,676 herbarium specimens with complete information regarding species name, date and location of collection. Based on these specimens, we estimated inventory completeness for sampling units (SUs) of 25kmx25km. We then tested whether the spatial distribution of well-sampled SUs was correlated with temporal parameters of botanical sampling. Finally, we determined whether inventory completeness in individual countries was related to old or recently collected specimens.
   ResultsThirty-one per cent of SUs contained at least one specimen, whereas only 2.4% of SUs contained a sufficient number of specimens to reliably estimate inventory completeness. We found that the location of poorly sampled areas remained almost unchanged for half a century. Moreover, there was pronounced temporal bias towards old specimens in South Africa, the country that holds half of the available data for the continent. There, high inventory completeness stems from specimens collected several decades ago.
   Main conclusionsDespite the increasing availability of species occurrence data for Africa, broad-scale biogeographical research is still compromised by the uncertain quality and spatial and temporal biases of such data. To avoid erroneous inferences, the quality and biases in species-occurrence data should be critically evaluated and quantified prior to use. To this end, we propose a quantification method based on inventory completeness using easily accessible species-occurrence data.

AB Understanding the role of predators in food webs can be challenging in highly diverse predator/prey systems composed of small cryptic species. DNA based dietary analysis can supplement predator removal experiments and provide high resolution for prey identification. Here we use a metabarcoding approach to provide initial insights into the diet and functional role of coral-dwelling predatory fish feeding on small invertebrates. Fish were collected in Moorea (French Polynesia) where the BIOCODE project has generated DNA barcodes for numerous coral associated invertebrate species. Pyrosequencing data revealed a total of 292 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) in the gut contents of the arc-eye hawkfish (Paracirrhites arcatus), the flame hawkfish (Neocirrhites armatus) and the coral croucher (Caracanthus maculatus). One hundred forty-nine (51%) of them had species-level matches in reference libraries (>98% similarity) while 76 additional OTUs (26%) could be identified to higher taxonomic levels. Decapods that have a mutualistic relationship with Pocillopora and are typically dominant among coral branches, represent a minor contribution of the predators' diets. Instead, predators mainly consumed transient species including pelagic taxa such as copepods, chaetognaths and siphonophores suggesting non random feeding behavior. We also identified prey species known to have direct negative interactions with stony corals, such as Hapalocarcinus sp, a gall crab considered a coral parasite, as well as species of vermetid snails known for their deleterious effects on coral growth. Pocillopora DNA accounted for 20.8% and 20.1% of total number of sequences in the guts of the flame hawkfish and coral croucher but it was not detected in the guts of the arc-eye hawkfish. Comparison of diets among the three fishes demonstrates remarkable partitioning with nearly 80% of prey items consumed by only one predator. Overall, the taxonomic resolution provided by the metabarcoding approach highlights a highly complex interaction web and demonstrates that levels of trophic partitioning among coral reef fishes have likely been underestimated. Therefore, we strongly encourage further empirical approaches to dietary studies prior to making assumptions of trophic equivalency in food web reconstruction.

AB The principle of limiting similarity suggests that species must be functionally different to coexist; based on the assumption that inter-specific competition should be greatest between functionally similar species. There has been controversy over the generality of this assembly rule for plant communities with some studies finding evidence for limiting similarity and others not. One approach to testing this is to examine the invasion' success of species into communities in which the functional group composition has been manipulated. Using a meta-analysis approach, we examined the generality of limiting similarity for plant communities based on published experimental studies. We asked is establishment of an invading species less successful if it belongs to a functional group that is already present in the community compared to a community in which that functional group is absent? We explored separately colonisation (i.e. germination, establishment or seedling survival) and performance (i.e. biomass, cover or growth) of different functional groups (forbs and grasses) and experimental designs (removal experiments of more or less natural communities and synthetic-assemblage experiments). We found that communities containing functionally similar resident species did reduce invader colonisation and performance of forb invaders, but did not reduce colonisation or performance of grass invaders. Evidence in support of limiting similarity was only detected in synthetic-assemblage experiments and not when studies used functional group removal from natural' communities. Functional similarity is an important aspect of biotic resistance for forb invaders, but was only found in artificial communities. This has implications for restoration ecology especially when communities are built de novo. However, we suggest that limiting similarity plays a limited role in biotic resistance, because no evidence was detected in established communities.

AB The need for biodiversity conservation is increasing at a rate much faster than the acquisition of knowledge of biodiversity, such as descriptions of new species and mapping species distributions. As global changes are winning the race against the acquisition of knowledge, many researchers resort to the use of surrogate groups to aid in conservation decisions. Reductions in taxonomic and numerical resolution are also desirable, because they could allow more rapid the acquisition of knowledge while requiring less effort, if little important information is lost. In this study, we evaluated the congruence among 22 taxonomic groups sampled in a tropical forest in the Amazon basin. Our aim was to evaluate if any of these groups could be used as surrogates for the others in monitoring programs. We also evaluated if the taxonomic or numerical resolution of possible surrogates could be reduced without greatly reducing the overall congruence. Congruence among plant groups was high, whereas the congruence among most animal groups was very low, except for anurans in which congruence values were only slightly lower than for plants. Liana (Bignoniaceae) was the group with highest congruence, even using genera presence-absence data. The congruence among groups was related to environmental factors, specifically the clay and phosphorous contents of soil. Several groups showed strong spatial clumping, but this was unrelated to the congruence among groups. The high degree of congruence of lianas with the other groups suggests that it may be a reasonable surrogate group, mainly for the other plant groups analyzed, if soil data are not available. Although lianas are difficult to count and identify, the number of studies on the ecology of lianas is increasing. Most of these studies have concluded that lianas are increasing in abundance in tropical forests. In addition to the high congruence, lianas are worth monitoring in their own right because they are sensitive to global warming and the increasing frequency and severity of droughts in tropical regions. Our findings suggest that the use of data on surrogate groups with relatively low taxonomic and numerical resolutions can be a reliable shortcut for biodiversity assessments, especially in megadiverse areas with high rates of habitat conversion, where the lack of biodiversity knowledge is pervasive.

AB An understanding of the drivers of tree growth at the species level is required to predict likely changes of carbon stocks and biodiversity when environmental conditions change. Especially in species-rich tropical forests, it is largely unknown how species differ in their response of growth to resource availability and individual size. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the impact of light availability and tree diameter on growth of 274 woody species in a 50-ha long-term forest census plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Light reaching each individual tree was estimated from yearly vertical censuses of canopy density. The hierarchical Bayesian approach allowed accounting for different sources of error, such as negative growth observations, and including rare species correctly weighted by their abundance. All species grew faster at higher light. Exponents of a power function relating growth to light were mostly between 0 and 1. This indicates that nearly all species exhibit a decelerating increase of growth with light. In contrast, estimated growth rates at standardized conditions (5 cm dbh, 5% light) varied over a 9-fold range and reflect strong growth-strategy differentiation between the species. As a consequence, growth rankings of the species at low (2%) and high light (20%) were highly correlated. Rare species tended to grow faster and showed a greater sensitivity to light than abundant species. Overall, tree size was less important for growth than light and about half the species were predicted to grow faster in diameter when bigger or smaller, respectively. Together light availability and tree diameter only explained on average 12% of the variation in growth rates. Thus, other factors such as soil characteristics, herbivory, or pathogens may contribute considerably to shaping tree growth in the tropics.

AB At their most local, initiatives to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) will depend on rural people to manage forest resources. Although the design of frameworks, mechanisms and arrangements to implement REDD programs have received significant attention, it is not yet clear how REDD+ will function on the ground or how the participation of local populations will be assured. Community forest management (CFM) could be an option under REDD+ depending on how it is negotiated, largely because of the expectation that CFM could reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation. Examining institutional factors in the emergence of successful CFM systems and local forest enterprises could provide valuable lessons for REDD planners. We examine cases of CFM development in Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia, to assess the role of multi-scaled governance institutions in their development. Comparing and contrasting advanced CFM systems to regions where it is still emerging, we will show how the establishment of a local organizational base for communal resource management is crucial.

AB Slow-growing juveniles of shade-tolerant plant species are predicted to have tough leaves because of the high cost of leaf replacement in shade relative to potential carbon gain. We assessed the degree of correlated evolution among eight traits associated with leaf toughness and the relationships of those traits with the growth and mortality rates of 197 tree and shrub species from the understory of the 50-ha forest dynamics plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Path analysis with phylogenetically independent contrasts revealed that leaves attained material toughness (resistance to fracture per unit fracture area) through increases in tissue density, percent cellulose per unit dry mass, and vein fracture toughness. Lamina density and cellulose content evolved independently and thus represent different paths to material toughness. Structural toughness (resistance to fracture per unit fracture length) depended on material toughness and lamina thickness. Mortality rates of individuals 1-10 cm in stem diameter were negatively correlated with material toughness and lamina density but were independent of structural toughness and cell wall fiber contents. Leaf toughness traits were uncorrelated with relative growth rates. Results imply that material toughness enhances resistance to natural enemies, which increases survival and offsets the biomass allocation cost of producing tough leaves in the shaded understory.

AB P>Understanding demographic transitions may provide the key to explain the high diversity of tropical tree communities. In a faunally intact Amazonian forest, we compared the spatial distribution of saplings of 15 common tree species with patterns of conspecific seed fall, and examined the seed-to-sapling transition in relation to locations of conspecific trees. In all species, the spatial pattern of sapling recruitment bore no resemblance to predicted distributions based on the density of seed fall. Seed efficiency (the probability of a seed producing a sapling) is strongly correlated with distance from large conspecific trees, with a > 30-fold multiplicative increase between recruitment zones that are most distant vs. proximal to conspecific adults. The striking decoupling of sapling recruitment and conspecific seed density patterns indicates near-complete recruitment failure in areas of high seed density located around reproductive adults. Our results provide strong support for the spatially explicit predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.

AB 1. Population dynamics often defy predictions based on empirical models, and explanations for noisy dynamics have ranged from deterministic chaos to environmental stochasticity. Transient (short-term) dynamics following disturbance or perturbation have recently gained empirical attention from researchers as further possible effectors of complicated dynamics.
   2. Previously published methods of transient analysis have tended to require knowledge of initial population structure. However, this has been overcome by the recent development of the parametric Kreiss bound (which describes how large a population must become before reaching its maximum possible transient amplification following a disturbance) and the extension of this and other transient indices to simultaneously describe both amplified and attenuated transient dynamics.
   3. We apply the Kreiss bound and other transient indices to a data base of matrix models from 108 plant species, in an attempt to detect ecological and mathematical patterns in the transient dynamical properties of plant populations.
   4. We describe how life history influences the transient dynamics of plant populations: species at opposite ends of the scale of ecological succession have the highest potential for transient amplification and attenuation, whereas species with intermediate life history complexity have the lowest potential.
   5. We find ecological relationships between transients and asymptotic dynamics: faster-growing populations tend to have greater potential magnitudes of transient amplification and attenuation, which could suggest that short- and long-term dynamics are similarly influenced by demographic parameters or vital rates.
   6. We describe a strong dependence of transient amplification and attenuation on matrix dimension: perhaps signifying a potentially worrying artefact of basic model parameterization.
   7.Synthesis. Transient indices describe how big or how small plant populations can get, en route to long-term stable rates of increase or decline. The patterns we found in the potential for transient dynamics, across many species of plants, suggest a combination of ecological and modelling strategy influences. This better understanding of transients should guide the formulation of management and conservation strategies for all plant populations that suffer disturbances away from stable equilibria.

AB Aim To determine the effect and relative importance of geographic and local environmental factors on species richness and turnover of ant assemblages in floodplain forests across the Amazon basin.
   Location Twenty-six mature forest sites scattered along the entire extension of the Amazon River in Brazil. The study area encompassed nearly 18 degrees of longitude and 3.5 degrees of latitude.
   Methods Systematic collections of ants were performed at each site during the low-water season (i.e. when forests are not inundated) using three complementary sampling methods. We used variance partitioning techniques to assess the relative effects of the spatial (latitude and longitude) and environmental (rainfall, length of the dry season and flood height) variables on ant species richness and composition.
   Results There was a twofold variation in the number of species per site, which was largely explained by inter-site variations in rainfall seasonality and flooding intensity. In general, there were more species at sites located in the western part of the basin, where the dry season is less severe, or near the river estuary, where precipitation is also high and flooding is less intense. Ant community composition was also affected by environmental heterogeneity. For instance, some species only occurred at those sites less affected by the river's seasonal flooding, whereas others were mostly associated with the drier or wetter regions of the basin. In addition, the turnover of species increased significantly as geographic distances increased. Nevertheless, the rate of change was small given that many species had a broad distribution across the study area.
   Main conclusions Ant distribution patterns along the floodplain forests of the Amazon appear to be controlled to a relatively large extent by the current gradient in flooding intensity and - most importantly - in precipitation. Altered rainfall regimes resulting from global warming and land-use change thus have the potential to influence these patterns.

AB The idea of direct payments for biodiversity conservation in developing countries has generated much debate. Despite substantial experience with related economic instruments in high-income countries such approaches are rare in tropical developing countries, where conservation action is most urgently needed. We explore current experience with the application of direct payments in developing countries through an extensive review and subsequent analysis of the efforts of Conservation International. Our review identifies a broad spectrum of possible direct payment contracts. However, we focus on those involving international conservation interests. Firstly, we develop a framework for the design of direct payment applications, addressing four major aspects: contractual arrangements, definition of conservation services, performance payments, and monitoring and enforcement systems. Secondly, we discuss implementation issues, highlighting the need to consider social factors such as participatory processes, property rights, local institutions and contract legitimacy. Finally, we discuss important considerations for future payment schemes. These include the need for social responsibility, as well as rigorous assessments of effectiveness. We conclude that direct payments show potential as an innovative tool for engaging local communities or resource users in conservation and as a mechanism for channelling global investments in biodiversity conservation services to site-based initiatives.

AB We developed allometric relationships between tree size parameters (stem diameter at breast height (dbh). at ground surface (D-0) and tree height) and leaf, stem, small-root (diameter <5 mm) and total root biomass in various tropical secondary-forest trees in Sarawak, Malaysia. In total, 136 individuals from 23 species were harvested to measure above-ground parts. Root systems of 77 individuals of 16 species were also excavated. The coefficients of correlation for the obtained allometric relationships between tree diameter and plant-part biomass showed high values, ranging from 0.83 to 0.99. In addition, there were few interspecific differences in relationships for all biomass parts, except for leaves. We also found relatively high coefficients of allometric relationships between tree height and plant-part biomass ranging from 0.83 to 0.94. Comparison orabove- and below-ground biomass equations for various tropical rainforests implies that our allometric equations differ largely from the equations for tropical primary forests. Thus. choosing both above- and below-ground allometric equations for biomass estimation in tropical secondary forests of South-East Asia requires careful consideration of their suitability.

AB We analysed presence/absence data for understorey bird species in rain forest fragments sampled from 1979 through 2001. Here we consider extinctions between 1992, when most fragments had been isolated for at least 8 years, and 2001. Our objectives were to determine whether high extinction rates documented soon after isolation continued through up to 20 years after isolation, and to examine fragment size and landscape effects on extinction.
   Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, near Manaus, Brazil.
   Through 1992, birds were surveyed with standardized mist net sampling in ten 1- to 100-ha fragments. We repeated the mist net protocol in 2000-01. We also added remote taping of the dawn chorus and tape playback surveys for species captured in 1991-92 but not in 2000-01.
   Between 1992 and 2001, 37 species went extinct in at least one fragment. As expected, extinction rate decreased with increasing fragment size. Over 30% of species went extinct in 1-ha fragments, compared to about 5% in 100-ha fragments. Extinction followed a predictable pattern: most species lost from 100-ha fragments between 1992 and 2001 had already gone extinct in smaller fragments before 1992. Despite extinctions, fragments gained species between 1992 and 2001, apparently due to species moving through the developing second growth matrix. Fragments surrounded by old second growth had lower extinction rates than predicted based on fragment size alone.
   Sequential extinctions occurred for at least 20 years. Some additional species previously lost from smaller fragments may continue to go extinct in 100-ha fragments. At the same time, species assemblages in 1- and 10-ha fragments mostly reflect second-growth dynamics by 20 years after isolation. High species loss predicted from the first few years after isolation has not occurred, almost certainly because of recolonization.

DE Amazonia; biodiversity; deforestation
ID FOREST BIRD COMMUNITY; TROPICAL FORESTS; DENSITY
AB This is a review of the main factors currently perceived as threats to the biodiversity of Amazonia. Deforestation and the expansion of the agricultural frontier go hand in hand within the context of occupation and land use in the region, followed by a hasty process of industrialization since the 1950s and, more recently, by a nation-wide attempt to adapt Brazil to economic globalization. Intensive agriculture and cattle-raising, lack of territorial planning, the monoculture of certain crops often promoted by official agencies, and the introduction of exotic species by cultivation are some of the factors affecting Amazonian biodiversity. There are still large gaps in knowledge that need to be dealt with for a better understanding of the local ecosystems so as to allow their preservation, but such investigation is subjected to manifold hindrances by misinformation, disinformation and sheer ignorance from the legal authorities and influential media. Data available for select groups of organisms indicate that the magnitude of the loss and waste of natural resources associated with deforestation is staggering, with estimated numbers of lost birds and primates being over ten times that of such animals illegally commercialized around the world in one year. The challenges to be met for an eventual reversal of this situation demand more systematic and concerted studies, the consolidation of new and existing research groups, and a call for a halt to activities depleting the Amazonian rainforest.

AB Understanding the impacts of combined resource supplies on seedlings is critical to enable prediction of establishment growth, and forest dynamics. We investigated the effects of irradiance and water treatments on absolute growth, and relative growth rate (RGR) and its components, for seedlings of four Quercus species differing in leaf habit and with a wide variation in seed mass. Plants were grown for 6.5 months at three levels of irradiance (100, 27, and 3% daylight), and treated during the last 2.5 months with two watering treatments (frequent watering v. suspended watering). Both shade and drought reduced seedling growth rates, with a significant interaction: under full irradiance the drought treatment had a stronger impact on RGR and final biomass than under deep shade. For three species, seed mass was positively related to absolute growth, with stronger correlations at lower irradiance. The evergreen species grew faster than the deciduous species, though leaf habit accounted for a minor part of the interspecific variation in absolute growth. Seedling biomass was determined positively either by RGR or seed mass; RGR was positively linked with net assimilation rate (NAR) and leaf mass fraction (LMF), and seed mass was negatively linked with RGR and LMF, but positively linked with NAR. Seedling RGR was not correlated with light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, but was strongly correlated with the net carbon balance estimated, from photosynthetic light-response curves, considering daily variation in irradiance. These findings suggest an approach to applying short-term physiological measurements to predict the RGR and absolute growth rate of seedlings in a wide range of combinations of irradiance and water supplies.

AB Abiotic and biotic processes operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales to shape many ecological processes, including species distributions and demography. Current debate about the relative roles of niche-based and stochastic processes in shaping species distributions and community composition reflects, in part, the challenge of understanding how these processes interact across scales. Traditional statistical models that ignore autocorrelation and spatial hierarchies can result in misidentification of important ecological covariates. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a hierarchical modeling framework for testing hypotheses about the importance of abiotic factors at different spatial scales and local spatial autocorrelation for shaping species distributions and abundances. For the two orchid species studied, understory light availability and soil moisture helped to explain patterns of presence and abundance at a microsite scale (< 4 m(2)), while soil organic content was important at a population scale (< 400 m(2)). The inclusion of spatial autocorrelation is shown to alter the magnitude and certainty of estimated relationships between abundance and abiotic variables, and we suggest that such analysis be used more often to explore the relationships between species life histories and distributions. The hierarchical modeling framework is shown to have great potential for elucidating ecological relationships involving abiotic and biotic processes simultaneously at multiple scales.

AB Termites are important components of biologically mediated feedback to land-use change in the tropics. In Central Amazonia, termite mounds are prevalent in post-clearing landscapes and appear to constrain re-colonization of the landscape by vegetation. To determine the most important constraints imposed by termite mounds on plant establishment, we investigated chemical, physical, and hydraulic properties of termite mounds at an 8-yearold secondary forest site, and their effects on the development of native plant species. Mounds contained only half of the root biomass found in neighboring soil in the surface 0.05 m. Carbon, nitrogen, and potassium levels in the termite mounds were significantly elevated, by 33, 28, and 38%, respectively (44 g kg(-1), 2.5 g kg(-1), and 33 mg kg(-1)), while no significant difference in phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, or copper concentrations was observed. Calcium was depleted by 27% in the termite mounds at 0.026 g kg(-1). Aluminum concentrations and acidity were significantly higher in the termite mound material (0.23 g kg(-1), pH 4.3) than surrounding soils (0.15 g kg(-1), pH 4.4). Resistance to penetration was significantly higher in termite mounds, at 13.5 MPa. Termite mounds were on average 5 mm drier than the control soil in the surface 0.05 m, with a significantly higher median water infiltration rate through the termite mound than the adjacent soil (16 mm s(-1) vs. 3 mm s(-1)). Although drainage through the mounds in situ was faster, termite mound samples absorbed water significantly more slowly than control soil. Termite mound material retained significantly less water than control soil under the same suction. Plant assays ruled out an effect of aluminum toxicity on seed germination and seedling development in termite mounds over control soil. Water availability and mechanical impedance were the most important constraints for seed germination and seedling development. The abundance of termite mounds was 760 ha(-1) in the study site, but covered only 3% of the area. Complementing the results from this study with investigations of termite mounds and nutrient cycling, carbon storage, and biodiversity will further our understanding of the effects of mound-building termites in the pastures and secondary forests of Amazonia.

AB Habitat heterogeneity contributes to the maintenance of diversity, but the extent that landscape-scale rather than local-scale heterogeneity influences the diversity of soil invertebrates-species with small range sizes-is less clear. Using a Scottish habitat heterogeneity gradient we correlated Collembola and lumbricid worm species richness and abundance with different elements (forest cover, habitat richness and patchiness) and qualities (plant species richness, soil variables) of habitat heterogeneity, at landscape (1 km(2)) and local (up to 200 m(2)) scales. Soil fauna assemblages showed considerable turnover in species composition along this habitat heterogeneity gradient. Soil fauna species richness and turnover was greatest in landscapes that were a mosaic of habitats. Soil fauna diversity was hump-shaped along a gradient of forest cover, peaking where there was a mixture of forest and open habitats in the landscape. Landscape-scale habitat richness was positively correlated with lumbricid diversity, while Collembola and lumbricid abundances were negatively and positively related to landscape spatial patchiness. Furthermore, soil fauna diversity was positively correlated with plant diversity, which in turn peaked in the sites that were a mosaic of forest and open habitat patches. There was less evidence that local-scale habitat variables (habitat richness, tree cover, plant species richness, litter cover, soil pH, depth of organic horizon) affected soil fauna diversity: Collembola diversity was independent of all these measures, while lumbricid diversity positively and negatively correlated with vascular plant species richness and tree canopy density. Landscape-scale habitat heterogeneity affects soil diversity regardless of taxon, while the influence of habitat heterogeneity at local scales is dependent on taxon identity, and hence ecological traits, e.g. body size. Landscape-scale habitat heterogeneity by providing different niches and refuges, together with passive dispersal and population patch dynamics, positively contributes to soil faunal diversity.

AB Savannas are the major biome of tropical regions, spanning 30% of the Earth's land surface. Tree: grass ratios of savannas are inherently unstable and can be shifted easily by changes in fire, grazing, or climate. We synthesize the history and ecological impacts of the rapid expansion and eradication of an exotic large herbivore, the Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalus), on the mesic savannas of Kakadu National Park (KNP), a World Heritage Park located within the Alligator Rivers Region (ARR) of monsoonal north Australia. The study inverts the experience of the Serengeti savannas where grazing herds rapidly declined due to a rinderpest epidemic and then recovered upon disease control. Buffalo entered the ARR by the 1880s, but densities were low until the late 1950s when populations rapidly grew to carrying capacity within a decade. In the 1980s, numbers declined precipitously due to an eradication program. We show evidence that the rapid population expansion and Sudden removal of this exotic herbivore created two ecological cascades by altering around cover abundance and composition, which in turn affected competitive regimes and fuel loads with possible further, long-term effects due to changes in fire regimes. Overall, ecological impacts varied across a north-south gradient in KNP that corresponded to the interacting factors of precipitation, landform, and vegetation type but was also contingent upon the history of buffalo harvest. Floodplains showed the greatest degree of impact during the period of rapid buffalo expansion, but after buffalo removal, they largely reverted to their prior state. Conversely, the woodlands experienced less visible impact during the first cascade. However, in areas of low buffalo harvest and severe impact, there was little recruitment of juvenile trees into the canopy due to the indirect effects of grazing and high frequency of prescribed fires once buffalo were removed. Rain forests were clearly heavily impacted during the first cascade, but the long term consequences of buffalo increase and removal remain unclear. Due to hysteresis effects, the simple removal of an exotic herbivore was not sufficient to return savanna systems to their previous state.

AB Questions: Do past disturbance, soil nutrients, or species diversity predict the invasion success of the alien tree Pitto-sporum undulatum in an island montane rain forest? What are the consequences of its invasion for forest composition and species diversity?
   Location: Blue Mountains, Jamaica.
   Methods: Censuses of trees >= 3 cm DBH in permanent plots in four sites within ca. 7 ha; 1974-2004 (intensive sites) and in 16 plots within 250 ha; 1990-2004 (extensive plots).
   Results: Pittosporum was unrecorded in the intensive sites before a severe hurricane in 1988: by 2004 all four sites were invaded. Pittosporum had invaded 25% of the extensive plots in 1990 and 69% in 2004, where its basal area increased from 0.5 +/- 0.4 (SEM) m(2).ha(-1) in 1990 to 2.8 +/- 1.3 m(2).ha(-1) in 2004. It had zero stem mortality and diameter growth rate exceeded that of native species fourfold. Pittosporum's basal area in the extensive plots in 2004 was positively related to the stand basal area damaged in the 1988 hurricane and negatively related to soil N concentrations. Pittosporum invasion was unrelated to stand-level tree species diversity in the extensive plots but as its basal area increased over time the basal area of native species and stand-level diversity declined.
   Conclusions: There are no obvious functional attributes of Pittosporum unrepresented in the native tree flora although it has high photosynthetic efficiency compared with native trees. More widespread invasion of these forests by Pittosporum seems inevitable since hurricanes, which accelerated the invasion, affect these forests frequently.

AB Avian nest predation is known to increase with the degree of forest fragmentation. A common explanation is that farmland allows for high densities of generalist predators, and predators penetrating into the forest cause higher nest losses at forest-farmland edges than in forest interiors. In contrast to numerous patch-level studies of forest edge effects conducted earlier, we broadened the spatial extent to the landscape. We tested the hypothesis of increased predation near farmland over distances of > 4 km from forest-farmland edges into forest interiors in five mountain ranges in Germany, using artificial ground nests. We considered two landscape settings: (1) Transitions between a forest matrix and a farmland matrix, and (2) farmland patches within a forest matrix. Nest losses were not significantly higher in vicinity to a farmland matrix, but proximity to a pasture within the forest matrix strongly increased predation risk. We speculate that these differences resulted from landscape geometry. Farmland patches and matrix alike are highly attractive to generalist predators, and are regularly visited by red foxes from the forest. Predators that traverse the forest and take prey along the way, will cause a concentration of predation risk towards a patch (pasture), but not towards an adjacent matrix (farming lowlands), of feeding habitat. Contrary to previous evidence that edge effects in nest predation level off after 50 m, nest fate was related to distance to pastures across the entire study extent of 4.1 km. Our results suggest that landscape context and predator mobility may greatly affect spatial predation patterns.

AB Sub-lethal responses to heat stress were investigated in the limpet Cellana grata. During summer low tides, foot temperatures were hotter than rock temperatures, but positively correlated with, heart rate, air and rock temperatures. Hotter limpets showed mushrooming behaviour, raising their shell from the rock. Over 30 % of monitored limpets were not relocated during the subsequent daytime low tide. Missing animals were mostly situated on horizontal surfaces, were smaller than those recaptured, and had higher body temperatures, mushrooming heights and heart rates. A laboratory protocol was designed to resemble on-shore thermal stress conditions. Firstly, small and large limpets were held on a hot plate for 60 min and either constrained or allowed to mushroom. Secondly, unconstrained, large animals were held on the hot plate for 120 min. Unconstrained limpets were able to mushroom and had lower foot temperatures but higher heart rates than those constrained, suggesting mushrooming is an active response. Small animals had higher heart rates than large individuals. Mantle water could not be collected from most small, mushrooming limpets but was from constrained animals, and was more concentrated in small limpets. Small and constrained limpets had more concentrated haemolymph than large or mushrooming animals. Mantle and haemolymph osmolalities were positively related, except at high mantle water osmolalities. Smaller animals lost relatively more water, and constrained limpets more than those allowed to mushroom. Large limpets on the hot plate for 120 min showed similar mushrooming heights and heart rates but had hotter foot temperatures, higher haemolymph concentrations, lost all their mantle water and nearly twice as much water than those held for 60 min. Mushrooming behaviour appears to be a short-term, high-risk strategy that allows limpets temporary relief from stressful conditions and may increase their chance of survival until the next tidal immersion.

ID DEFORESTATION; RAINFALL; LEVEL
AB The time series of 97 annual values, observed or reconstituted, of runoff of the River Amazon at Obidos shows a slight increase of 9% in the mean annual discharges from 1903 to 1999, and of 10% for the floods. All the rupture tests indicate a break in 1970, for the mean annual discharges as well as for the floods. The evolution of the coefficients of variation indicates a reduction in the interannual variability of the mean discharges and floods, from 1927 to 1970. The comparison between the evolution of the mean annual discharges and the average annual rainfall of the basin, from 1945 to 1998, exhibits a good correlation between precipitation and runoff. Finally, the analysis of the evolution of the mean annual discharge and the average annual rainfall, expressed as a percentage of the deviation from the 19451998 averages, demonstrates an increase in the flow in relation to the rainfall, which could be the consequence of the Amazonian deforestation.

   PREDATION
AB Decreased recruitment is hypothesized to be a primary mechanism driving the local extinctions of plant species from fragmented landscapes. A critical but untested assumption of this claim is that reductions in fecundity by individual plants actually result in demographic vulnerability at the population level. I tested this "recruitment limitation hypothesis" using three years of census data from 13 populations of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata, which I integrated with empirical estimates of seedling establishment into matrix demographic models. I asked: (1) How much recruitment is necessary for lambda > 1? (2) What are the projected values of lambda for H. acuminata populations in fragments and continuous forest, given empirical estimates of seedling emergence? (3) What are the actual values of lambda for populations in fragments and continuous forest, and why might projected and estimated values of lambda differ? (4) What other demographic stages contribute to lambda, and how are these affected by fragmentation? Simulation models suggest that extreme reductions in recruitment are necessary for population declines, and empirical estimates of seedling establishment were frequently below these thresholds. As a result, Heliconia actaninata populations in fragments are projected to shrink at a rate of 1-1.5% per year, while those in continuous forest are projected to grow 2.3-4% per year. Annual censuses, however, indicated populations in both continuous forest and fragments grew at rates well in excess of those projected by matrix models. This discrepancy is due to higher-than-predicted seedling numbers. While elasticity analyses indicated transitions related to growth and survivorship actually made the greatest proportional contribution to lambda, these results suggest that dispersal into fragments is common and helping populations overcome the negative demographic consequences of reduced seedling establishment. Additional demographic studies of plant populations in fragmented areas are urgently needed to identify other potential mechanisms responsible for population declines. Particular attention should be paid to appraising the effect of fragmentation on plant growth and survivorship, as altering these life-history stages may have the most serious consequences for population growth rates.

AB To clarify the interactive effect of the simultaneous death of dwarf bamboo (Sasa kurilensis), forest canopy gap formation, and seed predators on beech (Fagus crenata) regeneration, we analyzed beech demography from seed fall until the end of the first growing season of seedlings in an old-growth forest near Lake Towada, northern Japan. The simultaneous death of S. kurilensis took place in 1995. We established four types of sampling site differing in forest canopy conditions (closed or gap) and Sasa status (dead or alive). Beech seed survival and emergence ratio were both highest in gaps with dead Sasa (gap-dead),because rate of predation was lowest. Seedling survival during the first growing season was also highest in the gap-dead treatment, because of less predation and less damping off. As a result, even though density of seed fall was lowest in the gap-dead treatment, the living seedling density there was highest at the end of the first growing season. Predation, which caused the greatest mortality during the seed and seedling stages, was significantly lower at both sites in gaps and sites with dead Sasa. This was probably due to changes in the behavior of rodents in response to the structure of the forest canopy and undergrowth. Both the death of Sasa and canopy gap formation allowed seedlings to avoid damping off because of the high light availability. The indirect effect of the simultaneous death of Sasa and canopy gap formation in reducing predation contributed more to beech regeneration than their direct effect in increasing light for the seedlings.

AB Physical damage caused by litterfall is a source of seedling mortality that can be influenced by environmental disturbances, such as the isolation of forest fragments due to habitat destruction. The impact of physical damage in seedling mortality was evaluated in forest fragments and continuous forests in central Amazonia using artificial seedlings. A total of 11 reserves distributed among three sires were studied: three 1-ha, three 10-ha, two 100-ha, and three continuous forest reserves. In each reserve, ten transects each comprised of ten artificial seedlings were monitored for one year at four-week intervals. Survival curves were compared using failure time analysis, and the effect of reserve size on artificial seedling mortality after one year was analyzed with a categorical model. In the analysis of survival curves, artificial seedling survival was significantly greater in the continuous forest than in the 10-ha reserve at one site only, a result that may have occurred by chance. After one year, artificial seedlings suffered similar mortality due to litterfall among the reserves sampled. Physical damage by litterfall varied from 28 to 35 percent annually in the 1- and 10-ha forest fragments compared to 20 to 24 percent in the continuous forest. Mortality of artificial seedlings in the continuous forest was similar to other tropical sites in which the same method has been used, and may indicate that litterfall plays an important rule in seedling morality in the terra firme tropical forests of central Amazonia.

AB Tree regeneration was compared among closed-canopy sites and 4-11-year old natural and felling gaps in a selectively logged semideciduous tropical forest in southeastern Mexico. Closed-canopy sites and gaps were selected stratified randomly. In addition, all large natural and felling gaps encountered were sampled. All stems less than or equal to 5 cm dbh were sampled in sets of 10 m(2) plots in closed-canopy sites and gaps. The origins of the 10 tallest stems in each gap were also determined. Rubber-tired skidder disturbance in felling gaps resulted in a fourfold increase in the relative abundances of a set of shade-intolerant species. The logging process also promoted root sprouting, primarily among shade-intolerant species, but also in several shade-tolerant species. Advance growth accounted for a higher proportion of tall stems in natural than felling gaps and most of these stems were of shade-tolerant species. The proportion of tall stems that originated from seeds or small seedlings at the time of gap formation was higher in felling than natural gaps and increased with canopy openness only in felling gaps. These stems were primarily from shade-intolerant species. A lack of response to canopy openness in natural gaps was likely a result of relatively low levels of understory and substrate disturbance coupled with the absence of large natural gaps with high canopy openness. The maintenance of shade-intolerant and tolerant timber species in this forest would appear to require, at minimum, the creation of large gaps with understory and substrate disturbance within a matrix of forest logged by single-tree selection methods in which understory damage was minimized.

AB This study investigated the effect of purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.) on the pollination and reproductive success of co-flowering plant species (Impatiens capensis Walt., Eupotorium perfoliatum L. and Eupatorium maculatum L.). Pollinator visits, heterospecific and conspecific stigmatic pollen loads, fruit and seed set were measured and compared among experimental plots of low, medium, and high densities of Lythrum salicaria. Honey bees accounted for over 90% of the visits to Lythrum salicaria. In medium-density plots, in one of the two study sites. there was 19% reduction in seed production in Eupatorium perfoliatum and more than 58% increase in the amount of Lythrum salicaria pollen on Eupatorium maculatum stigmas. In high-density plots at one site, 30% fewer fruit set in Impatiens capensis. These data indicate that Lythrum salicaria can have a negative impact on wetland plant communities.

AB We examined size-related dietary patterns in a Queensland population of the Australian freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus johnstoni). In three consecutive dry seasons, we stomach flushed crocodiles (n = 324) to record the numerical frequency and percent occurrence of prey items, Prey included spiders, aquatic insects, terrestrial insects, shrimp, fish, anurans, turtles, snakes, mammals, and birds. The diet of C. johnstoni showed ontogenetic shifts as the cranium broadened and once body size exceeded 60 cm SVL. With increasing crocodile size, the ingestion of spiders, insects, and anurans declined strongly whereas the consumption of fish, turtles, and snakes increased strongly, Shrimp were eaten at low and variable levels by all size classes of crocodile, The low overall prevalence of mammals and birds suggested that they were consumed opportunistically by the larger crocodiles, With increasing crocodile size, there were overall increases in prey richness and significant declines in realized dietary niche, dietary breadth, and mean number of prey items per crocodile. There were no significant changes in dietary diversity, evenness, or number of equally common prey species.

AB The traditional milpa agriculture system (slash-burn) of the Lacandon Maya people in eastern Chiapas, Mexico has created and uses a variety of habitat patches including the whole range of seral stages during forest development. This study examines seed bank attributes in habitats associated with slash-burn agriculture and with the more recent expansion of grasslands. We estimated the abundance and floristic composition of seeds in the soil from induced grasslands, milpa fields neighboring early and mature forests, and from secondary forest and mature tropical rain forest (15 samples by site, 2-3 replicated sites per successional stage). A total of 130 species germinated from the soil samples. The seeds of late successional tree species were scarce in all the seed soil samples (<2% of che species). Twenty-five early successional species accounted for ca. 70 percent of all individuals. Soil seed density (but not species richness) increased as milpas and fallows dominated the landscape. Affinity analysis based on presence/absence and abundance data showed a different soil seed bank composition for the grasslands when compared to that of all other successional communities. Our results suggest that current expansion of pastures and agricultural fields modifies seed deposition and storage patterns in the soil that may alter the process of secondary succession. This compromises both the regenerating potential of tropical rain forest in the region, and the sustainability of traditional practices and economic relationships of the Lacandon Maya.

AB 1. We quantitatively assess seasonal changes in community structure and habitat selection among seabirds in the Scotia-Weddell Confluence region, Antarctica. Additionally, we discuss the biological and physical factors underlying the patterns. Data were derived from strip-transects on closely-coordinated multidisciplinary cruises that characterized the physics and biology during spring 1983, autumn 1986 and winter 1988.
   2. We describe for the first time ever for the Southern Ocean seasonal changes in seabird communities in terms of composition, using cluster analysis, as well as relative density and diversity among species. Sea-surface temperature, distance to the pack ice edge and ice type, all physical characteristics of habitat, were the most important environmental variables that affected assemblage composition. We identified three recurrent assemblages of species. One persistent assemblage, present year round, was associated with the pack ice; another was associated with open waters immediately adjacent to the ice; and a third was a far-from-ice assemblage. Only the two open-water assemblages changed markedly on a seasonal basis.
   3. Close similarity of patterns in the spring 1983 data with those collected during spring 1976 in the Ross Sea, on the other side of Antarctica, supported our contention that we were comparing seasonal and not interannual differences in community structure.
   4. In spite of a major reduction in the number and density of species in the open-water assemblages during winter, the pack-ice assemblage exhibited no habitat expansion, which might be expected if competition affected community structure and habitat selection. The pack ice, in contrast to the adjacent open water, is a habitat in which food is abundantly available year round for an assemblage of species specialized to exploit the opportunities present. Unspecialized species vacate the region when food becomes sparse.

AB The recent rise in global demand for natural rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) has led to expansive areas of natural forest being transformed into monoculture plantations. This paper explores the utility of annual Landsat time series for monitoring forest disturbance and the role of natural rubber in mainland Southeast Asia from 2000 to 2012. A region on the Cambodian-Vietnamese border was chosen for this study considering four primary questions: 1) how accurately can annual Landsat time series map the location and timing of forest disturbances in evergreen and seasonal tropical forests, 2) are there cross-border differences in frontier and non-frontier forest disturbance rates between Cambodia and Vietnam, 3) what proportion of disturbances in frontier and non-frontier forests can be accounted for by the impact of rubber plantations, and 4) is there a relationship between global market prices for natural rubber and the annual rate of frontier forest clearing for rubber plantations on both sides of the border. We used LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery) for temporal segmentation of the Landsat time series and disturbance mapping. Our results show that this approach can provide accurate forest disturbance maps but that accuracy is affected by forest type. Highest accuracies were found in evergreen forest (91%), with lower accuracies in mixed (82%) and dry-deciduous forest types (86%). Our final map considering all forest types yielded an overall accuracy of 86%. Forest disturbance rates were generally higher on the Cambodian side of the border. Frontier forest disturbance rates averaged 3.8%/year in Cambodia compared to 2.5%/year in Vietnam. Conversion to rubber was the dominant form of frontier forest change in both countries (42% in Cambodia and 84% in Vietnam). Non-frontier forest disturbances averaged 4.0% and 2.5% in Cambodia and Vietnam, respectively, with most disturbances likewise linked with rubber plantations. Although rates of frontier forest disturbance differed in both countries, they each displayed similar correlations between disturbance rates related to rubber plantation expansion and price fluctuations of natural rubber. This suggests links between localized land cover/use change and international market forces, irrespective of differing political and socioeconomic backgrounds. Our study underlines the value of using dense Landsat time series when exploring the dynamics of human-induced land cover change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ecosystem services are strongly influenced by the landscape configuration of natural and human systems. So they are heterogeneous across landscapes. However lack of the knowledge of spatial variations of ecosystem services constrains the effective management and conservation of ecosystems. We presented a spatially explicit and quantitative assessment of the geographic variations in ecosystem services for the Fuzhou City in 2009 using exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and semivariance analysis. Results confirmed a significant and positive spatial autocorrelation, and revealed several hot-spots and cold-spots for the spatial distribution of ecosystem service intensity (ESI) in the study area Also the trend surface analysis indicated that the level of ESI tended to be reduced gradually from north to south and from west to east, with a trough in the urban central area, which was quite in accordance with land-use structure. A more precise cluster map was then developed using the range of lag distance, deriving from semivariance analysis, as neighborhood size instead of default value in the software of ESRI ArcGIS 10.0, and geographical clusters where population growth and land-use pressure varied significantly and positively with ESI across the city were also created by geographically weighted regression (GWR). This study has good policy implications applicable to prioritize areas for conservation or construction, and design ecological corridor to improve ecosystem service delivery to benefiting areas.

AB Forest fragmentation dramatically alters species persistence and distribution and affects many ecological interactions among species. Recent studies suggest that mutualisms, such as pollination and seed dispersal, are more sensitive to the negative effects of forest fragmentation than antagonisms, such as predation or herbivory. We applied meta-analytical techniques to evaluate this hypothesis and quantified the relative contributions of different components of the fragmentation process (decreases in fragment size, edge effects, increased isolation, and habitat degradation) to the overall effect. The effects of fragmentation on mutualisms were primarily driven by habitat degradation, edge effects, and fragment isolation, and, as predicted, they were consistently more negative on mutualisms than on antagonisms. For the most studied interaction type, seed dispersal, only certain components of fragmentation had significant (edge effects) or marginally significant (fragment size) effects. Seed size modulated the effect of fragmentation: species with large seeds showed stronger negative impacts of fragmentation via reduced dispersal rates. Our results reveal that different components of the habitat fragmentation process have varying impacts on key mutualisms. We also conclude that antagonistic interactions have been understudied in fragmented landscapes, most of the research has concentrated on particular types of mutualistic interactions such as seed dispersal, and that available studies of interspecific interactions have a strong geographical bias (arising mostly from studies carried out in Brazil, Chile, and the United States).

AB Negative density dependence (NDD) of recruitment is pervasive in tropical tree species. We tested the hypotheses that seed dispersal is NDD, due to intraspecific competition for dispersers, and that this contributes to NDD of recruitment. We compared dispersal in the palm Attalea butyracea across a wide range of population density on Barro Colorado Island in Panama and assessed its consequences for seed distributions. We found that frugivore visitation, seed removal and dispersal distance all declined with population density of A. butyracea, demonstrating NDD of seed dispersal due to competition for dispersers. Furthermore, as population density increased, the distances of seeds from the nearest adult decreased, conspecific seed crowding increased and seedling recruitment success decreased, all patterns expected under poorer dispersal. Unexpectedly, however, our analyses showed that NDD of dispersal did not contribute substantially to these changes in the quality of the seed distribution; patterns with population density were dominated by effects due solely to increasing adult and seed density.

AB Soundscape ecology aims to use biological, geophysical and anthropogenic sound to understand natural-human landscape dynamics. The analysis of natural soundscapes with no human noise is a prerequisite to understand and quantify the effects of human activity on animal ecology linked to sound. Preserved tropical forests are the location of unique, highly diverse, and animal sound. However, although the acoustic behavior of several tropical species has been examined, very few analyses have attempted tropical sounds at a spatial scale able to incorporate landscape characters. Here we analyze the acoustic structure of a neotropical forest landscape in French Guiana. We used a four dimensional synchronous acoustic sampling (three spatial dimensions and the temporal dimension) by deploying an array of 24 microphones in the understory and canopy of the Nouragues Nature Reserve during a 43 day period and we undertook a detailed signal analysis to detect spatial and temporal animal acoustic heterogeneity. We identified a clear pattern of acoustic activity with four distinct periods of activity that differed by their spectral characteristics indicating acoustic heterogeneity along the 24-hour cycle but periodicity at a longer time scale. We revealed acoustic divergences between the understory and the canopy layers in terms of amplitude level and frequency content. We highlighted vertical (understory/canopy) and horizontal acoustic heterogeneities with a more diverse (frequency) patch in the north of the study area sampled and a more active (intensity) patch in the southeast of the study area. Our results show that the soundscape of a tropical forest, in the absence of human disturbance, is subtly structured in time and is heterogeneous in space. This structure is probably linked to endogenous factors that rule out the acoustic time activity of animal species, to the vertical stratification of singing communities or guilds, to horizontal variations in the distributions of species and to vegetation spatial heterogeneity. Our study emphasizes that tropical soundscapes need to be recorded and analyzed in considerable spatial and temporal detail to understand their dynamics without the presence of human produced noise. Our analysis also suggests that tropical forests are unique places for acoustic diversity, supporting the need for preservation from all perturbations including anthropic noise.

AB The Janzen-Connell hypothesis proposes that plant interactions with host-specific antagonists can impair the fitness of locally abundant species and thereby facilitate coexistence. However, insects and pathogens that associate with multiple hosts may mediate exclusion rather than coexistence. We employ a simulation model to examine the effect of enemy host breadth on plant species richness and defence community structure, and to assess expected diversity maintenance in example systems. Only models in which plant enemy similarity declines rapidly with defence similarity support greater species richness than models of neutral drift. In contrast, a wide range of enemy host breadths result in spatial dispersion of defence traits, at both landscape and local scales, indicating that enemy-mediated competition may increase defence-trait diversity without enhancing species richness. Nevertheless, insect and pathogen host associations in Panama and Papua New Guinea demonstrate a potential to enhance plant species richness and defence-trait diversity comparable to strictly specialised enemies.

AB South-western Australia harbours a global biodiversity hotspot on the world's most phosphorus (P)-impoverished soils. The greatest biodiversity occurs on the most severely nutrient-impoverished soils, where non-mycorrhizal species are a prominent component of the flora. Mycorrhizal species dominate where soils contain slightly more phosphorus. In addition to habitat loss and dryland salinity, a major threat to plant biodiversity in this region is eutrophication due to enrichment with P. Many plant species in the south-western Australian biodiversity hotspot are extremely sensitive to P, due to a low capability to down-regulate their phosphate-uptake capacity. Species from the most P-impoverished soils are also very poor competitors at higher P availability, giving way to more competitive species when soil P concentrations are increased. Sources of increased soil P concentrations include increased fire frequency, run-off from agricultural land, and urban activities. Another P source is the P-fertilizing effect of spraying natural environments on a landscape scale with phosphite to reduce the impacts of the introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, which itself is a serious threat to biodiversity. We argue that alternatives to phosphite for P. cinnamomi management are needed urgently, and propose a strategy to work towards such alternatives, based on a sound understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms of the action of phosphite in plants that are susceptible to P. cinnamomi. The threats we describe for the south-western Australian biodiversity hotspot are likely to be very similar for other P-impoverished environments, including the fynbos in South Africa and the cerrado in Brazil.

AB There is substantial variation in the reported effects of logging on tropical forest fauna. In addition to inherent variation in disturbance sensitivity among taxa, another contributing factor is that most studies use comparative analyses of unlogged versus logged forests, which cannot fully account for heterogeneity in disturbance as well as underlying environmental gradients. To better understand how logging affects biodiversity, we examined changes in bat assemblages across a disturbance gradient ranging from old growth to forest logged several times. In one of the first evaluations of repeatedly logged forest, we use both comparative and gradient analyses to reveal substantial signals in assemblage change in response to habitat alteration. Despite multiple rounds of extraction in the most degraded forest, neither approach revealed a definitive effect of logging on site-based richness. However, each approach generated insight into assemblage compositional responses to forest degradation. Structural differences were evident between old-growth and repeatedly logged forest, and depauperate assemblages characterised degraded sites with low, open canopy. Ordinations identified species that best contributed to the signal of assemblage change, and also key associated forest-structure variables. Models of trap-based abundance confirmed not only the importance of forest height in determining assemblage change but also the role of tree-cavity availability in supporting forest specialists, indicating that efforts to supplement this resource could aid restoration. While highlighting the ecological importance of unlogged stands, we show that heavily degraded forests-even those that have been repeatedly logged-still hold some potential value for tropical biota and could have a role in conservation.

AB We summarise the contemporary carbon budget of South America and relate it to its dominant controls: population and economic growth, changes in land use practices and a changing atmospheric environment and climate. Component flux estimate methods we consider sufficiently reliable for this purpose encompass fossil fuel emission inventories, biometric analysis of old-growth rainforests, estimation of carbon release associated with deforestation based on remote sensing and inventories, and agricultural export data. Alternative methods for the estimation of the continental-scale net land to atmosphere CO2 flux, such as atmospheric transport inverse modelling and terrestrial biosphere model predictions, are, we find, hampered by the data paucity, and improved parameterisation and validation exercises are required before reliable estimates can be obtained. From our analysis of available data, we suggest that South America was a net source to the atmosphere during the 1980s (similar to 0.3-0.4 Pg C a(-1)) and close to neutral (similar to 0.1 Pg C a(-1)) in the 1990s. During the latter period, carbon uptake in old-growth forests nearly compensated for the carbon release associated with fossil fuel burning and deforestation.
   Annual mean precipitation over tropical South America as inferred from Amazon River discharge shows a long-term upward trend. Although, over the last decade dry seasons have tended to be drier, with the years 2005 and 2010 in particular experiencing strong droughts. On the other hand, precipitation during the wet seasons also shows an increasing trend. Air temperatures have also increased slightly. Also with increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, it is currently unclear what effect these climate changes are having on the forest carbon balance of the region. Current indications are that the forests of the Amazon Basin have acted as a substantial long-term carbon sink, but with the most recent measurements suggesting that this sink may be weakening. Economic development of the tropical regions of the continent is advancing steadily, with exports of agricultural products being an important driver and witnessing a strong upturn over the last decade.

AB P>1. The core assumption of neutral theory is that all individuals in a community have equal fitness regardless of species, and regardless of the species composition of the community. But, real communities consist of species exhibiting large trait differences; hence these differences must be subject to perfect fitness-equalizing trade-offs for neutrality to hold.
   2. Here we explain that perfect equalizing trade-offs are extremely unlikely to occur in reality, because equality of fitness among species is destroyed by: (i) any deviation in the functional form of the trade-off away from the one special form that gives equal fitness; (ii) spatial or temporal variation in performance; (iii) random species differences in performance.
   3. In the absence of the density-dependent processes stressed by traditional niche-based community ecology, communities featuring small amounts of (i) or (ii) rapidly lose trait variation, becoming dominated by species with similar traits, and exhibit substantially lower species richness compared to the neutral case. Communities featuring random interspecific variation in traits (iii) lose all but a few fortuitous species.
   4. Thus neutrality should be viewed, a priori, as a highly improbable explanation for the long-term co-occurrence of measurably different species within ecological communities. In contrast, coexistence via niche structure and density dependence, is robust to species differences in baseline fitness, and so remains plausible.
   5. We conclude that: (i) co-occurring species will typically exhibit substantial differences in baseline fitness even when (imperfect) equalizing trade-offs have been taken into account; (ii) therefore, communities must be strongly niche structured, otherwise they would lose both trait variation and species richness; (iii) nonetheless, even in strongly niche-structured communities, it is possible that the abundance of species with similar traits are at least partially free to drift.

AB Have forest dynamics changed significantly in intact Amazon rainforests since the early 1980s? If so, what environmental drivers might potentially be responsible?
   Central Amazonia, north of Manaus, Brazil.
   Within 20 1-ha plots scattered over similar to 300 km(2), all trees (>= 10 cm diameter at breast height) were marked, identified, and measured five times between 1981 and 2003. We estimated stand-level dynamics (mortality, recruitment, and growth) for each census interval and evaluated weather parameters over the study period.
   We observed a widespread, significant increase in tree mortality across our plots. Tree recruitment also rose significantly over time but lagged behind mortality. Tree growth generally accelerated but varied considerably among census intervals, and was lowest when mortality was highest. Tree basal area rose 4% overall, but stem number exhibited no clear trend. In terms of climate variation, annual maximum and minimum temperatures increased significantly during our study. Rainfall anomalies were strongly and positively associated with ENSO events.
   The increasing forest dynamics, growth, and basal area observed are broadly consistent with the CO2 fertilization hypothesis. However, pronounced shorter-term variability in stand dynamics might be associated with climatic vicissitudes. Tree mortality peaked, and tree recruitment and growth declined during atypically wet periods. Tree growth was fastest during dry periods, when reduced cloudiness might have increased available solar radiation. Inferences about causality are tenuous because tree data were collected only at multi-year intervals. Mean temperatures and rainfall seasonality have both increased over time in central Amazonia, and these could potentially have long-term effects on forest dynamics and carbon storage.

AB 1. Although shade tolerance is often assumed to be a fixed trait of species, recent work has reported size-related changes in the relative and absolute light requirements of woody taxa. We hypothesized that, in evergreen forests, light requirements of shade-tolerant species that accumulate multiple foliage cohorts will be more stable during juvenile ontogeny than those of intolerant species with short leaf lifetimes.
   2. We quantified the light environments occupied by three size classes of 13 coexisting evergreens in a temperate rainforest, to determine how size influenced their relative shade tolerance. Minimum light requirements (MLRs) of species were estimated by computing the 10th percentile of the distribution of juveniles in relation to percentage canopy openness, for each size class. Leaf life span in low light (2%-5% canopy openness) was estimated by recording survival of marked leaves over 12 months, or retrospectively on species with clearly discernible foliage cohorts.
   3. Agreement of ranks of species' MLR across size classes was significant, although not strong (Kendall's W = 0.159, P = 0.02). MLRs of the most shade-tolerant species changed little between size-classes, whereas those of most of the less-tolerant species rose with increasing size.
   4. Shift in MLR across size-classes was negatively correlated with leaf life span, possibly because of the effects of leaf life span on biomass distribution and whole-plant carbon balance. Survival of light-demanding species with short leaf lifetimes may thus depend on their encountering increasing light levels as they grow taller, whereas progressive accumulation of an extensive leaf area by late-successional taxa enables them to continue to tolerate low light despite increasing size.
   5. Results suggest that shade-tolerance differences between evergreens become increasingly apparent with increasing size. In identifying a relationship with leaf life span, this work also provides a basis for predicting changes in species' light requirements during juvenile ontogeny.

AB As large nature reserves occupy only a fraction of the earth's land surface, conservation biologists are critically examining the role of private lands, habitat fragments, and plantations for conservation. This study in a biodiversity hotspot and endemic bird area, the Western Ghats mountains of India, examined the effects of habitat structure, floristics, and adjacent habitats on bird communities in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and tropical rainforest fragments. Habitat and birds were sampled in 13 sites: six fragments (three relatively isolated and three with canopy connectivity with adjoining shade-coffee plantations and forests), six plantations differing in canopy tree species composition (five coffee and one cardamom), and one undisturbed primary rainforest control site in the Anamalai hills. Around 3300 detections of 6000 individual birds belonging to 106 species were obtained. The coffee plantations were poorer than rainforest in rainforest bird species, particularly endemic species, but the rustic cardamom plantation with diverse, native rainforest shade trees, had bird species richness and abundance comparable to primary rainforest. Plantations and fragments that adjoined habitats providing greater tree canopy connectivity supported more rainforest and fewer open-forest bird species and individuals than sites that lacked such connectivity. These effects were mediated by strong positive effects of vegetation structure, particularly woody plant variables, cane, and bamboo, on bird community structure. Bird community composition was however positively correlated only to floristic (tree species) composition of sites. The maintenance or restoration of habitat structure and (shade) tree species composition in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and rainforest fragments can aid in rainforest bird conservation in the regional landscape.

AB 1 The role of seed limitation in tropical forests remains uncertain owing to the scarcity of experimental evidence. We performed seed addition experiments to assess seed limitation for 32 shade-tolerant tropical forest species and monitored the natural seed rain of 25 of these species for 17 years.
   2 One, two or five seeds were sown into 0.0079-m(2) plots for large- (n = 5 species), medium- (n = 5) and small-seeded species (n = 22), respectively. The experiment was replicated at 69 sites, placed in groups of three at 23 locations. Seedling establishment was evaluated after 1 and 2 years in paired seed addition and control plots. Natural seedling emergence and understorey plant density were also measured.
   3 Median natural seed rain was 0.31 seeds m(-2) year(-1) per focal species.
   4 Seed addition enhanced seedling establishment in 31 and 26 of the 32 species after 1 and 2 years, respectively. Mean number of focal species' seedlings after 2 years was 0.002 seedlings in control plots and 0.12, 0.37 and 0.60 seedlings in seed addition plots for large-, medium- and small-seeded species, respectively.
   5 A 25 seeds added treatment increased seedling establishment by >= 2.0-fold over the five seeds added treatment after 2 years.
   6 Community-wide recruitment and understorey plant density were strongly seed-limited. The natural density of understorey plants averaged 12 plants m(-2) and was significantly less than for seedlings of the single focal species in plots with >= 2 seeds added 2 years earlier.
   7 The number of established seedlings per seed added was independent of seed size.
   8 Treatment (adding zero or five seeds), species identity and location all affected seedling establishment for the 11 small-seeded species represented at all sites, with treatment and its interactions accounting for 86% of the explained variation.
   9 Our results suggest that seed limitation plays a dominant role in seedling recruitment and understorey plant community assembly in tropical forests. Although strong seed limitation may set the stage for species-neutral community assembly, the species differences in seedling establishment rate and its spatial variation demonstrate an important role for species-specific processes.

AB Benthic colonial invertebrates share with higher plants a modular construction and a sessile adult life. Both types of organism show parallel evolutionary responses to common selective forces, but in contrast to the long-established focus on plants, comparable study of colonial invertebrates has developed relatively recently, largely owing to the application of new techniques in image processing and molecular biology. Species whose life cycles are readily completed under laboratory conditions and whose colonies are easily propagated from cuttings provide powerful models for experimentally investigating fundamental evolutionary problems, including metabolic allometry, the manifestation of ageing and the origin of allorecognition systems. Free of the confounding influences of behavioural manipulation and costs of copulation, colonial invertebrates whose water-borne sperm fertilize retained eggs lend themselves well to the experimental study of cryptic female choice, sperm competition and sexual conflict. In these respects, it will be productive to adopt and extend theoretical frameworks developed for flowering plants to guide experimental investigation of modular animals. Since mate choice occurs at the cellular level in modular animals, reproductive isolation is uncorrelated with morphology and cryptic speciation is likely to be widespread.

AB Meteorological impacts of El Nino events of 1982-1983 and 1997-1998 were observed in locations throughout the world. In southern Brazil, El Nino events are associated with increased rainfall and higher freshwater discharge into Patos Lagoon, a large coastal lagoon that empties into the Atlantic Ocean. Based on interdecadal meteorological and biological data sets encompassing the two strongest El-Nino events of the last 50 yr, we evaluated the hypothesis that El Nino-induced hydrological changes are a major driving force controlling the interannual variation in the structure and dynamics of fishes in the Palos Lagoon estuary. High rainfall in the drainage basin of the lagoon coincided with low salinity in the estuarine area during both El Nino episodes. Total rainfall in the drainage basin was higher (767 versus 711 nun) and near-zero salinity conditions in the estuarine area lasted about 3 mo longer during the 1997-1998 El Nino event compared with the 1982-1983 event. Hydrological changes triggered by both El Nino events had similar relationships to fish species composition and diversity patterns, but the 1997-1998 event appeared to have stronger effects on the species assemblage. Although shifts in species composition were qualitatively similar during the two El Nino events, distance between El Nino and non-El Nino assemblage multivariate centroids was greater during the 1996-2000 sampling period compared with the 1979-1983 period. We provide a conceptual model of the principal mechanisms and processes connecting the atmospheric-oceanographic interactions triggered by the El Nino phenomena and their effect on the estuarine fish assemblage.

AB Massive mortality in kelp beds of the Pacific coasts of North and South America was caused by the rise in surface seawater temperature during the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event of 1982/83, the strongest in the four and half previous centuries. In northern Chile a stretch of 600 km of coastline showed massive mortality of the intertidal kelp species Lessonia nigrescens Bory, of which only a few individuals managed to survive. Kelps and their associated biodiversity recovered but kelp beds re-colonization in general was variable in time and space seemingly very slow along northern Chilean coasts. Here we show, effectively, that northward re-colonization advanced less than 60 km in 20 years. Conversely, kelp beds of the Northern Hemisphere recovered 300 km in only six months after the same ENSO event. Genetic diversity in the two most affected populations of L. nigrescens shows half of the heterozygosity and polymorphism with respect to that observed in six non affected populations. In addition, geographically separated populations seem highly isolated as evidenced by high and significant fixation indices (all F-ST values over 0.4).

AB Tree characteristics were recorded from 2829 standing trees in 24 0.25-ha terra firme forest plots in central Amazonia, 3 y after a surface fire had swept through the study area. Sixteen of the plots were within forest that burnt for the first time at the end of the 1997-98 El Nino (ENSO) event, and the remaining eight plots were within unburnt primary forest. In order to investigate the morphological correlates of tree mortality, we measured tree diameter at breast height (dbh) and bark thickness, and recorded burn height, bark roughness and the presence of latex, resin and buttress roots. Leaf litter depth was also recorded at the base of all trees in the unburnt forest. Using logistic regression models, tree mortality was best explained by the burn height, although dbh and the presence of buttresses were also important. Buttressed trees were associated with deeper leaf litter accumulation at their bases and higher char heights than trees without buttresses. Moreover, trees surviving the fire had significantly thicker bark than living trees in unburnt forest plots, indicating that thin-barked trees are more prone to selective mortality induced by heat stress. Latex did not appear to have had any significant effects on mortality, though resins were less abundant amongst the live trees in the burnt forest than in the unburnt controls. Levels of fire-mediated tree mortality in this study are compared with those in other Amazonian forest regions in light of historical factors affecting tree resistance to fires.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly used as a management tool to preserve species and habitats. Testing hypotheses about the effectiveness of MPAs is important for their implementation and to identify informative criteria to support management decisions. This study tested the general proposition that MPAs affected assemblages of algae and invertebrates between 0.0 and 0.5 m above the mean low water level of rocky coasts on two islands in the Tuscan Archipelago (northwest Mediterranean). Protection was concentrated mainly on the west coasts of the islands, raising the possibility that neither the full range of assemblages nor the relevant scales of variation were properly represented within MPAs. This motivated the comparison of assemblages on opposite sides of islands (habitats). The effects of MPAs and habitat were assessed with a multifactorial sampling design; hypotheses were tested about differences in structure of assemblages, in mean abundance of common taxa and in univariate and multivariate measures of spatial variation. The design consisted of three replicate shores for each condition of protected and reference areas on the west side of each island and three unprotected shores on the eastern side. Assemblages were sampled independently four times on each island between June 1999 and January 2001. At each time of sampling two sites were selected randomly at each of two tidal heights to represent midshore and lowshore assemblages on each shore. Estimates of abundance Were obtained using non-destructive sampling methods from five replicate 20x20 cm quadrats at each site. Results indicated differences among habitats in structure of assemblages, in mean abundance of common taxa and in univariate and multivariate measures of spatial variation at the scale of shores. Most of these patterns were inconsistent with the predicted effect of management through MPAs. The data suggest that designation of MPAs in the Tuscan Archipelago should proceed through management of multiple shores and types of habitat selected to guarantee protection to a representative sample of assemblages and to the processes responsible for maintenance of spatial patchiness at different scales. This study also shows that considerations of spatial heterogeneity are important to underpin management decisions about the number, size and location of MPAs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In forests where large, stand-replacing disturbances are infrequent, small-scale disturbances associated with the mortality and replacement of individual trees are a primary source of heterogeneity in forest composition and structure. The disturbances considered in this study were canopy gaps created by a partial harvest in the winter of 1987-1988 in an oak-pine (Quercus-Pinus) forest that is part of a long-term ecosystem study at the Holt Research Forest in coastal Maine. This study examined the gap phase of the forest turnover cycle: the brief episodes of rapid change when processes determining the structure and composition of a forest community occur. The objective was to evaluate the effects of harvest-created gaps and soil moisture (as reflected by soil drainage classes) on woody and herbaceous species diversity, composition, and abundance relative to unharvested control areas. Because the vegetation was sampled in both 1993 and 1998, detection of short-term changes was possible.
   Harvest gaps had higher total plant species richness in the understory (vegetation <1 m tall) than controls, primarily due to more infrequently-occurring species. Average species richness varied by soil drainage class but not treatment, whereas the Shannon-Wiener diversity index was not affected by treatment, drainage class, or time. Species abundance was more evenly distributed (i.e., higher evenness) in controls than in gaps. Species unique to harvest gaps decreased in number and abundance over time. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) revealed that harvest gaps exhibited greater variability in species composition than controls, although many of the gaps and controls were similar in composition. Shifts in individual species abundance were evident with treatment, drainage, and time.
   Diversity measures calculated for sapling density showed a significant difference among drainage classes for species richness, but no significant difference between treatments for species richness, the Shannon-Wiener index, or the evenness index. Gap size was positively correlated with the total density of saplings, the density of several species, and species richness. There were significant differences between treatments for the density of all species tested in at least one of the four height classes. DCA of sapling data revealed some separation of harvest gaps and controls but there was considerable overlap. Axis I tended to separate early successional species in the harvest gaps from shade tolerant species in the controls. The understory plant community at the HRF appears to be resilient to the partial harvest that created a variety of gap sizes. Silvicultural objectives were met; the harvest gaps created sites for establishment of seedlings and sprouts of tree species, particularly early successional species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Larval statoliths of the temperate neogastropod Concholepas concholepas (Bruguiere, 1789) appear to have great utility for reconstructing larval dispersal history. Hatching marks on the statoliths seem to demarcate the natal core of recent recruits. Analysis of individual larval statoliths by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) indicates detectable levels of multiple trace elements. Differences in Ba/Ca, Zn/Ca, and Pb/Ca in the larval core of C. concholepas statoliths from 3 geographically separated sites in Chile suggest these mineralized hard parts could function as natural tags of natal origin and hence be useful in ecological studies of larval dispersal pathways.

AB A comparison of fossil (Echinolampas sp. from the Lower Miocene Zogelsdorf Formation, Austria) and Recent (Schizaster canaliferus from the northern Adriatic Sea) irregular sea-urchin tests shows that, upon their death, burrowing echinoids can serve as a substrate for a dense epigrowth. Size, shape, stable orientation, and surface residence-time were identified as key factors governing encrustation. The encrusters on fossil Echinolampas were bryozoans, serpulid polychaetes, barnacles, and coralline algae, while the recent material was initially encrusted by serpulids and hydrozoan colonies, and ultimately covered by the lull range of sessile, hemi-sessile, and vagile species characterizing the benthic community in the Adriatic. In Echinolampas, epigrowth was more abundant on the lower (oral) surface; this specific distribution was echoed in S. canaliferus, where epigrowth started on the bottom side and grew upward. This indicates that the tests have a stable orientation and a surface residence-time long enough to allow intense encrustation. A taphonomic model is developed, and the role of encrustation on such special substrates for overall community structure is discussed. The Recent/fossil comparison provides new insights for both fields of study: the recent material indicates the role of soft-bodied faunas as well as the complexity of small-scaled ecological processes; the fossil material reflects many of the above phenomena and adds important taphonomic details on the fate of encrusted biogenic structures and on encruster growth patterns and distributions.

AB Typically seed rain density decreases as a function of distance from the parent plant. Most models of recruitment assume a seed (and a seedling) mortality function monotonically decreasing with distance from the parent (hence, positively density-dependent). This results in either higher recruitment at a distance from the parent (Janzen-Connell model) or near it (Hubbell model), or else a spatially uniform recruitment (exact compensation model), depending upon the specific shape of the mortality function in relation to distance from the parent. However, mortality may increase with distance from the parent (negatively density-dependent) or be spatially uniform, both of those scenarios resulting in a recruitment similar to that predicted by the Hubbell model. Recruitment may also be unpredictable on the sale basis of the parent plant position if mortality is spatially variable and density-independent. For several tree species in a homogeneous cold temperate forest (Houle, 1992a), recruitment could not be predicted from seed rain spatial patterns. Seeds and seedlings were contagiously distributed and mortality, at both stages, was spatially variable and density-independent. In a similar forest type (present study), in which two species were segregated along a topographical gradient, recruitment of each species was higher where respective seed rain abundance was higher. Al this study site, also mortality, for both seeds and first-year seedlings was not density-dependent, with the result that clumping at the seedling level and positive relationship between seed min and recruitment were maintained through time. A chain of events from seed dispersal through seedling establishment and subsequent survival controls recruitment. Simple models tend to mask the complexity of the processes involved between dispersal and recruitment.

AB Seasonal and spatial patterns of seed dissemination ofthe canopy tree Cornus controversa were studied over two fruiting seasons in a temperate deciduous forest in Japan. Seedfall was monitored every 2 wk in seed traps (N = 221) distributed over a 1-ha study plot that included 12 mature Cornus. Estimated annual seed production was 1.57 x 10(6) seeds/ha. In both years, the peak of fruit ripening had already ended before migratory frugivorous birds entered the area and only 17% ofthe seeds were disseminated by birds. Directly fallen seeds were deposited close to the parent trees (usually within 10 m, infrequently as far as 35 m from parent trees). In contrast, bird-disseminated seeds showed a markedly scattered distribution; the birds deposited more than half of the seeds they ate > 5 m from the crown edge, and density of bird-disseminated seeds exceeded that of directly fallen seeds at distances > 15 m, with some found > 40 m from the nearest mature Cornus. In addition, birds seemed to selectively eat fruits that contained viable seeds. The density of bird-disseminated seed decreased significantly with increasing distance from fruiting trees, both conspecific and heterospecific. Distance to the nearest edge of canopy gaps that were several years old had little effect on the spatial pattern of bird-disseminated seeds. This means that seeds of C. controversa were not directionally dispersed into canopy gaps by birds.

AB Deforestation and land use change are among the most pressing anthropogenic environmental impacts. In Brazil, a resurgence of malaria in recent decades paralleled rapid deforestation and settlement in the Amazon basin, yet evidence of a deforestation-driven increase in malaria remains equivocal. We hypothesize an underlying cause of this ambiguity is that deforestation and malaria influence each other in bidirectional causal relationships-deforestation increases malaria through ecological mechanisms and malaria reduces deforestation through socioeconomic mechanisms-and that the strength of these relationships depends on the stage of land use transformation. We test these hypotheses with a large geospatial dataset encompassing 795 municipalities across 13 y (2003 to 2015) and show deforestation has a strong positive effect on malaria incidence. Our results suggest a 10% increase in deforestation leads to a 3.3% increase in malaria incidence (similar to 9,980 additional cases associated with 1,567 additional km(2) lost in 2008, the study midpoint, Amazon-wide). The effect is larger in the interior and absent in outer Amazonian states where little forest remains. However, this strong effect is only detectable after controlling for a feedback of malaria burden on forest loss, whereby increased malaria burden significantly reduces forest clearing, possibly mediated by human behavior or economic development. We estimate a 1% increase in malaria incidence results in a 1.4% decrease in forest area cleared (similar to 219 fewer km(2) cleared associated with 3,024 additional cases in 2008). This bidirectional socioecological feedback between deforestation and malaria, which attenuates as land use intensifies, illustrates the intimate ties between environmental change and human health.

AB Conspecific negative density dependence is thought to maintain diversity by limiting abundances of common species. Yet the extent to which this mechanism can explain patterns of species diversity across environmental gradients is largely unknown. We examined density-dependent recruitment of seedlings and saplings and changes in local species diversity across a soil-resource gradient for 38 woody-plant species in a temperate forest. At both life stages, the strength of negative density dependence increased with resource availability, becoming relatively stronger for rare species during seedling recruitment, but stronger for common species during sapling recruitment. Moreover, negative density dependence appeared to reduce diversity when stronger for rare than common species, but increase diversity when stronger for common species. Our results suggest that negative density dependence is stronger in resource-rich environments and can either decrease or maintain diversity depending on its relative strength among common and rare species.

AB Coastal defence structures are proliferating to counter rising and stormier seas. With increasing concern about the ecological value of built environments, efforts are being made to create novel habitat to increase biodiversity. Rock pools are infrequent on artificial structures. We compared biodiversity patterns between rock pools and emergent rock and assessed the role of pool depth and substratum incline in determining patterns of biodiversity. Rock pools were more taxon rich than emergent substrata. Patterns varied with depth and incline with algal groups being more positively associated with shallow than deeper habitats. Substratum incline had little influence on colonising epibiota, with the exception of canopy algae in deeper habitats where vertical surfaces supported greater taxon richness than horizontal surfaces. The creation of artificial rock pools in built environments will have a positive effect on biodiversity. Building pools of varying depths and inclines and shore heights will provide a range of habitats, increase environmental heterogeneity, therefore creating more possible ecological niches, promoting local biodiversity.

AB Questions
   Niche differentiation is a central explanation for the co-existence and distribution patterns of numerous tree species in tropical forests, but functional equivalence leading to neutral dynamics has been proposed as an alternative explanation. This niche vs neutral debate is fuelled by the highly variable results yielded by studies of the association between tree species distributions and environmental factors, where some studies find strong associations but others do not. Here, we ask how differences in sampling scale between studies contribute to this variation.
   Location
   Barro Colorado Island, Panama.
   Methods
   Using distribution maps of canopy-statured individuals, we evaluated patterns of habitat association in five tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island across a wide range of sampling scales (from 50 to 1600ha). We investigated the scale-dependency of species clumping patterns (Ripley's K) and the association of species distributions with important environmental variables (forest age, topography and geological formation) using point pattern analyses.
   Results
   Clump size and clump density had high variances within and among spatial scales. Significant habitat associations were found in all five species, with the number of habitat associations generally increasing with the sampling scale. Ignoring dispersal constraints inflated the number of significant habitat associations.
   Conclusions
   We found that patterns of habitat association (and hence conclusions on the importance of niche vs neutral processes) are strongly affected by the choice of sampling scale and location. Explicit inclusion of the effect of spatial scale is critical for studies of habitat association and the main processes that structure communities of tropical trees.

AB The objective of this study was to quantify forest cover changes in three watersheds (Gilgel Abbay (1,646 km(2)), Birr (980 km(2)), and Upper-Didesa (1,980 km(2)) of the Blue Nile Basin between 1957 and 2001. Four land cover maps were produced for each watershed for 1957/1958, 1975, 1986, and 2000/2001. Nine different types of land cover were identified, five of which were forest cover classes. Between 1957 and 2001, the total forest cover increased in Gilgel Abbay (from 10 to 22 % cover) and decreased in Birr (from 29 to 22 % cover) as well as in Upper-Didesa (from 89 to 45 % cover). The increase in Gilgel Abbay was primarily due to the expansion of eucalyptus plantations. Natural forest cover decreased in all three watersheds. Wooded grassland decreased by two-thirds, dry/moist mixed forests decreased by half, and riverine forests had disappeared by 1975 in Gilgel Abbay and Birr. Major deforestation had already taken place in the northern watersheds, Gilgel Abbay and Birr, before the 1960s and 1970s, while in the southern watershed, Upper-Didesa, much of the deforestation occurred after 1975. The southern watershed still remained by far the most forested watershed in 2001 despite the strong ongoing deforestation. The changes in forest cover could affect natural resource management, greenhouse gas emissions, water resources, and agricultural production including coffee production. The patterns of change are different in the three watersheds. We therefore recommend further studies of the local conditions and drivers of change as the basis for designing effective policy to halt further loss of natural forest, which offers a wealth of ecosystem services.

AB It is essential to understand how ecological restoration (ER) improves human well-being in order to justify more investments and upscaling in this emergent field of action. As part of a 22-year-old, 80ha ER project being carried out around a water reservoir that supplies drinking water to the city of Iracemapolis (population 19,700), in the mega-diversity Atlantic Forest biome of Brazil, we assessed local community perceptions of the tangible and intangible benefits expected to arise from this project. A detailed questionnaire was completed for 292 members of the local community to gauge perceptions of benefits arising from various cultural and provisioning ecosystem services (ESs; especially safe and clean drinking water) provided by the 80ha forest restoration project. A striking 94% of those interviewed wanted more ER projects in their community. Participants reported an appreciation for cultural ESs such as esthetic landscape improvement, tourism, recreation, as well as various religious, spiritual, and educational services. In addition, 87% of interviewees believed that the restoration project improved the quality of their drinking water, and 63% said they would agree to an increase in water tariffs if the proceeds were to be invested in more forest restoration. Judging from this study, investigation and subsequent communication of popular perceptions of the various benefits of ER projects could promote consensus-building and support for projects among stakeholders, and inform governmental and societal investments in restoration.

AB Seedling dynamics play a crucial role in determining species distributions and coexistence. Exploring causes of variation in seedling dynamics can therefore provide key insights into the factors affecting these phenomena. We examined the relative importance of biotic neighborhood processes and habitat heterogeneity using survival data for 5,827 seedlings in 39 tree and shrub species over 2 years from an old-growth temperate forest in northeastern China. We found significant negative density-dependence effects on survival of tree seedlings, and limited effects of habitat heterogeneity (edaphic and topographic variables) on survival of shrub seedlings. The importance of negative density dependence on young tree seedling survival was replaced by habitat in tree seedlings a parts per thousand yen4 years old. As expected, negative density dependence was more apparent in gravity-dispersed species compared to wind-dispersed and animal-dispersed species. Moreover, we found that a community compensatory trend existed for trees. Therefore, although negative density dependence was not as pervasive as in other forest communities, it is an important mechanism for the maintenance of community diversity in this temperate forest. We conclude that both negative density dependence and habitat heterogeneity drive seedling survival, but their relative importance varies with seedling age classes and species traits.

AB To investigate the ability of pioneer and late-successional species to adapt to a strong light environment in a reforestation area, we examined the activities of antioxidant enzymes in relation to photosystem chlorophyll a fluorescence and photosynthetic pigment concentration for eight tropical tree species grown under 100% (sun) and 10% (shade) sunlight irradiation. The pioneer (early-succession) species (PS) were Cecropia pachystachya, Croton urucurana, Croton floribundus and Schinus terebinthifolius. The non-pioneer (late succession) species (LS) were Hymenaea courbaril L var. stilbocarpa, Esenbeckia leiocarpa, Cariniana legalis and Tabebuia roseo-alba. We observed a greater decline in the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll a fluorescence (F-v/F-m) under full sunlight irradiation in the late-successional species than in the pioneer species. The LS species most sensitive to high irradiance were C. legalis and H. courbaril. In LS species, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll concentrations were higher in the shade-grown plants than in plants that developed under full sunlight, but in the PS species C. floribundus and C. pachystachya, we did not observe significant changes in chlorophyll content when grown in the two contrasting environments. The carotenoids/total chlorophyll ratio increased significantly when plants developed under high-sunlight irradiation, but this response was not observed in the PS species S. terebinthifolius and C. pachystachya. The improved performance of the pioneer species in high sunlight was accompanied by an increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD. EC 1.15.1.1) activity, though no light-dependent increase in the activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX. EC 1.11.1.11) was observed. The activity of catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) was reduced by high irradiation in both pioneer and late-successional species. Our results show that pioneer species perform better under high-sunlight irradiation than late-successional species, as indicated by increased SOD activity and a higher F IF,, ratio. C. legalis was the LS species most susceptible to photoinhibition under full sunlight conditions. These results suggest that pioneer plants have more potential tolerance to photo-oxidative damage than late-successional species associated with the higher SOD activity found in pioneer species. Reduced photoinhibition in pioneer species probably results from their higher photosynthetic capacities, as has been observed in a previous survey carried out by our group. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Fine-scale height-growth response of boreal trees to canopy openings is difficult to measure from the ground, and there are important limitations in using stereo-photogrammetry in defining gaps and determining individual crowns and height. However, precise knowledge on height growth response to different openings is critical for refining partial harvesting techniques. In this study, we question whether conifers and hardwoods respond equally in terms of sapling growth or lateral growth to openings. We also ask to what distance gaps affect tree growth into the forest. We use multi-temporal lidar to characterize tree/sapling height and lateral growth responses over five years to canopy openings and high resolution images to identify conifers and hardwoods. Species-class-wise height-growth patterns of trees/saplings in various neighborhood contexts were determined across a 6-km(2) matrix of Canadian boreal mixed deciduous coniferous forests. We then use statistical techniques to probe how these growth responses vary by spatial location with respect to the gap edge. Results confirm that both mechanisms of gap closure contribute to the closing of canopies at a rate of 1.2% per annum. Evidence also shows that both hardwood and conifer gap edge trees have a similar lateral growth ( average of 22 cm/yr) and similar rates of height growth irrespective of their location and initial height. Height growth of all saplings, however, was strongly dependent on their position within the gap and the size of the gap. Results suggest that hardwood and softwood saplings in gaps have greatest growth rates at distances of 0.5-2 m and 1.5-4 m from the gap edge and in openings smaller than 800 m 2 and 250 m 2, respectively. Gap effects on the height growth of trees in the intact forest were evident up to 30 m and 20 m from gap edges for hardwood and softwood overstory trees, respectively. Our results thus suggest that foresters should consider silvicultural techniques that create many small openings in mixed coniferous deciduous boreal forests to maximize the growth response of both residual and regenerating trees.

AB Aim
   (1) To resolve theoretical debates regarding the role of environment versus dispersal limitation, the conservatism of niches across distances and the prevalence of environmental specialists in diatom communities. (2) To provide guidance on the use of diatom communities and other microbial analogues to analyse ecological response to environmental change.
   Location
   Eight hundred and ninety-one lakes in five regional datasets from north-western Europe and four regional datasets from north-eastern North America.
   Methods
   Lacustrine diatom communities were analysed at three scales: inter-continental, intra-continental and regional. Nested partial redundancy analyses (RDAs) were used to determine spatial versus environmental components of community variation. Weighted-averaging (WA) regression and calibration, as well as logistic and quadratic regressions, were used to detect niche conservatism and the prevalence of environmental specialists.
   Results
   Community patterns indicate that dispersal limitation acts predominantly at the inter-continental scale, while at the regional (less than c. 1,000,000 km2) scale, a single environmental variable (pH) explains more than five times the community variation as spatial (dispersal-related) variables. In addition, pH niche components appear to be conserved at the inter-continental scale, and environmental specialization does not impose relative rarity, as specialists apparently readily disperse to suitable environments.
   Main conclusions
   Analysis at multiple scales is clearly important in determining the influences of community variation. For diatom communities, dispersal limitation acts most strongly at the broadest scales, giving way to environment at the scales considered by most analyses. The availability of a wide variety of propagules with consistent niches across regions indicates that diatom communities reflect the succession of taxa according to local environmental conditions, rather than disequilibrium with the environment or adaptation of local populations. While multi-scale analyses must be undertaken for other groups to resolve debates over community drivers and determine appropriate scales for prediction, for diatoms (and probably other microbial communities), responses to environmental change can be inferred using analogue datasets from large geographic areas.

AB P>1. The future of tropical forest species depends in part on their ability to survive in human-modified landscapes. Forest strips present a priority area for biodiversity research because they are a common feature of many managed landscapes, are often afforded a high level of legal protection, and can provide a cost-effective and politically acceptable conservation strategy.
   2. Despite the potential conservation benefits that could be provided by forest strips, ecologists currently lack sufficient evidence to inform policy and guide their design and management.
   3. We used a quasi-experimental landscape in the Brazilian Amazon to test the importance of four management-relevant variables (forest type, isolation distance, forest structure, and large mammal activity) on the potential biodiversity conservation value of narrow forest strips for dung beetles.
   4. Information-theoretic model selection based on AICc revealed strong support for the influence of large mammal activity and forest type on dung beetle abundance; isolation distance on species richness; and forest structure on the relative abundance of matrix-tolerant species. Multi-dimensional scaling showed a strong influence of forest type and isolation on community composition and structure, with riparian and dry-land strips having complementary sets of species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. To enhance the conservation value and ecological integrity of forest strips in human-modified landscapes we recommend that strip design considers both isolation distance and whether or not the strips encompass perennial streams. In addition, we identify the maintenance of forest structure and the protection of large mammal populations as being crucially important for conserving forest dung beetle communities.

AB We document for the first time the epiphytic composition and biomass of canopy emergent trees from temperate, old-growth coastal rainforests of Chile (42 degrees 30'S). Through tree-climbing techniques, we accessed the crown of two large (c. 1 m trunk diameter, 25-30 m tall) individuals of Eucryphia cordifolia (Cunoniaceae) and one large Aextoxicon punctatum (Aextoxicaceae) to sample all epiphytes from the base to the treetop. Epiphytes, with the exception of the hemi-epiphytic tree Raukaua laetevirens (Araliaceae), were removed, weighed and subsamples dried to estimate total dry mass. We recorded 22 species of vascular epiphytes, and 22 genera of cryptogams, with at least 30 species of bryophytes, liverworts and lichens. The dominant vascular epiphytes were Fascicularia bicolor (Bromeliaceae), Raukaua laetevirens, Sarmienta repens (Gesneriaceae), and filmy ferns (Hymenophyllaceae). Epiphyte loads per tree ranged between 134 and 144 kg dry mass, with 60-70% water. The hemi-epiphytic tree R. laetevirens added between 1 and 2.6 t of dry mass to each host tree. A main component of epiphyte biomass, making 70% of the weight, was detritus and roots, while leaves, stems, and fronds made up the remaining 30%. Emergent trees hold a high proportion of the regional diversity of epiphytes: 33% of all flowering epiphytes, and 50% of all filmy ferns described for Chilean temperate forests. Dry epiphyte biomass associated only with the emergent E. cordifolia trees in coastal forests was estimated in 10 t/ha. Epiphyte biomass may store up to 3001 of water in each emergent tree, and add 40-150% of photosynthetic biomass to the tree crowns. Based on this evidence, epiphytes may play key but generally neglected roles in ecosystem carbon uptake, water storage, and nutrient cycling. Moreover, emergent trees represent nuclei of biodiversity and ecosystem functions distributed throughout mature forests. Forest management should recognize large trees as significant management units for the preservation of biodiversity and ecological functions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Various management plans have been developed to mitigate the effects of human activities on threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations. Most plans do not account for the behavior of wolves (Canis lupus), their main predator. The success of caribou recovery plans may nonetheless depend on how landscape management shapes wolf-caribou interactions. We evaluated the species-specific responses of caribou and wolves to a management plan in Qu,bec, and assessed its impact on the probability of wolf-caribou co-occurrence. Landscape management consisted of the protection of large forest blocks, and the spatial aggregation of cutblocks. Based on telemetry data, we modeled animal-habitat spatial relationships with resource selection functions, and then estimate the relative probability of wolf-caribou co-occurrence. We found that caribou selected mature conifer forests with lichen. Wolves selected mixed and deciduous stands. Caribou avoided roads and cutblocks, while wolves selected them, which resulted in a relatively low probability of co-occurrence in harvested areas. Concurrent habitat selection by the two species was such that the highest probability of wolf-caribou co-occurrence took place in protected forest blocks (PB) from December to May. For efficient mitigation measures, the location of PBs should be selected while accounting for differences in habitat selection between wolf and caribou. The blocks should include mature conifer forests with lichen, minimize the abundance of mixed and deciduous stands, and be far from roads and cutblocks. Consideration of predator behavior can improve suitability of landscape management plans for the long-term persistence of threatened prey populations under top-down control.

AB Frugivorous animals disperse the seeds of the majority of rainforest plant species and hence play a key role in the trajectory of rainforest regeneration. This study investigated whether changes in the species composition of the frugivore community in fragmented rainforest in subtropical Australia is likely to impact the dispersal of native plant species. The potential of frugivorous bird and bat species to disperse the seeds of plant species in fragmented rainforest was assessed using published dietary information together with field surveys of frugivore abundance within intact forest, forest fragments and patches of regrowth. Frugivore species with reduced abundance in fragmented rainforest were the only known dispersers of 27 of the 221 native plant species in the data set (12% of species). These frugivore species were also major dispersers of plant species producing fruits wider than 10 mm and species from the families Rubiaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Meliaceae, Lamiaceae and Vitaceae. Except for Rubiaceae, these plant taxa are also potentially dispersed by two of the frugivore species that were widespread in fragmented rainforest, Lopholaimus antarcticus and Ptilonorhynchus violaceus, although dispersal rates are likely to be lower in fragmented than in extensive rainforest. Consistent with other regions, large-seeded plants are susceptible to reduced dispersal in fragmented rainforest in subtropical Australia. However, we predict a smaller deficit in seed dispersal in fragmented forests than has been reported from other regions, due to factors such as functional overlap among frugivore species, the ability of many Australian rainforest vertebrates to persist in fragmented rainforest, and a lack of hunting in these forests. Nevertheless, rainforest fragmentation has reduced the abundance of a suite of frugivorous rainforest fauna, which in turn is likely to reduce the dispersal of a certain plant taxa and may alter patterns of plant regeneration in subtropical Australian rainforest fragments.

AB A fundamental property of all forest landscapes is the size frequency distribution of canopy gap disturbances. But characterizing forest structure and changes at large spatial scales has been challenging and most of our understanding is from permanent inventory plots. Here we report the first application of light detection and ranging remote sensing to measurements of canopy disturbance and regeneration in an old-growth tropical rain forest landscape. Pervasive local height changes figure prominently in the dynamics of this forest. Although most canopy gaps recruited to higher positions during 8.5 years, size frequency distributions were similar at two points in time and well-predicted by power-laws. At larger spatial scales (hundreds of ha), height increases and decreases occurred with similar frequency and changes to canopy height that were analysed using a height transition matrix suggest that the distribution of canopy height at the beginning of the study was close to the projected steady-state equilibrium under the recent disturbance regime. Taken together, these findings show how widespread local height changes can produce short-term stability in a tropical rain forest landscape.

AB 1. Seed dispersal is a critical life stage of plants, yet accurate measurement of dispersal distances has been difficult in natural systems. Genetic techniques for matching dispersed seeds to maternal trees provide valuable data on dispersal events. Questions remain regarding how best to estimate the population seed dispersal distance distributions from such data and how these estimates compare with classical non-genetic estimates based on seed trap data alone.

Using simulated data, we compared seed shadow estimates obtained via standard inverse modelling of seed arrival into seed traps within mapped stands (summed seed shadow, SSS) with estimates from four models using genetic matches: direct fitting of the observed distribution of distances in the genotyped sample (observed distance, OBS), direct fitting inversely weighted by sampling intensity (OBSw), inverse modelling of numbers of seeds of each genotype in each trap (gene shadow model, GSM), and inverse modelling of frequencies of each genotype in each trap (competing sources model, CSM). We further explored how consideration of immigrant seed rain from unmapped and ungenotyped trees outside the stand affected dispersal estimates, denoting these variants SSSi, GSMi and CSMi.
   3. We applied these models to an empirical data set for the Neotropical tree Jacaranda copaia, using a hierarchical Bayesian model to incorporate variation in fecundity among trees.
   4. Fits to simulated data sets showed that OBS and SSS estimates were strongly biased, while SSSi, GSMi and CSMi were mildly biased. Root mean square errors varied as OBS >> SSS > OBSw > CSMi > GSMi > SSi > CSM > GSM.
   5. Comparing results for Jacaranda under the three best models, mean posterior estimates of dispersal distances varied as SSSi < GSM < CSM, but credible intervals overlapped among all three models, demonstrating agreement that long-distance dispersal is common.
   6. Synthesis. Here we reconcile two general approaches used to study seed dispersal distances in natural communities. Genetic and non-genetic approaches can both provide good estimates of seed dispersal provided that analyses of genetic data take account of any deviation from random selection of seeds for genotyping, and that SSS models consider immigrant seed rain in the analysis whenever there is reason to think its contribution is non-zero. The use of the models presented here should provide better estimates of population-level dispersal distance distributions in genetic and classical seed dispersal studies.

AB Herbicide applications have greatly reduced plant cover, and increased soil erosion on a new orange orchard planted on valley slopes in eastern Spain. This has increased the importance of soil fauna, such as ants, in regulating soil erosion processes. Ants increase water infiltration rates by forming soil macropores during nest construction, but new soil brought to the surface by ant activity could increase the sediments available for erosion. Simulated rainfall experiments were conducted on 20 paired plots (20 with ant activity and 20 controls) to study the impact of ants on surface water flow and sediment movement in an intensively managed orange orchard near Valencia, Spain. Simulated rainfall was applied to each plot at a rate of 55 mm/h on a 0.25 m(2) area for 1 h. We found a reduction of soil bulk density, an increase in soil organic matter, and an increase in macropore flow in ant-affected soils, as compared to soil without ant activity. These ant-induced soil changes increased water infiltration rates and runoff discharge. However, the fresh, unconsolidated soil brought to the surface during nest construction resulted in greater soil loss on two plots than their ant-free controls. Ants can be an important factor in soil erosion processes when surface vegetation is removed by intensive herbicide use.

AB In this study, we used a recently developed supertrees method to test for shared phylogeographical signal in partially overlapping geographical ranges of lizards of the genus Liolaemus from the Andean Range in south-central Chile. We reconstruct mtDNA gene trees for three partially codistributed species (Liolaemus tenuis, L. lemniscatus and L. pictus), and our sampling effort is sufficient to allow statistical tests of shared signal between the combinations L. tenuis-L. pictus, and L. tenuis-L. lemniscatus. For both combinations, standardized maximum agreement subtrees scores showed statistically significant signal for shared pattern in regions of overlap, as evaluated by randomization tests (P < 0.001 and < 0.05, respectively). The matrix representation with parsimony tree obtained from the combination of the three different gene trees revealed concordant phylogeographical associations of all species, and was consistent with the geographical association of intraspecific haploclades with three Chilean bioclimatic zones. A multidimensional scaling analysis of several climate variables showed highly significant differences among these zones, which further suggests that they may have contributed to similar patterns of intraspecific divergence across all three species. In the mesomorphic zone in Central Chile, the species L. tenuis and L. lemniscatus may have codiverged in response to shared orogenic vicariant events, which likely predominated over climatic events associated with cycles of glacial advance and retreat. In the hygromorphic zone in southern Chile, however, glacial cycles likely predominated in structuring the phylogeographical histories of L. tenuis and L. pictus, although important ecological differences between these two caution against broad generalizations at this point.

AB Using 15 shade coffee farms and two forest reserves located in central Veracruz, Mexico, we evaluated how tree vegetation structure and richness changed as a function of management type and compared to that remnant forest fragments. Coffee farms were classified as shade monocultures (SMs), simple polycultures (SPs), or diverse polycultures (DPs). A total of 124 sampling units representing 15.19 ha were randomly located in farms with the number of sampling units varying as a function of farm area. Twenty additional plots were sampled in two nearby cloud forest fragments. Forest vegetation structure was higher than in farms, except for mean canopy height that was similar to that in SP and DP farms. Within farms, tree density was generally higher in SM, whereas basal area and both mean and maximum height were higher in SP and DP sites. We recorded 2833 individuals representing 107 tree species >= 5 cm dbh in coffee farms, including 24 non-native species, and 83 native species (33 primary, and 50 secondary tree species). Patterns of richness followed the expected pattern with 11 +/- 1.4 (S.E.) tree species in SM farms, 14 +/- 1.8 in SP farms, 29 +/- 2.3 in DP farms, and 38 +/- 16 in forest control sites; however, rarefaction strongly suggests that DP sites are actually richer in species than the forests studied. The proportion of native tree species in each coffee management type was consistently elevated (78%). Since the majority of species (71%) were rare and found only in one or two farms, complementarity among types of coffee management (68-77%), and coffee managements and forest (90-92%) was very high. SP and DP farms had the highest proportions of animal-dispersed species and were similar to forest. Species richness was positively correlated with tree density for DP, and to basal area for SM farms. Our results suggest that shade diversity is actively managed by coffee farmers and that all three types of coffee management studied may have an important role to play in the conservation of regional biodiversity. Considering factors such as complementarity, landscape heterogeneity, functional diversity, and the rigor of vegetation surveys may also help improve the validity, and thus the impact, of coffee certification programs designed with the goal of conserving tropical montane biodiversity.

AB The shapes of landscapes are fundamental to ecosystem processes at various spatial scales. Topographic roughness index (TRI) is a measure of variability in the landscape surface and a proxy of the potential of disturbances to propagate across the earth's surface, such as a wildland fire burning across a landscape. We describe the significance of TRI, present methods for calculation, and demonstrate the utility of the index in a fire frequency prediction model. The model was used to show how the relationships between topography, fire, and humans changed during the period of AD 1620-1850 for a study area (5180 km 2) in Missouri, USA. The model predicted historic mean fire return intervals from TRI and two human population variables. The model explained 46% of the variation in mean fire return intervals and demonstrated that topographic roughness was most important in controlling fire frequency during the period AD 1620-1780 when human population density was lowest (<0.35 humans/km(2)). Due to increases in human population, mean fire return intervals were shortened by LIP to one-fourth of their original length and the landscape became more homogeneous with respect to fire frequency despite topographic roughness. The use of TRIs in wildland fire research aid in quantifying and visualizing topographic variability and could be applicable to multiple scales and ecosystem processes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ants are key indicators of ecological change, but few studies have investigated how ant assemblages respond to dramatic changes in vegetation structure in temperate forests. Pests and pathogens are causing widespread loss of dominant canopy tree species; ant species composition and abundance may be very sensitive to such losses. Before the experimental removal of red oak trees to simulate effects of sudden oak death and examine the long-term impact of oak loss at the Black Rock Forest (Cornwall, NY), we carried out a rapid assessment of the ant assemblage in a 10-ba experimental area. We also determined the efficacy in a northern temperate forest of five different collecting methods-pitfall traps, litter samples, tuna fish and cookie baits, and hand collection-routinely used to sample ants in tropical systems. A total of 33 species in 14 genera were collected and identified; the myrmecines, Aphaenogaster rudis and Myrmica punctiventtis, and the formicine Formica neogagates were the most common and abundant species encountered. Ninety-four percent (31 of 33) of the species were collected by litter sampling and structured hand sampling together, and we conclude that, in combination, these two methods are sufficient to assess species richness and composition of ant assemblages in northern temperate forests. Using new, unbiased estimators, we project that 38 -58 ant species are likely to occur at Black Rock Forest. Loss of oak from these forests may favor Camponotus species that nest in decomposing wood and open habitat specialists in the genus Lasius.

AB This paper addresses the effects of habitat fragmentation on the phyllostomid bats of the Atlantic rain forest in Brazil. by comparing community structure (species richness and capture frequency) and the frequency of three bat species sampled along 36 transects encompassing six habitat categories: interiors and edges of large (> 7.000 ha) and small fragments (< 100 ha), and the surrounding matrix of second-growth forests and areas of shade cocoa plantation. Species composition. richness and total captures were not directly affected by forest size per se, although the frequency of one dominant forest species (Artibeus obscures) was significantly lower in small fragments compared with larger ones. The high connectivity among forest patches in the study area and the ability of some species to use the surrounding matrix of secondary forests and shade cocoa plantations possibly precludes the insularization effect. Qualitative habitat changes induced by fragmentation, such as edge formation and forest regrowth affected bat community structure; both modified habitats comprised a limited subset of the species assemblage found in the interiors of mature forests. The results presented here provide evidence of impoverished bat assemblages in man-modified habitats linked with deforestation and overall disturbances related with forest fragmentation.

AB The production of reactive nitrogen worldwide has more than doubled in the last century because of human activities and population growth. Advances in our understanding of the nitrogen cycle and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on regional to global scales is largely hindered by the paucity of information about nitrogen inputs from human activities in fast-developing regions of the world such as the tropics. In this paper, we estimate nitrogen inputs and outputs in Brazil, which is the world's largest tropical country. We determined that the N cycle is increasingly controlled by human activities rather than natural processes. Nitrogen inputs to Brazil from human activities practically doubled from 1995 to 2002, mostly because of nitrogen production through biological fixation in agricultural systems. This is in contrast to industrialized countries of the temperate zone, where fertilizer application and atmospheric deposition are the main sources of anthropogenic nitrogen. In Brazil, the production of soybean crops over an area of less than 20 million ha, was responsible for about 3.2 Tg N or close to one-third of the N inputs from anthropogenic sources in 2002. Moreover, cattle pastures account for almost 70% of the estimated 280 x 10 6 ha of agricultural land in Brazil and potentially fix significant amounts of N when well managed, further increasing the importance of biological nitrogen fixation in the nitrogen budget. Much of these anthropogenic inputs occur in the Brazilian savannah region (Cerrado), while more urbanized regions such as the state of Sao Paulo also have high rates of nitrogenous fertilizer inputs. In the Amazon, rates of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs are relatively low, but continuing conversion of natural forests into cattle pasture or secondary forests potentially add a significant amount of new nitrogen to Brazil given the vast area of the region. Better measurements of biological fixation rates in Brazil are necessary for improving the nitrogen budgets, especially at a more refined spatial scale.

AB In addition to human-caused changes in the environment, natural stochasticity may threaten species persistence, and its impact must be taken into account when priorities are established and management plans are designed. Borderea chouardii is a Tertiary relict at risk of extinction that occurs in only one location in the world, where the probability of human disturbance is low. Its persistence, therefore, is mainly linked to its response to natural threats such as stochasticity. Over 8 years I monitored up to 25% of this rupicolous small geophyte. The population had an unbalanced size structure and 90% failure in seed arrival at appropriate microhabitats, which suggests a problem with recruitment. I used matrix models to describe its population dynamics, conducted hand sowings, and performed stochastic simulations to investigate the effect of environmental stochasticity on population trend and viability. I modeled several scenarios to represent a variety of ecological situations, such as population reduction, episodic or persistent disease, and enhancement or decrease of recruitment. Population growth rate (lambda) was never significantly different from unity over the study period. The risk of extinction was null over the next five centuries under current conditions. Increase of mortality and decrease of recruitment reduced stochastic population growth rate, but no factor except a persistent increase of 10% mortality resulted in extinction. These results are the consequence of the plant's extremely long life span (over 300 years) and low temporal variability of key vital rates. Even though hand sowing significantly increased the stochastic population growth rate, other approaches may be more important for the persistence of this species. The extremely slow capacity for recovery following disturbances renders habitat preservation essential. In addition, the founding of new populations would reduce the risk associated with habitat destruction.

AB 1. Tower-based eddy covariance measurements were used to quantify the effect of fire on subsequent carbon dioxide fluxes and water and surface energy balance characteristics for campo sujo savanna located near Brasilia in Central Brazil (15degrees56' S, 47degrees51' W). Campo sujo is a xeromorphic, open shrub savanna with very scattered but definitely visible shrubs and tree-like shrub elements. We studied two areas, one exposed to a prescribed fire late in the dry season, and a second that had not been burned for the previous 4 years.
   2. The fire on 22 September 1998 consumed an estimated 26 mol C m(-2). Immediately after the fire, evapotranspiration rates decreased and the savanna became a stronger net source of CO2 to the atmosphere. This was attributed to the removal of the still slightly physiologically active grass layer and higher soil CO2 efflux rates as a consequence of elevated surface soil temperatures post-burning.
   3. On the commencement of the first rains in early October 1998, this situation was reversed, with the burned area rapidly becoming a stronger sink for CO2 and with higher evapotranspiration rates than a nearby unburned (control) area. This difference persisted throughout the wet season (until at least June 1999) and was attributable to greater physiological activity of the regrowing vegetation in the burned area. Early in the growing season, higher soil evaporation rates may also have contributed to faster water use by the previously burned area.
   4. Overall, we estimate an annual gross primary productivity for the burned area of 135 mol C m(-2) year(-1), with that for the unburned area being 106 mol C m(-2) year(-1). Estimated ecosystem respiration rates were more similar on an annual basis (96 and 82 mol C m(-2) year(-1) for the burned and unburned areas, respectively), giving rise to a substantially higher net ecosystem productivity for the previously burned area (38 vs 24 mol C m(-2) year(-1)).
   5. Stimulation of photosynthetic activity in the rapid post-fire growth phase means that the negative effects of fire on the ecosystem carbon balance were more or less neutralized after only 12 months.

AB 1. We propose the method of 'phase analysis' for studying the spatio-temporal fluctuations of animal populations, and use this method for helping identify remarkable synchronized population fluctuations that may sometimes be found over very large spatial domains.
   2. The method requires decomposing the observed time series of population fluctuations into two components-one that quantifies the changing phase of the signal, and the other that quantifies the changing amplitude.
   3. Two populations are considered to be 'phase synchronized' if there is locking or synchrony between their phase components, while their associated amplitudes may nevertheless remain largely uncorrelated.
   4. Since environmental noise often masks population synchrony, a null hypothesis approach is used to detect whether the phase variables are locked more than would be expected by chance alone.
   5. The technique is thus particularly appropriate for ecological analyses where it is often important to study evidence of weak interactions in irregular non-stationary and noisy time series. Because climatic patterns (and predicted climate changes) almost certainly influence population dynamics, the approach appears particularly relevant for analysing the potential links between climatic fluctuations and population abundance.

AB We studied size-abundance relationships in a species-rich Amazonian bird community and found that the slope of the logarithmic relationship between population density and body mass (b = -0.22) is significantly shallower than expected under Damuth's energetic equivalence rule (EER), which states that population energy use (PEU) is independent of species body mass. We used estimates of avian field metabolic rates to examine the logarithmic relationship between PEU and body mass and its variation among ecological guilds. The relationship for all species had a significantly positive slope (b = 0.46), indicating that PEU of larger species was greater than that of smaller species. Analyses of guilds revealed significant variation. The slopes of the frugivore-omnivore, insectivore, and granivore guilds were all significantly positive, with that of the frugivore-omnivore guild being the steepest. In contrast, PEU did not vary significantly with species body mass among raptors. These results were confirmed in analyses using both species values and phylogenetically independent contrasts, and the results do not support the EER in this community. The spatial distribution of resources and mechanisms of interference competition within guilds may explain why most patterns differed from the predictions of the EER. Other sources of variation, including the effects of scale, are also discussed.

AB Little is known about the demographic consequences of fragmentation for plant populations. By assessing the population structure of a common herb (Heliconia acuminata) in an experimentally fragmented landscape in the central Amazon, we tested the predictions that fragmentation could reduce population density, alter population structure, and reduce reproductive effort. Population density in continuous forest varied six-fold, some areas having high density and others low density. Population density in small fragments and on the edges of large fragments was often low, but it was within the range of densities found in continuous forest, and the difference between locations was not significant. Heliconia populations in forest fragments were skewed toward smaller demographic size classes, however. Because reproduction in H. acuminata is positively correlated with plant size, these shifts were predicted to result in fewer flowering plants in forest fragments. The proportion of the population flowering in forest fragments and continuous forest was not significantly different, although there was a trend toward proportionately greater flowering in continuous forest. For plants that did flower, per-individual reproductive success (measured as developing fruit set) was the same in forest fragments and continuous forests. Our results suggest that per-individual and population-level reproduction by understory herbs in tropical forest fragments may be resistant to the detrimental consequences of fragment isolation. Our study also highlights the need to consider how fragmentation influences aspects of population structure and demography beyond abundance and fruit production, because these alternative measures of population structure can be modified in forest fragments in subtle, unexpected ways.

AB Factors limiting tree invasion in the Inland Pampas of Argentina were studied by monitoring the establishment of four alien tree species in remnant grassland and cultivated forest stands. We tested whether disturbances facilitated tree seedling recruitment and survival once seeds of invaders were made available by hand sowing. Seed addition to grassland failed to produce seedlings of two study species, Ligustrum lucidum and Ulmus pumila, but did result in abundant recruitment of Gleditsia triacanthos and Prosopis caldenia. While emergence was sparse in intact grassland, seedling densities were significantly increased by canopy and soil disturbances. Longer-term surveys showed that only Gleditsia became successfully established in disturbed grassland. These results support the hypothesis that interference from herbaceous vegetation may play a significant role in slowing down tree invasion, whereas disturbances create microsites that can be exploited by invasive woody plants. Seed sowing in a Ligustrum forest promoted the emergence of all four study species in understorey and treefall gap conditions. Litter removal had species-specific effects on emergence and early seedling growth, but had little impact on survivorship. Seedlings emerging under the closed forest canopy died within a few months. In the treefall gap, recruits of Gleditsia and Prosopis survived the first year, but did not survive in the longer term after natural gap closure. The forest community thus appeared less susceptible to colonization by alien trees than the grassland. We conclude that tree invasion in this system is strongly limited by the availability of recruitment microsites and biotic interactions, as well as by dispersal from existing propagule sources.

AB The importance of non-harvested areas, marine protected areas, and management and exploitation areas (= harvest-controlled) as seeding areas of Concholepas concholepas (Bruguiere, 1789) larvae was quantitatively evaluated at intertidal and subtidal sites at Las Cruces, central Chile. Egg capsules of C, concholepas were sampled along both intertidal and subtidal strip-transects monthly in harvested, harvest-controlled and non-harvested areas from September 1990 to December 1993. Additionally, egg capsules of C, concholepas were sampled at subtidal sites in the 3 categories of areas during 1993 and 1994. Spawning activity of C, concholepas was consistently concentrated between February and July in both the intertidal and the subtidal zones. The total area occupied by egg capsules of C, concholepas was larger in non-harvested than in harvested areas; moreover, larger capsules were found in non-harvested areas. These differences in total surface occupied by egg capsules and their sizes have an important impact on the estimated number of C. concholepas larvae that would be released from harvested and non-harvested areas. We conclude that protected areas may play an important role in the natural replenishment of C. concholepas stocks.

AB Gibbons are one of the main frugivores in the forests of Southeast Asia, and consequently have long been considered to be good seed dispersers. This is the first study in which the primary seed shadow they create by their ranging and foraging activities is evaluated in detail. I studied two gibbon groups over 12 months in lowland dipterocarp forest in central Borneo. The gibbons dispersed up to 81% of the species they consumed and destroyed the seeds of only 12%. Fruit with elongated seeds (up to 20 mm wide) were more likely to be dispersed than round seeds. Considering that the survival rate of seeds in the forest to one year was 8%, the gibbons effectively dispersed 13 seedlings ha(-1) group(-1) year(-1). Their effect on germination was very variable, although most species did eventually germinate. Most seeds were deposited along their major ranging routes and close to or under feeding trees. Am. J.

AB We examine the influence of both local habitat and landscape variables on avian species abundance at forested study sites situated within fragmented and contiguous landscapes. The study was conducted over a six year period (1991-1996) at 10 study sites equally divided between the heavily forested Missouri Ozarks and forest fragments in central Missouri. We found greater species richness and diversity in the fragments, but there was a higher percentage of Neotropical migrants in the Ozarks. We found significant differences in the mean number of birds detected between the central Missouri fragments and the unfragmented Ozarks for 15 (63%) of 24 focal species. We used stepwise regression to determine which of 12 local vegetation variables and 4 landscape variables (forest cover, core area, edge density, and mean patch size) accounted for the greatest amount of variation in abundance for 24 bird species. Seven species (29%) were most sensitive to local vegetation variables, while 16 species (67%) responded most strongly to one of four landscape variables. Landscape variables are significant predictors of abundance for many bird species; resource managers should consider multiple measures of landscape sensitivity when making bird population management decisions.

AB The savannas (cerrado) of south-central Brazil are currently,subjected to frequent anthropogenic burning, causing widespread reduction in tree density. Increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 could reduce the impact of such frequent burning by increasing the availability of nonstructural carbohydrate, which is necessary for resprouting. We tested the hypotheses that elevated CO2 stimulates resprouting and accelerates replenishment of carbohydrate reserves. Using a factorial experiment, seedlings of a common Brazilian savanna tree, Keilmeyera,ern coriacea, were grown at 350 ppm and 700 ppm CO2 and at two nutrient levels. To simulate burning, the plants were either clipped at 15 weeks or were left unclipped. Among unclipped plants, CO2 and nutrients both stimulated growth, with no significant interaction between nutrient and CO2 effects. Among clipped plants, both CO2 and nutrients stimulated resprouting. However, there was a strong interaction between CO2 and nutrient effects, with CO2 having a significant effect only in the presence of high nutrient availability. Under elevated CO2, carbohydrate reserves remained at higher levels following clipping. Root total nonstructural carbohydrate remained above 36% in all treatments, so carbohydrate reserves did not limit regrowth. These results indicate that under elevated CO2 this species may be better able to endure the high frequency of anthropogenic burning in the Brazilian savannas.

AB The synergism between climatic change and human action has provided conditions for the occurrence of forest fires in the Amazon. We used annual mapping to reconstruct the history of fire in Brazil's state of Acre to understand the forest-fire regime over a period of 33 years (1984-2016). The bum-scar index (BSI) derived from the fractions of soil and of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic material was generated by CLASlite (c) software using Landsat-TM and OLI satellite images. The area of forest-fire scars totaled 525,130 ha in the period analyzed. This total includes forests that fire affected only once (388,350 ha), twice (59,800 ha) and three times (5727 ha). The years 2005 and 2010 represent 90% of the total area of forest fires in Acre, coinciding with severe droughts caused by the anomalous warming of the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. The most heavily impacted portion of Acre was in the eastern part of the state, which has the greatest forest fragmentation, consolidation of agricultural activity and presence of settlement projects. In 2005, the municipalities of Acrelandia, Placid de Castro and Senador Guiomard accounted for more than 50% of the forest remnants impacted by fire. Of the total extent of forest fires in Acre, 43% occurred in settlement projects administered by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and 16% in conservation units administered by the Ministry of Environment (MMA). The area of forest fires was 36 times greater in the 16 years after 2000, compared to the 16 years before 2000. The frequency of fires increased dramatically from one fire episode roughly every ten years (period from 1984 to 2004), to one fire every five years (period from 2005 to 2016). With the projections of warmer climate and advancing deforestation, the forest fires in Acre will tend be more intense and frequent.

AB Species coexistence in diverse communities likely results from multiple interacting factors. Mechanisms such as conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and varying life-history strategies related to resource partitioning are known to influence plant fitness, and thereby community composition and diversity. However, we have little understanding of how these mechanisms interact and how they vary across life stages. Here, we document the interaction between CNDD and life-history strategy, based on growth-mortality trade-offs, from seedling to adult tree for 47 species in a tropical forest. Species' life-history strategies remained consistent across stages: fast-growing species had higher mortality than slow-growing species at all stages. In contrast, mean CNDD was strongest at early life stages (i.e. seedling, sapling). Fast-growing species tended to suffer greater CNDD than slow-growing species at several, but not all life stages. Overall, our results demonstrate that coexistence mechanisms interact across multiple life stages to shape diverse tree communities.

AB Humans have long utilized resources from all forest biomes, but the most indelible anthropogenic signature has been the expanse of human populations in temperate forests. The purpose of this review is to bring into focus the diverse forests of the temperate region of the biosphere, including those of hardwood, conifer and mixed dominance, with a particular emphasis on crucial challenges for the future of these forested areas. Implicit in the term 'temperate' is that the predominant climate of these forest regions has distinct cyclic, seasonal changes involving periods of growth and dormancy. The specific temporal patterns of seasonal change, however, display an impressive variability among temperate forest regions. In addition to the more apparent current anthropogenic disturbances of temperate forests, such as forest management and conversion to agriculture, human alteration of temperate forests is actually an ancient phenomenon, going as far back as 7000 yr before present (BP). As deep-seated as these past legacies are for temperate forests, all current and future perturbations, including timber harvesting, excess nitrogen deposition, altered species' phenologies, and increasing frequency of drought and fire, must be viewed through the lens of climate change.

AB Intraspecific trait variation is widespread in nature, yet its effects on community dynamics are not well understood. Here we explore the consequences of intraspecific trait variation for coexistence in two- and multispecies competitive communities. For two species, the likelihood of coexistence is in general reduced by intraspecific variation, except when the species have almost equal trait means but different trait variances, such that one is a generalist and the other a specialist consumer. In multispecies communities, the only strong effect of non-heritable intraspecific variation is to reduce expected species richness. However, when intraspecific variation is heritable, allowing for the possibility of trait evolution, communities are much more resilient against environmental disturbance and exhibit far more predictable trait patterns. Our results are robust to varying model parameters and relaxing model assumptions.

AB 1. Long-term soil chronosequences provide natural soil fertility gradients that can be used to explore linkages between soils and plant community composition and diversity. Well-studied forested soil chronosequences have revealed that local (a) plant diversity increases with greater soil age and declining fertility, but corresponding changes in species turnover and beta (b) diversity have not been explored, particularly in extremely species-rich regions.
   2. We quantified changes in plant species diversity and community composition, and identified the edaphic drivers of these changes, along a >2-million year retrogressive dune chronosequence in the south-west Australia biodiversity hotspot.
   3. We found greater plant species diversity across all growth forms as soil development proceeded and concentrations of soil nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P), diminished to extremely low levels (surface soil total P concentrations of 6 mg P kg(-1)). Despite the high plant a diversity on older nutrient-impoverished soils, species turnover across the chronosequence was exceptionally high when all growth forms were considered (mean of 1% of species shared between the youngest and oldest soils), and there was complete turnover of woody species along the chronosequence. Such extreme species turnover across the chronosequence reflected large changes in soil chemical properties. In addition, b diversity within individual chronosequence stages increased with declining soil fertility. Shrubs remained the dominant and most speciose growth form throughout the chronosequence.
   4. Synthesis. The large increase in plant a diversity and the extreme species turnover associated with declining soil fertility highlight the central role of soil properties in driving plant community assembly during long-term ecosystem development, previously only reported from comparatively species-poor regions. Our finding that plant b diversity increased with declining soil fertility points to a novel mechanism whereby extremely low soil fertility, rather than high productivity, promotes high b diversity. These results suggest that the interaction of an exceptionally diverse plant species pool and nutrient-impoverished soils provides the basis for the maintenance of such high b diversity at extremely low soil fertility.

AB Tropical forests store vast amounts of carbon and are the most biodiverse terrestrial habitats, yet they are being converted and degraded at alarming rates. Given global shortfalls in the budgets required to prevent carbon and biodiversity loss, we need to seek solutions that simultaneously address both issues. Of particular interest are carbon-based payments under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism to also conserve biodiversity at no additional cost. One potential is for REDD+ to protect forest fragments, especially within biomes where contiguous forest cover has diminished dramatically, but we require empirical tests of the strength of any carbon and biodiversity cobenefits in such fragmented systems. Using the globally threatened Atlantic Forest landscape, we measured above- ground carbon stocks within forest fragments spanning 13 to 23 442 ha in area and with different degrees of isolation. We related these stocks to tree community structure and to the richness and abundance of endemic and IUCN Red-listed species. We found that increasing fragment size has a positive relationship with above- ground carbon stock and with abundance of IUCN Red-listed species and tree community structure. We also found negative relationships between distance from large forest block and tree community structure, endemic species richness and abundance, and IUCN Red-listed species abundance. These resulted in positive congruence between carbon stocks and Red-listed species, and the abundance and richness of endemic species, demonstrating vital cobenefits. As such, protecting forest fragments in hotspots of biodiversity, particularly larger fragments and those closest to sources, offers important carbon and biodiversity cobenefits. More generally, our results suggest that macroscale models of cobenefits under REDD+ have likely overlooked key benefits at small scales, indicating the necessity to apply models that include finer-grained assessments in fragmented landscapes rather than using averaged coarse-grained cells.

AB Simplification of natural habitats has become a major conservation challenge and there is a growing consensus that incorporating and enhancing habitat complexity is likely to be critical for future restoration efforts. Habitat complexity is often ascribed an important role in controlling species diversity, however, despite numerous empirical studies the exact mechanism(s) driving this association remains unclear. The lack of progress in untangling the relationship between complexity and diversity is partly attributable to the considerable ambiguity in the use of the term 'complexity'. Here, we offer a new framework for conceptualizing ecological complexity, an essential prerequisite for the development of analytical methods for creating and comparing habitat complexity. Our framework distinguishes between two fundamental forms of complexity: information-based complexity and systems-based complexity. Most complexity-diversity studies are concerned with informational complexity which can be measured in the field through a variety of metrics (e.g. fractal dimensions, rugosity, etc.), but these metrics cannot be used to re-construct three-dimensional complex habitats. Drawing on our operational definition of informational complexity, it is possible to design habitats with different degrees of physical complexity. We argue that the ability to determine or modify the variables of complexity precisely has the potential to open up new lines of research in diversity theory and contribute to restoration and reconciliation by enabling environmental managers to rebuild complexity in anthropogenically-simplified habitats.

AB The idea that variable fire regimes (pyrodiversity) may increase habitat heterogeneity and, consequently, increase biodiversity at the landscape level is a relatively old one. However, this idea has been recently challenged by studies showing that the biota of fire-prone ecosystems is so resilient to fire that variation in fire regime has little ecological consequences. We evaluated how communities of ants - a dominant faunal group - differ with variation in the frequency and seasonal timing of fire in Brazilian Cerrado (savanna), a global biodiversity hotspot. We compared the number and composition of ant species foraging on the ground and in trees among experimental treatments with three fire frequencies (unburned for 37years and burned every 2 or 4years for the past 16years) and three seasonal timings (early, mid and late dry season) of fire with a biennial frequency. There were no significant differences in ant species richness in trees, and there were no significant differences in the richness of ground-dwelling ants among plots burned at different times of the dry season. However, unburned plots had fewer ground-dwelling ant species than those burned at 2 or 4year intervals. We detected marked differences in species composition across regimes varying in both the frequency and the timing of fire, which were related to fire-induced changes in vegetation structure. Over 40% of the overall ant species richness recorded in our study site was attributed to differences in species composition among fire treatments.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that Cerrado ant diversity at the landscape scale is promoted by a diversity of fire regimes, and therefore supports the validity of the pyrodiversity-biodiversity hypothesis for the Cerrado biome. Our findings suggest that the current policy of fire suppression in Cerrado protected areas has a negative effect on overall biodiversity and therefore should be reconsidered.

AB To predict future changes in forest ecosystems, it is crucial to understand the complex processes involved in decline of tree species populations and to evaluate the implications for potential vegetation shifts. Here, we study patterns of decline (canopy defoliation and mortality of adults) of four Scots pine populations at the southern edge of its distribution and characterized by different combinations of climate dryness and intensity of past management. General linear and structural equation modeling were used to assess how biotic, abiotic, and management components interacted to explain the spatial variability of Scots pine decline across and within populations. Regeneration patterns of Scots pine and co-occurring oak species were analyzed to assess potential vegetation shifts. Decline trends were related to climatic dryness at the regional scale, but, ultimately, within-population forest structure, local site conditions, and past human legacies could be the main underlying drivers of Scots pine decline. Overall, Scots pine regeneration was negatively related to decline both within and between populations, whereas oak species responded to decline idiosyncratically across populations. Taken together, our results suggest that (1) patterns of decline are the result of processes acting at the plot level that modulate forest responses to local environmental stress and (2) decline of adult Scots pine trees seems not to be compensated by self-recruitment so that the future dynamics of these forest ecosystems are uncertain.

AB This study describes the feeding ecology of three pelagic shark species in the California Current: shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus); blue (Prionace glauca); and thresher (Alopias vulpinus) sharks. Stomach contents of sharks collected from 2002 to 2008 were identified to the lowest taxonomic level and analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods. Of 330 mako sharks sampled (53 to 248 cm fork length [FL]), 238 stomachs contained 42 prey taxa, with jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) and Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) representing the most important prey based on the geometric index of importance (GII). In addition, 158 blue sharks were sampled (76 to 248 cm FL) and 114 stomachs contained 38 prey taxa, with jumbo and Gonatus spp. squids representing the most important prey. Lastly, 225 thresher sharks were sampled (108 to 228 cm FL) and 157 stomachs contained 18 prey taxa with northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) identified as the most important prey. Overall, mako sharks had the most diverse diet based upon Simpson's diversity index (1/D) (8.43 +/- 1.16), feeding on many species of teleosts and cephalopods, followed by blue sharks (6.20 +/- 2.11) which consumed a wide range of prey (primarily cephalopods), while thresher sharks were most specialized (2.62 +/- 0.34), feeding primarily on coastal pelagic teleosts. Dietary overlap was lowest between blue and thresher sharks (Sorensen similarity index = 0.321 and Simplified Morisita Horn index = 0.006), and seasonal variability in diet was greatest for blue sharks (Simplified Morisita Horn index = 0.260, Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) p < 0.001). In addition, size class, and subregion were significant factors that affected diet of each species differently (ANOSIM p < 0.001). Despite similarities in life history characteristics and spatial and temporal overlap in habitat, diets of these three common shark species are distinct in the California Current.

AB Ecology Letters (2012) 15: 673679 Abstract The role of top-down factors like herbivory and fire in structuring species niches, even in disturbance-dependent biomes like savanna, remains poorly understood. Interactions between herbivory and fire may set up a potential tradeoff axis, along which unique adaptations contribute to structuring communities and determining species distributions. We examine the role of herbivory and fire in structuring distributions of Acacia saplings in Hluhluwe iMfolozi Park in South Africa, and the relationship of species niche structure to traits that help them survive herbivory or fire. Results suggest that (1) fire and herbivory form a single trade-off axis, (2) Acacia sapling distributions are constrained by fire and herbivory, and (3) Acacia saplings have adaptations that are structured by the tradeoff axis.

AB Tropical forest mammal assemblages are widely affected by the twin effects of habitat loss and habitat fragmentation. We evaluated the effects of forest patch metrics, habitat structure, age of patch isolation, and landscape metrics on the species richness, abundance and composition of small mammals at 23 forest fragments (ranging in size from 43 to 7,035 ha) in a highly deforested 3,609-km(2) landscape of southwestern Brazilian Amazonia. Using pitfall traps and both terrestrial and arboreal traplines of Sherman, Tomahawk and snap traps, we captured a total of 844 individuals over 34,900 trap-nights representing 26 species and 20 genera of small-mammals, including 13 rodent and 13 marsupial species. We also consider the effects of distance from forest edges on species occupancy and abundance. Overall small mammal abundance, species richness and species composition were primarily affected by the quality of the open-habitat matrix of cattle pastures, rather than by patch metrics such as fragment size. Ultimately, small mammal community structure was determined by a combination of both landscape- and patch-scale variables. Knowledge of the anthropogenic factors that govern small mammal community structure is of critical importance for managing the persistence of forest vertebrates in increasingly fragmented neotropical forest landscapes.

AB Tree cover in savannas is determined as much by disturbances from fire and herbivory as by rainfall and soil resources. Fire especially acts to limit tree cover via a demographic bottleneck, limiting the recruitment of tree saplings to adults. Because sapling growth rates determine rates of sapling to tree recruitment, predicting changes in tree cover requires data on sapling growth rates, commonly expressed as population means. Here, we discuss the variability in sapling growth rates in Acacia populations in a savanna in Hluhluwe iMfolozi Park in South Africa. Saplings growing at mean rates under typical fire regimes in African savannas would likely never escape the fire-trap to become adults. Only the fastest growing saplings could grow above the flame zone between fires. We suggest that maximum growth rates are more ecologically relevant than mean growth rates in natural populations and experiments. Maximum growth rates are better than mean growth rates as predictors of sapling release within species, as shown here, and probably of which species are likely 'winners' in savanna tree communities.

AB It is known that the number of limiting nutrients may affect the species richness of plant communities, but it is unclear whether the type of nutrient limitation is also important. I place the results from a study in Patagonia (elsewhere in this issue) in the context of the number and types of nutrients that are limiting. I present four mechanisms through which N or P limitation may potentially influence species richness. These mechanisms are related to: (i) the number of forms in which P or N are present in soil and the plant traits needed to acquire them, (ii) the mechanisms and traits that control species competition and coexistence under N or P limitation, (iii) the regional species pools of plants capable of growing under N- and P-limited conditions, and (iv) the interaction between the type of nutrient limitation and community productivity. It appears likely that P limitation can favour a higher species richness than N limitation, in at least in a variety of low productive plant communities, but evidence to support this conclusion is so far lacking. The four mechanisms proposed here offer a framework for exploring whether the type of nutrient limitation per se, or an interaction with productivity, is a potential driver for variation in species diversity.

AB Soil acidity can have a potent influence on soil microbial composition and function, but it remains unclear if this influence is a direct response to the concentration of H+ or an indirect response caused by the influence of pH on other soil chemical properties. We hypothesized that the composition and function of soil microorganisms would shift in response to decreases in the availability of inorganic P caused by mobilized Al. We tested this hypothesis at Dysart Woods, a mosaic of old growth and second growth mixed, mesophytic forest in eastern Ohio. We evaluated microbial community composition (phospholipid fatty acid [PLFA] analysis) and function (extracellular enzyme activity) in the context of P availability and common metrics of soil fertility. We observed a threshold response where available organic P (P-o, i.e., bicarbonate-extracted, molybdate-unreactive P) dominated (similar to 80%) the availability of total available P when mobilized Al was present (>0.1 cmol(c) kg(-1)), but when Al was immobilized, available inorganic P (P-i, i.e., bicarbonate-extracted, molybdate-reactive P) content was significantly greater (similar to 50%). Available P-o significantly correlated (r = 0.54) with acid phosphatase activity. Using nonmetric multidimensional scaling, we observed that PLFA composition ordination was significant along a gradient of soil pH and available P-o. Because the composition and function of the microbial community changes due to available P-o, results suggest that microbial communities in acidic forest soils are functionally P limited. The availability of P-o did not influence the microbial biomass, however, indicating that the microbial community compensates for the apparent P limitation by altering its composition.

AB Question
   What is the relative importance of seed mass and abiotic factors in species-specific seedling growth and morphology during the first and the second growing season? How do oak species respond along gradients of these factors?
   Location
   Mediterranean oak forest in southern Spain.
   Methods
   We analysed seedling growth components and morphology of three co-occurring Quercus species (two deciduous and one evergreen). Oak seeds with a wide variety of sizes were sown along broad gradients of abiotic conditions. Intra- and inter-specific differences were evaluated by calibrating maximum likelihood estimators of seedling growth during the first two years of life.
   Results
   We found multiple resources and conditions affecting seedling morphology and biomass allocation. However, the integrative variables of seedling growth - total aboveground biomass and relative growth rate (RGR) - were affected by two main factors: seed mass and light conditions. The relative contribution of these two factors depended strongly on seedling age. Seed mass explained most of the growth and morphological variables during the first year, while light conditions were the best predictor in the second growing season. In contrast, soil factors did not play an important role in seedling growth. We found some evidence of regeneration niche partitioning between oak species along the light gradient, a reflection of their distribution patterns as adults at the study site.
   Conclusions
   We conclude that inter-specific differences in seedling growth, arising from seed size variability and microsite heterogeneity, could be of paramount importance in oak species niche segregation, driving stand dynamics and composition along environmental gradients.

AB 1. The use of experimental design and statistical analysis to evaluate the effects of marine protected areas (MPAs) is increasingly popular throughout the world.
   2. However, in looking at historical approaches to MPA evaluations, flaws were identified in the execution of theoretically correct designs, as well as disconnects between the stated objectives of MPAs and those of assessment studies.
   3. MPA assessments can be improved by: (1) considering the enforcement/compliance level; (2) linking explicitly the choice of indicator(s) to the MPA objectives; (3) accounting for habitat structure; (4) taking into account the age and size of the MPA; and (5) quantifying the fishing pressure outside the MPA (including possible displacement effects).
   4. Neglecting social factors, using inappropriate indicators, and/or ignoring relevant covariates, carries the risk of having MPAs dismissed as an effective management tool. Societal expectations are strong that MPAs will confer benefits, and thus assessment studies need to be progressively improved using new methodologies and the best available scientific evidence.

AB A large diversity of floral morphological types exists within the bird pollination syndrome in the Cape Floral Region of South Africa. Here we focus on species with tubular flowers and ask: "Do differences in tube length among plant species correspond to differences in bill length among the birds that serve as pollinators?" To answer this question, we observed 1669 bird-plant interactions at thirteen bird-pollinated plant species across a spectrum of tube lengths. Only three nectar feeding bird species pollinated the focal plant species. The relatively short-billed species were the Southern Double-collared Sunbird (Cinnyris chalybea) and Orange-breasted Sunbird (Anthobaphes violacea); the only long-billed species was the Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa). We found that the groups of plant species pollinated by the long- and short-billed birds differed significantly in floral tube length. Short-billed sunbirds nevertheless often robbed long-tubed flowers by piercing the corolla, and there was a significant difference in floral tube length among those species that were robbed, and those that were pollinated by short-billed sunbirds. The presence of territorial Malachite Sunbirds depressed robbing rates by short-billed sunbirds at long-tubed flowers. In turn, the absence of Malachite Sunbirds from short-tubed plant species might be explained by the observed positive correlation between tube length and nectar volume. Together, these data suggest that there is a Subset of the bird-pollinated plants at the Cape that are pollinated solely by the long-billed Malachite Sunbird, a pollination service irreplaceable by the more abundant, short-billed sunbird species. To extrapolate this finding to a greater Subset of species in the Cape Floral Region, we measured flowers on herbarium specimens of all tubular putatively bird-pollinated plants. We find that floral tube length has a bimodal distribution with 37 Cape species potentially dependent on pollination by Malachite Sunbirds. (C) 2009 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Effects of gap-size classes on litter decomposition rates were investigated in a high-elevation forest for 4 years by placing leaf litter of beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky.), oak (Quercus robur L.), and chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) in (1) a closed canopy, (2) small gaps with a diameter of less than 15 m, (3) intermediate gaps with a diameter of 15-30 m, and (4) large gaps with a diameter of more than 30 m. The leaf litter placed under the closed canopy or within the small gaps decayed more rapidly than those in the intermediate or the large gaps for all three deciduous species. Among the microclimatic and soil factors, soil temperature was most strongly positively correlated with litter decomposition rates, and among the three species, initial lignin concentration was the best predictor of litter decomposition rates. Differences in litter decomposition rates among the four gap-size classes were generally significant, but varied among the three species. Litter with low lignin concentrations tended to be more responsive to canopy openings. Large forest gaps significantly reduced litter decomposition rates in this study by changing environmental conditions, especially by decreasing soil temperature and soil pH which reduced soil respiration rates. These changes may result in reduced nutrient cycling, carbon cycling, and organic matter turnover rates in these forest ecosystems.

AB Aim In the Mediterranean Basin, the main forest communities vary in their ability to recover after fire. In this study we analyse the effects of fire on ant communities occurring in various vegetation types distributed along a geographical gradient in the western Mediterranean region.
   Location The study was carried out in burned and unburned habitats of 22 sites corresponding to eight vegetation types distributed along a gradient of dryness throughout Catalonia (north-east Spain).
   Methods We placed five pairs of plots (one plot located in the burned area and the second one placed in the unburned margin) per site. We compared ant communities in these unburned and burned plot types 8 years after fire using pitfall traps. Traps were set out in mid-May and mid-July. We analysed the structure and composition of ant communities in the burned and unburned areas of these vegetation types using ANOVA tests, correspondence analysis (CA) and linear regression.
   Results The resilience of ant communities varies with vegetation type. Ant communities in forests with high resilience also recover rapidly after fire, while those in forests that do not recover after fire show the lowest resilience. Species richness does not depend on burning or vegetation type. The resilience of these Mediterranean ant communities to fire is related to the environmental characteristics of the region where they live. Accordingly, differences between burned and unburned habitats are smaller for ant communities in areas with higher water deficit in summer than for those in moister ones.
   Main conclusions The structure and composition of ant communities after fire depends on the level of direct mortality caused by the fire. It affects ant species differently, as determined by the habitats used for nesting and foraging. The reestablishment of vegetation cover depends on forest composition before the fire. As vegetation cover determines resource and microhabitat availability and competitive relationships among species, forest composition before the fire also affects post-fire recovery of ant communities to the medium-term. Finally, ant communities living in drier areas recover more quickly after fire than those living in moister ones. This pattern might be because in areas with higher water deficit there are more species characteristic of open environments, which are habitats similar to those generated after fire.

AB We use population viability analysis of an endangered Florida scrub mint, Dicerandra frutescens, to specify the optimal fire return intervals for its long-term persistence and for its specific habitat. We derived 83 population projection matrices from 13 years of demographic data from eight populations, 59 matrices from scrub populations and 24 from firelane or yard edges. Seed dormancy and germination transitions were inferred based on experimental data and verified by comparing modeled vs. observed population trajectories. Finite rates of increase in scrub sites were highest shortly after fire and declined steeply through 10 years postfire. The break-even value of lambda = 1 was passed quickly, in about six years, suggesting that populations > 6 years postfire were already facing decline. The decline is probably related to the rapid growth of competing shrubs in the habitat of D. frutescens. In long-unburned sites, finite rates of increase were nearly always < 1 and declined the most in the long-unburned site with no foot trails or treefall gaps. Finite rates of increase in firelane populations also declined with years since fire or last disking. The yard edge population showed values both > 1 and < 1, with no temporal trend. Stochastic simulations in scrub sites suggested an optimal regular fire return interval of about 6-12 years. Regular fires at this interval were more favorable than stochastic fire regimes, but stochasticity reduced extinction percentages at longer fire return intervals. Stochastic fire return intervals implied a wider optimal fire return interval of 6-21 years. We suggest that prescribed fire in Florida scrub on yellow sand has occurred (and needs to occur) more frequently than previously recommended. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Variability of leaf traits related to photosynthesis was assessed in seedlings from 14 tree species growing in the tropical rain forest of French Guiana. Leaf photosynthetic capacity (maximum rate of carboxylation and maximum rate of electron transport) was estimated by fitting a biochemical model of photosynthesis to response curves of net CO2 assimilation rate versus intercellular CO2 mole fraction. Leaf morphology described by leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA), density and thickness, as well as area- and mass-based nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) concentrations, were recorded on the same leaves. Large interspecific variability was detected in photosynthetic capacity as well as in leaf structure and leaf N and C concentrations. No correlation was found between leaf thickness and density. The correlations between area- and mass-based leaf N concentration and photosynthetic capacity were poor. Conversely, the species differed greatly in relative N allocation to carboxylation and bioenergetics. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that, of the recorded traits, only the computed fraction of total leaf N invested in photosynthesis was tightly correlated to photosynthetic capacity. We also used PCA to test to what extent species with similar shade tolerances displayed converging leaf traits related to photosynthesis. No clear-cut ranking could be detected among the shade-tolerant groups, as confirmed by a one-way ANOVA. We conclude that the large interspecific diversity in photosynthetic capacity was mostly explained by differences in the relative allocation of N to photosynthesis and not by leaf N concentration, and that leaf traits related to photosynthetic capacity did not discriminate shade-tolerance ranking of these tropical tree species.

AB Species richness and taxonomic composition of pollinator assemblages are documented for 26 plant species from temperate rain forests of northern Chiloe Island, southern Chile (42 degrees 30'S). We investigated the patterns of generalism and specialization among plants and animal pollinators by comparing the flower visit frequency by different pollen vectors during the spring and summer months of three consecutive years (2000-2002). Species studied exhibited a range of floral morphologies (radial vs. zygomorphic, open vs. tubular) and rewards (nectar and/or pollen). Overall, we recorded 172 pollinator species, with an average of 6.6 species of pollen vectors/plant species. Pollinators visited an average of 15.2 plant species/pollen vector. Pollinator assemblages were dominated by Coleoptera (75 species), Diptera (56 species) and Hymenoptera (30 species), but passerine birds and hummingbirds were also important. The most specialized plants were vines, including the bee-pollinated genus Luzuriaga (Philesiaceae) and two endemic species of hummingbird-pollinated Gesneriaceae. Hymenoptera contributed 41.2% of all visits, with the bumblebee Bombus dalhbomi accounting for 22.5% of these. Plants with unspecialized flower morphology supported a higher species richness of pollinators, but visiting rates did not differ from specialized flowers. 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.

AB Centaurea corymbosa is an endemic plant species restricted to a 3-km(2) area in southern France. This species is known from only six. small populations that are highly differentiated genetically. Matrix models based on eight years of data (1994-2001) were used to assess the pattern of variation in the demographic vital rates of this species, and to investigate the causes of their variation. Asymptotic growth rates X varied widely between years and populations (0.613-1.424). Randomization tests were developed to test for spatial and temporal variation in the asymptotic growth rates. These tests rely on individual data on both survival and fecundity. As our demographic survey only allowed us to estimate,average fecundities, additional fecundity data collected from 1994 to 1996 were used to assess the distribution of individual fecundity expected within populations under demographic stochasticity or sampling error. Randomization tests showed that asymptotic growth rates were significantly different between populations and between years in C. corymbosa. In contrast, log-linear analysis performed only on transition data (i.e., excluding fecundity) suggested that the observed variations in transition probabilities were mostly explained by sampling error or demographic stochasticity rather than environmental stochasticity. This suggested that variations in fecundity among populations and among years may play a key role to explain temporal and spatial differences in X. Life-table response experiment analysis revealed that variations in fecundity and especially in the number of just-emerged seedlings per plant explained most of the observed variance in X. Spatial and temporal variations were detected for most lower-level vital rates, but causal factors that may account for these patterns a. re still unknown: no effect of genetic diversity was detected on the dynamics of the species, and correlation between lower-level vital rates and climatic data did not reveal any clear trends. Our study emphasizes the need to conduct long-term demographic surveys and to collect individual fecundity data to get more insights into the causes of variation of the demographic behavior of C. corymbosa.

AB The soil seed bank was monitored in four 75x75 m plots over 6 years (1990-1995) in an arid thorn scrub community in north-central Chile. Sixty-six species were identified. Total seed densities ranged from 2,000 to 42,000/m(2). Average mass of shrub seeds was significantly greater than that of other growth-forms. Between 70 and 90% of the seeds were less than 1 mg, with those in the 0.51-1.00 mg size class being most numerous. Seed densities were highly variable between years as well as within years, but were also closely associated with plant cover patterns and rainfall regime. Higher seed densities were found in wet years, and in samples taken in early summer and early autumn (i.e., after seed set); the lowest seed densities were in late winter (i.e., after annual plant germination). The annual plant species with the highest cover were also the most abundant in the soil seed bank and exhibited the largest seed density fluctuations. In general, seed densities were 5- to 10-fold higher during the 1991-1992 El Nino/southern oscillation (ENSO) years than non-ENSO years, showing the importance of this phenomenon for seed bank replenishment in the arid region of Chile.

AB Flower species visited by hummingbirds were studied over 13 months in 52 forested patches ("capoes") in the seasonally flooded plains of Southern Pantanal, western Brazil. The size of the surveyed capoes ranged from 0.2 to 3.8 ha and the total sampled area measured 51.6 ha. We recorded 21 plant species, mainly herbs and climbers, whose flowers were visited by hummingbirds. Most of these plant species are regarded as non-ornithophilous (71.4%). The flowering peaks of the hummingbird-visited plants occurred at the end of the dry season and during the rainy season. The density of omithophilous and non-ornithophilous flowers was higher during the rainy season and the dry season, respectively. Helicteres guazumaefolia is the most frequent ornithophilous species, bearing flowers throughout the year. Four hummingbird species were observed in the capoes. Their mean visiting rates for ornithophilous flowers (x = 0.019 +/- 0.01 visits.min(-1).number of flowers(-1)) did not differ (P = 0.09, Kruskal-Wallis) from those for non-ornithophilous flowers (x = 0.025 +/- 0.06 visits.min(-1).number of flowers(-1)). The most frequent visitor, Hylocharis chrysura was the only hummingbird recorded every month. It visited 20 plant species, 75% of which were non-ornithophilous, and seems to be the major pollinating bird in the capoes. The availability of H. guazumaefolia flowers throughout the year may favor the residence of this hummingbird in the study area.

AB The role of white-tailed rats (Uromys caudimaculatus) as dispersers of seeds of the Australian tropical rain forest tree Beilschmiedia bancroftii, (Lauraceae) was investigated by following the fates of seeds and seedlings over 2 y. Fruits of this tree are too large to be consumed by any avian frugivore except the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius), and the only other native mammal capable of dispersing the seeds is the musky rat kangaroo (Hypsiprimnodon moschatus). However, neither of these species has been documented to disperse the seeds of this tree. During a mast year, white-tailed rats cached seeds an average of 13 m from parent trees in a variety of microsites. Although none of the 61 cached seeds followed in this study survived to germination, comparison of seed, cache and seedling distributions suggested that most seedlings arose from rat-cached seeds. White-tailed rats cached seeds in both mast and non-mast pears, but the time seeds remained on the forest floor and in caches was significantly shorter in non-mast) ears, suggesting that synchronous seed production increases the probability that some caches survive to germination. Because white-tailed rats are the most common and widespread native mammal capable of dispersing large-seeds, this study suggests that they may play an important role in the seed and seedling dynamics of large-seeded tree species in Australian tropical rain forests.

AB Selective crab predation has been hypothesized to maintain mangrove forest zonation by preventing the establishment of certain species' seedlings at particular tidal elevations. Support for this hypothesis consists of observations that the propagules of some mangrove species are consumed at a rate that is inversely related to the species' relative abundance in the adult canopy. In addition, one previous study found that rates of crab predation were lower in large light gaps than in small ones. We conducted a mensurative field experiment to assay rates of crab predation on dispersing propagules of the dominant mangrove species (Avicennia germinans Laguncularia racemosa, and Rhizophora mangle) in our study forests at Punta Galeta on the Caribbean coast of Panama. The experiment specifically examined whether rates of crab predation varied 1) with species of propagule, 2) with changes in stand composition along the tidal gradient, and 3) inside versus outside of light gaps. Lightning-created canopy gaps are the primary sites of tree regeneration in these and other tall-stature mangrove forests.
   Propagules of the three mangrove species were tethered inside and in the understory surrounding nine light gaps, with representatives in each of the major stand types that occur along the intertidal gradient. Fates of propagules were monitored over a four-wk period. Rates of propagule predation varied spatially, with highest rates of removal occurring in lower intertidal R. mangle/L. racemosa stands, where the large herbivorous crabs, Ucides cordatus and Goniopsis cruentata are common. In mid- and upper intertidal stands, dominated by A. germinans or L. racemosa, where detritivorous Uca spp. are abundant but larger herbivorous crabs are rare, few propagules were consumed. The propagules of A. germinans were preyed upon more heavily than those of the other two species; rates of predation on R. mangle and L. racemosa propagules did not differ. Light environment (i.e. inside versus outside a gap) had no significant effect on the rate of propagule predation. The enhanced survival of juvenile mangroves in light gaps that we have observed is probably due to other factors such as higher light and nutrient availability; and in some situations, lower insect herbivory.
   Only the propagules of A. germinans experienced a pattern of predation consistent with the dominance-predation model: they were consumed at higher rates in the low intertidal where adults of the species are rare, and at lower rates in high intertidal areas where the species dominates the canopy. This suggests that predation on mangrove propagules by herbivorous crabs could influence the species composition of low intertidal forests by differentially reducing the recruitment of A. germinans On the other hand, rates of crab predation on A. germinans propagules seem insufficient to prevent A. ger, from establishing in low intertidal areas. In opposition to the dominance-predation hypothesis, crab predation cannot account for the distribution patterns of R. mangle or L. racemosa whose propagules were preyed on most heavily in lower intertidal areas where these species are very abundant. Our results, together with those of two earlier studies, indicate that predation by crabs on dispersing propagules is not a general explanation for the zonation of tree species along tidal gradients in mangrove forests.

AB By comparing seed rain, seedling and sapling community structures we assessed the possible role played by vertebrate seed dispersal as a structuring factor in advanced regeneration of closed-canopied sites in the tropical rain forest of Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Seed weight, initial morphology of seedlings and species abundance were also analyzed to determine if these traits influenced the probability of establishment in the shade.
   About half of the seed species falling in five closed forest sites (25 x 25 m) during one year came from fruiting trees growing within the sites (local seeds) and half from fruiting trees found outside the sites (immigrant seeds). Seeds of liana and upper-canopy species were over-represented among immigrant seeds compared with seeds of understory tree species. This probably reflects the activity of frugivorous arboreal mammals, bats, and birds. Species with immigrant seeds had both a lower abundance and a narrower spatial distribution than locally produced seeds. Therefore, immigrant seeds showed higher diversity values than locally produced seeds.
   Average seed size and the proportion of epigeous seedlings were similar in local and immigrant species. Under closed-canopied sites, factors affecting community organization seem to operate selectively, favoring the establishment of large-seeded, local abundant species in the advanced regeneration. However, the fact that some saplings of immigrant species were found in the plots suggest that a slow species infiltration may be occurring leading to a slow shift in the advanced regeneration species composition. We propose that the influence of seed dispersal on advanced regeneration structure depends on the disturbance history of the patches where seeds land.

AB Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations were historically considered rare or absent from tropical ecosystems. Although most tropical forests are dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees, ECM associations are widespread and found in all tropical regions. Here, we highlight emerging patterns of ECM biogeography, diversity and ecosystem functions, identify knowledge gaps, and offer direction for future research. At the continental and regional scales, tropical ECM systems are highly diverse and vary widely in ECM plant and fungal abundance, diversity, composition and phylogenetic affinities. We found strong regional differences among the dominant host plant families, suggesting that biogeographical factors strongly influence tropical ECM symbioses. Both ECM plants and fungi also exhibit strong turnover along altitudinal and soil fertility gradients, suggesting niche differentiation among taxa. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are often more abundant and diverse in sites with nutrient-poor soils, suggesting that ECM associations can optimize plant nutrition and may contribute to the maintenance of tropical monodominant forests. More research is needed to elucidate the diversity patterns of ECM fungi and plants in the tropics and to clarify the role of this symbiosis in nutrient and carbon cycling.

AB Biodiversity extinction thresholds are abrupt declines in biological diversity that occur with habitat loss, associated with a decline in habitat connectivity. Matrix quality should influence the location of thresholds along habitat loss gradients through its effects on connectivity; however these relationships have seldom been explored empirically. Using field data from 23 independent 1254 ha landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we evaluated how tropical avian biodiversity responds to native forest loss within habitat patches embedded either in homogeneous pasture matrix context (with a high proportion of cattle pastures), and heterogeneous coffee matrix context (with high abundance of sun coffee plantations). We considered taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity, and tested if matrix type and choice of diversity metric influenced the location of biodiversity thresholds along the forest cover gradient. We found that matrix type postponed the abrupt loss of taxonomic diversity, from a threshold of 35% of forest cover in homogeneous pasture matrix to 19% in heterogeneous coffee matrix. Phylogenetic diversity responded similarly, with thresholds at 30 and 24% in homogeneous-pasture and heterogeneous-coffee matrices, respectively, but no relationship with forest cover was detected when corrected for richness correlation. Despite the absence of a threshold for functional diversity in either matrix types, a strong decline below 20% of habitat amount was detected. Finally, below 20% native habitat loss, all diversity indices demonstrated abrupt declines, indicating that even higher-quality matrices cannot postpone diversity loss below this critical threshold. These results highlight that taxonomic diversity is a more sensitive index of biodiversity loss in fragmented landscapes, which may be used as a benchmark to prevent subsequent functional and phylogenetic losses. Furthermore, increasing matrix quality appears an efficient conservation strategy to maintain higher biodiversity levels in fragmented landscapes over a larger range of habitat loss.

AB According to the habitat amount hypothesis the species richness in a sample site should increase with the habitat amount in the local landscape around the sample site. On the other hand, size and isolation of the patch containing the sample site should have no effect on species richness if the habitat amount in the local landscape remains constant. We tested these predictions using a small mammal dataset recorded in 100 transects in a savanna region of Brazil. We used generalized linear models considering the predictors - habitat amount, patch size, and patch isolation - together and singly, using subsets of data to control for correlations between them. We measured the habitat amount in 10 nested circles ranging in radius from 250 m to 6000 m around each transect. The scale of effect was the radius with the strongest estimated correlation between habitat amount and species richness. Our results indicate that habitat amount is the most important single predictor of species richness. The habitat amount effect was always positive and large. In general, patch size and patch isolation had no effect on species richness after controlling for the effect of habitat amount. The results are consistent with the habitat amount hypothesis, and suggest that habitat amount can be used in place of patch size and isolation in predicting small mammal species richness. This simplifies information needs by landscape managers as it replaces two predictors with one. Our results also support the use of estimated dispersal distance as a way of determining the appropriate landscape scale of effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microorganisms are the pillars of life on Earth. Over billions of years, they have evolved into every conceivable niche on the planet. Microbes reshaped the oceans and atmosphere and gave rise to conditions conducive to multicellular organisms. Only in the past decade have we started to peer deeply into the microbial cosmos, and what we have found is amazing. Microbial ecosystems behave, in many ways, like large-scale ecosystems, although there are important exceptions. We review recent advances in our understanding of how microbial diversity is distributed across environments, how microbes influence the ecosystems in which they live, and how these nano-machines might be harnessed to advance our understanding of the natural world.

TI Forest law enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon: Costs and income effects

AB Despite recent success in reducing forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon, additional forest conservation efforts, for example, through 'Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation' (REDD+), could significantly contribute to global climate-change mitigation. Economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services could promote conservation, but deforestation often occurs on land without crucial tenure-security prerequisites. Improving the enforcement of existing regulatory disincentives thus represents an important element of Brazil's anti-deforestation action plan. However, conservation law enforcement costs and benefits have been much less studied than for conditional payments. We develop a conceptual framework and a spatially explicit model to analyze field-based regulatory enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon. We validate our model, based on historical deforestation and enforcement mission data from 2003 to 2008. By simulating the current conservation law enforcement practice, we analyze the costs of liability establishment and legal coercion for alternative conservation targets, and evaluate corresponding income impacts. Our findings suggest that spatial patterns of both deforestation and inspection costs markedly influence enforcement patterns and their income effects. Field-based enforcement is a highly cost-effective forest conservation instrument from a regulator's point of view, but comes at high opportunity costs for land users. Payments for environmental services could compensate costs, but will increase budget outlays vis-A-vis a command-and-control dominated strategy. Both legal and institutional challenges have to be overcome to make conservation payments work at a larger scale. Decision-makers may have to innovatively combine incentive and disincentive-based policy instruments in order to make tropical forest conservation both financially viable and socially compatible.

AB Spectral properties of foliage express fundamental chemical interactions of canopies with solar radiation. However, the degree to which leaf spectra track chemical traits across environmental gradients in tropical forests is unknown.
   We analyzed leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra in 2567 tropical canopy trees comprising 1449 species in 17 forests along a 3400-m elevation and soil fertility gradient from the Amazonian lowlands to the Andean treeline. We developed quantitative links between 21 leaf traits and 400-2500-nm spectra, and developed classifications of tree taxa based on spectral traits.
   Our results reveal enormous inter-specific variation in spectral and chemical traits among canopy trees of the western Amazon. Chemical traits mediating primary production were tightly linked to elevational changes in foliar spectral signatures. By contrast, defense compounds and rock-derived nutrients tracked foliar spectral variation with changing soil fertility in the lowlands. Despite the effects of abiotic filtering on mean foliar spectral properties of tree communities, the spectra were dominated by phylogeny within any given community, and spectroscopy accurately classified 85-93% of Amazonian tree species.
   Our findings quantify how tropical tree canopies interact with sunlight, and indicate how to measure the functional and biological diversity of forests with spectroscopy.

AB Water shortage and nitrogen (N) deficiency are the key factors limiting agricultural production in arid and semi-arid regions, and increasing agricultural productivity under rain-fed conditions often requires N management strategies. A field experiment on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was begun in 2004 to investigate effects of long-term N fertilization in the traditional pattern used for wheat in China. Using data collected over three consecutive years, commencing five years after the experiment began, the effects of N fertilization on wheat yield, evapotranspiration (ET) and water use efficiency (WUE, i.e. the ratio of grain yield to total ET in the crop growing season) were examined. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, N increased the yield of wheat cultivar Zhengmai No. 9023 by up to 61.1, 117.9 and 34.7%, respectively, and correspondingly in cultivar Changhan No. 58 by 58.4, 100.8 and 51.7%. N-applied treatments increased water consumption in different layers of 0-200 cm of soil and thus ET was significantly higher in N-applied than in non-N treatments. WUE was in the range of 1.0-2.09 kg/m(3) for 2010, 2011 and 2012. N fertilization significantly increased WUE in 2010 and 2011, but not in 2012. The results indicated the following: (1) in this dryland farming system, increased N fertilization could raise wheat yield, and the drought-tolerant Changhan No. 58 showed a yield advantage in drought environments with high N fertilizer rates; (2) N application affected water consumption in different soil layers, and promoted wheat absorbing deeper soil water and so increased utilization of soil water; and (3) comprehensive consideration of yield and WUE of wheat indicated that the N rate of 270 kg/ha for Changhan No. 58 was better to avoid the risk of reduced production reduction due to lack of precipitation; however, under conditions of better soil moisture, the N rate of 180 kg/ha was more economic.

AB Specialised natural enemies maintain forest diversity by reducing tree survival in a density- or distance-dependent manner. Fungal pathogens, insects and mammals are the enemy types most commonly hypothesised to cause this phenomenon. Still, their relative importance remains largely unknown, as robust manipulative experiments have generally targeted a single enemy type and life history stage. Here, we use fungicide, insecticide and physical exclosure treatments to isolate the impacts of each enemy type on two life history stages (germination and early seedling survival) in three tropical tree species. Distance dependence was evident for five of six species-stage combinations, with each enemy type causing distance dependence for at least one species stage and their importance varying widely between species and stages. Rather than implicating one enemy type as the primary agent of this phenomenon, our field experiments suggest that multiple agents acting at different life stages collectively contribute to this diversity-promoting mechanism.

AB The concerted evolution of morphological and behavioral specializations has compelling examples in ant castes. Unique to ants is a marked divergence between winged queens and wingless workers, but morphological specializations for behaviors on the ground have been overlooked. We analyzed thorax morphology of queens and workers in species from 21 of the 25 ant subfamilies. We uncovered unique skeletomuscular modifications in workers that presumably increase power and flexibility of head-thorax articulation, emphasizing that workers are not simply wingless versions of queens. We also identified two distinct types of queens and showed repeated evolutionary associations with strategies of colony foundation. Solitary founding queens that hunt have a more worker-like thorax. Our results reveal that ants invest in the relative size of thorax segments according to their tasks. Versatility of head movements allows for better manipulation of food and objects, which arguably contributed to the ants' ecological and evolutionary success.

AB To predict the long-term effects of climate change - global warming and changes in precipitation - on the diameter (radial) growth of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B. S. P.) trees in boreal Ontario, we modified an existing diameter growth model to include climate variables. Diameter chronologies of 927 jack pine and 1173 black spruce trees, growing in the area from 47 degrees N to 50 degrees N and 80 degrees W to 92 degrees W, were used to develop diameter growth models in a nonlinear mixed-effects approach. Our results showed that the variables long-term average of mean growing season temperature, precipitation during wettest quarter, and total precipitation during growing season were significant (alpha = 0.05) in explaining variation in diameter growth of the sample trees. Model results indicated that higher temperatures during the growing season would increase the diameter growth of jack pine trees, but decrease that of black spruce trees. More precipitation during the wettest quarter would favor the diameter growth of both species. On the other hand, a wetter growing season, which may decrease radiation inputs, increase nutrient leaching, and reduce the decomposition rate, would reduce the diameter growth of both species. Moreover, our results indicated that future (2041-2070) diameter growth rate may differ from current (1971-2000) growth rates for both species, with conditions being more favorable for jack pine than black spruce trees. Expected future changes in the growth rate of boreal trees need to be considered in forest management decisions. We recommend that knowledge of climate-growth relationships, as represented by models, be combined with learning from adaptive management to reduce the risks and uncertainties associated with forest management decisions.

AB The relative importance of deterministic and neutral processes on community assembly is currently a topic of much debate among ecologists. Analyzing species-environment associations is an effective way to assess the importance of deterministic process such as niche differentiation, but both habitat association and dispersal limitation can produce similar patterns of spatial aggregation in species. Therefore, it is crucial to control for the impact of dispersal limitation on species distributions when analyzing species-environment associations. We sampled soil with high resolutions in a 24 ha stem-mapped subtropical forest and tested plant-soil associations. We controlled for the influence of dispersal limitation by employing the homogeneous Thomas process to simulate the effect of dispersal limitation on the aggregation of tree species. After controlling for the effect of dispersal limitation, we found that the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties was associated with distributions of 88.2% (90 of 102 species) of tree species in this subtropical forest. Furthermore, not only did soil properties influence the distribution of tree species, but also tree species tended to affect properties of the soil around them. The soil factors most strongly influencing species distributions were TC, TN, TP, K, Mg, Si, soil moisture, and bulk density. We found the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties to be strongly associated with tree species distributions. Niche partitioning of soil gradients contributed substantially to species coexistence in this subtropical forest.

AB With increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, there is an urgent need of reliable estimates of biomass and carbon pools in tropical forests, most especially in Africa where there is a serious lack of data. Information on current annual increment (CAI) of carbon biomass resulting from direct field measurements is crucial in this context, to know how forest ecosystems will affect the carbon cycle and also to validate eddy covariance flux measurements. Biomass data were collected from 25 plots of 13 ha spread over the different vegetation types and land uses of a moist evergreen forest of 772,066 ha in Cameroon. With site-specific allometric equations, we estimated biomass and aboveground and belowground carbon pools. We used GIS technology to develop a carbon biomass map of our study area. The CAI was estimated using the growth rates obtained from tree rings analysis. The carbon biomass was on average 264 +/- 48 Mg ha(-1). This estimate includes aboveground carbon, root carbon and soil organic carbon down to 30 cm depth. This value varied from 231 +/- 45 Mg ha(-1) of carbon in Agro-Forests to 283 +/- 51 Mg ha(-1) of carbon in Managed Forests and to 278 56 Mg ha(-1) of carbon in National Park. The carbon CAI varied from 2.54 +/- 0.65 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in Agro-Forests to 2.79 +/- 0.72 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in Managed Forests and to 2.85 +/- 0.72 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in National Park. This study provides estimates of biomass, carbon pools and CAI of carbon biomass from a forest landscape in Cameroon as well as an appropriate methodology to estimate these components and the related uncertainty.

AB To counteract an increasing biodiversity decline, parks and protected areas have been established worldwide. However, many parks lack adequate management to address environmental degradation. To improve management strategies simple tools are needed for an assessment of human impact and management effectiveness of protected areas. This study quantifies the current threats in the heavily fragmented and degraded tropical rainforest of Kakamega, western Kenya. We recorded seven disturbance parameters at 22 sites in differently managed and protected areas of Kakamega Forest. Our data indicate a high level of human impact throughout the forest with illegal logging being most widespread. Furthermore, logging levels appear to reflect management history and effectiveness. From 1933 to 1986, Kakamega Forest was under management by the Forest Department and the number of trees logged more than 20 years ago was equally high at all sites. Since 1986, management of Kakamega Forest has been under two different organizations, i.e. Forest Department and Kenya Wildlife Service. The number of trees logged illegally in the last 20 years was significantly lower at sites managed by the Kenya Wildlife Service. Finally, logging was lower within highly protected National and Nature Reserves as compared to high logging within the less protected Forest Reserves. Reflecting management effectiveness as well as protection status in Kakamega Forest, logging might therefore provide a valuable quantitative indicator for human disturbance and thus an important tool for conservation managers. Logging might be a valuable indicator for other protected areas, too, however, other human impact such as e.g. hunting might also prove to be a potential indicator.

AB A data base on the flowering phenology of the Wet Tropics bioregion of far northern Queensland, Australia, has been constructed, based upon over 36 774 records from two Queensland-based herbaria.
   Flowering patterns have been analysed against the predictions of three overlapping hypotheses based on climatic, biotic and phylogenetic explanations. No one hypothesis is supported to the exclusion of the others.
   Patterns of flowering in the Wet Tropics show marked seasonal increases and decreases, except in the northern lowlands. In general this seasonality correlates with rainfall and temperature and is exacerbated by increasing latitude and altitude.
   There is little or no statistical evidence for the over-dispersion of flowering times that would indicate a competition-avoidance mechanism: flowering within taxa or morphological groups tends to be clumped (and if not, is random).
   That clumping of flowering within taxa does not coincide with a single season provides support for a mass action hypothesis based on the minimization of generalist predation and/or the avoidance of flower predation.
   Timing of flowering did show some consistency among species within genera and within families, but there was little consistency at higher taxonomic levels. Clear separation of the biotic and phylogenetic hypotheses requires greater knowledge of pollination ecology and phylogeny of this large and diverse flora.
   Understanding of flowering patterns and their underlying determining mechanisms is a key to assessing the ecosystem health of the forest. Our results highlight the importance of competitive interactions and of physical and evolutionary factors as determinants of flowering time, intensity and co-occurrence in tropical forests.

AB Aim To integrate the effects of ecosystem engineers (organisms that create, maintain or destroy habitat for other species) sharing the same archetype on species diversity, and assess whether different engineer species have generalized or idiosyncratic effects across environmentally similar ecosystems.
   Location High-Andean habitats of Chile and Argentina, from 23 degrees S to 41 degrees S.
   Methods We measured and compared the effects of eight alpine plants with cushion growth-form on species richness, species diversity (measured as the Shannon-Wiener index) and evenness of vascular plant assemblages across four high-Andean ecosystems of Chile and Argentina.
   Results The presence of cushion plants always increased the species richness, diversity (measured as the Shannon-Wiener index) and evenness of high-Andean plant assemblages. However, while the presence of different cushion species within the same ecosystem controlled species diversity in the same way, these effects varied between cushion species from different ecosystems.
   Main conclusions Results consistently supported the idea that increases in habitat complexity due to the presence of ecosystem engineers, in this case cushion plants, would lead to higher community diversity. Results also indicate that effects of the presence of different cushion species within the same ecosystem could be generalized, while the effects of cushion species from different ecosystems should be considered idiosyncratic.

AB Interactions between trees and grasses that influence leaf area index (LAI) have important consequences for savanna ecosystem processes through their controls on water, carbon, and energy fluxes as well as fire regimes. We measured LAI, of the groundlayer (herbaceous and woody plants < 1-m tall) and shrub and tree layer (woody plants > 1-m tall), in the Brazilian cerrado over a range of tree densities from open shrub savanna to closed woodland through the annual cycle. During the dry season, soil water potential was strongly and positively correlated with grass LAI, and less strongly with tree and shrub LAI. By the end of the dry season, LAI of grasses, groundlayer dicots and trees declined to 28, 60, and 68% of mean wet-season values, respectively. We compared the data to remotely sensed vegetation indices, finding that field measurements were more strongly correlated to the enhanced vegetation index (EVI, r(2) =0.71) than to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, r(2) =0.49). Although the latter has been more widely used in quantifying leaf dynamics of tropical savannas, EVI appears better suited for this purpose. Our ground-based measurements demonstrate that groundlayer LAI declines with increasing tree density across sites, with savanna grasses being excluded at a tree LAI of approximately 3.3. LAI averaged 4.2 in nearby gallery (riparian) forest, so savanna grasses were absent, thereby greatly reducing fire risk and permitting survival of fire-sensitive forest tree species. Although edaphic conditions may partly explain the larger tree LAI of forests, relative to savanna, biological differences between savanna and forest tree species play an important role. Overall, forest tree species had 48% greater LAI than congeneric savanna trees under similar growing conditions. Savanna and forest species play distinct roles in the structure and dynamics of savanna-forest boundaries, contributing to the differences in fire regimes, microclimate, and nutrient cycling between savanna and forest ecosystems.

AB The Janzen-Connell hypothesis states that local species-specific density dependence, mediated through specialist enemies of offspring such as fungal pathogens and insect seed predators, can facilitate coexistence of species by preventing recruitment near conspecific adults. We use spatially explicit simulation models and analytical approximations to evaluate how spatial scales of offspring and enemy dispersal affect species richness. In comparison with model communities in which both offspring and enemies disperse long distances, species richness is substantially decreased when offspring disperse long distances and enemies disperse short distances. In contrast, when both offspring and enemies disperse short distances species richness more than doubles and adults of each species are highly spatially clumped. For the range of conditions typical of tropical forests, locally dispersing specialist enemies may decrease species richness relative to enemies that disperse long distances. In communities where dispersal distances of both offspring and enemies are short, local effects may enhance species richness.

AB This research utilized tower-based eddy covariance to quantify the trends in net ecosystem mass (CO2 and H2O vapor) and energy exchange of important land-cover types of NW Mato Grosso during the March-December 2002 seasonal transition. Measurements were made in a mature transitional (ecotonal) tropical forest near Sinop, Mato Grosso, and a cattle pasture near Cotriguacu, Mato Grosso, located 500 km WNW of Sinop. Pasture net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was considerably more variable than the forest NEE over the seasonal transition, and the pasture had significantly higher rates of maximum gross primary production in every season except the dry-wet season transition (September-October). The pasture also had significantly higher rates of whole-ecosystem dark respiration than the forest during the wetter times of the year. Average (+/-95% CI) rates of total daily NEE during the March-December 2002 measurement period were 26+/-15 mmol m(-2) day(-1) for the forest (positive values indicate net CO2 loss by the ecosystem) and -38+/-26 mmol m(-2) day(-1) for the pasture. While both ecosystems partitioned more net radiation (R-n) into latent heat flux (L-e), the forest had significantly higher rates of L-e and lower rates of sensible heat flux (H) than the pasture; a trend that became more extreme during the onset of the dry season. Large differences in pasture and forest mass and energy exchange occurred even though seasonal variations in micrometeorology (air temperature, humidity, and radiation) were relatively similar for both ecosystems. While the short measurement period and lack of spatial replication limit the ability to generalize these results to pasture and forest regions of the Amazon Basin, these results suggest important differences in the magnitude and seasonal variation of NEE and energy partitioning for pasture and transitional tropical forest.

AB 1. Allocational shifts in response to light may be an important factor in allowing plants to survive in shade, while increasing their extension rates and competitive ability in sun. To investigate this response, the allocation of above-ground growth between leaves, branches and stems was studied in saplings of Acer pensylvanicum L. and Castenea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh. in the Appalachian mountains of western Virginia, USA. Measurements of current leaf biomass, current and past year leaf numbers and the growth ring widths of branches and stem were used to estimate biomass partitioning for saplings growing in locations ranging from forest understorey to large openings.
   2. Both species showed higher leaf area per unit leaf biomass (SLA) and higher allocation of above-ground growth to leaves in shade than in sun.
   3. There were no differences between species in the slopes of the relationships of allocation and SLA vs estimated irradiance, but SLA was significantly greater in A. pensylvanicum than in C. dentata at a given light level. Hence, somewhat lower production per unit leaf area is required to maintain the canopy in A. pensylvanicum, consistent with foresters' ratings of greater shade tolerance for this species.
   4. Greater foliar allocation in shade than sun has also been observed in broad-leaved evergreen saplings, but generally not in seedlings. This difference is probably related to differences in size and age between seedlings and saplings. Young seedlings typically show exponential growth with no immediate foliar losses, while shaded saplings lie closer to the steady state where new leaves replace old ones with little additional stem growth.
   5. Thus trees shift their allocation patterns in an acclimatory fashion, depending on their size and light environment, with the costs of replacing senesced leaves becoming of consequence as juveniles age.

ID TROPICAL FORESTS; LAND-USE; FIRE; CONSERVATION; VEGETATION; CARBON
AB Recent studies suggest that deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon could increase sharply in the future as a result of over US$ 40 billion in planned investments in highway paving and major new infrastructure projects in the region. These studies have been challenged by several Brazilian ministries, which assert that recent improvements in environmental laws, enforcement and public attitudes have fundamentally reduced the threat posed to forests by such projects. The notion that hazards to Amazonian forests have declined over the last decade was assessed using available data on deforestation rates from 1978 to 2000. Although the alarmingly high rate of forest loss during 1978-1989 (1.98 million ha yr(-1)) declined somewhat in 1990-1994 (1.38 million ha yr(-1)), it rebounded to a high level in the period 1995-2000 (1.90 million ha yr(-1)). Moreover, correlation and regression analyses reveal that both absolute and per caput rates of forest loss accelerated significantly over the last decade. These trends fail to support the assertion that deforestation pressure in Amazonian forests has been brought under control. Poor enforcement of existing environmental laws, rapidly expanding logging and mining industries, increasing population pressure and other challenges are greatly hindering efforts to limit the environmental impacts of development activities in Brazilian Amazonia.

AB Mycorrhizal fungi were sampled in a deciduous tropical forest on the Pacific coast of Mexico during different seasons and in natural treefall gaps and pastures. All 12 plant species sampled in the forest were arbuscular mycorrhizal. The percent root infection and spore production were closely related to the phenology of the plants. Most tree species and all herbaceous species had the highest infection in the summer rainy season, bur two species, Opuntia excelsa and Jacquinia pungens, had highest infection in the dry season. Unusually high rainfall during the dry season was associated with increased infection bur not increased spore production. Spore density was low for all species at all sample times, except at the beginning of the July 1993 rainy season in, when we observed up to 28 spores/g soil.
   The percent cover of shrubs or herbs did nor increase in gaps after two years, and we observed no colonizing seedlings. No plane species with cover higher than 2.7 percent occurred exclusively in gaps or forest. The percent mycorrhizal infection did nor differ significantly between gaps and forest. Spore counts were as high in the gaps as in the forest in two of the three gaps but lower in the third gap. The lack of significant response of plants in these gaps after two years differed from the rapid response in tropical rainforests. it is likely related to the small size of the gaps and to light infiltration to the forest floor. Pastures were dominated by two species of exotic grasses and one species of mycorrhizal fungus, whereas forests had lj fungal species. The slow regrowth of vegetation in gaps was not limited by mycorrhiza fungi, since they were still abundant after the treefalls, bur recovery in pastures could be affected by low fungal diversity and dominance of grasses.

AB This study examined whether postdispersal fruit and seed removal by terrestrial mammals of common plant species was affected by the type of item, item density (low, medium, high), and habitat (gap, mid-succession, mature). Fruits of Brosimum alicastrum and Ficus yoponensis (Moraceae), Astrocaryum mexicanum (Palmae), and Nectandra ambigens (Lauraceae), and seeds of Omphalea oleifera (Euphorbiaceae) and Cymbopetalum baillonii (Annonaceae) were tested at the Los Tuxtlas rainforest in Mexico. Item removal from 108 experimental patches (N = 2340 fruits or seeds for each plant species tested) after 5 d was lower for F. yoponensis (6.6%) than for N. ambigens (68.0%), B. alicastrum (67.8%) C. baillonii (64.0%) and A. mexicanum (60.0%). No seeds of O. oleifera were removed. A higher fruit or seed removal was observed from high density than low density food patches in A. mexicanum, C. baillonii and N. ambigens, but not in B. alicastrum and F. yoponensis. A higher fruit or seed removal was observed from food patches in mature forest than in gaps in all plant species tested. Similar removal values between open (open to all terrestrial mammals) and caged (open to small rodents) fruit and seed patches, abundant rodent live-trapping, and a scarcity of large terrestrial mammals, indicated that forest-dwelling small rodents were the main postdispersal removal agents. Differences in plans species seedling recruitment resulting from small rodent food choices can partially determine long-term forest floristic composition at the Los Tuxtlas rainforest.

AB Crabs (Grapsidae, Sesarma) are the dominant macrofaunal group of mangrove forest soils in northern Australia.  Little is known about the ecology of these crabs or the factors that influence their distribution in mangrove forests.  Pitfall traps were used to sample grapsid crabs in the Murray River estuary in north Queensland.  Sampling was conducted at five sites along a salinity gradient from <1 parts-per-thousand at upstream sites to >35 parts-per-thousand at the river mouth.  At each site, trapping was done in both low and high intertidal forests.  We characterized the sediments at each site by measuring percent sand, silt, clay and organic matter, Eh, pH, and soil pore-water salinity.  Four species of grapsids dominated the crab fauna along the Murray River (Sesarma semperi-longicristatum, S. messa, S. brevicristatum, and S. brevipes).  Distinct zonation patterns were found along the salinty gradient and between high and low intertidal forests.  S. messa was dominant in high intertidal, downstream forests, high and low intertidal forests in the middle to downstream portion of the river, and in low intertidal forests in the central reach of the river.  S. brevipes was dominant in both low and high intertidal zone forests at low salinity upstream sites.  S. brevicristatum was most abundant in the central reaches of the river and only in the high intertidal zone.  S. semperi-longicristatum was found only in the low intertidal zone, downstream forest.  Subsequently, tests of salinity tolerances of these crabs were carried out in the laboratory.  These indicated very wide tolerances over salinities from completely fresh to hypersaline (60 parts-per-thousand).  The osmoregulatory abilities of the crabs were also found to vary.  However, neither their salinity tolerance nor osmoregulatory ability adequately explain the zonation patterns we measured in the field.  For example, S. brevicristatum had the most restricted distribution, but it had the second broadest salinity tolerance and osmoregulatory ability.  Sediment characteristics explained a significant amount of the variation in abundance for two of the crab species.  Pore-water salinity provided no explanatory power for any of the species.  Individual species abundances are probably influenced by additional factors such as interspecific competition and predation.

AB Phosphorus is a scarce nutrient in many tropical ecosystems, yet how soil microbial communities cope with growth-limiting phosphorus deficiency at the gene and protein levels remains unknown. Here, we report a metagenomic and metaproteomic comparison of microbial communities in phosphorus-deficient and phosphorus-rich soils in a 17-year fertilization experiment in a tropical forest. The large-scale proteogenomics analyses provided extensive coverage of many microbial functions and taxa in the complex soil communities. A greater than fourfold increase in the gene abundance of 3-phytase was the strongest response of soil communities to phosphorus deficiency. Phytase catalyses the release of phosphate from phytate, the most recalcitrant phosphorus-containing compound in soil organic matter. Genes and proteins for the degradation of phosphorus-containing nucleic acids and phospholipids, as well as the decomposition of labile carbon and nitrogen, were also enhanced in the phosphorus-deficient soils. In contrast, microbial communities in the phosphorus-rich soils showed increased gene abundances for the degradation of recalcitrant aromatic compounds, transformation of nitrogenous compounds and assimilation of sulfur. Overall, these results demonstrate the adaptive allocation of genes and proteins in soil microbial communities in response to shifting nutrient constraints.

AB 1. Ants are diverse and abundant, especially in tropical ecosystems. They are often cited as the agents of key ecological processes, but their precise contributions compared with other organisms have rarely been quantified. Through the removal of food resources from the forest floor and subsequent transport to nests, ants play an important role in the redistribution of nutrients in rainforests. This is an essential ecosystem process and a key energetic link between higher trophic levels, decomposers and primary producers.
   2. We used the removal of carbohydrate, protein and seed baits as a proxy to quantify the contribution that ants, other invertebrates and vertebrates make to the redistribution of nutrients around the forest floor, and determined to what extent there is functional redundancy across ants, other invertebrate and vertebrate groups.
   3. Using a large-scale, field-based manipulation experiment, we suppressed ants from c. 1ha plots in a lowland tropical rainforest in Sabah, Malaysia. Using a combination of treatment and control plots, and cages to exclude vertebrates, we made food resources available to: (i) the whole foraging community, (ii) only invertebrates and (iii) only non-ant invertebrates. This allowed us to partition bait removal into that taken by vertebrates, non-ant invertebrates and ants. Additionally, we examined how the non-ant invertebrate community responded to ant exclusion.
   4. When the whole foraging community had access to food resources, we found that ants were responsible for 52% of total bait removal whilst vertebrates and non-ant invertebrates removed the remaining 48%. Where vertebrates were excluded, ants carried out 61% of invertebrate-mediated bait removal, with all other invertebrates removing the remaining 39%. Vertebrates were responsible for just 24% of bait removal and invertebrates (including ants) collectively removed the remaining 76%. There was no compensation in bait removal rate when ants and vertebrates were excluded, indicating low functional redundancy between these groups.
   5. This study is the first to quantify the contribution of ants to the removal of food resources from rainforest floors and thus nutrient redistribution. We demonstrate that ants are functionally unique in this role because no other organisms compensated to maintain bait removal rate in their absence. As such, we strengthen a growing body of evidence establishing ants as ecosystem engineers, and provide new insights into the role of ants in maintaining key ecosystem processes. In this way, we further our basic understanding of the functioning of tropical rainforest ecosystems.

AB Woody encroachment due to changes in climate or in the disturbance regimes (fire and herbivory) has been observed throughout the savannah biome over the last century with ecological, hydrological and socioeconomic consequences. We assessed changes in tree density and basal area and estimated changes in rain interception by the canopies across a 5-year period over a biomass gradient in Cerrado vegetation protected from fire. We modelled throughfall, stemflow and net rainfall on the basis of tree basal area (TBA). Tree density increased by an average annual rate of 6.7%, basal area at 5.7% and rain interception by the canopies at 0.6% of the gross rainfall. Independent of the vegetation structure, we found a robust relationship of 0.9% less rainfall reaching the ground as TBA increases by 1 m(2) ha(-1). Increases in tree biomass with woody encroachment may potentially result in less water available for uptake by plants and to recharge rivers and groundwater reserves. Given that water is a seasonally scarce resource in all savannahs, woody encroachment may threaten the ecosystem services related to water resources.

AB Treefall gaps are the "engines of regeneration'' in tropical forests and are loci of high tree recruitment, growth, and carbon accumulation. Gaps, however, are also sites of intense competition between lianas and trees, whereby lianas can dramatically reduce tree carbon uptake and accumulation. Because lianas have relatively low biomass, they may displace far more biomass than they contribute, a hypothesis that has never been tested with the appropriate experiments. We tested this hypothesis with an 8-yr liana removal experiment in central Panama. After 8 years, mean tree biomass accumulation was 180% greater in lianafree treefall gaps compared to control gaps. Lianas themselves contributed only 24% of the tree biomass accumulation they displaced. Scaling to the forest level revealed that lianas in gaps reduced net forest woody biomass accumulation by 8.9% to nearly 18%. Consequently, lianas reduce whole-forest carbon uptake despite their relatively low biomass. This is the first study to demonstrate experimentally that plant-plant competition can result in ecosystemwide losses in forest carbon, and it has critical implications for recently observed increases in liana density and biomass on tropical forest carbon dynamics.

AB The correlation between vegetation patterns (species distribution and richness) and altitudinal variation has been widely reported for tropical forests, thereby providing theoretical basis for biodiversity conservation. However, this relationship may have been oversimplified, as many other factors may influence vegetation patterns, such as disturbances, topography and geographic distance. Considering these other factors, our primary question was: is there a vegetation pattern associated with substantial altitudinal variation (10-1,093 m a.s.l.) in the Atlantic Rainforest-a top hotspot for biodiversity conservation-and, if so, what are the main factors driving this pattern? We addressed this question by sampling 11 1-ha plots, applying multivariate methods, correlations and variance partitioning. The Restinga (forest on sandbanks along the coastal plains of Brazil) and a lowland area that was selectively logged 40 years ago were floristically isolated from the other plots. The maximum species richness (> 200 spp. per hectare) occurred at approximately 350 m a.s.l. (submontane forest). Gaps, multiple stemmed trees, average elevation and the standard deviation of the slope significantly affected the vegetation pattern. Spatial proximity also influenced the vegetation pattern as a structuring environmental variable or via dispersal constraints. Our results clarify, for the first time, the key variables that drive species distribution and richness across a large altitudinal range within the Atlantic Rainforest.

AB Ecologists have long sought to explain the coexistence of multiple potentially competing species in local assemblages. This is especially challenging in species-rich assemblages in which interspecific competition is intense, as it often is in ant assemblages. As a result, a suite of mechanisms has been proposed to explain coexistence among potentially competing ant species: the dominance-discovery tradeoff, the dominance-thermal tolerance tradeoff, spatial segregation, temperature-based niche partitioning, and temporal niche partitioning. Through a series of observations and experiments, we examined a deciduous forest ant assemblage in eastern North America for the signature of each of these coexistence mechanisms. We failed to detect evidence for any of the commonly suggested mechanisms of coexistence, with one notable exception: ant species appear to temporally partition foraging times such that behaviourally dominant species foraged more intensely at night, while foraging by subdominant species peaked during the day. Our work, though focused on a single assemblage, indicates that many of the commonly cited mechanisms of coexistence may not be general to all ant assemblages. However, temporal segregation may play a role in promoting coexistence among ant species in at least some ecosystems, as it does in many other organisms.

AB 1. Density-dependent survival is prevalent in tropical forests and is recognized as a potentially important mechanism for maintaining tree species diversity. However, there is little knowledge of how density dependence changes in fluctuating environments. 2. Across the 20-ha Xishuangbanna tropical seasonal rain forest dynamics plot in southwest China, which has distinct dry and wet seasons, we monitored seedling survival in 453 1-m2 quadrats over 2 years. Density dependence was assessed using generalized linear mixed models with crossed random effects. 3. When pooling all species at the community level, there were strong negative effects of conspecific tree neighbours on seedling survival over the dry-season, wet-season and 2-year intervals. The proportion of conspecific seedling neighbours had a significant negative effect in the dry season, but not in the wet season. 4. At the species level, the effects of conspecific tree and seedling neighbours varied widely among species in the community and were significantly positively related to population basal area in the community over the dry-season interval. In contrast, over the wet-season interval, the effects of conspecific tree and seedling neighbours did not significantly vary among species in the community. Overall community- and species-level results suggest that local-scale negative density dependence (NDD) tends to be stronger in the dry than wet season in the Xishuangbanna tropical forest. 5. At the scale of the 20-ha plot, we found a community compensatory trend (CCT), in which rare species had relatively higher seedling survival than common species in both the wet and dry seasons. A positive association between potential NDD and population basal area suggests that the CCT results from local-scale NDD, specifically because of negative effects of conspecific tree neighbours. 6. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that the strength of density-dependent seedling survival can vary between seasons and among species in tropical forests. Future research is needed to assess the underlying mechanisms of this temporal and interspecific variation in NDD and its consequences for species coexistence and community composition.

AB Over the last decade, hundreds of payments for ecosystem services (PES) programmes have been initiated around the world, but evidence of their environmental benefits remains limited. In this study, two PES programmes operating in the municipality of Coatepec (Mexico) were evaluated to assess their effectiveness in protecting the region's endangered upland forests. Landsat satellite data were analysed to assess changes in forest cover before and after programme implementation using a difference-indifferences estimator. Additionally, surveys and interviews were conducted with local residents and a subset of PES programme participants to evaluate the programmes' social and environmental impacts, particularly the effect of the programmes on landowner behaviour. The remote-sensing data show that deforestation was substantially lower on properties receiving PES payments compared to properties not enrolled in the programmes, but the programmes did not prevent the net loss of forests within Coatepec. Moreover, the on-site interviews suggest that the payments may have had little impact on deforestation rates, and that other factors contributed to the conservation of forests in PES properties. These findings suggest that risk-targeted payments, robust monitoring and enforcement programmes, and additional conservation initiatives should be included in all PES schemes to ensure environmental effectiveness.

AB Aim
   Epiphytic bryophyte communities of tropical forests show a gradient in species composition from the base to the top of the host trees, indicating a strong role of niche assembly. This pattern, however, has never been tested at a regional scale. The aim of this study was to test whether niche assembly, rather than dispersal limitation, predominantly drives species composition of bryophyte communities across large spatial scales.
   Location
   Three lowland forests in the Guianas: one near Saul, French Guiana; and two near Mabura Hill, Guyana.
   Methods
   Communities of epiphytic bryophytes were sampled from six different height zones of several trees in three lowland forests. We analysed the composition of these communities using detrended correspondence analysis in order to find the best explanatory variable for the variation in community composition. A multi-response permutation procedure was used to test the significance of grouping communities by height zone. We conducted an indicator species analysis to classify species as specialists or generalists and then tested, through weighted averaging, if specialists would indeed maintain their preferred height zone across the Guianas.
   Results
   Community composition was explained mainly by height zone. The similarity among communities inhabiting the same height zone of trees, across a distance of up to 640 km, was higher than the similarity among communities established along the vertical gradient of a single standing tree (30-50 m). More than half (57%) of the species had a preferred height zone, and the preference was consistent: species occupied roughly the same height zone on host trees in the different localities. The three local communities investigated were found to belong to the same regional species pool.
   Main conclusions
   Throughout the Guianas, epiphytic bryophyte communities are drawn from the same regional species pool, and their composition is shaped by micro-environmental conditions. The predominance of niche assembly over dispersal assembly rules is consistently found at both local and regional scales.

AB To examine whether the Janzen-Connell mechanism applies to temperate forests, seedling survival and causes of mortality were investigated at two distances (beneath, far) from conspecific adults and at two densities (high, low) at each distance for seedlings (n = 7935) of eight tree species co-occurring in a hardwood forest. Six of the eight species showed distance- and/or density-dependent seedling mortality mainly caused by diseases and rodents. In four of the five species primarily killed by disease (i.e. damping-off, blight, rot, powdery mildew), the infectivity (probability of infection by the disease) and/or the virulence (proportion of seedlings killed to those infected by the disease) were higher beneath than far from conspecific adults. These findings suggest that host specificity and/or spatially heterogeneous activity of natural enemies play an important role in the reciprocal replacement of tree species, maintaining species diversity in temperate forests.

AB Seed predation and seed dispersal are key factors that determine plant recruitment. In this study, we compared the role of small (< 200 g) and 'large' mammals as predators of Araucaria angustifolia (Araucariaceae) seeds in the Brazilian Araucaria Forest. We also investigated the effect of deposition site, namely open grassland, forest edge or forest interior (> 50 m from the edge) on seed-removal rates. We conducted field experiments on seed removal in July 2003 and 2004. We compared the habitat types using two exclusion treatments: semi-permeable exclosure (exclusive access of small rodents) and an open control (access of all mammal groups). We considered proportion of seeds removed after 15 days to investigate the effect of year, habitat type, and exclusion treatment on seed removal by using three-factor permutational ANOVA. We also evaluated seed fate and seed consumers by using spool-and-line devices attached to seeds and camera trapping. The results showed that seed removal differed significantly between years and among habitat types, but not between exclusion treatments. Removal rates were higher in 2004 than in 2003 and also were significantly lower in the open field when compared with both forested types (edge or interior) in both years. There was also a significant interaction between 'year' and 'habitat' which was driven by an increase in 2004 removal rates in the open field compared to the previous year. Our combination of manipulative experiments, camera-trapping survey, and spool-and-line seed tracking demonstrated that small rodents are responsible for the majority of seed removal of A. angustifolia in the study area. The low removal rates in open habitats indicate that they could serve as safe sites for A. angustifolia seeds. The results also suggested a potential role of small rodents as seed dispersers (about 4% of removed seeds were not consumed). The knowledge of how fragmentation affects pattern of seed predation and establishment of A. angustifolia through changes in abundance of different-sized mammals is essential for the conservation of the Brazilian Araucaria Forest and its most characteristic species.

AB Multiple-use forest management (MFM) for timber, non-timber forest products and environmental services is envisioned by many as a preferable alternative to timber-dominant management models. It is praised as a more equitable strategy of satisfying the demands from multiple stakeholders, an ecologically more benign harvesting approach, and a way of adding more value to forests making them more robust to conversion. MFM thus represents a common and prime management objective under the sustainable forest management (SFM) paradigm. However, its implementation has been lagging behind the expectations, particularly in the tropics. In this paper. we analyze selected MFM implementation examples to try to explain why. We scrutinize the tropical forestry debate to find that the meaning of MFM has undergone significant changes along the way, and that the topic depends heavily on the scale of inspection. Also, we examine the conditions that either favor or constrain MFM adoption. At the local scale, the factors that set the scene for multiple-use approaches to be successfully adopted are favorable governance conditions relate to land-devolution policies, effective collective institutions, and multiagent forest-management models. MFM feasibility also depends on the stage of forest transition, i.e. in society's economic development. MFM (at the stand level) dominates in poor subsistence-oriented autarchic forest settings, it typically declines when entering capitalist stages of specialized commodity production, but may then rebound (at the landscape level) in more advanced development stages. Key factors MFM generally is up against range from intricate technical trade-offs to the economies of scale in forestry production and marketing. MFM remains a valid management alternative under specifically favorable local context conditions, especially when practiced at the landscape scale, but these conditions are less frequent than commonly assumed.

AB Using long-term data on two kangaroo rats in the Chihuahuan Desert of North America, we fitted logistic models including the exogenous effects of seasonal rainfall patterns. Our aim was to test the effects of intraspecific interactions and seasonal rainfall in explaining and predicting the numerical fluctuations of these two kangaroo rats. We found that logistic models fit both data sets quite well; Dipodomys merriami showed lower maximum per capita growth rates than Dipodomys ordii, and in both cases logistic models were nonlinear. Summer rainfall appears to be the most important exogenous effect for both rodent populations; models including this variable were able to predict independent data better than models including winter rainfall. D. merriami was also negatively affected by another kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis), consistent with previous experimental evidence. We hypothesized that summer rainfall influences the carrying capacity of the environment by affecting seed availability and the intensity of intraspecific competition.

AB Habitat isolation is one of the most important factors endangering the biodiversity, but little research has been done with vascular epiphytes. In order to understand the effect of isolation on the epiphyte community, we studied epiphyte diversity on three plots in a forest fragment, two riparian forest fragments, and in isolated pastureland trees. We found 118 vascular epiphyte species. On forest plots, both epiphyte richness per tree (S-tree) and species turnover rate within trees (beta(tree)) registered the highest values, although the lowest S-tree diversity was also found there; additionally inside the forest were host species with clearly different epiphyte community. S-tree and beta(tree) diversities of riparian fragments behaved similarly to those of the forest. Isolated trees had the second highest S-tree diversity, although their beta(tree) diversity was the lowest. In the forest plots were both, the highest and lowest expected accumulated richness (alpha diversity); on riparian fragments it was intermediate, and the second lowest alpha diversity was registered for isolated trees. Species turnover rate among plots (beta) was high and was associated with both, isolation and a distance gradient from permanent water sources. The epiphyte community on isolated trees was clearly different to the other habitats. Results suggest that deforestation eliminated dry areas and specific hosts that were important for the maintenance of epiphyte species richness. In pastureland trees the epiphyte beta(tree) diversity diminished, suggesting a simplification of the environment for epiphytes and causing a low alpha diversity.

AB We use a two-species model of plant competition to explore the effect of intraspecific variation on community dynamics. The competitive ability ("performance") of each individual is assigned by an independent random draw from a species-specific probability distribution. If the density of individuals competing for open space is high (e.g., because fecundity is high), species with high maximum (or large variance in) performance are favored, while if density is low, species with high typical (e.g., mean) performance are favored. If there is an interspecific mean-variance performance trade-off, stable coexistence can occur across a limited range of intermediate densities, but the stabilizing effect of this trade-off appears to be weak. In the absence of this trade-off, one species is superior. In this case, intraspecific variation can blur interspecific differences (i.e., shift the dynamics toward what would be expected in the neutral case), but the strength of this effect diminishes as competitor density increases. If density is sufficiently high, the inferior species is driven to extinction just as rapidly as in the case where there is no overlap in performance between species. Intraspecific variation can facilitate coexistence, but this may be relatively unimportant in maintaining diversity in most real communities.

AB Qualitative and quantitative coal petrological analyses have been undertaken on the laminated lignite at the base of the Cobham Lignite Bed, from Scalers Hill, Kent, England. The maximum negative carbon isotope excursion, which marks the beginning of the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), occurs near the top of the laminated lignite. The lignite contains inertinite, a petrographic term used to describe charcoal. The laminated lignite has inertinite-rich and inertinite-poor layers indicative of episodic fires and post-fire erosion. Charcoal clasts are derived from living or recently senesced plants and are dominated by the leaf stalks of herbaceous ferns and wood fragments from flowering plants. The charcoal assemblage reflects a low-diversity flora, possibly adapted to disturbance by fire, derived from a source vegetation subjected to seasonal surface wildfires. The environmental conditions leading up to and across the onset of the PETM are, therefore, interpreted as incorporating a persistent fire regime with episodic wildfires followed by rainfall and runoff events. Abundant charcoal indicates near-modern oxygen levels whereas the absence of charred peat in this area calls into question previous suggestions that burning of Palaeocene peats might have contributed to the short-lived negative carbon isotope excursion at the Palaeocene-Eocene boundary.

AB Evidence supporting an association between phenotypic plasticity and invasiveness across a range of plant taxa is based primarily on comparisons between invasive species and native species whose potential invasiveness is typically unknown. Comparison of invasive and non-invasive exotic species would provide a better test of whether plasticity promotes invasion. Such comparisons should distinguish between adaptive and non-adaptive plasticity because they have different consequences for invasiveness. Adaptive plasticity is expected to promote the invasion of multiple habitats, but non-adaptive plasticity may reflect specialization for invading more favorable habitats only. We grew four invasive and four non-invasive species of the Commelinaceae with and without competitors and compared their putatively adaptive plasticity of three traits related to competitive ability and non-adaptive plasticity in performance. The invasive species grew significantly more than the non-invasive species only in the non-competitive environment. The invasive species had greater plasticity of performance (total biomass) in response to competition than non-invasives, but there was no consistent difference in the plasticities of the traits related to competitive ability. These results are consistent with specialization of these invasive taxa for invading the more productive non-competitive environment rather than a superior ability to invade both competitive and non-competitive environments. A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between plasticity and invasiveness will require many more comparisons of the plasticity of invasive and non-invasive taxa in a range of traits in response to a variety of environments.

AB As primary forest is cleared, pastures and secondary forest occupy an increasing space in the Amazonian landscape. We evaluated the effect of forest clearing on a soil macrofauna (invertebrate) community in a smallbolder farming system of southeastern Amazonia. We sampled the soil macrofauna in 22 plots of forest, upland rice fields, pastures, and fallows of different ages. In total, we collected 10, 728 invertebrates. In cleared plots the species richness per plot of the soil macrofauna fell from 76 to 30 species per plot immediately after forest clearance, and the composition of the new community was different. Ants, termites, and spiders were most affected by the disturbance. In plots deforested several years before, the effect of forest clearance was highly dependent on the type of land use (pasture or fallow). In fallows, the community was similar to the initial state. The species richness per plot in old fallows rose to 66, and the composition was closer to the primary forests than to the other types of land use. On the contrary, in the pastures the species richness per plot remained low at 47. In fallows, all the groups showed a richness close to that in primary forest, whereas in the forest only the richness of earthworms and Coleoptera recovered. Our results show that forest clearing constitutes a major disturbance for the soil macrofauna and that the recovery potential of the soil macrofauna after 6 or 7 years is much higher in fallows than in pastures. Thus, fallows may play a crucial role in the conservation of soil macrofauna.

AB Amongst the various hypotheses that challenged to explain the coexistence of species with similar life histories, theoretical, and empirical studies suggest that spatial processes may slow down competitive exclusion and hence promote coexistence even in the absence of evident trade-offs and frequent disturbances. We investigated the effects of spatial pattern and density on the relative importance of intra- and interspecific competition in a field experiment. We hypothesized that weak competitors increased biomass and seed production within neighborhoods of conspecifics, while stronger competitors would show increased biomass and seed production within neighborhoods of heterospecifics. Seeds of four annual plant species (Capsella bursa-pastoris, Stachys annua, Stellaria media, Poa annua) were sown in two spatial patterns (aggregated vs. random) and at two densities (low vs. high) in three different species combinations (monocultures, three and four species mixtures). There was a hierarchy in biomass production among the four species and C. bursa-pastoris and S. media were among the weak competitors. Capsella and Stellaria showed increased biomass production and had more individuals in the aggregated compared to the random pattern, especially when both superior competitors (S. annua, P. annua) were present. For P. annua we observed considerable differences among species combinations and unexpected pattern effects. Our findings support the hypothesis that weak competitors increase their fitness when grown in the neighborhood of conspecifics, and suggested that for the weakest competitors the species identity is not important and all other species are best avoided through intraspecific aggregation. In addition, our data suggest that the importance of spatial pattern for the other competitors might not only depend on the position within the hierarchy but also on the identity of neighbor species, species characteristics, below ground interactions, and other nonspatial factors.

AB Few individuals in canopy tree species attain the canopy and reproduce. Understanding why these select few succeed is fundamental to tree population ecology and forest community dynamics. Yet our understanding remains poor, because the time required to reach the canopy is long relative to experimental and demographic studies. We used a simple, yet powerful, approach to examine the long-term process of canopy recruitment. We compared early growth in proven "winners" (extant canopy trees) with that of "contenders" (extant saplings 75 cm tall to 5 cm dbh). The resulting analyses relate early radial growth (after reaching 50 cm height) to survival, implicit in the long-term persistence of winners. We focused on the three major tree species of subalpine forests in the northeastern United States: shade-intolerant mountain birch (Betula cordifolia), shade-tolerant balsam fir (Abies balsamea), and highly shade-tolerant red spruce (Picea rubens).
   For all species, extant canopy trees grew faster than extant saplings at equivalent ages and sizes. For shade-intolerant B. cord folia, no surviving canopy trees, or even saplings, had slow early growth. Even in shade-tolerant A. balsamea and P. rubens, surprisingly few individuals with slow early growth were represented in the canopy, even though both saplings and canopy trees survived slow growth for up to 50 years later in life. Thus, long-term success in reaching the canopy was strongly determined by fast early growth rates, across all species and life histories. We discuss implications for understanding the physiology of shade tolerance and for modeling forest dynamics. Most current models of forest tree population and community dynamics ignore individual growth history, but our results suggest that failure to account for growth history may overestimate long-term survival of shade-tolerant species.

AB Although accurate reconstructions of Amazonian palaeoclimates are central to understanding the distribution and history of Neotropical biodiversity, current reconstructions based on proxy data are discordant and Subject to intense debate. We review some Current thinking in Amazonian climatology and incorporate some new ideas in an attempt to explain the apparently contradictory records of palaeoprecipitation from across the Amazon Basin. We suggest that palaeoecologists need to recognise that organised convective radiation, the process that induces most wet season rainfall in Amazonia, should be treated as a phenomenon related to, but separate from, the passage of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Decoupling ITCZ migration from larger convective activity provides a mechanism to account for observed palaeoclimatic heterogeneity. Patterns of observed precipitation change are consistent with the long-term persistence of closed forest across Much of Amazonia, indicating that the greatest changes in precipitation during the last glacial maximum came during the wet season, which would have little negative impact on forest extent. Neotropical cooling at the last glacial maximum (LGM) is widely accepted, although the estimates of that cooling range between 1degreesC and >5degreesC. In answering the basic question 'What is meant by cooling?' we observe that interhemispheric ice mass asymmetry may have caused cooling to be manifested differently according to location. A terrestrial cooling of ca. 5degreesC, as well as radiative cooling and event-based cooling combined to induce vegetation change. Probably, both absolute temperature and mean monthly minima were reduced by polar air incursions in the northern Neotropics. However, in the southern Neotropics, mean monthly minima were reduced by more frequent incursions of Patagonian air masses, but absolute minima may have been largely unchanged.

AB Animals aid population growth and fitness in tropical forest communities through dispersal and negatively impact populations through seed predation. The interaction between dispersal and seed predation can produce distance- or density-dependence; powerful mechanisms for maintaining species diversity incorporated in the Janzen-Connell model. Large mammals, the highest biomass seed predators of intact Amazonian communities and at risk due to human disturbance, are potentially central to these interactions. This study tests the Janzen-Connell model and investigates the impact of mammalian seed predators on seedling recruitment and maintenance of tree diversity. Patterns of both vertebrate and invertebrate seed predation and seedling recruitment were studied in the two most abundant canopy tree species in western Amazonia (Arecaceae: Astrocaryum murumuru and Iriartea deltoidea). We specifically examined effects of both spatial and temporal variation of the highest biomass seed predator in southwest Amazonian forests, the white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), on recruitment through disturbed and undisturbed sites and through a fortuitous 12 year natural extinction and recolonization event of T. pecari. Distance-dependent seedling recruitment was found in Astrocaryum and Iriartea at both sites. However, the median distance of seedlings was similar to1.5x farther from reproductive adults in both palms at the undisturbed site. The number of Iriartea seeds escaping predation increased 6,000% in both space and time due to the decline of T. pecari abundance. The results demonstrate that Janzen-Connell effects are stronger in intact ecosystems and tie these mechanistically to changes in seed predator abundance. This study shows that anthropogenic changes in mammal communities decrease the magnitude of Janzen-Connell effects in Amazonian forests and may result in decreases in tree diversity.

AB This paper explores the effects of spatial resolution on the performance and applicability of habitat models in wildlife management and conservation. A Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) model for the Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) in the Bavarian Alps, Germany, is presented. The model was exclusively built on non-spatial, small-scale variables of forest structure and without any consideration of landscape patterns. The main goal was to assess whether a HSI model developed from small-scale habitat preferences can explain differences in population abundance at larger scales. To validate the model, habitat variables and indirect sign of Capercaillie use (such as feathers or feces) were mapped in six study areas based on a total of 2901 20 m radius (for habitat variables) and 5 m radius sample plots (for Capercaillie sign). First, the model's representation of Capercaillie habitat preferences was assessed. Habitat selection, as expressed by Ivlev's electivity index, was closely related to HSI scores, increased from poor to excellent habitat suitability, and was consistent across all study areas. Then, habitat use was related to HSI scores at different spatial scales. Capercaillie use was best predicted from HSI scores at the small scale. Lowering the spatial resolution of the model stepwise to 36-ha, 100-ha, 400-ha, and 2000-ha areas and relating Capercaillie use to aggregated HSI scores resulted in a deterioration of fit at larger scales. Most importantly, there were pronounced differences in Capercaillie abundance at the scale of study areas, which could not be explained by the HSI model. The results illustrate that even if a habitat model correctly reflects a species' smaller scale habitat preferences, its potential to predict population abundance at larger scales may remain limited.

AB Discussion about thrips (Thysanoptera) as main pollinators has been controversial in the past because thrips (to not fit the preconception of an effective pollinator. In this study, we present evidence for thrips pollination in the dioecious pioneer tree genus Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) Macaranga hullettii is pollinated predominantly by one thrips species, Neoheegeria sp. (Phlaeothripidae. Thysanoptera) As a reward for pollinators, the protective floral bracteoles function as breeding sites for thrips and trichomal nectaries on the adaxial surface of the floral bracteoles provide alimentation Flowering phenology of both staminate and pistillate trees was highly synchronized within 3-4 wk periods. In contrast to pistillate trees, staminate trees start to breed the thrips inside the developing inflorescences similar to2 wk before anthesis Breeding of Neoheegeria sp in the laboratory indicates that the thrips development is completed within similar to17 d Thus, staminate trees offer breeding sites for one thrips generation until the onset of pollen presentation. Intraspecific pollen transfer by thrips was proved by pollen loads of thrips taken from receptive pistillate inflorescences of M. hullettu Bagging experiments of different mesh sizes showed that seed set reached almost the level of open-pollinated flowers when exclusively tiny insects like thrips were able to enter the net bags, but no apomictic seed set occurred when no insect access was given to the flowers.

AB The factors and processes that regulate Douglas-fit (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France) natural regeneration in southwestern Argentina are unknown. We investigated (i) the germination responses of P. menziesii seeds to variations in the radiation and thermal environments imposed by canopy cover and litter, (ii) the effects of litter on seedling emergence, and (iii) the effects of understory vegetation on seedling performance and seed and seedling predation. Seed germination was high in darkness and under canopies. Under a combination of canopy types and litter covers, germination showed a negative correlation with temperature between 23 and 40 degrees C. Germination was not altered by changes in red/far-red ratio. These results suggest that the presence of an overstory canopy promotes P. menziesii seed germination compared with a no-canopy situation (e.g., a clearcut). Litter inhibited seedling emergence by reducing water availability and by acting as a mechanical barrier. Understory vegetation (established saplings) reduced seedling growth and survival. However, our results suggest that direct competition between seedlings and understory vegetation is not the principal force regulating regeneration; indirect effects appear to be of paramount importance because P. menziesii seed and seedling consumption (presumably by rodents) is greatly encouraged by the presence of dense vegetation patches in the understory.

AB We studied the effectiveness of three species of turacos, the Great Blue Turaco, the Ruwenzori Turaco, and the Black-billed Turaco, as seed dispersers in a tropical forest in Rwanda. For each species of turaco, we examined two factors affecting the effectiveness of seed dispersal: (1) the proportion of ingested seeds dispersed away from the parent tree and (2) the distances seeds were dispersed. To estimate these measures of effectiveness, we systematically observed the foraging activities of focal birds over a 14-month period. We also fed six species of tree fruits to captive Ruwenzori Turacos to determine the gut retention times for seeds of various sizes. Based on these measures, we calculated the seed shadows generated by each turaco species for tree seeds with either long or-short gut retention times. The gut retention time of seeds was not correlated with seed size, but was positively correlated with the time interval over which seeds were defecated. Seeds with a long gut retention time were not only dispersed farther away from the parent tree, but were also deposited over a longer time period and were thus likely to be dispersed over a greater variety of habitats. Of the three turacos? the Ruwenzori Turaco deposited the highest percentage of ingested seeds away from the parent tree because it had the shortest residence time in feeding trees. However, the Ruwenzori Turaco also dispersed seeds for the shortest distance, partly due to its short flight distances. The Great Blue Turaco on average dispersed seeds the farthest due to its long flight distance and long gut retention time. The Black-billed Turaco, which fed least frequently, deposited seeds more evenly among perching sites than did the other two species. All three species of turacos dispersed over 80% of ingested seeds away from the parent tree.

AB A total of 985 rocks with a wide range of surface areas were examined from six locations at Signy Island in the maritime Antarctic. The shallowest site was intertidal and the deepest at 42 m. The probability of coralline algae occurring was found to increase with surface area and depth of rocks, implying decreased levels of turnover or physical disturbance with increasing rock size and depth. Percent area colonised, number of animal phyla, bryozoan species and bryozoan colonies all increased both with rock surface area and depth. The largest rocks in the intertidal had broadly similar levels of colonisation and community development as did the smallest at 42 m. Thus, because of depth-dependent ice-scour, community development in the Antarctic sublittoral may be followed along a pseudo-time sequence by using two axes (substratum size and depth) of environmental stability. Frequent disturbance appears to be responsible for maintaining the level of diversity and preventing monopolisation. Bryozoans and polychaetes were the most abundant encrusting animal groups, although tunicates and sponges were the dominant overgrowth competitors. The faunal elements of the colonising biota were almost entirely confined to the undersurfaces of rocks whereas algae dominated upper surfaces. In most bryozoan species the proportion of colonies occurring on the upper surfaces of rocks increased with depth to 34 m and then decreased at 42 m where silt deposition apparently became a major influence. Such a shift in distribution may reflect decreasing current velocities, and therefore reduced disturbance to animal feeding, and/or decreasing growth of coralline algae due to reduced light availability.

AB Mortality factors most likely to constitute substantial selective pressures for early juvenile gastropods on temperate rocky shores were identified by examining the vulnerability of hatchlings of an intertidal snail, Nucella emarginata, to heat stress, desiccation, and predation in 1992 and 1993. The highest temperature of substrata measured at tidal heights colonized by N. emarginata in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada, was 28.5 degrees C. This temperature was not lethal to hatchlings in laboratory tests. In laboratory and field desiccation experiments, all hatchlings died within 6 h of emersion. Early juveniles could not survive direct exposure to even moderate drying conditions for the duration of a low tide. Hence, intertidal microhabitats which dry up even for short periods during low tides would prove lethal. Of 45 intertidal animal species to which hatchlings were exposed in the laboratory, small decapod crustaceans were the only organisms to cause substantial hatchling mortality. Of these, Pagurus hirsutiusculus and Hemigrapsus nudus were by far the most abundant in the field, and are probably the only important predators of early juvenile N. emarginata at most sites. Total predator densities in the field were as high as 438 individuals m(-2), suggesting that predation pressure may be intense. Desiccation and predation by decapod crustaceans appear to be the most significant threats to early juvenile N. emarginata. These factors commonly occur on most temperate rocky shores and undoubtedly constitute major selective agents influencing population parameters and shaping life-history strategies and early juvenile traits of intertidal invertebrates.

AB The influences of neighbors and flow regime on growth patterns and feeding rates of the bryozoan Electra pilosa were characterized in laboratory and field experiments. In laboratory studies, neighbors inhibited growth, while flow velocity exerted a negative effect on growth rates of isolated colonies but had no influence on growth rates of colonies with neighboring Electra upstream. There were no significant effects of neighborhood or flow on zooid dimensions. Field experiments, which only tested the influence of neighbors on growth, revealed a similar reduction in growth in the presence of neighbors. The growth responses displayed by Electra do not support predictions of adaptive strategy models: despite its noted range in colony morphology, Electra did not assume more runner-like shapes when growth conditions were poor. Rather, growth of Electra appeared to be a result of local astogenetic (colonial ontogenetic) rules. Colonies that fed from similar flows to those they had experienced in the laboratory provide evidence backing the common assumption that patterns of feeding result in growth responses and so may be related to fitness in colonial animals. Evidence that growth patterns resulted from feeding rates suggests a central role for the acquisition of food in the dynamics of benthic assemblages of suspension feeders.

AB The tropical forests of Borneo and Amazonia may each contain more tree species diversity in half a square kilometre than do all the temperate forests of Europe, North America, and Asia combined(1). Biologists have long been fascinated by this disparity, using it to investigate potential drivers of biodiversity(2). Latitudinal variation in many of these drivers is expected to create geographic differences in ecological(2-4) and evolutionary processes(4,5), and evidence increasingly shows that tropical ecosystems have higher rates of diversification, clade origination, and clade dispersal(5,6). However, there is currently no evidence to link gradients in ecological processes within communities at a local scale directly to the geographic gradient in biodiversity. Here, we show geographic variation in the storage effect, an ecological mechanism that reduces the potential for competitive exclusion more strongly in the tropics than it does in temperate and boreal zones, decreasing the ratio of interspecific-to-intraspecific competition by 0.25% for each degree of latitude that an ecosystem is located closer to the Equator. Additionally, we find evidence that latitudinal variation in climate underpins these differences; longer growing seasons in the tropics reduce constraints on the seasonal timing of reproduction, permitting lower recruitment synchrony between species and thereby enhancing niche partitioning through the storage effect. Our results demonstrate that the strength of the storage effect, and therefore its impact on diversity within communities, varies latitudinally in association with climate. This finding highlights the importance of biotic interactions in shaping geographic diversity patterns, and emphasizes the need to understand the mechanisms underpinning ecological processes in greater detail than has previously been appreciated.

AB Changes in species richness along climatological gradients have been instrumental in developing theories about the general drivers of biodiversity. Previous studies on microbial communities along climate gradients on mountainsides have revealed positive, negative and neutral richness trends. We examined changes in richness and composition of Fungi, Bacteria and Archaea in soil along a 50-1000 m elevation, 280-3280 mm/yr precipitation gradient in Hawai'i. Soil properties and their drivers are exceptionally well understood along this gradient. All three microbial groups responded strongly to the gradient, with community ordinations being similar along axes of environmental conditions (pH, rainfall) and resource availability (nitrogen, phosphorus). However, the form of the richness-climate relationship varied between Fungi (positive linear), Bacteria (unimodal) and Archaea (negative linear). These differences were related to resource-ecology and limiting conditions for each group, with fungal richness increasing most strongly with soil carbon, ammonia-oxidizing Archaea increasing with nitrogen mineralization rate, and Bacteria increasing with both carbon and pH. Reponses to the gradient became increasingly variable at finer taxonomic scales and within any taxonomic group most individual OTUs occurred in narrow climate-elevation ranges. These results show that microbial responses to climate gradients are heterogeneous due to complexity of underlying environmental changes and the diverse ecologies of microbial taxa.

AB Analysis of Earth observation (EO) data, often combined with geographical information systems (GIS), allows monitoring of land cover dynamics over different ecosystems, including protected or conservation sites. The aim of this study is to use contemporary technologies such as EO and GIS in synergy with fragmentation analysis, to quantify the changes in the landscape of the Rajaji National Park (RNP) during the period of 19years (1990-2009). Several statistics such as principal component analysis (PCA) and spatial metrics are used to understand the results. PCA analysis has produced two principal components (PC) and explained 84.1% of the total variance, first component (PC1) accounted for the 57.8% of the total variance while the second component (PC2) has accounted for the 26.3% of the total variance calculated from the core area metrics, distance metrics and shape metrics. Our results suggested that notable changes happened in the RNP landscape, evidencing the requirement of taking appropriate measures to conserve this natural ecosystem.

AB Analysing functional traits along environmental gradients can improve our understanding of the mechanisms structuring plant communities. Within forests, vertical gradients in light intensity, temperature and humidity are often pronounced. Vascular epiphytes are particularly suitable for studying the influence of these vertical gradients on functional traits because they lack contact with the soil and thus individual plants are entirely exposed to different environmental conditions, from the dark and humid understorey to the sunny and dry outer canopy. In this study, we analysed multiple aspects of the trait-based ecology of vascular epiphytes: shifts in trait values with height above ground (as a proxy for vertical environmental gradients) at community and species level, the importance of intra- vs. interspecific trait variability, and trait differences among taxonomic groups. We assessed ten leaf traits for 1151 individuals belonging to 83 epiphyte species of all major taxonomic groups co-occurring in a Panamanian lowland forest. Community mean trait values of many leaf traits were strongly correlated with height and particularly specific leaf area and chlorophyll concentration showed nonlinear, negative trends. Intraspecific trait variability was pronounced and accounted for one-third of total observed trait variance. Intraspecific trait adjustments along the vertical gradient were common and seventy per cent of all species showed significant trait-height relationships. In addition, intraspecific trait variability was positively correlated with the vertical range occupied by species. We observed significant trait differences between major taxonomic groups (orchids, ferns, aroids, bromeliads). In ferns, for instance, leaf dry matter content was almost twofold higher than in the other taxonomic groups. This indicates that some leaf traits are taxonomically conserved. Our study demonstrates that vertical environmental gradients strongly influence functional traits of vascular epiphytes. In order to understand community composition along such gradients, it is central to study several aspects of trait-based ecology, including both community and intraspecific trends of multiple traits.

AB Little is known about the potential of restoration plantations to provide appropriate understory conditions to support the establishment of seeds arriving from neighboring native forests. In this article, we investigated how seedling establishment is affected in the understory of restoration sites of different ages and assessed some of the potential environmental factors controlling this ecological process. We first compared the density and richness of native tree seedlings among 10-, 22-, and 55-year-old restoration plantations within the Atlantic Forest region of southeastern Brazil. Then, we undertook a seed addition experiment in each study site, during the wet season, and compared seedling emergence, survival, and biomass on local versus old-growth forest soil (transferred from a reference ecosystem), in order to test whether local substrate could hamper seedling establishment. As expected, the oldest restoration site had higher density and richness of spontaneously regenerating seedlings. However, seedling establishment was less successful both in the oldest restoration planting and using substrate transferred from a reference ecosystem, where emergence and survival were lower, but surviving seedlings grew better. We attribute these results to lower light availability for seedlings in the understory of the oldest site and speculate that higher incidence of pathogens on old-growth forest soil may have increased seedling mortality. We conclude that the understory of young restoration plantations provides suitable microsite conditions at the early establishment phases for the spontaneous regeneration or enrichment planting of native trees.

AB Understanding the ecological mechanisms driving beta diversity is a major goal of community ecology. Metacommunity theory brings new ways of thinking about the structure of local communities, including processes occurring at different spatial scales. In addition to new theories, new methods have been developed which allow the partitioning of individual and shared contributions of environmental and spatial effects, as well as identification of species and sites that have importance in the generation of beta diversity along ecological gradients. We analyzed the spatial distribution of dung beetle communities in areas of Atlantic Forest in a mainland-island scenario in southern Brazil, with the objective of identifying the mechanisms driving composition, abundance and biomass at three spatial scales (mainland-island, areas and sites). We sampled 20 sites across four large areas, two on the mainland and two on the island. The distribution of our sampling sites was hierarchical and areas are isolated. We used standardized protocols to assess environmental heterogeneity and sample dung beetles. We used spatial eigenfunctions analysis to generate the spatial patterns of sampling points. Environmental heterogeneity showed strong variation among sites and a mild increase with increasing spatial scale. The analysis of diversity partitioning showed an increase in beta diversity with increasing spatial scale. Variation partitioning based on environmental and spatial variables suggests that environmental heterogeneity is the most important driver of beta diversity at the local scale. The spatial effects were significant only at larger spatial scales. Our study presents a case where environmental heterogeneity seems to be the main factor structuring communities at smaller scales, while spatial effects are more important at larger scales. The increase in beta diversity that occurs at larger scales seems to be the result of limitation in species dispersal ability due to habitat fragmentation and the presence of geographical barriers.

AB The loss of species diversity due to habitat fragmentation has been extensively studied. In contrast, the impacts of habitat fragmentation on functional diversity remains relatively poorly understood. We conducted bird functional diversity studies on a set of 41 recently isolated land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China. We analysed differences in bird species richness and a recently developed suite of complementary functional diversity indices (FRic, volume of functional space occupied; FEve, evenness of abundance distribution in the functional trait space; FDiv, divergence in the distribution of abundance in the trait volume) across different gradients (island area and isolation). We found no correlations between FRic and FEve or FEve and FDiv, but negative correlations between FRic and FDiv. As predicted, island area accounted for most of the variation in bird species richness, whereas isolation explained most of the variation in species evenness (decreasing species evenness with increasing isolation). Functional diversity appears to be more strongly influenced by habitat filtering as opposed to limiting similarity. More specifically, across all islands, both FRic and FEve were significantly lower than expected for randomly assembled communities, but FDiv showed no clear patterns. FRic increased with island area, FEve decreased with island area and FDiv showed no clear patterns. Our finding that FEve decreases with island area at TIL may indicate low functional stability on such islands, and as such large islands and habitat patches may deserve extra attention and/or protection. These results help to demonstrate the importance of considering the effects of fragmentation on functional diversity in habitat management and reserve design plans.

AB Aim To test relationships between the richness and composition of vascular plants and birds and attributes of habitat fragments using a model land-bridge island system, and to investigate whether the effects of fragmentation differ depending on species natural history traits. Location Thousand Island Lake, China. Methods We compiled presence/absence data of vascular plant and bird species through exhaustive surveys of 41 islands. Plant species were assigned to two categories: shade-intolerant and shade-tolerant species; bird species were assigned to three categories: edge, interior, and generalist species. We analysed the relationships between island attributes (area, isolation, elevation, shape complexity, and perimeter to area ratio) and species richness using generalized linear models (GLMs). We also investigated patterns of composition in relation to island attributes using ordination (redundancy analysis). Results We found that island area explained a high degree of variation in the species richness of all species groups. The slope of the speciesarea relationship (z) was 0.16 for all plant species and 0.11 for all bird species. The lowest z-value was for generalist birds (0.04). The species richness of the three plant species groups was associated with island area per se, while that of all, generalist, and interior birds was explained mainly by elevation, and that of edge bird species was associated primarily with island shape. Patterns of species composition were most strongly related to elevation, island shape complexity, and perimeter to area ratio rather than to island area per se. Species richness had no significant relationship with isolation, but species composition did. We also found differential responses among the species groups to changes in island attributes. Main conclusions Within the Thousand Island Lake system, the effects of fragmentation on both bird and plant species appear to be scale-dependent and taxon-specific. The number of plant species occurring on an island is strongly correlated with island area, and the richness of birds and the species composition of plants and birds are associated with variables related to habitat heterogeneity. We conclude that the effects of fragmentation on species diversity and composition depend not only on the degree of habitat loss but also on the specific patterns of habitat fragmentation.

AB Cooperation among humans is highly dependent on social and institutional conditions, with individual incentives playing a key role in determining the level of cooperation achieved. Understanding the conditions under which cooperation can emerge has important implications for the design of resource management and wildlife conservation interventions. Incentive-based conservation approaches are being widely implemented, yet very few studies test the role of incentives in promoting cooperation in relevant developing country contexts. Using a common pool resource game, in four villages in Cambodia, we investigated how the level of within-group cooperation varies under different institutional arrangements, including opportunities for social approval, external enforcement of rules and individual and collective incentive payments. Our results demonstrate the significance of self-organisation, the ability to devise, monitor and enforce a set of rules, among resource users. Treatments which promoted self-organisation had the greatest effect in reducing individual extraction, achieved the greatest efficiencies and had the strongest interaction with group decision-making in reducing extraction. The effects of these treatments carried over to reduce extraction in subsequent treatments, irrespective of their institutional arrangements. These results suggest that policies designed to incentivise certain behaviour in local stakeholder groups may be more successful if they create opportunities for local decision-making.

AB Although vascular epiphytes contribute substantially to the biodiversity of tropical montane forests, it is unclear how their diversity and community composition is affected by forest alteration. We studied the response of vascular epiphyte assemblages to different intensities of land-use in a montane wet forest of northeastern Ecuador: (1) unmanaged mature forest; (2) mature forest with mid- and understorey opened for cattle grazing; and (3) isolated remnant trees in cattle pastures. The numbers of individuals and species of epiphytes per host tree did not differ significantly between land-use types, neither did total epiphyte species richness (n = 30 trees). However, total species richness of pteridophytes was significantly lower on isolated remnant trees compared to unmanaged forest, whereas several taxa rich in xerotolerant species (Bromeliaceae, Orchidaceae, Piperaceae) exhibited the opposite trend. An analysis of floristic composition using ordination (NMS) and randomisation techniques (MRPP) showed that epiphyte assemblages on isolated remnant trees were significantly distinct from unmanaged forest while managed forest was intermediate between those two vegetation types. Ordination analysis further indicated reduced floristic heterogeneity in disturbed habitats. These results suggest considerable, rapid species turnover since land-use change 6 years prior to study, with pteridophytes being replaced by more xerotolerant taxa. We attribute this floristic turnover primarily to changes in microclimate towards higher levels of light and desiccation stress associated with forest disturbance. Our results support the notion that community composition offers a more sensitive indicator of human disturbance than species richness. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Invasive species may establish in communities because they are better competitors than natives, but in order to remain community dominants, the competitive advantage of invasive species must be persistent. Native species that are not extirpated when highly invasive species are introduced are likely to compete with invaders. When population sizes and genetic diversity of native species are large enough, natives may be able to evolve traits that allow them to co-occur with invasive species. Native species may also evolve to become significant competitors with invasive species, and thus affect the fitness of invaders. Invasive species may respond in turn, creating either transient or continuing coevolution between competing species. In addition to demographic factors such as population size and growth rates, a number of factors including gene flow, genetic drift, the number of selection agents, encounter rates, and genetic diversity may affect the ability of native and invasive species to evolve competitive ability against one another. We discuss how these factors may differ between populations of native and invasive plants, and how this might affect their ability to respond to selection. Management actions that maintain genetic diversity in native species while reducing population sizes and genetic diversity in invasive species could promote the ability of natives to evolve improved competitive ability.

AB Understanding the influence of habitat alteration on population structure and persistence is critical for effective conservation strategies. Timber harvest and wildfire are two of the most prevalent disturbances across temperate forests, yet the long-term effects of these two forces on population connectivity have rarely been studied. We studied populations of the Rocky Mountain tailed frog (Ascaphus montanus) across landscapes that have experienced either timber harvest or broad scale fires. Rocky Mountain tailed frogs generally require forested habitat, and are a species of concern in managed forests. We used landscape genetic techniques to test the explanatory power of alternative paths of connectivity across both burned and harvested forests and identified topographical and climatic variables that significantly influenced gene flow. We found that timber harvest and fire led to different patterns of genetic connectivity. Widespread terrestrial gene flow was maintained across previously burned areas and connectivity was primarily limited by solar radiation. In contrast, gene flow among populations in managed forests followed riparian corridors, presumably to avoid the loss of cover due to timber harvest. Gene flow along riparian corridors in Rocky Mountain tailed frogs differs from a population of the closely related coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei), for which gene flow appears to occur primarily over land. These results suggest management of Rocky Mountain tailed frogs should focus on maintaining riparian buffer zones, which may be less effective for the coastal species. Thus, consideration of landscape differences is essential even for conservation of closely related, morphologically similar species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1. A trade-off between growth in high-light and survival in low-light of species is often proposed as a key mechanism underpinning the dynamics of trees in forest communities. Yet, growth and survival are known to depend on plant size and few studies have analysed how this trade-off can vary between juvenile life stages and the potential consequences of the trade-off for the differences in regeneration rate between species in mixed forests.
   2. We quantified growth and mortality for two different juvenile life stages-seedlings and saplings -of seven tree species common in temperate rain forests in New Zealand using data from field studies. We found strong evidence that the ranking of species for survival in shade and growth in full light was affected by size. There was a trade-off between seedling survival in low light and sapling height growth in high light, but no trade-offs were observed when considering other combinations of life stages (seedling growth vs. seedling survival, seedling growth vs. sapling survival, or sapling growth vs. sapling survival).
   3. We ran simulations with an individual-based forest dynamics model-SORTIE/NZ-to explore how the trade-off drives the differences in tree species regeneration success in gaps vs. under closed forest conditions. These simulations indicate that because species' ranks in shade tolerance varied with life stage, regeneration success was not predicted from knowledge of tree performance at a single life stage. For instance, high-light sapling growth was a strong determinant of regeneration success in forest gaps, but seedling growth was also influential. Under closed forest, regeneration success was primarily limited by low-light mortality at the seedling stage, but seedling growth and sapling survival were also influential.
   4. Synthesis. Growth-survival trade-offs can be strongly affected by the size of the individual analysed, resulting in completely different rankings of the shade tolerance of species across different juvenile life stages. Performance of both seedlings and saplings influenced regeneration success, highlighting the need to consider growth-survival trade-offs and the shade-tolerance strategies of tree species over a large range of juvenile sizes.

AB To improve our understanding of the distribution and abundance of amphibians and reptiles in tropical forests, herpetologists need to understand the relative effectiveness of different sampling techniques. However, current studies are biased by a focus on certain methods, species groups, or geographic regions. To address this problem, we conducted the first standardized comparison of patterns of species richness, rank-abundance, and community structure for both passive and active sampling methods for the study of herpetofauna in a tropical forest landscape. Moreover, we compare the effectiveness of these methods in primary and secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantation. Although different methods captured significantly different numbers of species and individuals, almost all techniques provided complementary benefits for the sampling of both lizards and leaf litter amphibians. The use of a limited set of methods can severely bias our understanding of changes in amphibian and lizard community structure in response to large-scale habitat change. Contrary to other studies, we recommend the use of pitfall traps in all studies, even Rapid Assessments (RAP), because they are indispensable for sampling many cryptic species, as well as being particularly cost effective for large-scale research. Because of the combination of complementary methods in sampling effectiveness, and the influence of method choice on taxon responses to habitat change, we recommend the use of multiple sampling techniques wherever possible. Synchronous adoption of multiple techniques in field studies will help improve sample representation and, thus, the understanding of species distributions and human impacts on herpetofauna in tropical forests.

AB The introduction of payments for environmental services ( PES) offers an opportunity for traditional and indigenous populations to be compensated for contributing to carbon sequestration in meeting the challenge of ameliorating global warming. As one mechanism among several for promoting biodiversity conservation and sustainable development, pro-poor PES initiatives could eventually be incorporated into an international post-Koyoto framework to encourage reduced emissions from deforestation. Brazil's Proambiente PES scheme for small farmers in Amazonia has enjoyed some limited success, but it has fallen short of expectations. Its performance has been undermined by the lack of a national legal framework, limited funding, reduced implementation capacity, poor cross-sector collaboration and incompatibility with existing regional development policies. These challenges are being addressed by the federal government in cooperation with civil society with a view to scaling up Proambiente into a national programme.

AB Extensive plot studies across Amazonia have demonstrated that there are large regional gradients in forest productivity and that the dynamics of the forests seem to have accelerated substantially in recent decades, with ensuing impacts on forest structure. Most of these sites are, however, one hectare plots nested within a heterogeneous landscape, and a clear need exists to understand the landscape and regional context of these studies. Remote sensing offers the potential to scale up from plot to higher landscape levels but it has proven complex to evaluate forest structure, and therefore biomass patterns in tropical areas, due to saturation, signal noises, and unclear relationships between reflectance values and structural properties, both for optical and radar systems. In this study, we explore the potential of a textural approach to detect landscape and regional variations in the structure of tropical forest canopies, as viewed from high resolution IKONOS satellite imagery. We used lacunarity analysis and a derived variable, the index of translational homogeneity (ITH), as a tool to search for structural and dynamic forest properties within and among different Amazonian landscapes. The main goals of this research were: (1) to examine the sensitivity and robustness of ITH analysis to details of the analysis procedure; (2) to explore the intra- and inter-regional textural properties of a variety of tropical forest canopies [Caxiuan (a) over tilde, Manaus, Sinop, Santarem (Brazil), and Tambopata (Peru)], and (3) to relate textural properties derived,from lacunarity to structural properties of the forest canopy, mainly crown size. Our results show how ITH and lacunarity analyses offer insights into the spatial distribution of structural properties of forest canopies, easily differentiating between terra firme forests and swamp forests. The studied forest canopies are self-similar on length-scales of 5-11 m, and show translational invariance on scales above 20 m (central and western Amazonia) and 30 m (eastern Amazonia) For a restricted range of solar elevation angles, the ITH appears to be determined mainly by the mean size of tree crowns, and by the fraction of large (shadow-generating) trees.

AB Reforestation has been suggested as a way to mitigate the effects of tropical rain forest loss. However, factors influencing the successful colonisation of biota into newly created rainforest are poorly understood. We assessed beetle species assemblages with flight interception traps, in sites undergoing rainforest restoration across the largely cleared landscape of the Atherton Tablelands in north-eastern Queensland, Australia. There were two levels of site age (2-4 years and 6-17 years) and two distances from intact rainforest (adjacent and > 0.9 km), with six sites in each treatment, together with six reference sites in each of pasture and small rainforest remnants (n = 36 sites). Multivariate metrics were used to assess the restored sites' relative similarity to pasture and rainforest, in terms of both physical habitat structure and beetle species composition within ten family groups. Older restoration sites were structurally most similar to rainforest. Older sites and those adjacent to rainforest had a more rainforest-like beetle species composition (without significant interaction). However, even the closer and older sites had a substantially lower abundance and richness of rainforest- associated beetles than did rainforest. Age effects were generally stronger than distance effects, with the latter appearing to be entirely driven by rare rainforest species. Beetle assemblage similarity to rainforest was more strongly correlated with structural similarity to rainforest than with age, except within older sites. The use of revegetation techniques which lead to more rainforest-like structural conditions appears to be of over-riding importance in catalysing the rapid acquisition of volant rainforest beetle assemblages in the initial stages of restoration.

AB Species response to forest fragmentation may strongly vary according to ecological requirements, shape, spatial configuration and connectivity of fragments, and the structure of the surrounding matrix. Bats are natural candidates for studies on forest fragmentation. However, the conclusions of such studies are often contradictory. We present the results of a study on the effects of forest fragmentation on bat communities in Alter do Chao, Santarem area, in Central Amazonia, Brazil, an area composed by forests and fragments surrounded by savanna-like vegetation. We compared the species composition between habitats, tested the effect of size, shape and density of trees of forested areas on the presence species and their relative frequency of captures, and investigated the savannas as an ecological barrier for the dispersion of bats. With an effort of 5678 mistnet-hours, we captured 3740 bats (64 species). Multidimensional Scaling indicated no strong separation between the habitats sampled, however, savanna sites were grouped distinctly of fragments and forest sites. Multiple linear regressions indicated no significant correlation between the number of bat species recorded and the size, shape or tree density in forest sites and fragments. There was a significant correlation between the number of captures and the variables tested, explained by the shape of the sites, but not by size or tree density. In general, sites with bigger shape indices had fewer captures. Ten of the 20 most captured species showed no significant difference between the three habitats. The bat communities in Alter do Chao were not strongly affected by forest fragmentation, and the savannas did not appear to act as an ecological barrier to bats. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB over the past few decades, the montane forests of Peninsula Malaysia have been severely impacted by the cultivation of exotic crops and urban sprawl. To guide conservation initiatives, montane bird communities were studied to determine their response along a disturbance gradient with the aim of identifying key factors influencing their distribution. Habitat types surveyed included primary and secondary montane forests, a tea plantation, rural, and urban areas in Cameron Highlands and Fraser's Hill. Response variables included species richness and density quantified via point counts and mistnet surveys. Explanatory variables measured were related to vegetation structure, food abundance and land-use cover. Estimated 'true' species richness was higher for pristine and minimally disturbed sites, lower in tea plantation and lowest in heavily developed town centres. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealed that both vegetation structure (e.g. canopy density) and land-use cover (e.g. proportion of forest cover) influence species distribution; certain invasive lowland birds were tolerant of extreme development and native montane birds, in general, endured only slight habitat disturbances. A simulation indicated that montane forest dependant species richness started to decline when more than 20% of the canopy cover was lost. Less than a third of the species richness remained when more than 40% of the canopy cover was cleared. The logistic regression model suggested that sensitive species nested lower, were restricted to montane habitats and foraged in mid or high canopy. The dominance of lowland invasives in highly developed urban sites reveals that homogenisation of bird communities can occur even at higher altitudes (> 1400 in a.s.l.). The results indicated that native montane birds communities are sensitive to habitat loss and degradation. Thus, any development in the highlands must proceed with minimal disturbance to montane forests, of which, keeping the canopy cover intact should be a crucial consideration. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Depending on the mosaic of habitats that is created, forest fragmentation can reduce the abundance and diversity of forest birds. Temperate deciduous forests in South America are rapidly being replaced by pine plantations, causing changes in habitats for both breeding and migrant birds. We examined differences in avian species richness and abundance in three areas: a reserve with continuous tracts of native forest, forest fragments and pine plantations. Four species were negatively affected by fragmentation, with their abundance declining from continuous forest to pine plantations. Fourteen species were not affected by fragmentation and eight had significantly increased abundance in pine plantations compared to continuous forest. Overall abundance in pooled and ground/understorey birds was higher in forest fragments and pine plantations compared to continuous forest. The abundance of granivorous species was higher in the pine plantations than in the forest reserve, but the abundance of insectivorous species was higher in the forest reserve and in forest fragments than in pine plantations. Thus, forest fragmentation affects birds differentially according to their feeding ecology.

AB Understanding the role of interactions between intrinsic feedback loops and external climatic forces is one of the central challenges within the field of population ecology. For rodent dynamics, the seasonal structure of the environment necessitates changes between two stages: reproductive and non-reproductive. Nevertheless, the interactions between seasonality, climate, density dependence and predators have been generally ignored. We demonstrate that direct climate effects, the nonlinear effect of predators and the nonlinear first-order feedback embedded in a seasonal structure are key elements underlying the large and irregular fluctuations in population numbers exhibited by a small rodent in a semi-arid region of central Chile. We found that factors influencing population growth rates clearly differ between breeding and non-breeding seasons. In addition, we detected nonlinear density dependencies as well as nonlinear and differential effects of generalist and specialist predators. Recent climatic changes may account for dramatic perturbations of the rodent's population dynamics. Changes in the predator guild induced by climate are likely to result, through the food web, in a large impact on small rodent demography and population dynamics. Assuming such interactions to be typical of ecological systems, we conclude that appropriate predictions of the ecological consequences of climate change will depend on having an in-depth understanding of the community-weather system.

AB We studied the effects of patch size and historical land use on woodland ants and myrmecochores (plant species that have their diaspores dispersed by ants) in mesic forests of the southern Appalachian Highlands. Our purpose was to examine a potential mechanism, the presence and diversity of seed-dispersing ants, that might explain the reduced abundance and diversity of myrmecochores in small forest patches with high intensities of past land use. Small patches (<25 ha) of forest harbored a greater abundance and diversity of myrmecochorous ants, but a lower abundance and species richness of myrmecochores than large patches (>200 ha) with minimal past land use. Overall, sites with greater myrmecochore species richness and abundance had less diverse ant communities and a lower abundance of ants. However, ant species composition varied with patch size. Large patches with low historical land-use intensity were dominated by one ant species, Aphaenogaster fulva, whereas small patches supported higher numbers of Aphaenogaster rudis and two Camponotus species. The abundances of immature myrmecochores were more strongly related to land-use history, forest patch size, and the abundance of mature conspecifics than to ant variables. An absence of seed-dispersing ants cannot explain the reduced numbers of myrmecochores in small patches with high past land use because seed dispersal by ants still appears to be available in those patches. Land-use legacies or fragmentation effects may be overriding any advantages offered by the increased diversity and abundance of ants at those sites.

AB We studied the distribution of five pollination modes (ornithophily, chiropterophily, entomophily, mixed/unspecific, autogamy) among the bromeliad communities of 74 forest sites in the Bolivian Andes and adjacent lowlands. We recorded a total of 188 bromeliad species belonging to 16 genera, including 115 (61%) ornithophilous, 14 (7%) chiropterophilous, 45 (24%) entomophilous, 8 (4%) autogamous, and 6 (3%) species with mixed pollination mode. Ornithophily was the dominant pollination mode at high elevations and in wet regions, while entomophily dominated in arid regions. Chiropterophily was most common in wet lowland regions, autogamy in arid sites, and mixed pollination in the lowlands. Pollination modes were rather evenly distributed among life-forms and ecophysiological types, with a few exceptions: terrestrial forest bromeliads, mostly belonging to unarmed, soft-leaved taxa, had a prevalence of entomophily and few ornithophilous species; large, spiny terrestrial bromeliads of Puya and Bromelioideae showed a prevalence of ornithophily; and autogamy was restricted to the neotenous subgenus Diaphoranthema of Tillandsia. The restriction of unspecific pollination modes to the lowlands is hypothesized to be related to the abundance of pollinators, eliminating the need for specialized co-evolution, or to the overall rarity of bromeliads in this environment, precluding the development of specialized relationships. The low representation of entomophilous species in small dry forest regions compared to extensive areas is assumed to be due to the seasonal influx of hummingbirds and/or bats. Overall, the frequency of individual pollination modes was related to the availability of pollinators as determined by temperatures and humidity.

AB The amount of leaf litter fall produced by different: tree species in tropical forests varies in space and time. Falling litter may cover seeds and thereby enhance their survival by making their detection by seed predators more difficult. Tests were made to determine whether Astrocaryum murumuru and Dipteryx micrantha seeds survive better in microsites covered by leaf litter. Seed numbers and litter cover on the forest floor were experimentally manipulated. How natural variation in leaf litter cover and thickness affects seed and seedling survival of these two plant species was also examined. Seed survivorship was significantly higher for both plant species in microsites with leaf litter than in those with bare soil. Results from an experiment in which the litter was not disturbed showed that Astrocaryum seed survival was positively correlated with litter thickness (defined as the number of overlying dead leaves). Astrocaryum seedling survival was also significantly affected by leaf litter; more seedlings survived in shallow litter. Leaf litter had no effect on Dipteryx seedling survival. The results of the study suggest that early recruitment of both Astrocaryum and Dipteryx is influenced by the spatial distribution and amount of forest leaf litter.

AB Analyzing permanent plot data from 40 tropical forest sites, Phillips and Gentry (1994) found that there has been a significant tendency for tree turnover - as measured by tree mortality and recruitment - to increase since the 1950s. The dataset is now substantially improved, and includes 67 mature forest sites with turnover data representing most of the major tropical forest regions of the world. This paper presents an updated and expanded analysis of the latest data, and confirms that tree turnover has increased in mature tropical forest plots. Several artifactual explanations have been suggested but none are supported by the available data, suggesting that surviving mature tropical forests have been recently affected by large-scale anthropogenic or natural change. The effects of increased turnover may include impacts on future global atmosphere, climate, and biodiversity. Better understanding of the ecological changes in mature tropical forests depends on progress in two critical research areas - a ground-based monitoring network of long-term, fully identified tropical forest plots, and controlled manipulation of atmospheric conditions in forest experiments. Research activity in both areas needs to be substantially increased if we are to understand and predict the complex interactions between tropical forest ecology and global environmental change.

AB The effect of seed aggregation and distance from conspecific trees on seed predation was experimentally examined for two neotropical tree species, Macoubea guianensis (Apocynaceae) and Pourteria sp. (Sapotaceae) in a lowland tropical rain forest in northeastern Peru. Results of these experiments are discussed in the context of the Janzen-Connell model (Janzen 1970; Connell 1971), which predicts decreased seed survival near parent trees due to either density- or distance-responsive mortality, and Howe's model (Howe 1989) which predicts that trees with seeds dispersed in clumps (aggregated) will not suffer density-dependent predation, and will have higher survival of seeds near the parent tree than other trees. We also examined whether predation on seeds of these species was affected by seed placement in or near 30-m-wide strips regenerating after clear-cutting. Both species appeared to be mammal-dispersed but differed in how frugivores handled seeds, seed size, overall fruit crop size, and gemination time. Neither of the two species studied appeared to suffer seed predation in a manner predicted by the Janzen-Connell model, and patterns of seed predation for only one of the species was similar to predictions of Howe's model. For neither species did seed predation along the edge of, or in the center of, regenerating clear cuts differ from predation 15 m into the primary forest. For Pouteria, seed predation in and near regnerating strips was significantly greater than around forest trees, but the opposite pattern held for Macouben. Overall, seed predation was much greater on Macouben. The difference in seed predation for these two species was most likely a result of differences in the types of seed predators that attacked these two species.

AB We summarize three existing conceptual frameworks for forest regeneration in northeastern North America and suggest that none consider both a range of disturbance characteristics and a range of forest conditions at the time of disturbance. We offer a more general conceptual model, within which the existing models can be seen as special cases. We propose that the abundance of characteristic seed-bank, pioneer species, such as Prunus pensylvanica L.f. and Rubus spp. (often Rubus allegheniensis T.C. Porter, Rubus hispidus L., or Rubus odoratus L.), is dependent on propagule availability, which in turn is determined by forest age and size. Specifically, following disturbance, large tracts of forest and older forests (ca. >125 years) are predicted to have very low densities of the above pioneers. As a result, population, community, and ecosystem parameters may be substantially different in the regenerating forest than in the familiar cases of regeneration in secondary forests. Indeed, the presettlement forest of much of northeastern North America may have experienced a notable scarcity of pioneers after disturbances, in areas far enough inland for hurricanes to be unimportant. Our hypothesis makes predictions of seed-bank abundance that are well supported in a variety of forest types; we also provide support for our hypothesis with data on regeneration following catastrophic windthrow in Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. Finally, our hypothesis also predicts that the potential regeneration in much of the secondary forest of northeastern North America should profoundly shift as stands age from roughly 100 to 130 years.

AB The diet and microhabitat use of two species of native Australian desert rodents, the spinifex hopping-mouse Notomys alexis and sandy inland mouse Pseudomys hermannsburgensis, were studied in the Simpson Desert, south-western Queensland. Contrary to expectation, both species were confirmed from analyses of their stomach contents to be omnivorous. The diets of both species varied through time in a similar manner; seeds were important in summer and especially in winter, but in autumn invertebrates constituted nearly 50% and 60% of the diet of N. alexis and P. hermannsburgensis, respectively. Other plant material (root, leaf, floral part, stem) was found in appreciable amounts in the stomach contents of both species, and fungi were identified from a small number of individuals. Both species showed a high degree of overlap in the broad types of food they ingested (seed, plant material, invertebrates); however, there was considerably less overlap in the species of seeds eaten. Analysis of microhabitat use suggested that this difference was due to differential foraging between the species; the larger, bipedal N. alexis forages in the open more than the smaller, quadrupedal P. hermannsburgensis, which is found more commonly in or under hummocks of spinifex grass. Although our findings parallel patterns of morphological specialisation and differential foraging on seeds that have been described within communities of North American heteromyid rodents, we found little evidence that the foraging economics of N. alexis or P. hermannsburgensis should depend solely or primarily on the distribution patterns of seeds. In the absence of dietary information, we suggest that ecological studies of desert rodents which focus solely on granivory, and neglect other important aspects of rodent foraging, can lead to a misinterpretation of species coexistence and community structure.

AB To test the premises and predictions of the Janzen-Connell model (Janzen's spacing mechanism), seeds of the rainforest canopy tree, Brosimum alicastrum, were placed at different distances from the parent tree and their removal observed over 3 weeks. The number and density of naturally occurring seeds at different distances from the parent tree were also estimated. Predation was not greater near the parent tree, except on the very small spatial scale: the proportion of experimental seeds removed was greater 1 m from the trunk than it was 5-25 m from the trunk. Predation was negatively correlated with seed density, not positively as the Janzen-Connell model assumes - presumably due to predator satiation. The density of seeds after predation peaked 5 m from the tree trunk, but this is well within the crown radius of the parent tree. There is a peak in the number of potential recruits at a distance of 10 m from the parent tree, due to the peaked initial distribution of seeds. This peak is caused by the interaction between the seed density curve and the increasing area of an annulus around the parent tree at increasing distances, not by the product of the density curve and the predation curve. However, it is important to realize that it is not the presence of a peak in recruitment away from the parent that is essential to maintaining tropical tree species diversity, but frequency-dependent recruitment induced by poor recruitment near conspecifics. Predator satiation seems to be an important factor in the survival of B. alicastrum seeds, possibly at several spatial scales. The number of seeds produced by the tree is negatively correlated with the loss to predators, and trees that have a fruiting conspecific nearby also suffer lower levels of predation. Seed predation increases as one moves from the forest edge into the interior, creating an edge effect that may have long-term effects on the forest composition and tree species diversity. More studies are needed, for other species, other localities, and larger spatial and temporal scales, on both the Janzen-Connell mechanism and this edge effect.

AB Seedlings of six species of rainforest trees with widely contrasting ecology and seed morphology were transplanted at 3 weeks of age into tree-fall gaps and the shaded understoreys at two rainforest sites (Curtain Fig and Lamins Hill) on the Atherton Tableland, North Queensland, Australia. In each forest habitat, half of the transplanted seedlings were protected from vertebrates by means of wire cages, and survival was monitored over 16 months. The main objective was to estimate the extent to which independent variables (forest, habitat, protection from vertebrates, and species) contribute to explaining survival differences among the seedlings. Significant differences existed in the mortality among species, whether caged or uncaged. Seedlings unprotected from vertebrates suffered greater mortality (i.e. averaged over all species and forests, mortality > 75%), compared to the caged seedlings (mortality < 40%). Seedling of most species survived better in forest gaps, though the effects varied significantly among the six species. Survival of caged seedlings in Curtain Fig was significantly greater than in Lamins Hill, a pattern attributed to the partial deciduousness of the Curtain Fig forest. Because only few of the uncaged seedlings survived to 16 months, we focussed on the caged seedlings to examine the role of light at the forest habitats on survival. Relationship between seedling mortality and increasing light availability vary significantly among the six species. However across species, seedling mortality decreased linearly as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) rose from 0.48 to 2.0%, after which an asymptote was reached and further increase in light (up to 8% PAR) did not influence survival significantly. Overall, temporal, species and the various environmental variables and their interactions explained about 60% of the variations in the seedling mortality data, with protection and species differences making the greatest contributions.

AB This study characterizes the microclimate and soilwater conditions of three gaps within mixed-dipterocarp rainforest of southwest Sri Lanka. The gaps were each of a different size and within a particular part of the forest topography. The largest pp was in a valley and the smallest on a ridge. Soil water, light quantity, and temperature were recorded within demarcated zones across each gap.
   Although trends between gaps and within gaps are relatively easily explained, the numerical values reported give a good impression of differences and amplitudes concerned as well as of the actual values in the rainforest understory.
   Surface soilwater measurements revealed that the ridge gap was more prone to water stress than the valley and midslope gaps. Gap centers of all three disturbances appeared to have lower amounts of surface soil water than adjacent forest understories.
   Light quantities on a sunny day in the forest understory were between 0.26 and 0.92 mols, of which sunflecks contributed between 24 and 62%. These understory light levels are approximately 1% of full sun exposure. The central zone of the valley pp had the longest duration of full sun (17-54% of the daily photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of full sun). The center of the midslope pp had between 12 and 22% and the ridge had between 7 and 16% of daily PPFD of full sun.
   Diurnal temperature ranges in pp centers are wider than in adjacent forest understories. Sunny days had the greatest ranges of difference with a maximum of 34-degrees-C on the soil surface of the valley gap center, while surface temperatures in the understory did not exceed 25-degrees-C.

ID TROPICAL FOREST
AB Factors affecting seedling Virola surinamensis (Myristicaceae) survival and growth were investigated on Barro Colorado Island, Panama.  Seedlings planted 3 months after germination were monitored in treefall gaps and understory using 2.25 ha irrigated and control plots through the first dry season.  During the dry season, irrigated plants in gaps increased total leaf area significantly more than did irrigated plants in the shaded understory.  Over the same dry season, control plants in gaps and in the shaded understory lost similar amounts of leaf area.  Seedlings in understory were suppressed in stem height and biomass in both irrigated and control plots; these measures were greater in gaps and greatest in irrigated gaps (height).  Roots were similar in length in all treatments, but greater in biomass in gaps than understory due to greater proliferation of secondary roots in control and irrigated gaps than in control and irrigated understory.  This experiment demonstrates both water and light limitation during the first dry season after germination.  V. surinamensis seedlings are capable of survival and modest growth of leaf area in the deep shade of the understory in moist locations; they are severely disadvantaged in shaded understory subject to drought, where most seeds fall and most seedlings establish.  The broken canopy of a gap allows shoot and consequently root growth that permits seedlings to survive seasonal drought.

AB The Energy-Water-Food Nexus is one of the most complex sustainability challenges faced by the world. This is particularly true in Brazil, where insufficiently understood interactions within the Nexus are contributing to large-scale deforestation and land-use change, water and energy scarcity, and increased vulnerability to climate change. The reason is a combination of global environmental change and global economic change, putting unprecedented pressures on the Brazilian environment and ecosystems. In this paper, we identify and discuss the main Nexus challenges faced by Brazil across sectors (e.g. energy, agriculture, water) and scales (e.g. federal, state, municipal). We use four case studies to explore all nodes of the Nexus. For each, we analyse data from economic and biophysical modelling sources in combination with an overview of the legislative and policy landscape, in order to identify governance shortcomings in the context of growing challenges. We analyse the complex interdependence of developments at the global and local (Brazilian) levels, highlighting the impact of global environmental and economic change on Brazil and, conversely, that of developments in Brazil for other countries and the world. We conclude that there is a need to adjust the scientific approach to these challenges as an enabling condition for stronger science-policy bridges for sustainability policy-making.

AB Biochar is anticipated to be an effective option for mitigating nitrogen (N) leaching and improving the hydraulic characteristics of soil, particularly sandy soil. However, little attention has been paid to understanding the effect of biochar on N leaching and hydraulic conductivity (K) in fine-textured soil. Additionally, whether different biochar application methods have different effects on N leaching and K remains unclear. Therefore, our objective in this study is to determine the effects of biochar with different application methods on nitrate/ammonium leaching and K in silty clay soil. The three biochar application patterns were as follows: A, biochar was mixed into 0-10 cm of surface soil; B, biochar was mixed into 10-20 cm of subsurface soil; and C, biochar was mixed evenly into 0-20 cm of plow layer soil. In addition, biochar was added at three rates, namely, 1%, 2% and 4% (mass ratios), and a soil column without biochar addition served as the control (CK). Our results demonstrated that the choice of biochar application method significantly influenced N leaching and soil K and balance between the soil K and N leaching, particularly for nitrate. Additionally, the leaching of N in silty clay soil occurred mainly in nitrate form. Compared with the CK, all 1% biochar treatments increased nitrate leaching (except C1%, which showed no differences from the CK) and tended to decrease K. However, all 4% biochar treatments increased nitrate leaching due to a high K. All 2% biochar treatments significantly reduced nitrate leaching by 8.3-17.0%, and B2% significantly increased the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) of soil by 20.9%. Hence, the mixing of biochar at a rate of 2% into the subsurface soil effectively mitigated N leaching and increased K in silty clay soil. These findings could have some implications for the field application of biochar. For instance, the combination of subsurface biochar application with that of fertilizer to roots in orchards or with deep tillage in fields, which would mimic the B2% model, would yield multiple benefits, including lower costs.

AB After forest governance reforms by the Brazilian government, Amazon deforestation rates dropped by almost 80% between 2004 and 2012. Since then, however, deforestation has slowly increased again, casting doubts on the long-term sustainability of past conservation policy achievements. Clearly, deforestation rates and the associated local drivers of land-use and land-cover change differ considerably across the region, and adapting public policies to dynamic local contexts and actor constellations remains a major challenge for decision-makers. This paper seeks to contribute to the related science-policy debate by applying frontier theory insights to map, quantify, and compare land-cover dynamics in the Brazilian Amazon between 2004 and 2015. Our theoretical framework performs well in explaining broad variations in scope, nature, and agents of land-use and land-cover change across different frontier regions. We observe two types of transformative processes at deforestation frontiers in the Amazonian context. First, recent frontier development is characterized by an intensification of cattle ranching, and an increasing share of agricultural activities in the production portfolio, which could be the result of better access to modern technologies and markets, combined with forest governance induced scarcity of land for expansion of historically dominant extensive pasture systems. Second, the share of medium and large-scale deforestation declines at first, but rebounds during the observation period in all frontier types after 2012. Further research is needed to better understand the role of the changing political environment in driving these medium and short-term transformations in land-use and land-cover change. Furthermore, policy-makers, international cooperation, and civil society must seek strong integration between value chain based governance measures and effective environmental law enforcement.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are global threats to biodiversity and major research topics in ecology and conservation biology. We conducted a systematic review to assess where the geographic locations, and habitat types - and how - the study designs, conceptual underpinnings, landscape metrics and biodiversity measures scientists have studied fragmentation over the last two decades. We sampled papers from 1994 to 2016 and used regression modelling to explore changes in fragmentation research over time. Habitat loss and fragmentation studies are geographically and taxonomically biased. Almost 85% of studies were conducted in America and Europe, with temperate forests and birds the most studied groups. Most studies use a binary conceptual model of landscapes (habitat versus non-habitat) and static measures of biodiversity. However, research on fragmentation is slowly shifting from a focus on coarse patterns to more nuanced representations of biodiversity and landscapes that better represent ecological processes. For example, empirical research based on gradient or continuum models, that offer new insights into landscape complexity and species-specific responses to habitat fragmentation, are increasing in prevalence. We recommend that fragmentation research focuses on developing knowledge on underlying mechanisms and processes of how species respond to landscape changes, and that fragmentation studies be conducted in the full range of habitats currently experiencing high rates of landscape modification. This is crucial if we are to understand relationships between biodiversity and ecosystems and to develop effective management strategies in fragmented landscapes.

AB We assess the additional forest cover protected by 13 rural communities located in the southern state of Chiapas, Mexico, as a result of the economic incentives received through the country's national program of payments for biodiversity conservation. We use spatially explicit data at the intra-community level to define a credible counterfactual of conservation outcomes. We use covariate-matching specifications associated with spatially explicit variables and difference-in-difference estimators to determine the treatment effect. We estimate that the additional conservation represents between 12 and 14.7 percent of forest area enrolled in the program in comparison to control areas. Despite this high degree of additionality, we also observe lack of compliance in some plots participating in the PES program. This lack of compliance casts doubt on the ability of payments alone to guarantee long-term additionality in context of high deforestation rates, even with an augmented program budget or extension of participation to communities not yet enrolled.

AB Understanding how tropical trees coordinate fast growth with water consumption and carbon investment is of high relevance because climate warming may expose tropical forests to increasing stress. Thus, foresters require more information of native tree species envisaged for reforestation. This study examines the relationship between productivity and possibly growth-determining functional traits of xylem anatomy, hydraulic conductivity, foliar morphology and nutrient status in eight tree species in semi-dry Costa Rica; we further assessed the indicative value of wood density for growth rate and hydraulic efficiency. We tested the hypotheses that (i) wood density is related to both growth rate and hydraulic efficiency contrary to findings from moist tropical forests, and (ii) productivity is closely related to branch xylem properties as well as empirically determined hydraulic conductivity in these drought-adapted species. Growth rate was positively related to tree size, foliar nitrogen content, vessel diameter, specific conductivity and leaf water potential, and negatively to vessel density, wood density and delta C-13, indicating that fast-growing tree species with light wood possessed a more efficient hydraulic system but closed their stomata relatively early to prevent xylem dysfunction. We conclude, that in tropical semi-dry climates, productivity is closely associated not only with foliar nitrogen but also with wood anatomical and hydraulic properties. Wood density proved to be a reliable indicator for growth-related, wood anatomical and hydraulic traits in these drought-adapted species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There is currently a considerable effort to evaluate the performance of Payments for Ecosystem Services as an environmental management tool. The research presented here contributes to this work by using an experimental design to evaluate Payments for Ecosystem Services as a tool for supporting biodiversity conservation in the context of an African protected area. The trial employed a 'before and after' and 'with and without' design. We present the results of social and ecological surveys to investigate the impacts of the trial in terms of its effectiveness, efficiency and equity. We find the scheme to be effective at bringing about additional conservation outcomes. However, we also found that increased monitoring is similarly effective in the short term, at lower cost. The major difference - and arguably the significant contribution of the Payments for Ecosystem Services - was that it changed the motives for protecting the park and improved local perceptions both of the park and its authority. We discuss the implications of these results for conservation efficiency, arguing that efficiency should not be defined in terms of short-term cost-effectiveness, but also in terms of the sustainability of behavioral motives in the long term. This insight helps us to resolve the apparent trade-off between goals of equity and efficiency in Payments for Ecosystem Services. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A complex set of interactions among neighbors influences plant performance and community structure. Understanding their joint operation requires extensive information on species characteristics and individual performance. We evaluated first-year survival of 35 719 tropical forest seedlings of 222 species and 15 annual cohorts relative to the density of conspecific and heterospecific neighbors and the phylogenetic similarity of heterospecific neighbors. Neighbors were from two size classes, and size asymmetric interactions provided insight into likely mechanisms. Large heterospecific and conspecific neighbors reduced seedling survival equally, suggesting resource competition rather than host-specific enemies as a mechanism. In contrast, much stronger negative conspecific effects were associated with seedling neighbors capable of limited resource uptake, suggesting shared pests rather than competition as the mechanism. Survival improved, however, near phylogenetically similar heterospecific neighbors, suggesting habitat associations shared among closely related species affect spatial patterns of performance. Improved performance near phylogenetically similar neighbors is an emerging pattern in the handful of similar studies.

AB Rational soil/rhizosphere-plant phosphorus (P) management strategies in intercropping systems are poorly understood. Three years of field experiments with different rates of P fertilizer (0, 40 and 80 kg ha(-1)) as main effects and maize (Zea mays L) intercropping with oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), turnip (Brassica campestris L), faba bean (Vicia faba L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L) and soybean (Glycine max L.) with the respective monocultures as subplot effects were carried out to study the influence of fertilizer P application on productivity, shoot P content, apparent recovery of fertilizer P and soil Olsen-P in intercrops and monocultures. Average total grain yields and shoot P contents of maize/turnip, maize/faba bean, maize/chickpea and maize/soybean intercropping increased by 30.7%, 24.8%, 24.4%, and 25.3% and by 44.6%, 30.7%, 39.1%, and 28.6%, respectively, compared with the weighted means of the corresponding monocultures, and were highest at 40 kg Pha(-1). Moreover, the average apparent recovery of fertilizer P of the intercropping systems increased from 6.1% to 30.6% at 40 kg Pha(-1) and from 4.8% to 14.5% at 80 kg Pha(-1) compared with overall monoculture systems on average over three years. The results indicate that intercropping and a rational P application rate (e.g. 40 kg Pha(-1)) maintained maximum total grain production and shoot P content, P balance of inputs/outputs and soil Olsen-P at an appropriate level (21.3 mg kg(-1)), and maximum apparent recovery of fertilizer P (30.6%) through exploitation of the biological potential for efficient acquisition of P and other resources by interspecific interactions toward a sustainable and productive agricultural system.

AB Ecological edges are increasingly recognized as drivers of landscape patterns and ecosystem processes. In fragmented and patchy landscapes (e.g., a fragmented forest or a savanna with scattered termite mounds), edges can become so numerous that their effects pervade the entire landscape. Results of recent studies in such landscapes show that edge effects can be altered by the presence or proximity of other nearby edges. We considered the theoretical significance of edge-effect interactions, illustrated various landscape configurations that support them and reviewed existing research on this topic. Results of studies from a variety of locations and ecosystem types show that edge-effect interactions can have significant consequences for ecosystems and conservation, including higher tree mortality rates in tropical rainforest fragments, reduced bird densities in grassland fragments, and bush encroachment and reduced wildlife densities in a tropical savanna. To clarify this underappreciated concept and synthesize existing work, we devised a conceptual framework for edge-effect interactions. We first worked to reduce terminological confusion by clarifying differences among terms such as edge intersection and edge interaction. For cases in which nearby edge effects interact, we proposed three possible forms of interaction: strengthening (presence of a second edge causes stronger edge effects), weakening (presence of a second edge causes weaker edge effects), and emergent (edge effects change completely in the presence of a second edge). By clarifying terms and concepts, this framework enables more precise descriptions of edge-effect interactions and facilitates comparisons of results among disparate study systems and response variables.

AB Tree populations in mesic (>650 mm precipitation/yr) savannas of the world have strong demographic bottlenecks to the transition of subadult trees to the canopy layer. Although such bottlenecks are a major determinant of savanna physiognomy, the factors that allow subadults to traverse the bottleneck are little studied. In a landscape-scale field experiment in a northern Australia savanna, we determined the survival and growth of 1506 permanently marked juveniles (<150 cm tall) and saplings (150-599 cm tall) of canopy species in response to season of fire (early dry season, late dry season, wet season, and unburned), and understory type (herbaceous forbs vs. sorghum [native annual grass]) that differ in seasonal growth patterns and competitive regimes. Trees were assessed before fires and at the end of the following growing season, without repeat fires. We used Akaike-information-criterion-based model selection and multi-model inference for data analyses. Initial height was an important explanatory variable for all responses except genet mortality wherein fire season was important for juveniles and understory type for saplings. Fire season was important to height growth of large juveniles and small saplings (enhanced the year following dry-season fires). Fire season x understory interactions were important for height growth of small juveniles and for the proportion of juveniles transitioning to saplings. Changes in stem numbers were affected by all explanatory variables. All fires topkilled most juveniles (fewer in early dry-season fires in herbaceous understory), but genet death was rare. Late dry-season fires topkilled most saplings; they failed to regain previous height and some died the following year. Given no further fires, persistent large juveniles can grow to sapling size within a year; whereas sapling success is severely hampered by late-dry-season fires, especially in grassy understory. Differences in seasonal phenological patterns of both understory vegetation and trees that vary with size and life history stage are among suggested explanatory mechanisms. Weighted averaged model coefficients for all responses to the explanatory variables are provided for use in population dynamics models. A conceptual framework links landscape-scale variables to tree attributes and responses, with implications for population ecology and community assembly.

AB 1. One of the primary goals in community ecology is to determine the relative importance of processes and mechanisms that control biodiversity. Here, we examined habitat-driven species assemblages and species distribution patterns as well as their temporal variations for three life stages of two censuses of a 25-ha mixed dipterocarp forest at Sinharaja (Sri Lanka).
   2. Our general objective was to find out whether the species assemblages and associated habitat types changed with life stage, spatial scale and species attributes. We also analyse whether the habitat types were related to certain indicator species. Habitat types were determined with multivariate regression tree analyses driven by topographic variables.
   3. We found species assemblages associated with five distinct habitat types that appeared consistently for all life stages of the two censuses. These habitats were related to ridge-valley gradients and a pronounced contrast in south-west versus north-east aspect. Habitat-driven structuring was weak at the recruit stage but strong in the juvenile and adult stages. The species assemblage variance explained by topographic variables for different life stages ranged between 10% for recruits and 23% for juveniles.
   4. The species assemblages determined for different spatial scales (10, 20, 50 m) showed similar habitat partitioning, but the variance explained by the topographic variables increased in all life stages with spatial scale. This could be due to the homogenizing effect of topographic variables at the larger scales and unaccounted environmental variation at the smaller scales. The number of indicator species identified in the two censuses was higher in the juvenile stage than in the adult stage, and nearly all indicator species in the adult stage were also indicator species in the juvenile stage.
   5. Synthesis. Our study showed that approximately 75% of the variance in local species composition is unexplained. This may be due to spatially structured processes such as dispersal limitation, unaccounted biotic and abiotic environmental variables, and stochastic effects, but only 25% were due to topographic habitat association. Although the pronounced ridge-valley gradient and contrast of south-west versus north-east aspect created consistent habitats, our results suggest that local species assemblages at Sinharaja forest are jointly shaped by neutral and niche processes.

AB Although large-scale biodiversity declines are ongoing, certain conservation actions have made a positive difference. Rates of extinction and endangerment of vertebrate species, for instance, have probably been reduced via conservation interventions. Such conservation actions operate at different spatial scales. Habitat preservation and endangered species recovery are examples of conservation successes at microscales. Mesoscale conservation includes regional cooperation among neighboring countries that has arrested population declines of endangered species, such as mountain gorillas. At macroscales, public pressure on multinational corporations has sometimes resulted in their abandoning environmentally damaging practices or suppliers with poor environmental records. Overall, conservation projects such as these need more long-term funding and greater political and popular support, and must also include provisions to evaluate and document their outcomes. As we discuss here, a focus on conservation successes achieved at different scales can help to promote these aims and guide future conservation victories.

AB Coastal zones provide habitat cores and corridors that maintain the diversity of entire landscapes, and they can form the cornerstone elements of regional conservation strategies. Natural environmental driving factors and excessive anthropogenic activities play important roles in coastal wetland change. Many studies have used remote sensing images to map and assess coastal wetland change on local or regional scales. This paper aims to provide insight into coastal wetland change in the Yancheng National Nature Reserve (YNNR) using remote sensing technology and landscape metrics analysis. The results reveal that grass flat and reed areas have significantly decreased, whereas agriculture fields, aquaculture ponds and built-up areas have continuously increased from 1988 to 2006. The spatial pattern of the coastal landscape has become fragmented and heterogeneous under great pressure from rapid economic development and population growth. The wetland changes have important impacts on natural habitat of the red-crowned cranes. The results of this study provide basic information that is required for developing measures toward a sustainable management and conservation of the YNNR.

AB Payments for reduced carbon emissions from deforestation (RED) are now attracting attention as a way to halt tropical deforestation. Northern Sumatra comprises an area of 65 000 km(2) that is both the site of Indonesia's first planned RED initiative, and the stronghold of 92% of remaining Sumatran orangutans. Under current plans, this RED initiative will be implemented in a defined geographic area, essentially a newly established, 7500 km(2) protected area (PA) comprising mostly upland forest, where guards will be recruited to enforce forest protection. Meanwhile, new roads are currently under construction, while companies are converting lowland forests into oil palm plantations. This case study predicts the effectiveness of RED in reducing deforestation and conserving orangutans for two distinct scenarios: the current plan of implementing RED within the specific boundary of a new upland PA, and an alternative scenario of implementing RED across landscapes outside PAs.
   Our satellite-based spatially explicit deforestation model predicts that 1313 km(2) of forest would be saved from deforestation by 2030, while forest cover present in 2006 would shrink by 22% (7913 km(2)) across landscapes outside PAs if RED were only to be implemented in the upland PA. Meanwhile, orangutan habitat would reduce by 16% (1137 km(2)), resulting in the conservative loss of 1384 orangutans, or 25% of the current total population with or without RED intervention. By contrast, an estimated 7824 km(2) of forest could be saved from deforestation, with maximum benefit for orangutan conservation, if RED were to be implemented across all remaining forest landscapes outside PAs. Here, RED payments would compensate land users for their opportunity costs in not converting unprotected forests into oil palm, while the construction of new roads to service the marketing of oil palm would be halted.
   Our predictions suggest that Indonesia's first RED initiative in an upland PA may not significantly reduce deforestation in northern Sumatra and would have little impact on orangutan conservation because a large amount of forest inside the project area is protected de facto by being inaccessible, while lowland forests will remain exposed to the combined expansion of high-revenue plantations and road networks. In contrast, RED would be more effective in terms of its conservation impact if payments were extended to all remaining carbon-rich tropical forests, including lowland peat swamp forests, the preferred habitat for dense populations of orangutans, and if the construction of new roads was halted.

AB Southeast Asia is one of the richest reservoirs of biodiversity on earth and home to one of the highest concentrations of endemic species. Many protected areas (PA) have been established across the region, but to date no systematic evaluation of their efficacy has been published because no comprehensive dataset was available which could be fed into an analysis of conservation gaps. We collected the geographic range for 1086 mammal species of Southeast Asia and we built species-specific habitat suitability models for 901 of them. We performed two gap analyses (one based on a combination of distribution models and distribution ranges and one based on distribution ranges only) for each mammalian species, to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing network of PA and to identify priority regions and priority species for expanding and consolidating the network. our results indicate that 7.5-8.2% of species are not covered by any PA, and 51.6-59.1% are covered only partially. These species are distributed throughout the entire study area and their conservation requires the creation of new PA that can help fill this existing conservation gap. This would be particularly important for species which are endemic of small islands, where species survival is often threatened by the presence of introduced species and habitat conversion. Yet PAS cannot be considered as the ending point of a conservation strategy, because overall, 34% of the species we analyzed (many of which already covered by existing PAS) were at risk of extinction when considering the IUCN red-list criteria. PAS should therefore be considered in a broader framework of all local ecological and socio-economic trends, including the growing human population, growing economy and infrastructure development.

AB Amazonian forest produces environmental services such as maintenance of biodiversity, water cycling and carbon stocks. These services have a much greater value to human society than do the timber, beef and other products that are obtained by destroying the forest. Yet institutional mechanisms are still lacking to transform the value of the standing forest into the foundation of an economy based on maintaining rather than destroying this ecosystem. Forest management for commodities such as timber and non-timber forest products faces severe limitations and inherent contradictions unless income is supplemented based on environmental services. Amazon forest is threatened by deforestation, logging, forest fires and climate change. Measures to avoid deforestation include repression through command and control, creation of protected areas, and reformulation of infrastructure decisions and development policies. An economy primarily based on the value of environmental services is essential for long-term maintenance of the forest. Much progress has been made in the decades since I first proposed such a transition, but many issues also remain unresolved. These include theoretical issues regarding accounting procedures, improved quantification of the services and of the benefits of different policy options, and effective uses of the funds generated in ways that maintain both the forest and the human population.

   ecosystem services
ID SLASH-AND-BURN; DEFORESTATION; SYSTEMS; FORESTS
AB Policymakers seeking to modify financial incentives to increase the flows of ecosystem services in and around tropical. moist forests must consider where to focus their attention and what collection of incentives can effectively achieve policy objectives. In most cases, policymakers focus on extensively forested areas where the flows of ecosystem services between agriculture and the environment is generally characterized by massive flows of carbon and soil nutrients from forests to agriculture. In these forest margin areas the stock of primary forest is eventually exhausted and the cheap ingredients provided by nature to agriculture become increasingly scarce. At this point, policy interest generally wanes, and agriculture and the environment begin slow declines in ecosystem service exchange, often with negative consequences for rural poverty. How does one promote increased flows of ecosystem services from agricultural lands without increasing poverty when forests and soils have been depleted? Can the standard instruments, e.g., payments for ecosystem services, be effective in such situations, and if so, do the costs to society of securing these services increase? Here we focus on the flows of ecosystem services at the end of the cycle of converting primary forest to agriculture. Primary data from the Bragantina area in the southeastern Brazilian Amazon, an area cleared of primary forest decades ago, are used to characterize smallholder production systems, to describe the flows of ecosystem services into and from these systems, and to develop a bioeconomic model of smallholder agriculture capable of predicting the effects of several types of policy action on ecosystem services provided by and to agriculture, and on-farm household incomes and food self-reliance. Of particular interest is the Proambiente Pilot Program in Brazil, which uses smallholder payment schemes to induce farmers to manage land and forest resources in ways that generate more ecosystem services. Baseline results suggest that smallholder agriculture leads to a gradual loss of ecosystem services (mainly above-ground and root carbon) provided by secondary forest fallows, and that reduction in fallow age leads to reductions in plant diversity. Intensifying agricultural activities accelerates this process, but considerably increases smallholder incomes. Paying farmers for ecosystem services linked to the retention of secondary forests and the Proambiente program both increase area in forest fallow, but the latter substantially reduces farm income because of input use restrictions. In general, programs aiming to promote the production of ecosystem services should not limit farmers' choices of ways to provide them. Employment and food self-reliance issues associated with policy options for increasing on-farm stocks of carbon and plant biodiversity are also explored. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Species differences in growth and shade tolerance might contribute to coexistence of tree species. To explore how such differences depend on underlying plant traits, 14 tree species were investigated in temperate forests on sand and loess soils in the Netherlands. Plant traits were measured for 0.5-1 m tall saplings: 10 saplings growing at low light conditions and 10 at high light conditions. Growth was determined from annual lengths of leader shoots, and shade tolerance from an independently tested scale.
   2. Shade tolerance and extension growth of the leader shoot were negatively correlated. Plant traits that related positively with shade tolerance were negatively related to extension growth, and vice versa. Photosynthetic capacity, leaf dark respiration and total leaf mass related weakly to shade tolerance and extension growth. Specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf mass) and wood density were the traits most strongly correlated to shade tolerance and extension growth.
   3. Shade-tolerant species had denser wood and slower extension growth. They also had larger crowns, suggesting that dense stems provide strength for supporting larger crowns.
   4. More shade-tolerant species had a higher SLA, which is opposite to tree communities with larger leaf life span variation. In winter deciduous tree communities, more shade-tolerant species benefit from investing leaf area at low costs (high SLA) rather than from investing in durable leaves (low SLA).
   5. Species on sand had higher growth rates and higher light requirements than species on loess. In line with the resource-ratio hypothesis, the dominance of the more shade-tolerant species on nutrient rich loess soils may be attributed to the denser vegetation supported and the resultant lower light availability for saplings compared with saplings on infertile and drought-prone sand soils.
   6. Synthesis: These results provide plant trait-based predictions for the regeneration success and composition of species of temperate forests with management based on natural regeneration. These forests are expected to become dominated by shade-tolerant species with high wood density and high SLA on the more productive soils, and by light demanding species with low wood density and low SLA on poorer soils.

AB Despite efforts to enclose and control conservation zones around the world, direct human impacts in conservation areas continue, often resulting from clandestine violations of conservation rules through outright poaching, strategic agricultural encroachment, or noncompliance. Nevertheless, next to nothing is actually known about the spatially and temporally explicit patterns of anthropogenic disturbance resulting from such noncompliance. This article reviews current understandings of ecological disturbance and conservation noncompliance, concluding that differing forms of noncompliance hold differing implications for diversity. The authors suggest that forms of anthropogenic patchy disturbance resulting from violation may maintain, if not enhance, floral diversity. They therefore argue for extended empirical investigation of such activities and call for conservation biologists to work with social scientists to assess this conservation reality by analyzing how and when incomplete enforcement and rule-breaking drive ecological change.

AB Chile is one of the world's leading countries in landings (catch) of marine resources. The pioneer studies of human impacts on coastal marine communities provided the scientific basis on which to establish novel resource management strategies for exploited wild populations but were not used to develop a comprehensive marine conservation plan that would also include no-take areas. We reviewed the development of marine conservation actions since approximately 19 70 to date, focusing on the (1) complex legal framework for establishment of marine protected areas, (2) scientific grounds that provided the impetus to establish efforts that were critical to creating the first marine protected eas where exploitation is regulated, (3) private e areas, and (4) lessons and constraints derived from this process as well as the challenges ahead. The existing legal tools for the protection of the ocean include natural sanctuaries, marine reserves, marine parks, national monuments, and management and exploitation areas for benthic resources. These instruments may be applied in coastal marine protected area,,;. It is remarkable that most of the existing marine protected areas in Chile are sponsored and administered by private organizations. We think the sequence in which the development of the different conservation instruments occurred, with a high priority reserved for initiatives tending to promote exploitation of the ocean (aquaculture and fisheries), poses challenges and constraints for establishing a network of marine protected areas that combine such apparently diametrically opposing goals, as exploitation and preservation of marine species. More recently the value of preserving biodiversity became evident with the creation of the first marine parks. We encourage more scientific information on patterns of biodiversity biological processes, and assessment of human impact to be incorporated in the process to reach the goal of preserving 10% of the representative marine habitats along Chile's coast.

AB Dung beetles play a major role in nutrient cycling in the tropics. While a number of studies have indicated decreasing diversity of dung beetles as a result of deforestation, scant information exists on the implications of this for decomposition. This study compares clung beetle assemblages at forest and deforested sites on the eastern slopes of the Peruvian Andes and examines the importance of species richness and assemblage biomass in the decomposition of standardized dung pats. Results from pitfall trapping indicated that species richness, assemblage biomass and the number of beetles arriving at dung pats were greater at forest sites than at deforested sites. Although dung removal was generally faster at forest sites, between 50 and 100% of each 100 ml pat was removed within 3 days at all sites. Dung remained attractive to beetles for longer at forest sites, where it remained moister, than at the deforested sites. Dung beetle activity significantly reduced the number of flies emerging from dung. In an observation of decomposition of 96 separate dung pats, dung disappearance after 24 h was more frequently and more closely related to total assemblage biomass than to species richness. This study indicates that deforestation results in a reduced efficiency in decomposition by clung beetles that can be attributed mainly to reduced assemblage biomass at individual dung pats.

AB Management strategies that attempt to mitigate tropical biodiversity loss require detailed studies of biodiversity in different land-uses. In this study the community structure and species richness of songbirds was characterised along with the vegetation structure, in three land-use types in and around a tropical forest reserve in Uganda (intact, mature forest; regenerating secondary forest; smallholder agriculture). Each land-use type had 30-35 count stations that were sampled twice by means of a 15-min recording session. In total, 118 bird species were recorded from 192 station counts. Number of species/station was similar in intact and regenerating forest and lower in smallholder agriculture. Songbird communities in intact forest were highly distinct from those in smallholder agriculture and were composed of forest-dependent species. Communities in regenerating forest were intermediate between intact forest and agriculture, although much closer to intact forest. Generalised Linear Model (GLM) modelling revealed that tree density and distance to the nearest intact forest had strong positive and non-linear effects on the community composition and forest species richness of songbirds. Simulations using these models showed that agroforestry programmes would not raise tree densities to levels that would shift agricultural songbird communities towards forest communities. Current and bestcase agricultural practices are therefore unlikely to contribute to the conservation of the songbird component of forest biodiversity in this area.

AB Between June 1995 and May 1996 seven rookeries in the Gulf of California were visited four times in order to collect seat samples for studying spatial and seasonal variability California sea lion prey. The rookeries studied were San Pedro Martir, San Esteban, El Rasito, Los Machos, Los Cantiles, Isla Granite, and Isla Lobos. The 1273 seat samples collected yielded 4995 otoliths (95.3%) and 247 (4.7%) cephaloped beaks. Fish were found in 97.4% of seat samples collected, cephalopods in 11.2%, and crustaceans in 12.7%. We identified 92 prey taxa to the species level, 11 to genus level, and 10 to family level, of which the most important were Pacific cutlassfish (Trichiurus lepturus), Pacific sardine (Sardinops caeruleus), plainfin midshipman (Porichthys spp.), myctophid no. 1, northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), anchoveta (Cetengraulis mysticetus), and jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus). Significant differences were found among rookeries in the occurrence of all main prey (Pless than or equal to0.04), except for myctophid no. 1 (P>0.05). Temporally, significant differences were found in the occurrence of Pacific cutlassfish, Pacific sardine, plainfin midshipman, northern anchovy, and Pacific mackerel (P<0.05), but not in jack mackerel (chi(2)=2.94, df=3, P=0.40), myctophid no. 1 (chi(2)=1.67, df= 3, P=0.64), or lanternfishes (chi(2)=2.08, df=3, P=0.56). Differences were observed in the diet and in trophic diversity among seasons and rookeries. More evident was the variation in diet in relation to availability of Pacific sardine.

AB Aim Structure and floristic composition of forest regeneration ( trees between 1 and 10 cm diameter at breast height (d. b. h), greater than or equal to 1 m growth height) was described in three forest types of Amazonian white-water forests (varzea), in order to analyse whether floristic composition of saplings is related to the successional stage of the forests, whether it differs in comparision with the mature flora, and if there exists a zonation of sapling species along the gradients of flooding and irradiation.
   Location Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve, Western Brazilian Amazon.
   Methods The investigated forests were of the low and the high varzea type, on an annual average flooded around 4 and 1 months, respectively. The two low-varzea forests belonged to the secondary and to the late-successional stage, the high-varzea forest also to the late-successional stage. A total of 24 circular sample plots covering 1885 m 2 were installed. They were nested within three rectangular 1 ha permanent sample plots where individuals greater than or equal to 10 cm d. b. h. were formerly inventoried. Average inundation and radiation [ relative photosynthetically active radiation (rPAR)] at the forest floor was recorded in all inventoried plots. The Mean spatial Distribution Center (MDC; Ebdon, 1998) for all sapling species was calculated. Sapling species were grouped into associations with respect to their light-demand and their location along the flood-level gradient.
   Results Average flood height and average rPAR at the forest floor was highest in the secondary stage of the low varzea and lowest in the high-varzea forest. Overall average density and basal area of the saplings averaged 2250 individuals and 2.3 m(2) ha(-1) in the secondary stage, 2330 individuals and 2.6 m(2) ha(-1) in the late-successional stage of the low varzea and 5000 individuals and 4.8 m(2) ha(-1) in the high varzea. In all forest types, species richness of saplings was lower than species richness of trees greater than or equal to 10 cm d. b. h., and amounted to 25 species in the secondary stage, to 35 species in the late-successional stage of the low varzea and to 88 species in the high-varzea forest. The amount of 'immigrants' (Bazzaz, 1991) at the sapling level increased with proceeding forest succession and amounted to 24 and 29% in the low varzea and to 31% in the high varzea. Sapling species distribution, species richness and individual density was linked to both, the gradient of flooding and the gradient of irradiation. Species richness and individual density was highest in the high varzea and decreased with increasing influence of flooding. The high varzea was predominated by pronounced shade-tolerant sapling species, whereas in the low varzea occured both, light demanding and shade-tolerant species groups.
   Main conclusions Influence of flooding seems to be the main factor triggering species composition and structure of sapling communities in varzea forests. Proceeding forest succession reduces the impact of flooding because of the biogenical induced silting up of the forested sites. However, forest succession also alters forest architecture of the overstory and such the light conditions at the sapling level. Therefore, radiation is an important factor influencing species composition of sapling communities in varzea forests.

AB Aim We tested the hypothesis that exclusion from fire and cattle is responsible for the increase in tree cover in open savanna vegetation.
   Location Four plots in open savanna vegetation from the Calabozo region in central Venezuela were studied. Plot A was located in a Biological Station (EBL) that was excluded from fire and cattle between 1961 and 1991, with only two burning events in 1964 and 1968. The other plots (B, C, D) were located within 2 km distance from A, in neighbouring farms with soils similar to those in A but under various regimes of land use and fire frequency.
   Methods We measured the cover of isolated trees, small tree groups and groves of each plot in 1960 and 1977 using geographic information system (GIS) and digitalized aerial photographs. Additionally, the plots were located in the field and the open grassland was sampled in 1995 for species composition and density of stems above 20 cm height. Information on land use was obtained surveying people at the farms.
   Results There was an increase in the woody component of all plots during the 17-year interval (1960-1977). Total woody cover in the four plots as a whole increased from 4.5% to 17.9%. All three components measured, groves, tree groups and isolated trees, increased despite differences in land use and fire frequency between plots. Contrary to our expectations, the field survey performed in 1995 showed that fire-sensitive species were abundant in the open savanna in plots B, C and D, which were not excluded. Plot B, with the most intense agricultural use showed the highest rate of woody increase, and plot C, under extensive cattle ranching, was second. The results also showed that woody cover increased by aggregation from single trees and small tree groups into groves. As a consequence of these changes, savanna physiognomy changed from open to dense savanna parkland with a woody cover reaching over 25% in one of the four plots.
   Conclusions The results agree with other reported increases in woody cover in savannas under exclusion or with annual fires during the same time period in Africa (Dauget & Menaut, 1992). Our results support evidence from previous studies showing that fire and grazing are only part of a complex system of interacting factors affecting the structure of savanna communities.

AB The sampling efficiency and consistency of pitfall traps and Winkler samples for inventory, bioindicator and ecological studies in savanna habitats was compared using ants. Pitfall traps are often used for ant collecting while Winkler litter sampling has until now had rather limited use. We test Winkler sampling for the first time in a South African savanna. Pitfall traps were more efficient and productive than Winkler sampling for epigaeic ants, with a greater total species richness and higher abundance of ants recorded. Winkler samples contributed few additional species. The relative abundance of different sized ants was different with the two collection methods. Winkler sampling was found to catch greater numbers of smaller ants than pitfall trapping, whereas pitfall trapping caught more larger ants. The standard collecting Winkler quadrat size of 1m(2) did not perform as well as 2 X 1/2 m(2) quadrats combined for one sample.

AB Changes in floristic composition and structure in a cerrado sensu stricto area were studied over a 9-y period. A sample of 19 (20-m x 50-m) permanent plots was assessed at 3-y intervals from 1985 to 1994, when all stems greater than or equal to 5 cm at 0.30 m above the ground level were measured. There was little change in species composition over the period. Changes in density and basal area of the whole community were in the range of 5% over the 9 y. These parameters fluctuated over the years with the greatest differences found in the comparisons of 1991, 2 y after an accidental fire reached the site, with other years. The changes in density and basal area were greater than in several tropical forests, probably due to disturbances such as fire occurring at 3 to 5-y intervals. The nearly constant density and basal area suggested a highly resilient community.

AB Hong Kong is within the tropics and has a seasonal climate. In winter, shores support patches of ephemeral macroalgae and areas of seemingly bare rock close to crevices where molluscan herbivores are abundant. Using a factorial design of herbivore exclusions in areas far and close to crevices, the development of algal assemblages was monitored in mid-shore, cleared areas, in winter. To estimate the role of herbivore mucus deposition, half the treatments received a mucus application. Algal development was estimated from macroalgal and biofilm development and chlorophyll a levels. In all areas, biofilms (diatoms, unicellular cyanobacteria) developed rapidly in herbivore exclusions followed by ephemeral macroalgae (Enteromorpha spp, and Porphyra suborbiculata). In herbivore access treatments, however, the algal assemblage was influenced by treatment location; few macroalgae developed in areas close to crevices, and the rock was dominated by cyanobacteria. A negative relationship between macroalgae and biofilms suggested that ephemeral algae were competitively dominant. In areas distant from herbivore refuges, ephemeral macroalgae did develop, illustrating that the effectiveness of molluscan herbivores was limited to 50 to 100 cm from these refuges. The absence of large herbivorous fish, and the sparse numbers of herbivorous crabs at this site, means that algae can achieve a spatial escape from consumption, and where this occurs competition between producers is important in assemblage development. Mucus appeared to play a limited role, only sometimes stimulating initial stages of unicellular cyanobacteria and macroalgae. With the onset of summer, macroalgae died back, and rock space became available for colonization. Unicellular cyanobacteria developed rapidly but were replaced in all treatments by the encrusting macroalga, Hapalospongidion gelatinosum, which dominated treatments until the end of the experiment. On seasonal, tropical shores processes influencing community structure can, therefore, be temporally variable and their relative importance, even at the same shore level, can change with season.

AB Patterns of disturbance and recovery were investigated in algal-dominated littoral rock pools on the west coast of Italy from February 1991 to November 1993. The assemblage was a mosaic of canopy-forming species interspersed amongst patches of turf-forming and encrusting algae. The effects of natural disturbance were investigated by monitoring the size distributions of patches of open space (mainly consisting of encrusting corallines and bare rock) in fixed plots over 2 yr. These plots were distributed in pools maintained at natural and reduced densities of herbivores. In both cases, the mean percentage of open space did not change greatly from February 1991 to February 1993, nor were there differences attributable to grazing by the end of the monitoring period. Shifts in size distributions of natural patches of open space occurred during the 2 yr of observations. The area accounted for by large size-classes (>1200 cm(2)) increased in pools exposed to natural densities of herbivores and decreased in the others. However, grazers never affected size distributions significantly. Overall, results suggested that the provision of open space in this system was mainly due to physical disturbances. A multifactorial experiment was used to assess the effects of herbivores (natural vs reduced densities), size of patch (17 x 17 vs 32 x 32 cm) and time of clearance (February vs August) on algal colonization in experimentally cleared plots. An additional experiment tested for the effects of algal turfs on the establishment of canopy-forming algae in pools where grazers had been removed. The results of the recolonization experiment indicated that herbivores, size of patches and time of clearance exerted important but variable effects on patterns of algal recolonization. Herbivores reduced but could not prevent algal recovery. Their effect was particularly evident for the algal turfs throughout the study, but it was not significant for Cystoseira spp. by the end of the experiment. There were significant size x time of clearance interactions affecting patterns of algal colonization early in the study. The percent cover of turf-forming and canopy-forming plants was greater in the small plots produced in February 1991 than in the other treatments. These effects were more evident in pools exposed to natural densities of grazers and during the early stages of colonization. The results also suggested that competition among Cystoseira spp. and algal turfs was nonhierarchical, the outcome of the interaction depending primarily upon the relative density and life stage of the interacting organisms, rather than on their identity. This view was supported by the fact that established mats of algal turfs drastically inhibited the recruitment of Cystoseira, whilst no strong interaction occurred if recruitment by these species was synchronous. Thus, variability in the intensity and timing of colonization could have important effects for subsequent patterns of algal dominance in this system, but only when grazing was unimportant and algal colonization plentiful. Alternative models were formulated to explain spatial and temporal patterns in pools where these conditions did not occur.

AB Root grafting was commonly found in cabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa Vahl), a dominant tree species of tabonuco forest in the subtropical wet forest of Puerto Rico. Over 60 percent of all stems and basal area of tabonuco occurred in unions, dumps of trees interconnected by root grafts. Self and intraspecific grafting were extensive, while interspecific grafting was not common in tabonuco trees. Seedlings and saplings did not show any grafting, probably because of their size or age. Grafted trees were taller and had a smaller crown/DBH ratio. Hurricane damage was significantly higher in isolated individual tabonuco trees than those in unions. Weak relationships between diameter class, area, and size of union, and inter-tree distances and the sum of the trunk circumferences of the two nearest neighbors suggested that a noncompetitive force such as root grafting was more important than competitive forces in maintaining the unions of tabonuco, and thus the forest community. A conceptual model of the costs and gains of tabonuco in unions is presented.

AB Microenvironmental variability and species diversity in gaps and forest understorey were studied to assess the role of treefall gaps in maintaining composition and patchy distribution in a broad-leaved sub-tropical climax forest, Mawphlang, Meghalaya. India. Photon flux density was higher in gaps than in the surrounding understorey. Relative humidity was low and the litter layer was relatively thin in gaps throughout the year. Soil moisture and photon flux density in the gaps significantly varied between seasons and gaps of different sizes. Relative humidity significantly varied between seasons but difference among gaps was insignificant. Among-gap and among-season variations in soil and air temperature were insignificant.
   The number of tree species in the gaps was positively correlated with gap area, and tree species abundance showed higher equitability in larger than in smaller gaps. In gaps, alpha-diversity was highest for herbs and lowest for shrubs. Beta-diversity was highest for shrubs and lowest for tree seedlings. Alpha-diversity of tree seedlings was higher in the gaps than in the forest understorey. Conversely, beta-diversity was higher in the understorey than in the gaps. Low species similarity for tree seedlings among the gaps could be an effect of patchy distribution of parent tree species in the forest. Thus a significant change in light and moisture regimes along the gap size gradient played an important role in influencing the composition and abundance of shade tolerant and intolerant tree species in gaps on one hand, and affected the overall species diversity of the forest, on the other.

TI SEED PREDATION OF CARINIANA-MICRANTHA (LECYTHIDACEAE) BY BROWN CAPUCHIN
   MONKEYS IN CENTRAL AMAZONIA
SO BIOTROPICA
LA English
DT Article
ID DISPERSAL; PALM
AB Predispersal seed predation is a widespread phenomenon in tropical forests.  However, few studies have quantified predator impact on seed crops during this critical stage of a plant's life cycle.  Here I report on a tight plant-animal interaction between brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) and an emergent Lecythidaceae, Cariniana micrantha.  The very hard and thick pericarps of this species are morphological adaptations to protect their fatty and protein-rich seeds from predispersal predators.  However, brown capuchins are behaviorally adept at overcoming the seed protection mechanisms.  Based on direct observations and a sample of 7328 fruits from exhaustive counts of 10 focal C. micrantha trees, I estimate that 69.5% of the entire anemochorous, winged-seeded crop was destroyed because of direct predation.  Another 30.1 percent of the seed crop also became inviable, but in a different manner:  its single dispersal opportunity was disrupted because seeds remained trapped inside indehisced fruits which had been discarded to the ground by the monkeys.

AB Human pressure mapping is important for understanding humanity's role in shaping Earth's patterns and processes. Our ability to map this influence has evolved, thanks to powerful computing, Earth-observing satellites, and new bottom-up census and crowd-sourced data. Here, we provide the latest temporally inter-comparable maps of the terrestrial human footprint and assessment of change in human pressure at global, biome, and ecoregional scales. In 2013, 42% of terrestrial Earth could be considered relatively free of direct anthropogenic disturbance, and 25% could be classed as "wilderness'' (the least degraded end of the human footprint spectrum). Between 2000 and 2013, 1.9 million km(2)-an area the size of Mexico-of land relatively free of human disturbance became highly modified. The majority of this occurred within tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannah, and shrubland ecosystems, but the rainforests of Southeast Asia also underwent rapid modification. Our results show that humanity's footprint is eroding Earth's last intact ecosystems, and greater efforts are urgently needed to retain them.

AB Fire is a natural disturbance in savannas, and defines vegetation physiognomy and structure, often influencing species diversity. Fire activity is determined by a wide range of factors, including long and short term climatic conditions, climate seasonality, wind speed and direction, topography, and fuel biomass. In Brazil, fire shapes the structure and composition of cerrado savannas, and the impact of fire on vegetation dynamics is well explored, but the drivers of variation in fire disturbance across landscapes and over time are still poorly understood. We reconstructed 31 years of fire occurrence history in the Serra do Cipo region, a highly-diverse cerrado landscape, located in the southern portion of the Espinhaco mountain range, state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. We mapped burn scars using a time series of Landsat satellite images from 1984 to 2014. Our questions were 1) How does fire occurrence vary in time and space across the Serra do Cipo cerrado landscape? 2) Which climatic drivers may explain the spatial and inter-annual variation in fire occurrence on this landscape? 3) Is fire occurrence in this cerrado landscape moisture-limited or fuel-limited? We evaluated the inter-annual variation and distribution of burned areas, and used linear models to explain this variation in terms of rainfall amount (determinant of fuel load production), seasonal rainfall distribution (determinant of dry fuel availability), abnormality of precipitation (Standardized Precipitation Index - SPI), and vegetation type (Enhanced Vegetation Index - EVI). Contrary to our expectations, annual rainfall volume was weakly and negatively correlated with burned area, and the strongest predictor of burned area was drought during the ignition season. The length of the dry season and the distribution of rain along the season determined ignition probability, increasing fire occurrence during the driest periods. We conclude that the mountain cerrado vegetation at Serra do Cipo has a moisture-dependent fire regime, in contrast to the fuel-dependent fire regimes described for African savannas. These findings imply that savannas at different continents may have different recovery and resilience capabilities when subjected to changes in the fire regime, caused by direct anthropogenic activities or indirectly through climatic changes. The possible effects of these changes on cerrado landscapes are still unknown, and future studies should investigate if currently observed fire regimes have positive or negative impacts on vegetation diversity, recovery, resilience and phenology, thus helping managers to include fire management as conservation measure.

AB Biogeographic distributions are driven by cumulative effects of smaller scale processes. Thus, vulnerability of animals to thermal stress is the result of physiological sensitivities to body temperature (T-b), microclimatic conditions, and behavioural thermoregulation. To understand interactions among these variables, we analysed the thermal tolerances of three species of intertidal snails from different latitudes along the Chinese coast, and estimated potential T-b in different microhabitats at each site. We then empirically determined the temperatures at which heart rate decreased sharply with rising temperature (Arrhenius breakpoint temperature, ABT) and at which it fell to zero (flat line temperature, FLT) to calculate thermal safety margins (TSM). Regular exceedance of FLT in sun-exposed microhabitats, a lethal effect, was predicted for only one mid-latitude site. However, ABTs of some individuals were exceeded at sun-exposed microhabitats in most sites, suggesting physiological impairment for snails with poor behavioural thermoregulation and revealing inter-individual variations (physiological polymorphism) of thermal limits. An autocorrelation analysis of T-b showed that predictability of extreme temperatures was lowest at the hottest sites, indicating that the effectiveness of behavioural thermoregulation is potentially lowest at these sites. These results illustrate the critical roles of mechanistic studies at small spatial scales when predicting effects of climate change.

AB Oil palm plantations have expanded around the world, increasing concern about its pressure on deforestation rates and the homogenization of the landscape. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate the impact of oil palm plantations on the physical characteristics of streams in Amazonia and their effects on Heteroptera, Odonata and Fish assemblages. A total of 23 streams were sampled, eight within fragments of primary forest, while 15 were in oil palm plantations. Data were collected on characteristics of the channel morphology, substrate, hydraulics, instream cover for aquatic organisms, riparian vegetation, human impacts and woody debris. Instream cover and proximity of human impacts were the variables that had the greatest effects on the physical structure of the streams, showing variation between streams of forest in pristine areas and oil palm plantations. Of the analyzed parameters, substrate, instream cover and woody debris influence the richness of Heteroptera, Odonata and Fish. The impact of oil palm plantations on local streams depended on the size of the plantations, and they cannot be considered an adequate substitute for lost habitats in efforts to preserve the physical habitat of Amazonian streams. Any type of conversion of the natural forest can have direct or indirect impacts on the dynamics and structure of these environments, with potentially negative consequences for their biodiversity. The maintenance of an adequate buffer zone of native riparian vegetation adjacent to the streams that flow through the plantations recommended, because this appears to be the principal factor determining the physical conditions of these streams.

AB Identifying the drivers shaping biological assemblages in fragmented tropical landscapes is critical for designing effective conservation strategies. It is still unclear, however, whether tropical biodiversity is more strongly affected by forest loss, by its spatial configuration or by matrix composition across different spatial scales.
   Assessing the relative influence of forest patch and landscape attributes on dung beetle assemblages in the fragmented Lacandona rainforest, Mexico.
   Using a multimodel inference approach we tested the relative impact of forest patch size and landscape forest cover (measures of forest amount at the patch and landscape scales, respectively), patch shape and isolation (forest configuration indices at the patch scale), forest fragmentation (forest configuration index at the landscape scale), and matrix composition on the diversity, abundance and biomass of dung beetles.
   Patch size, landscape forest cover and matrix composition were the best predictors of dung beetle assemblages. Species richness, beetle abundance, and biomass decreased in smaller patches surrounded by a lower percentage of forest cover, and in landscapes dominated by open-area matrices. Community evenness also increased under these conditions due to the loss of rare species.
   Forest loss at the patch and landscape levels and matrix composition show a larger impact on dung beetles than forest spatial configuration. To preserve dung beetle assemblages, and their key functional roles in the ecosystem, conservation initiatives should prioritize a reduction in deforestation and an increase in the heterogeneity of the matrix surrounding forest remnants.

AB The role of tropical secondary forests in carbon accumulation has been widely acknowledged, but the rates of changes in carbon stocks still remain uncertain. The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in carbon pool sizes and accumulation rates associated withgrowth, recruitment and mortality of trees at differentages of forest succession in semi-evergreen tropical forests and relate these to the age of the secondary vegetation and prior land use intensity. The study was carried out in a chronosequence of secondary and mature forests around Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in southern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Permanent monitoring plots were established and measured in 2011 and 2012 to account all carbon stocks and changes due to tree increments, establishment of new trees and tree mortality in different age classes of secondary forests.
   We found that carbon stocks in living tree biomass increased rapidly in the early stages and decreased in the older secondary forests. The annual carbon dynamics of trees were higher in younger secondary forest compared to older forests due to higher tree growth and recruitment. Growth functions predict that the secondary forests recover live aboveground biomass carbon stocks to pre-disturbance levels (99.56 Mg C ha(-1)) at the age of about 125 years or more, while the basal area (33.2 m(2) ha(-1)) regains this level at the age of about 85 years. The longer carbon recovery time can be explained by the fact that mature forests are dominated by hardwood species whereas secondary forests are composed of softwood species and that species composition turnover during succession is relatively slow. Secondary forests of 35 years look similar to mature forests in terms of basal area, but this is located in large number of small and medium sized trees, whereas in mature forests, most of the basal area is in trees of >20 cm diameter. In addition, the intensity of slash and burn agriculture can negatively alter the velocity of carbon accumulation. These findings have important implications for national forest carbon monitoring systems, greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional level REDD+ strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB World-wide, some biomes are densifying, or increasing in dense woody vegetation, and shifting to alternative stable states. We quantified densification and state transition between forests ecosystems in historical (ca. 1815-1850) and current (2004-2008) surveys of the Missouri Ozark Highlands, a 5-million ha landscape in southern Missouri, USA. To estimate density of historical forests, we used the Morisita plotless density estimator and applied corrections for surveyor bias. For contemporary forests, we used known densities at plots to predict continuous densities with random forests, an ensemble regression tree method. We also calculated basal area and percent stocking to determine changes in wood volume. Historical forests had densities ranging from about 75 to 320 trees/ha. Current forest densities were about 2.3 times greater and more uniform, at about 300-400 trees/ha (DBH >= 12.7 cm). Not all forests have increased in basal area and percent stocking because trees in contemporary forests are smaller in diameter than historical forests. Although oak species still are dominant (as defined by >= 10% composition), oak dominance is being replaced by many fire-sensitive species, of which only eastern redcedar and maples have become dominant. Densification and community changes in functional traits have produced a state transition from open oak forest ecosystems to predominantly closed eastern broadleaf forests in the Missouri Ozarks. This shift is not at equilibrium, as fire-sensitive species are continuing to increase and turnover in long-lived oaks is slow.

AB Understanding how drought affects annual tree growth in tropical forests is of crucial importance to predict their response to climate change. Previous studies, mainly led in the Neotropics and in Southeast Asia, have yielded contradictory results which might be explained by differences in species studied, in the tree development stages considered, or by differences in other environmental factors than water availability. Here, we described the growth responses of functional groups of tree species to drought in a Central African semi-deciduous moist forest. Species groups were automatically defined using a finite mixture model, which grouped species according to their growth model parameters. The growth model considered the variation in species response to drought, and the effect of competition for resources and of tree development stage on growth. Groups were further characterized by species functional traits. Nine species groups were identified. They differed in their ability to acquire, use and conserve resources, as suggested by their differences in maximum growth rate, regeneration guild, maximum dbh, wood density and leaf habit. The species were organized along a light requirement gradient that here closely matched a broader continuum of plant strategies for resource use, from slow-growing shade-tolerant conservative species to fast-growing pioneer acquisitive species. Tree growth decreased with drought intensity, and species drought tolerance was found to be related to resource use strategy: slow-growing species using a conservative strategy were the least sensitive to variations in water availability, while fast-growing species using an acquisitive strategy were the most sensitive.Synthesis. Shade-tolerant species, characterized by a low potential growth rate and thus a conservative strategy of resource use, were found to be the least sensitive to drought. This supports the hypothesis of a single axis summarizing multiple traits that represents a general trade-off between the conservation and rapid acquisition of resources.

AB Litter decomposition is a central focus of ecosystem science because of its importance to biogeochemical pools and cycling, but predicting dryland decomposition dynamics is problematic. Some studies indicate photodegradation by ultraviolet (UV) radiation can be a significant driver of dryland decomposition, whereas others suggest soil-litter mixing controls decomposition. To test the influence of soil coverage on UV photodegradation of litter, we conducted a controlled environment experiment with shrub (Prosopis velutina) leaf litter experiencing two UV levels and three levels of coverage with dry sterile soil. Under these conditions, decomposition over 224 days was enhanced by UV, but increasing soil coverage strongly and linearly diminished these effects. In a complementary study, we placed P. glandulosa leaf litter in different habitats in the field and quantified litter surface coverage by soil films. After 180 days, nearly half of the surface area of litter placed under shrub canopies was covered by a tightly adhering film composed of soil particles and fungal hyphae; coverage was less in grassy zones between shrubs. We propose a conceptual model for the shifting importance of photodegradation and microbial decomposition over time, and conclude that (1) soil deposition can ameliorate the direct effects of UV photodegradation in drylands and (2) predictions of C losses based solely on UV effects will overestimate the importance of this process in the C cycle. An improved understanding of how development of the soil-litter matrix mediates the shift from abiotic (photodegradation) to biotic (microbial) drivers is necessary to predict how ongoing changes in land cover and climate will influence biogeochemistry in globally extensive drylands.

AB In fragmented landscapes, changes in habitat availability, patch size, shape and isolation may affect survival of local populations. Proposing efficient conservation strategies for such species relies initially on distinguishing the particular effects of those factors. To address these issues, we investigated the occurrence of 3 bird species in fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest landscapes. Playback techniques were used to collect presence/absence data of these species inside 80 forest patches, and incidence models were used to infer their occupancy pattern from landscape spatial structure. The relative importance of patch size, shape and surrounding forest cover and isolation was assessed using a model selection approach based on maximum likelihood estimation. The presence of all species was in general positively affected by the amount of surrounding habitat and negatively affected by inter-patch distances. The joint effects of patch size and the surrounding landscape characteristics were important determinants of occupancy for two species. The third species was affected only by forest cover and mean patch isolation. Our results suggest that local species presence is in general more influenced by the isolation from surrounding forests than by patch size alone. We found evidence that, in highly fragmented landscapes, birds that can not find patches large enough to settle may be able to overcome short distances through the matrix and include several nearby patches within their home-ranges to complement their resource needs. In these cases, patches must be defined as functionally connected habitat networks rather than mere continuous forest segments. Bird conservation strategies in the Atlantic forest should focus on increasing patch density and connectivity, in order to implement forest networks that reduce the functional isolation between large remnants with remaining core habitat.

AB South East Asia is widely regarded as a centre of threatened biodiversity owing to extensive logging and forest conversion to agriculture. In particular, forests degraded by repeated rounds of intensive logging are viewed as having little conservation value and are afforded meagre protection from conversion to oil palm. Here, we determine the biological value of such heavily degraded forests by comparing leaf-litter ant communities in unlogged (natural) and twice-logged forests in Sabah, Borneo. We accounted for impacts of logging on habitat heterogeneity by comparing species richness and composition at four nested spatial scales, and examining how species richness was partitioned across the landscape in each habitat. We found that twice-logged forest had fewer species occurrences, lower species richness at small spatial scales and altered species composition compared with natural forests. However, over 80 per cent of species found in unlogged forest were detected within twice-logged forest. Moreover, greater species turnover among sites in twice-logged forest resulted in identical species richness between habitats at the largest spatial scale. While two intensive logging cycles have negative impacts on ant communities, these degraded forests clearly provide important habitat for numerous species and preventing their conversion to oil palm and other crops should be a conservation priority.

AB Plant litter diversity effects on decomposition rates are frequently reported, but with a strong bias towards temperate ecosystems. Altered decomposition and nutrient recycling with changing litter diversity may be particularly important in tree species-rich tropical rainforests on nutrient-poor soils. Using 28 different mixtures of leaf litter from 16 Amazonian rainforest tree species, we tested the hypothesis that litter mixture effects on decomposition increase with increasing functional litter diversity. Litter mixtures and all single litter species were exposed in the field for 9 months using custom-made microcosms with soil fauna access. In order to test the hypothesis that the long-term presence of tree species contributing to the litter mixtures increases mixture effects on decomposition, microcosms were installed in a plantation at sites including the respective tree species composition and in a nearby natural forest where these tree species are absent. We found that mixture decomposition deviated from predictions based on single species, with predominantly synergistic effects. Functional litter diversity, defined as either richness, evenness, or divergence based on a wide range of chemical traits, did not explain the observed litter mixture effects. However, synergistic effects in litter mixtures increased with the long-term presence of tree species contributing to these mixtures as the home field advantage hypothesis assumes. Our data suggest that complementarity effects on mixed litter decomposition may emerge through long-term interactions between aboveground and belowground biota.

AB Availability of light and water differs between tropical moist and dry forests, with typically higher understorey light levels and lower water availability in the latter. Therefore, growth trajectories of juvenile trees-those that have not attained the canopy-are likely governed by temporal fluctuations in light availability in moist forests (suppressions and releases), and by spatial heterogeneity in water availability in dry forests. In this study, we compared juvenile growth trajectories of Cedrela odorata in a dry (Mexico) and a moist forest (Bolivia) using tree rings. We tested the following specific hypotheses: (1) moist forest juveniles show more and longer suppressions, and more and stronger releases; (2) moist forest juveniles exhibit wider variation in canopy accession pattern, i.e. the typical growth trajectory to the canopy; (3) growth variation among dry forest juveniles persists over longer time due to spatial heterogeneity in water availability. As expected, the proportion of suppressed juveniles was higher in moist than in dry forest (72 vs. 17%). Moist forest suppressions also lasted longer (9 vs. 5 years). The proportion of juveniles that experienced releases in moist forest (76%) was higher than in dry forest (41%), and releases in moist forests were much stronger. Trees in the moist forest also had a wider variation in canopy accession patterns compared to the dry forest. Our results also showed that growth variation among juvenile trees persisted over substantially longer periods of time in dry forest (> 64 years) compared to moist forest (12 years), most probably because of larger persistent spatial variation in water availability. Our results suggest that periodic increases in light availability are more important for attaining the canopy in moist forests, and that spatial heterogeneity in water availability governs long-term tree growth in dry forests.

AB We provide a cross-taxon and historical analysis of what makes tropical forest species vulnerable to extinction. Several traits have been important for species survival in the recent and distant geological past, including seed dormancy and vegetative growth in plants, small body size in mammals, and vagility in insects. For major past catastrophes, such as the five mass extinction events, large range size and vagility or dispersal were key to species survival. Traits that make some species more vulnerable to extinction are consistent across time scales. Terrestrial organisms, particularly animals, are more extinction prone than marine organisms. Plants that persist through dramatic changes often reproduce vegetatively and possess mechanisms of die back. Synergistic interactions between current anthropogenic threats, such as logging, fire, hunting, pests and diseases, and climate change are frequent. Rising temperatures threaten all organisms, perhaps particularly tropical organisms adapted to small temperature ranges and isolated by distance from suitable future climates. Mutualist species and trophic specialists may also be more threatened because of such range-shift gaps. Phylogenetically specialized groups may be collectively more prone to extinction than generalists. Characterization of tropical forest species' vulnerability to anthropogenic change is constrained by complex interactions among threats and by both taxonomic and ecological impediments, including gross undersampling of biotas and poor understanding of the spatial patterns of taxa at all scales.

AB Tropical forests are becoming increasingly alien-dominated through the establishment of timber plantations and secondary forests. Despite widespread recognition that afforestation results in increased evapotranspiration and lower catchment yields, little is known of the impacts of timber plantations on water balance relative to native forest. Native forest trees have been claimed to use water conservatively and enhance groundwater recharge relative to faster-growing alien species, and this argument should motivate native forest preservation and restoration. However, data have been available primarily for leaf-level gas exchange rather than for whole-plant and stand levels. We measured sap flow of dominant tree and tree fern species over eight weeks in native Metrosideros polymorpha forest and adjacent alien timber plantations on the island of Hawai'i and estimated total stand transpiration. Metrosideros polymorpha had the lowest values of sap flux density and whole-tree water use (200 kg.m(-2) sapwood.d(-1), or 8 kg/d for trees of 35 cm mean diameter at breast height, D), substantially less than timber species Eucalyptus saligna or Fraxinus uhdei (33 and 34 kg/d for trees of 73 and 30 cm mean D, respectively). At the stand level, E. saligna and F. uhdei trees had three-and ninefold higher water use, respectively, than native M. polymorpha trees. Understory Cibotium tree ferns were most abundant in M. polymorpha-dominated forest where they accounted for 70% of water use. Overall, F. uhdei plantation had the highest water use at 1.8 mm/d, more than twice that of either E. saligna plantation or M. polymorpha forest. Forest water use was influenced by species composition, stem density, tree size, sapwood allocation, and understory contributions. Transpiration varied strongly among forest types even within the same wet tropical climate, and in this case, native forest had strikingly conservative water use. Comparisons of vegetation cover in water use should provide additional resolution to ecosystem valuation and land management decisions.

AB Most tropical forest landscapes are modified by humans, but the effects of these changes on rural hunting patterns and hunted vertebrate populations remain poorly understood. We investigated subsistence hunting patterns across a highly heterogeneous landscape mosaic in the Brazilian Amazon, where hunters from three villages had access to primary forest, active and fallow agricultural fields, and active and fallow Eucalyptus plantations. Landscape composition and the areas used by hunters were defined using a remote-sensing approach combined with mapping. We quantified hunting effort accounting for the availability and spatial distribution of each habitat. Overall, 71% of the kills were sourced in primary forest, but hunting in primary forest, which was often combined with other extractive activities (such as Brazil nut harvesting), yielded the lowest catch-per-unit-effort of all habitats. Hunting effort per unit area was highest in fallow fields, followed by primary forest, and both of these habitats were over-represented within village hunting catchments when compared to the composition of the available landscape. Active and fallow fields sourced a limited number of species known to be resilient to hunting, but hunting had additional benefits through crop-raider control. In contrast, hunting pressure in active and fallow plantations was low, despite a high catch-per-unit-effort, presumably because there were limited additional benefits from visiting these habitats. These results indicate that large-scale tree plantation and forest regeneration schemes have limited conservation potential for large vertebrates, as they support few forest specialists and fail to attract hunters away from primary forest, (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although environmental stressors affect natural systems in a multitude of ways, the interactive effect of multiple stressors on ecological assemblages remains largely misunderstudied. On tropical shores which experience seasonal monsoons, rocky intertidal habitats are physiologically stressful environments, being strongly affected by high temperatures and monsoon rains during emersion. In Hong Kong the limpet, Cellana toreuma, often takes refuge in mid-shore tidepools. In summer, these populations experience high mortality, probably as a result of stressful environmental conditions during low-spring tide days with high temperatures and/or intense rainfall periods can occur. Laboratory experiments were designed to mimic the effects of temperature stress (and increasing pool salinity) and reduced salinity as a result of monsoon rains on C. toreuma in tidepools. In general, haemolymph osmolality increased with salinity and limpet mortality increased with temperature. As salinity decreased after simulated rainfall, haemolymph osmolality (after 60 min) and survival (after 180 min) were significantly lower than in control treatments. Salinity fluctuations, coupled with high temperatures during emersion had both sub-lethal physiological effects and lethal effects on limpets in tidepools. Conducting experiments of multiple stressors simultaneously, however, revealed no interaction between hot temperatures and salinity variation, both of which operated independently for different response variables. Individually, therefore, hot temperatures and large salinity changes associated with the wet monsoon season are likely to play an important role in the population dynamics of intertidal species such as C. toreuma, and as a result will influence the structure and functioning of tropical rocky shores.

AB Few studies have evaluated the efficiency of methods for sampling ants, especially in regions with highly variable vegetation physiognomies such as the Cerrado region of central Brazil. Here we compared three methods to collect ground-dwelling ants: pitfall traps, sardine baits, and the Winkler litter extractor. Our aim was to determine which method would be most appropriate to characterize the ant assemblages inhabiting different vegetation types. More species were collected with pitfall traps and with the Winkler extractor than with sardine baits. Pitfall traps collected more species in the cerrado (savanna) physiognomies, particularly in those with a poor litter cover, whereas the Winlker extractor was more efficient in the forest physiognomies, except the one subject to periodic inundations. There was a low similarity in species composition between forest and cerrado physiognomies, and this pattern was detected regardless of the method used to sampling ants. Therefore, even the use of a single, relatively selective method of collection can be enough for studies comparing highly distinct habitats and/or conditions. However, if the purpose of the sampling is to produce a more thoroughly inventory of the ant fauna, we suggest the use of a combination of methods, particularly pitfall traps and the Winkler extractor. Therefore, the Ants of the Leaf-Litter (ALL) Sampling Protocol appear to be an adequate protocol for sampling ants in the highly-threatened Brazilian cerrado biome.

AB Ants are abundant, diverse, and ecologically dominant in tropical forests. Subterranean ants in particular are thought to have a significant environmental impact, although difficulties associated with collecting ants underground and examining their ecology and behavior have limited research. In this paper, we present the results of a study of subterranean ant diversity in Amazonian Ecuador that employs a novel probe to facilitate the discovery of species inhabiting the soil horizon. Forty-seven species of ants in 19 genera, including new and apparently rare species, were collected in probes. Approximately 19% of the species collected at different depths in the soil were unique to probe samples. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) results showed that the species composition of ants collected with the probe was significantly different from samples collected using other techniques. Additionally, ANOSIM computations indicated the species assemblage of ants collected 12.5 cm below the surface was significantly different from those found at 25, 37.5, and 50 cm. Ant diversity and species accumulation rates decreased with increasing depth. There were no species unique to the lowest depths, suggesting that subterranean ants may not be distributed deep in the soil in Amazonia due to the high water table. The technique we describe could be used to gain new insights into the distribution and biology of subterranean ant species and other members of the species-rich soil invertebrate macrofauna.

AB To investigate the existence of coordinated sets of seedling traits adapted to contrasting establishment conditions, we examined evolutionary convergence in seedling traits for 299 French Guianan woody plant species and the stress response in a shadehouse of species representing seed size gradients within five major cotyledon morphology types. The French Guianan woody plant community has larger seeds than other tropical forest communities and the largest proportion of hypogeal cotyledon type (59.2%) reported for tropical forests. Yet the community includes many species with intermediate size seeds that produce seedlings with different cotyledonal morphologies. A split-plot factorial design with two light levels (0.8% and 16.1% PAR) and four damage treatments (control, seed damage, leaf damage, stem damage) was used in the shadehouse experiment. Although larger-seeded species had higher survival and slower growth, these patterns were better explained by cotyledon type than by seed mass. Even larger-seeded species with foliar cotyledons grew faster than species with reserve-type cotyledons, and survival after stem grazing was five times higher in seedlings with hypogeal cotyledons than with epigeal cotyledons. Thus, to predict seedling performance using seed size, seedling morphology must also be considered.

AB Freshwater biodiversity is under threat worldwide, but the intensity of threat in the Oriental biogeographic region of tropical Asia is exceptional. Asia is the most densely populated region on Earth. Many rivers in that region are grossly polluted, and significant portions of their drainage basins and floodplains have been deforested or otherwise degraded. Flow regulation has been practiced for centuries, and thousands of dams have been constructed, with the result that most of the rivers are now dammed, often at several points along their course. Irrigation, hydropower, and flood security are among the perceived benefits. Recent water engineering projects in Asia have been exceptionally aggressive; they include the world's largest and tallest dams in China and a water transfer scheme intended to link India's major rivers. Some of these projects, i.e., those on the Mekong, have international ramifications that have yet to be fully played out. Overexploitation has exacerbated the effects of habitat alterations on riverine biodiversity, particularly that of fishes. Some fishery stocks have collapsed, and many fish and other vertebrate species are threatened with extinction. The pressure from growing impoverished human populations, increasingly concentrated in cities, has forced governments to focus on economic development rather than environmental protection and conservation. Although legislation has been introduced to control water pollution, which is a danger to human health. it is not explicitly intended to protect biodiversity. Where legislation has been enforced, it can be effective against point-source polluters, but it has not significantly reduced the huge quantities of organic pollution from agricultural and domestic sources that contaminate rivers such as the Ganges and Yangtze. River scientists in Asia appear to have had little influence on policy makers or the implementation of water development projects. Human demands from agriculture and industry dominate water allocation policies, and in-stream flow needs for ecosystems have yet to be widely addressed. Restoration of Asian rivers to their original state is impractical given the constraints prevailing in the region, but some degree of rehabilitation will be possible if relevant legislation and scientific information are promptly applied. Opportunities do exist: enforcement of environmental legislation in China has been strengthened, leading to the suspension of major dam projects. The 2003 introduction of an annual fishing moratorium along the Yangtze River, as well as breeding and restocking programs for endangered fishes in the Yangtze and Mekong, offer the chance to leverage other initiatives that enhance river health and preserve biodiversity, particularly that of fish species. Preliminary data indicate that degraded rivers still retain some biodiversity that can be the focus of rehabilitation efforts. To strengthen these efforts, it is important to identify which ecological features enhance biodiversity and which ones make rivers more vulnerable to human impacts.

AB Population structure and spatial patterns were examined for four species of canopy dipterocarps (Anisoptera costata, Dipterocarpus alatus, Hopea odorata, Vatica cinerea) in a 50 ha plot in seasonal dry evergreen forest at the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in western Thailand. Spatial dispersion was assessed with Morisita's index for quadrat sizes ranging from 61 m(2) to 25 ha; spatial attraction and repulsion between species and size classes were measured with Iwao's index. Only Vatica had a negative exponential diameter distribution suggesting continuous recruitment. The other species had either normal (Hopea) or irregular diameter distributions with peaks in the large size classes (Anisoptera, Dipterocarpus). All four species were significantly clumped at most quadrat sizes. At the local scale, saplings and poles of Hopea and Anisoptera were negatively associated with adults at quadrat sizes <1000-5000 m(2), while the distributions of Dipterocarpus and Vatica saplings and poles were independent of adult trees. In general, saplings and poles were always positively associated with each other. Spatial segregation among species may imply habitat specialization. A torus-translation analysis of habitat association for each of the dipterocarp species revealed both positive and negative species- specific associations. At HKK,most of the dipterocarps' spatial distributions were independent of each other and there was no evidence of strong spatial segregation among species. The irregular diameter distributions, clumping at large spatial scales, and lack of positive association between juvenile and adult stems suggest that many of the dipterocarps at the 50 ha plot may have established after a large-scale catastrophic disturbance. In the absence of catastrophic disturbance, we hypothesize that the Hopea and Anisoptera populations will eventually disappear from the plot because of a lack of suitable recruitment conditions.

AB We surveyed primates in seven fragments of Atlantic forest ranging from 210 to 24,250 ha in Espirito Santo, southeastern Brazil. The objective was to assess their population densities and fragment-specific population sizes in order to discuss the survival of primates in this highly fragmented landscape. We used line-transect sampling for censusing primates and estimated densities via DISTANCE program. Alouatta fusca, Cebus apella, Callicebus personatus, and Callithrix geoffroyi live in the study area. Although variable, primate numbers were higher in larger than in smaller fragments, the likely reasons being the lack of space and food resources (fruits) and higher impact of meso-predators (small cats) in small fragments. The estimated densities are within the range reported for other Atlantic forest sites, except for brown howlers (Alouatta fusca), which were extremely rare. Estimates of population sizes were on the order of several hundreds to thousands of individuals/species in the large-sized fragments (ca. 20,000 ha), while comparable estimates for the other areas indicate (500 individuals/species in the medium-sized reserves (ca. 2,000 ha), and < 50 individuals/species in the small fragments (ca. 200 ha). These estimates suggest that only Atlantic forest fragments greater than or equal to 20, 000 ha can harbor primate populations large enough to escape extinction in the long term. Given that < 20% of all protected areas remaining in the Atlantic forest are greater than or equal to 20,000 ha, management measures are urgently needed to improve primate conservation in this biome.

AB Lowiaceae, a family of the Zingiberales, comprise 11 species in the single genus Orchidantha. Here we present the first report on the pollination of Lowiaceae and describe a new system of dung-beetle pollination from Sarawak, Borneo. Orchidantha inouei has a zygomorphic flower located just above the ground. Observations revealed that the plant is visited frequently and is pollinated by scarabaeid dung beetles, mainly members of the genus Onthophagus. All four species of Onthophagus collected on O. inouei have also been caught using traps baited with dung or carrion in Borneo. Onthophagus was presumably attracted to the dung-like odor of the flower. Pollination of O. inouei is different from other examples of beetle pollination in that its flower provides neither reward nor protected space. Dung beetles are excellent at following a particular dung scent. Orchidantha is the only genus that includes species lacking floral nectar. It is interesting that this deception pollination using dung beetles was found in Zingiberales, in which all known species have mutual and specialized relationships with their long-distance, but costly, pollinators-bees, birds, and bats.

AB Four tree species of Shorea section Doona (Shorea megistophylla, Shorea trapezifolia, Shorea disticha, Shorea worthingtonii) were investigated for differences in seedling growth among related species. These species occur together as canopy emergents in rain forest of southwest Sri Lanka. Seedlings of each species were grown in light treatments that simulated a range of light environments found in the groundstorey of the rain forest. Seedlings of S. megistophylla grew most in the full-sun treatment. The other species grew tallest in treatments that provided partial shade or lower amounts of direct sunlight. For two of these species, S. disticha and S. worthingtonii, greatest proportions of seedling dry mass allocated to roots were in either dark-understorey shade or long durations of direct sunlight. Seedlings of S. megistophylla allocated the greatest proportion of dry mass to roots in the full-sun treatment. In the dark-understorey shade seedlings of S. trapezifolia had the least proportion of dry mass allocated to roots compared with the other species. This might predispose S. trapezifolia to more stress during drought periods. Under treatments providing high amounts of light S. megistophylla increased leaf area by increasing the size of its leaves. For S. worthingtonii and S. trapezifolia, leaf area increased by the production of more leaves rather than by an increase in area of individual leaves. Leaf area increase by number was less marked for S. disticha. Findings suggest an explanation for the co-existence of these Shorea species in this rain forest. High light environments like that in the centre of a large canopy disturbance promotes growth of S. megistophylla seedlings. Smaller canopy openings that expose seedlings to some direct sunlight favour growth of S. trapezifolia and S. disticha. Light regimes of the forest understorey and gap edge favour seedling growth of the more shade-tolerant S. worthingtonii.

AB Microbiome research has increased dramatically in recent years, driven by advances in technology and significant reductions in the cost of analysis. Such research has unlocked a wealth of data, which has yielded tremendous insight into the nature of the microbial communities, including their interactions and effects, both within a host and in an external environment as part of an ecological community. Understanding the role of microbiota, including their dynamic interactions with their hosts and other microbes, can enable the engineering of new diagnostic techniques and interventional strategies that can be used in a diverse spectrum of fields, spanning from ecology and agriculture to medicine and from forensics to exobiology. From June 19-23 in 2017, the NIH and NSF jointly held an Innovation Lab on Quantitative Approaches to Biomedical Data Science Challenges in our Understanding of the Microbiome. This review is inspired by some of the topics that arose as priority areas from this unique, interactive workshop. The goal of this review is to summarize the Innovation Lab's findings by introducing the reader to emerging challenges, exciting potential, and current directions in microbiome research. The review is broken into five key topic areas: (1) interactions between microbes and the human body, (2) evolution and ecology of microbes, including the role played by the environment and microbe-microbe interactions, (3) analytical and mathematical methods currently used in microbiome research, (4) leveraging knowledge of microbial composition and interactions to develop engineering solutions, and (5) interventional approaches and engineered microbiota that may be enabled by selectively altering microbial composition. As such, this review seeks to arm the reader with a broad understanding of the priorities and challenges in microbiome research today and provide inspiration for future investigation and multi-disciplinary collaboration.

AB 1. Achieving global targets for forest restoration will require cost-effective strategies to return agricultural land to forest, while minimizing implementation costs and negative outcomes for agricultural production.
   2. We present a landscape approach for optimizing the cost-effectiveness of large-scale forest restoration. Across three different landscapes within Brazil's Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot, we modelled landscape scenarios based on spatially explicit data on the probability of natural regeneration, restoration costs, land opportunity costs, and forest restoration outcomes for increasing carbon stocking and landscape connectivity. We compare benefits of our cost-reduction approach to the legally mandated riparian restoration and randomly distributed approaches.
   3. Compared with riparian prioritization and considering both implementation and opportunity costs, our cost-reduction scenario produced the greatest savings (20.9%) in mechanized agricultural landscapes.
   4. When only considering implementation costs, our cost-reduction scenario led to the highest savings (38.4%) in the landscape with highest forest cover where natural regeneration potential is highest and enables cost-effective carbon stocking and connectivity.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We present a guide for forest restoration planning that maximizes specific outcomes with minimal costs and reduction of agricultural production. Furthermore, we show how policies could encourage prioritization of low-cost restoration via natural regeneration, increasing cost-effectiveness. While our study focuses on Brazil's Atlantic Forest, the approach can be parameterized for other regions.

AB 1. Ants are recognized as one of the major sources of soil disturbance world-wide. However, this view is largely based on isolated studies and qualitative reviews. Here, for the first time, we quantitatively determined whether ant nests affect soil fertility and plant performance, and identified the possible sources of variation of these effects.
   2. Using Bayesian mixed-models meta-analysis, we tested the hypotheses that ant effects on soil fertility and plant performance depend on the substrate sampled, ant feeding type, latitude, habitat and the plant response variable measured.
   3. Ant nests showed higher nutrient and cation content than adjacent non-nest soil samples, but similar pH. Nutrient content was higher in ant refuse materials than in nest soils. The fertilizer effect of ant nests was also higher in dry habitats than in grasslands or savannas. Cation content was higher in nests of plant-feeding ants than in nests of omnivorous species, and lower in nests from agro-ecosystems than in nests from any other habitat.
   4. Plants showed higher green/root biomass and fitness on ant nests soils than in adjacent, non-nest sites; but plant density and diversity were unaffected by the presence of ant nests. Root growth was particularly higher in refuse materials than in ant nest soils, in leaf-cutting ant nests and in deserts habitats.
   5. Our results confirm the major role of ant nests in influencing soil fertility and vegetation patterns and provide information about the factors that mediate these effects. First, ant nests improve soil fertility mainly through the accumulation of refuse materials. Thus, different refuse dump locations (external or in underground nest chambers) could benefit different vegetation life-forms. Second, ant nests could increase plant diversity at larger spatial scales only if the identity of favoured plants changes along environmental gradients (i.e. enhancing beta-diversity). Third, ant species that feed on plants play a relevant role fertilizing soils, which may balance their known influence as primary consumers. Fourth, the effects of ant nests as fertility islands are larger in arid lands, possibly because fertility is intrinsically lower in these habitats. Overall, this study provide novel and quantitative evidence confirming that ant nests are key soil modifiers, emphasizing their role as ecological engineers.

AB To explain diversity in forests, niche theory must show how multiple plant species coexist while competing for the same resources. Although successional processes are widespread in forests, theoretical work has suggested that differentiation in successional strategy allows only a few species stably to coexist, including only a single shade tolerant. However, this conclusion is based on current niche models, which encode a very simplified view of plant communities, suggesting that the potential for niche differentiation has remained unexplored. Here, we show how extending successional niche models to include features common to all vegetation-height-structured competition for light under a prevailing disturbance regime and two trait-mediated tradeoffs in plant function-enhances the diversity of species that can be maintained, including a diversity of shade tolerants. We identify two distinct axes of potential niche differentiation, corresponding to the traits leaf mass per unit leaf area and height at maturation. The first axis allows for coexistence of different shade tolerances and the second axis for coexistence among species with the same shade tolerance. Addition of this second axis leads to communities with a high diversity of shade tolerants. Niche differentiation along the second axis also generates regions of trait space wherein fitness is almost equalized, an outcome we term "evolutionarily emergent near-neutrality." For different environmental conditions, our model predicts diverse vegetation types and trait mixtures, akin to observations. These results indicate that the outcomes of successional niche differentiation are richer than previously thought and potentially account for mixtures of traits and species observed in forests worldwide.

TI Achieving zero deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon: What is missing?

ID SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; CONSERVATION; DROUGHT; FUTURE; BEEF
AB Amazon deforestation causes severe climatic and ecological disruptions, with negative consequences for the livelihood of forest-dependent peoples. To avoid further disruptions, Brazil will need to take bold steps to eliminate both illegal and legal Amazon deforestation over the short term. Amazon deforestation declined by 70% between 2005 and 2014 due to drops in commodity prices and interventions by federal and state governments, such as law enforcement campaigns and credit restrictions for landowners who deforest illegally. Despite these impressive achievements, Brazil still deforests 5,000 km(2) of Amazonian forests each year. How then will Brazil eliminate Amazon deforestation altogether if the country is only committed to cut illegal deforestation by 2030-as stated in its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (iNDC) to the 2015 climate change treaty meeting in Paris? Here we provide an analysis of the major socio-economic-political threats that could constrain Brazil from achieving its current goals. We then propose six fundamental strategies to help Brazil achieve a more ambitious goal to eliminate all major legal and illegal Amazon deforestation. These strategies involve bringing social and environmental safeguards to the infrastructure plans in the region, consolidating and expanding positive incentives for the production of sustainable commodities, establishing a new policy to guarantee the social and environmental sustainability of rural settlements, fully implementing the national legislation protecting forests (the Forest Code), protecting the land rights of indigenous people and traditional communities, and expanding the existing network of protected areas, allocating the 80 million hectares of not designated public forests as protected areas or areas for sustainable use of timber and non-timber forest products. The implementation of these strategies however depends on the formulation of a new development paradigm that promotes economic growth, social justice and productive agriculture, while protecting the fundamentally important ecological services of tropical forests.

AB Low molecular weight organic acids exuded by plants roots enhance inorganic P-i release into soil solution and thereby increases plant-available Pi in soils. Low molecular weight organic acids may also induce organic P (P-o) release into soil solution, but kinetics of both Pi and Po displacement from the soil matrix into soil solution of agricultural soils is poorly understood, and the mechanism for P-o release is not well explained. This study used kinetic experiments to determine the concentrations and release rates of P-i and P-o induced by oxalic acid, citric acid, and malic acid in calcareous, neutral and acidic soils. Kinetic data were well described by Elovich (r(2)= 0.801-0.993, P < 0.001) and power functions models (r(2) = 0.721-0.977, P < 0.001). Low molecular weight organic acids at 10 mmol kg(-1) soil induced the exponential release of both P-i and P-o, which reached a plateau approx. 480- 2,880 min after the start of the experiment. Cumulative P-o release induced by low molecular weight organic acids was ranked as oxalic acid (0.63-3.17 mg kg(-1)) > citric acid (0.61-2.82 mg kg(-1)) > malic acid (0.52-1.76 mg kg(-1)) and mainly resulted from the release of labile P-o (NaHCO3-P-o) regardless of soil type. By contrast, oxalic acid was most effective in enhancing P-i release from the HCl-P-i (Ca-P-i) fraction of the calcareous soil, and citric acid was most effective in releasing P-i from the NaOH-P-i (Fe/Al-P-i) fraction of the neutral and acidic soils. Therefore, the mechanism for the kinetics of P-o release induced by low molecular weight organic acids is ascribed to their ability to mobilize the labile P-o (NaHCO3-P-o) rather than their ability to chelate cations (i.e., Fe3+, Al3+) bound to P-o in soil.

AB Assessing the relative importance of different processes that determine the spatial distribution of species and the dynamics in highly diverse plant communities remains a challenging question in ecology. Previous modelling approaches often focused on single aggregated forest diversity patterns that convey limited information on the underlying dynamic processes. Here, we use recent advances in inference for stochastic simulation models to evaluate the ability of a spatially explicit and spatially continuous neutral model to quantitatively predict six spatial and non-spatial patterns observed at the 50 ha tropical forest plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The patterns capture different aspects of forest dynamics and biodiversity structure, such as annual mortality rate, species richness, species abundance distribution, beta-diversity and the species-area relationship (SAR). The model correctly predicted each pattern independently and up to five patterns simultaneously. However, the model was unable to match the SAR and beta-diversity simultaneously. Our study moves previous theory towards a dynamic spatial theory of biodiversity and demonstrates the value of spatial data to identify ecological processes. This opens up new avenues to evaluate the consequences of additional process for community assembly and dynamics.

TI The stoichiometry of carbon and nutrients in peat formation
SO GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
LA English
DT Article
ID NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; EVERGLADES; DYNAMICS; CLIMATE
AB Northern peatlands have stored large amounts (similar to 500 Pg) of carbon (C) since the last glaciation. Combined with peat C are nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K), each of which plays an important role in plant production, litter decomposition, and the biogeochemical functioning of peatlands. Yet little attention has been given to the amounts of these nutrients stored in northern peatlands and their stoichiometry with C. Here we use data on nutrient concentrations in over 400 peat profiles in Ontario, Canada, representing bogs, fens, and swamps and their vegetation. We show that the C:N ratio is high (>40:1) in vegetation and litter but declines through the peat profiles to reach ratios between 22:1 and 29:1 in peat below 50 cm. In contrast, the C:P ratio rises from vegetation and litter (500:1 to 1300:1) to 1500:1 to 2000:1 in the lower part of the peat profile. Ratios of C to Ca, Mg, and K vary with peatland type. Most of these stoichiometric changes occur in the early stages of organic matter decomposition, where the litter structure remains intact. We estimate that similar to 18 Pg of N has been stored in northern peatlands since deglaciation, reflecting high N accumulation rates (similar to 0.8 gm(-2) yr(-1)), whereas P accumulation is small (similar to 0.3 Pg, similar to 0.016 gm(-2) yr(-1)), indicating that P is quickly recycled in the surface layers.

AB Landscape dynamics result from forestry and farming practices, both of which are expected to have diverse impacts on ecosystem services (ES). In this study, we investigated this general statement for regulating and supporting services via an assessment of ecosystem functions: climate regulation via carbon sequestration in soil and plant biomass, water cycle and soil erosion regulation via water infiltration in soil, and support for primary production via soil chemical quality and water storage. We tested the hypothesis that patterns of land-cover composition and structure significantly alter ES metrics at two different scales. We surveyed 54 farms in two Amazonian regions of Brazil and Colombia and assessed land-cover composition and structure from remote sensing data (farm scale) from 1990 to 2007. Simple and well-established methods were used to characterize soil and vegetation from five points in each farm (plot scale). Most ES metrics were significantly correlated with land-use (plot scale) and land-cover (farm scale) classifications; however, spatial variability in inherent soil properties, alone or in interaction with land-use or land-cover changes, contributed greatly to variability in ES metrics. Carbon stock in above-ground plant biomass and water infiltration rate decreased from forest to pasture land covers, whereas soil chemical quality and plant-available water storage capacity increased. Land-cover classifications based on structure metrics explained significantly less ES metric variation than those based on composition metrics. Land-cover composition dynamics explained 45 % (P < 0.001) of ES metric variance, 15 % by itself and 30 % in interaction with inherent soil properties. This study describes how ES evolve with landscape changes, specifying the contribution of spatial variability in the physical environment and highlighting trade-offs and synergies among ES.

AB A protected area (PA) tends to be designated in an area where tracts of primary forest remain, often with poor accessibility due to terrain features and yet with some exposure to threats. Typically, a PA is at the start of a 'forest transition' gradient. The establishment of a PA influences the whole gradient. We analyzed the temporal patterns of land-use change inside and outside four PAs, with one located in each of Laos, Indonesia, Madagascar and Cameroon. In Laos, in the Viengkham landscape, the rates of conversion of natural forest increased after the designation of the PA and were higher than the spatial baseline predicted. In the three other landscapes, the policies associated with the implementation of PAs increased the conversion rate immediately outside the boundary of the PAs. In Indonesia, in the Bungo landscape, forms of land-use associated with multifunctional agroforestry activities involving rubber trees land-use became the target for conversion to oil palm and monoculture rubber tree crops when the rules on the protection of the remaining natural forest were tightened. We tested a new metric for the degree of integration of forest in multifunctional landscapes which recognizes the surrounding matrix, both as surrogate habitat and as a corridor for tree species. Two important findings were: (i) a 'leakage' zone of influence of at least 10 km around a PA needs to be included for quantification of the deforestation and degradation changes that may be due to forest protection inside the PA and (ii) agroforest and other mixed tree cover can maintain or increase the degree of integration of forest in the multifunctional landscape for biodiversity maintenance and conservation, while providing a source of livelihood for the local people.

AB Brazil's rate of deforestation has declined by more than 70% since 2004, a dynamic unimaginable even a decade ago. Even the worst drought in more than 100 years (2010) produced a flat clearing profile from 2009-2010, an unexpected result, since dry periods usually have clearing spikes. While deforestation continues throughout the tropics (and Amazonia), and the recent change in Brazil's Forest Code has produced a modest increase in deforestation, there are significant processes that are slowing clearing and fostering woodland recovery. This paper outlines the multiplicities and interdisciplinarities of political ecologies, policies, politics scientific approaches and technologies that have moderated forest conversion and shaped Amazonia's unusual, and unusually effective development and conservation conjunctures in Brazil's post-authoritarian period. New institutional framings, ideologies, political decentralization, globalizations and an expanded arena for new social movements and civil society provided the context for this transformation. Changing environmental institutions, discourses and the relatively redistributive social pact that underpinned President Ignacio (Lula) da Silva's administration had a significant role in promoting more resilient land uses, monitoring, compliance and new markets, while regional social movements and national and international commodity boycotts affected more damaging ones. Finally, other forms of payment for environmental services, such as REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) and REDD+ are changing the value of standing forests. This paper describes how complex interdisciplinarities shaped the politics, policies and practices that slowed forest clearing. However, Amazonia's politics are extremely dynamic: destabilizing processes, violence and indifferent national leadership could still reverse this remarkable turnaround.

AB Although a major expectation of coevolutionary theory between plants and herbivores is the occurrence of reciprocal local adaptation, this has remained almost untested. Thus, we evaluated the presence and variation in the patterns of reciprocal local adaptation between an herbivorous insect and its host plant. Two four-by-four cross-infestation experiments were performed under similar abiotic conditions. The first one was done under laboratory conditions to estimate herbivore individual performance while the second one was performed in a common garden to simultaneously estimate herbivore population growth rate as well as seed production and plant defenses (resistance and tolerance to herbivory). The patterns of population differentiation for the herbivore and the plant were not independent of each other, showing all the possible outcomes from locally adapted to maladapted populations. These results indicate differences in the magnitude of local adaptation. While an association between resistance and herbivore performance was observed, there was no clear pattern between tolerance and herbivore local adaptation. Our results demonstrated the occurrence of reciprocal local adaptation following the pattern expected by theory: when the herbivores or the plants were adapted, the other species was non-adapted or even maladapted.

AB Clearing for large-scale soy production and the displacement of cattle-breeding by soybeans are major features of land-use change in the lowland Amazon that can alter hydrologic properties of soils and the runoff generation over large areas. We measured infiltrability and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) under natural forest, pasture, and soybeans on Oxisols in a region of rapid soybean expansion in Mato Grosso, Brazil. The forest-pasture conversion reduced infiltrability from 1258 to 100 mm/h and Ksat at all depths. The pasture-soy conversion increased infiltrability from 100 to 469 mm/h (attributed to shallow disking), did not affect Ksat at 12.5 cm, but decreased Ksat at 30 cm from 122 to 80 mm/h, suggesting that soybean cultivation enhances subsoil compaction. Permeability decreased markedly with depth under forest, did not change under pasture, and averaged out at one fourth the forest value under soybeans with a similar pattern of anisotropy. Comparisons of permeability with rainfall intensities indicated that land-use change did not alter the predominantly vertical water movement within the soil. We conclude that this landscape is well buffered against land-use changes regarding near-surface hydrology, even though short-lived ponding and perched water tables may occur locally during high-intensity rainfall on pastures and under soybeans.

AB We estimated carbon and nitrogen stocks in aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) along an elevation range in forest sites located on the steep slopes of the Serra do Mar on the north coast of the State of Sao Paulo, southeast Brazil. In elevations of 100 m (lowland), 400 m (submontane), and 1000 m (montane) four 1-ha plots were established, and above- (live and dead) and belowground (live and dead) biomass were determined. Carbon and nitrogen concentrations in each compartment were determined and used to convert biomass into carbon and nitrogen stocks. The carbon aboveground stock (C-AGB) varied along the elevation range from approximately 110 to 150 Mg.ha(-1), and nitrogen aboveground stock (N-AGB), varied from approximately 1.0 to 1.9 Mg.ha(-1). The carbon belowground stock (C-BGB) and the nitrogen belowground stock (N-BGB) were significantly higher than the AGB and varied along the elevation range from approximately 200-300 Mg.ha(-1), and from 14 to 20 Mg.ha(-1), respectively. Finally, the total carbon stock (C-TOTAL) varied from approximately 320 to 460 Mg.ha(-1), and the nitrogen total stock (N-TOTAL) from approximately 15 to 22 Mg.ha(-1). Most of the carbon and nitrogen stocks were found belowground and not aboveground as normally found in lowland tropical forests. The above- and belowground stocks, and consequently, the total stocks of carbon and nitrogen increased significantly with elevation. As the soil and air temperature also decreased significantly with elevation, we found a significantly inverse relationship between carbon and nitrogen stocks and temperature. Using this inverse relationship, we made a first approach estimate that an increase of 1 degrees C in soil temperature would decrease the carbon and nitrogen stocks in approximately 17 Mg.ha(-1) and 1 Mg.ha(-1) of carbon and nitrogen, respectively.

AB Non-governmental organizations have proposed nine different global prioritization schemes, some of them focusing on areas with low vulnerability (a proactive reasoning) and some others targeting areas with high vulnerability (a reactive reasoning). The main threat to the remaining natural habitats of these areas is the expansion of agriculture. We evaluated the spatial congruence between agricultural land cover and global conservation priority areas in the present and in the future using a spatial model of land use cover change from 2000 to 2100. We showed that by the year 2000, the extent of agriculture was larger in reactive priority areas than in the rest of the world, while it was smaller in areas highlighted as important under proactive approaches. During the twenty-first century, we found a general increase in agriculture area and the difference between the approaches of conservation schemes is expected to hold true, although we found that high-biodiversity wilderness areas (HBWA), a proactive scheme, may be specially affected in certain scenarios of future change. These results suggest an increase in conservation conflicts over this century. In face of agricultural expansion, both kinds of prioritization approaches are important, but different strategies of protection are necessary (e.g., reactive approaches need the urgent protection of remnant habitats, while proactive ones have space to create megareserves). Further, conservation organizations must include agriculture expansion data and their uncertainty in conservation planning in order to be more successful in biological conservation.

AB Predatory arthropods can exert strong top-down control on ecosystem functions. However, despite extensive theory and experimental manipulations of predator diversity, our knowledge about relationships between plant and predator diversity-and thus information on the relevance of experimental findings-for species-rich, natural ecosystems is limited. We studied activity abundance and species richness of epigeic spiders in a highly diverse forest ecosystem in subtropical China across 27 forest stands which formed a gradient in tree diversity of 25-69 species per plot. The enemies hypothesis predicts higher predator abundance and diversity, and concomitantly more effective top-down control of food webs, with increasing plant diversity. However, in our study, activity abundance and observed species richness of spiders decreased with increasing tree species richness. There was only a weak, non-significant relationship with tree richness when spider richness was rarefied, i.e. corrected for different total abundances of spiders. Only foraging guild richness (i.e. the diversity of hunting modes) of spiders was positively related to tree species richness. Plant species richness in the herb layer had no significant effects on spiders. Our results thus provide little support for the enemies hypothesis-derived from studies in less diverse ecosystems-of a positive relationship between predator and plant diversity. Our findings for an important group of generalist predators question whether stronger top-down control of food webs can be expected in the more plant diverse stands of our forest ecosystem. Biotic interactions could play important roles in mediating the observed relationships between spider and plant diversity, but further testing is required for a more detailed mechanistic understanding. Our findings have implications for evaluating the way in which theoretical predictions and experimental findings of functional predator effects apply to species-rich forest ecosystems, in which trophic interactions are often considered to be of crucial importance for the maintenance of high plant diversity.

AB Tropical forests provide a variety of goods and services to humanity. Although efforts to protect and manage these forests have increased in recent decades, forest loss continues. The last decade and a half has seen considerable research on reforestation with native species in Mesoamerica, including both biophysical and social aspects. Advances in knowledge have led to increasingly sophisticated reforestation treatments as well as novel ways of deriving forest goods and services from human dominated landscapes.
   This Special Issue includes articles produced as the result of a conference held in Panama City, Panama in January 2010 with the goal to summarize the state of knowledge of native species reforestation and associated ecosystems services in Mesoamerica. The introduction concludes with a call for continued research, including a mechanistic understanding of tree interactions with the biophysical environment in order to advance or knowledge of ecosystem services and their interactions. Results from these and other studies aimed at socioeconomic aspects of reforestation are critical to land use planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB While the wealth of projection matrices in plant demography permits comparative studies, variation in matrix dimensions complicates interspecific comparisons. Collapsing matrices to a common dimension may facilitate such comparisons but may also bias the inferred demographic parameters. Here we examine how matrix dimension affects inferred demographic elasticities and how different collapsing criteria perform. We analyzed 13 x 13 matrices representing nine plant species, collapsing these matrices (i) into even 7 x 7, 5 x 5, 4 x 4, and 3 x 3 matrices and (ii) into 5 x 5 matrices using different criteria. Stasis and fecundity elasticities increased when matrix dimension was reduced, whereas those of progression and retrogression decreased. We suggest a collapsing criterion that minimizes dissimilarities between the original-and collapsed-matrix elasticities and apply it to 66 plant species to study how life span and growth form influence the relationship between matrix dimension and elasticities. Our analysis demonstrates that (i) projection matrix dimension has significant effects on inferred demographic parameters, (ii) there are better-performing methods than previously suggested for standardizing matrix dimension, and (iii) herbaceous perennial projection matrices are particularly sensitive to changes in matrix dimensionality. For comparative demographic studies, we recommend normalizing matrices to a common dimension by collapsing higher classes and leaving the first few classes unaltered.

AB Litterfall production, decomposition and nutrient use efficiency in three different tropical forest ecosystems in SW China were studied for 10 years. Annual mean litterfall production in tropical seasonal forest (TSF) (9.47 +/- 1.65 Mg ha(-1)) was similar to that in man-made tropical forest (MTF) (9.23 +/- 1.29 Mg ha(-1)) (P > 0.05) but both were significantly lower than that in secondary tropical forest (STF) (12.96 +/- 1.71 Mg ha(-1)) (P < 0.05). The annual variation of litterfall was greater in TSF (17.4%, P < 0.05) than in MTF (14.0%) or STF (13.2%). The annual mean decomposition rate of litterfall increased followed the order of MTF (2.72) < TSF (3.15) < STF (3.50) (P < 0.05), which was not correlated with annual precipitation or annual mean temperature, but was rather related to litter quality. The nutrient use efficiency was found to be element-dependent and to vary significantly among the three forest types (P < 0.05). These results indicate that litterfall production and decomposition rates in different tropical forest systems are related to plant species composition and are influenced strongly by coexisting species and their life stage (age) but less so by the species richness. Constructing multi-species and multistory man-made tropical forest is an effective way to enhance biological productivity and maintain soil nutrients on degraded tropical land.

AB Unambiguous examples of ecological causation of sexual dimorphism are rare, and the best evidence involves sexual differences in trophic morphology. We show that moderate female-biased sexual dimorphism in bill curvature is the ancestral condition in hermit hummingbirds (Phaethornithinae), and that it is greatly amplified in species such as Glaucis hirsutus and Phaethornis guy, where bills of females are 60 per cent more curved than bills of males. In contrast, bill curvature dimorphism is lost or reduced in a lineage of short-billed hermit species and in specialist Eutoxeres sicklebill hermits. In the hermits, males tend to be larger than females in the majority of species, although size dimorphism is typically small. Consistent with earlier studies of hummingbird feeding performance, both raw regressions of traits and phylogenetic independent contrasts supported the prediction that dimorphism in bill curvature of hermits is associated with longer bills. Some evidence indicates that differences between sexes of hermit hummingbirds are associated with differences in the use of food plants. We suggest that some hermit hummingbirds provide model organisms for studies of ecological causation of sexual dimorphism because their sexual dimorphism in bill curvature provides a diagnostic clue for the food plants that need to be monitored for studies of sexual differences in resource use.

AB In tropical forest systems tree community change after initial succession (approximately 50-100 years) is very difficult to detect because of the very slow pace of transformation. Since the mid 1980s, there has been an accumulation of evidence that many forests traditionally considered old growth or mature forests have been disturbed. Using 18 years of data on forest change in Kibale National Park, Uganda, we tested the following hypotheses. Species that frequently recruit only into areas of large-scale disturbance (e.g., conversion to agriculture) (1) have a more strongly negative annualized rate of population change (i.e., recruitment is less than mortality) than trees recruiting into the understory or canopy treefall gaps and (2) these species are declining in their average cumulative diameter at breast height (DBH). Both hypotheses were verified. We then examined relationships between forest change and diets of the five diurnal primates in Kibale. The emergent patterns suggest that forest change will lead to declines in some species, particularly the black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza). We concluded that what was considered mature forest in Kibale has actually been disturbed in the recent past, and we discuss how potential sources of disturbance (dry-periods, elephant population fluctuations, and human disturbance) may affect both forest change and animal populations. We assess how such information might be useful in forest management. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plantation development is a significant form of landscape change worldwide. We report findings from a large-scale longitudinal natural experiment that quantified changes in Australian vertebrates as a former grazing landscape was transformed to one dominated by a radiata pine (Pinus radiata) plantation. The study included four main "treatments'': woodland remnants surrounded by emerging radiata pine (52 sites, termed "woodland treatments''), stands of radiata pine (10 sites, "pine controls''), woodland remnants where the surrounding landscape remained unchanged (56 sites, "woodland controls''), and paddocks with scattered woodland trees that surrounded the 56 woodland remnants (10 sites, "paddock controls''). In our study region, woodland is distinguished from forest by differences in tree height, tree spacing, bole length, and canopy development.
   Between 1998 and 2006, occupancy rates of "woodland treatments'' by most mammals and reptiles increased linearly. Similar trends occurred in the "woodland controls,'' suggesting that species had increased landscape-wide, rather than displaying year 3 treatment interaction effects. We cross-classified birds according to the statistical significance and nature of time trajectories. Groups included those that: (1) declined in woodland treatments in comparison with woodland controls, (2) decreased within woodland treatments but increased in woodland controls, (3) declined across the entire study area, (4) increased within woodland treatments in comparison with woodland controls, (5) increased within woodland treatments but declined in woodland controls, and (6) increased across the entire study area.
   Attributes of woodland treatments significantly associated with temporal changes in bird occupancy included: (1) age of surrounding pine stands; (2) number of boundaries with surrounding pines; (3) size of the woodland patches; (4) dominant vegetation type of woodland patches; and (5) temporal changes in vegetation structure in the woodland treatments.
   Bird species associated with open country and woodland environments were disadvantaged by landscape transformation, whereas those that benefited were forest taxa and/or habitat generalists capable of inhabiting pine stands and adjacent woodland patches. Beyond this generalization, an unanticipated finding was a lack of association between life history attributes and landscape transformation. We suggest that several key processes are likely drivers of change at multiple spatial scales. Recognition of such processes is important for conservation in landscapes transformed by plantation expansion.

AB Deforestation and forest degradation are associated and progressive processes resulting in the conversion of forest area into a mosaic of mature forest fragments, pasture, and degraded habitat. Monitoring of forest landscape spatial structures has been recommended to detect degenerative trends in forest conditions. GIS and remote sensing play an important role in the generation of such data to identify degraded and deforested areas as well as potential areas for conservation. In this study we analyzed forest degradation and deforestation trends in Chitwan district in Nepal, which contains key habitat elements for wildlife in the region. An artificial neural network was used to predict forest canopy density in five classes using Landsat images of the year 2001. Forest canopy density was predicted with 82% overall accuracy. Except riverine forest, forest area of all other forest types was reduced. Terai Shorea robusta forest, which has high commercial value, showed a loss of 23% between 1976 and 1989 and an overall loss of 15% forest covers between the year 1976 and 2001. Deforestation and forest degradation disproportionately reduced the sizes of the different forest types, a finding that has important management implications. The maps presented in this article could be useful to prioritize limited resources for conservation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim The effects of logging and habitat degradation on the richness and abundance of small mammals in Asian rain forests are largely unknown. This work compares the species richness, dominance and evenness of small non-volant mammals between logged and unlogged forests, and assesses whether assemblage variability (beta-diversity) is similar between forest types.
   Location Southeast Asia, northern Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia), Sunda-shelf.
   Methods We surveyed species-rich assemblages of small non-volant mammals in three unlogged and three logged forests for 2 years. At each forest site, we sampled a permanently marked transect and two additional sites in three trapping sessions. All analyses were performed at both levels to include the effects of local abundances and point estimates, separately from the relative abundances of species on a more regional scale.
   Results We trapped a total of 1218 individuals of 28 species. Eleven common species accounted for 95% of all captures. Species richness and diversity were significantly higher in unlogged forest (27 species) than in logged forest (17 species). This was mainly attributable to the smaller number of rarely recorded species in logged forest (five compared with 16 in unlogged forest, with a total of fewer than 10 captures). However, all common species were present in both logged and unlogged forests, and our analyses revealed similar patterns of dominance, evenness and fluctuations in abundance. Hence overall assemblage composition in multivariate space did not differ greatly between forest types. Assemblages of Muridae and Tupaiidae showed similar population fluctuations in space and time, indicating that the ecology of these taxa may be partially driven by the same environmental factors.
   Main conclusions Although species were distributed patchily within sites, analyses at local and regional scales revealed similar patterns in diversity and assemblage variability, suggesting that effects of forest modification did not differ extensively locally and regionally, but had a profound effect on rare species. Our results emphasize the importance and conservation value of logged forest stands that are able to hold a large proportion of the small mammals also found in unlogged forests. Rare and more specialized species are more vulnerable to forest degradation than commonly caught species, resulting in the complete loss, or a decrease in numbers, of certain groups, such as arboreal small mammals and Viverridae.

AB The establishment of plant species depends crucially on where the seeds are deposited. However, since most studies have been conducted in continuous forests, not much is known about the effects of forest fragmentation on the maintenance of abiotic and biotic characteristics in microhabitats and their effects on seed survival. in this study, we evaluated the effects of forest fragmentation on the predation upon the seeds of the palm Syagrus romanzoffiana in three microhabitats (interior forest, forest edge and gaps) in eight fragments of semi-deciduous Atlantic forest ranging in size from 9.5 ha to 33,845 ha in southeastern Brazil. Specifically, we examined the influence of the microhabitat structure, fauna and fragment size on the pattern of seed predation. Fragments < 100 ha showed similar abiotic and biotic characteristics to those of the forest edge, with no seed predation in these areas. Forest fragments 230-380 ha in size did not present "safe sites" for S. romanzoffiana seed survival and showed high seed predation intensity in all microhabitats evaluated. In fragments larger than 1000 ha, the seed predation was lower, with abiotic and biotic differences among gaps, interior forests and forest edges. In these fragments, the survival of S. romanzoffiana seeds was related to squirrel abundance and interior forest maintenance. Based on these results, we concluded that there are no safe sites for S. romanzoffiana seed establishment in medium- and small-sized fragments as result of the biotic and abiotic pressure, respectively We suggest that on these forest fragments, management plans are needed for the establishment of S. romanzoffiana, such as interior forest improvement and development in small-sized sites in order to minimize the edge effects, and on medium-sized fragments, we suggest post-dispersal seed protection in order to avoid seed predation by vertebrates. our findings also stress the importance of assessing the influence of forest fragmentation on angiosperm reproductive biology as part of the effective planning for the management of fragmented areas.

AB Little is known about how tropical land-use systems contribute to the conservation of functionally important insect groups, including dung beetles. In a study at the margin of Lore Lindu National Park (a biodiversity hotspot in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia) dung-beetle communities were sampled in natural forest, young secondary forest, agroforestry systems (cacao plantations with shade trees) and annual cultures (maize fields), each with four replicates (n = 16 sites). At each site we used 10 pitfall traps, baited with cattle dung, along a 100 m transect for six 3-day periods. The number of trapped specimens and species richness at the natural forest sites was higher than in all land-use systems, which did not significantly differ. Each land-use system contained, on average, 75% of the species richness of the natural forest, thereby indicating their importance for conservation. However, a two-dimensional scaling plot based on NESS indices (m = 6) indicated distinct dung beetle communities for both forest types, while agroforestry systems and annual cultures exhibited a pronounced overlap. Mean body size of dung beetles was not significantly influenced by land-use intensity. Five of the six most abundant dung beetle species were recorded in all habitats, whereas the abundance of five other species was significantly related to habitat type. Mean local abundance and number of occupied sites were closely correlated, further indicating little habitat specialisation. The low dung beetle diversity (total of 18 recorded species) may be due to the absence of larger mammals in Sulawesi during historical times, even though Sulawesi is the largest island of Wallacea. In conclusion, the dung beetle fauna of the lower montane forest zone in Central Sulawesi appears to be relatively robust to man-made habitat changes and the majority of species did not exhibit strong habitat preferences.

AB 1. Dispersal limitation is widely invoked to explain species coexistence and cooperation in the face of competition and cheating. However, empirical evidence from natural ecosystems for the stabilizing effect of space is sparse.
   2. We use a Neotropical ant-plant and its ant symbionts to show how mutual dispersal limitation brings about the stable persistence of coexistence and mutualism.
   3. We demonstrate that two ant genera exhibit hierarchies in competitive ability, fecundity and dispersal ability, which suggests that a competition-colonization trade-off could be producing coexistence. However, we also show that this trade-off is not a sufficient explanation for coexistence.
   4. Instead, we provide evidence that a dispersal-fecundity trade-off stabilizes the system by making each genus more dispersal-limited in a different portion of the environment. In this way, dispersal limitation can be seen as a form of environmental niche partitioning.
   5. We also find that regeneration niche partitioning and a competition-colonization trade-off may help to bring about local mixing.
   6. This study shows that care needs to be taken in identifying the critical mechanisms producing coexistence. Trade-offs between different stages of colonization may be more important for explaining coexistence than any trade-offs between competitive ability and colonization rate.

AB The cloud forests of Mexico have been degraded and severely fragmented, and urgently require restoration. However, progress with restoration has been constrained by a lack of information concerning the seedling ecology of native tree species. An experiment was therefore conducted to assess the influence of different environmental factors on the seedling survival and growth of four native tree species (Fagus grandifolia var. mexicana, Carpinus caroliniana, Symplocos coccinea, and Quercus acutifolia). The seedlings were established on three sites, in two contrasting environments: inside forest fragments and on adjacent agricultural land. Highly significant differences were recorded in seedling survival and growth among sites, environments, species, and interactions between these factors. Highest survival was recorded for Quercus, which uniquely among the four species displayed the same survival percentage inside and outside the forest. Survival of the other species was higher inside the forest. In contrast, growth rates of all four species were higher outside the forest. The most important cause of mortality outside the forest was desiccation, although significant seedling predation was also observed on two sites. Results indicate that all four species can be established successfully both within forest fragments and in neighboring agricultural areas, emphasizing the scope for forest restoration. However, the interactions observed between species, sites, and environments highlight the importance of accurate species-site matching if optimum rates of growth and survival are to be obtained. Quercus spp. have great potential for establishment on agricultural sites.

AB The spatial properties of gaps have an important influence upon the regeneration dynamics and species composition of forests. However, such properties can be difficult to quantify over large spatial areas using field measurements. This research considers how we conceptualize and define forest canopy gaps from a remote sensing point of view and highlights the inadequacies of passive optical remotely sensed data for delineating gaps. The study employs the analytical functions of a geographical information system to extract gap spatial characteristics from imagery acquired by an active remote sensing device, an airborne light detection and ranging instrument (LiDAR). These techniques were applied to an area of semi-natural broadleaved deciduous forest, in order to map gap size, shape complexity, vegetation height diversity and gap connectivity. A vegetation cover map derived from imagery from an airborne multispectral scanner was used in combination with the LiDAR data to characterize the dominant vegetation types within gaps. Although the quantification of these gap characteristics alone is insufficient to provide conclusive evidence on specific processes, the paper demonstrates how such information can be indicative of the general status of a forest and can provide new perspectives and possibilities or further ecological research and forest monitoring activities.

AB Conservation of marine species through fisheries management and no-take marine reserves have focused primarily on single species, but such protection may influence the target species' predators, prey, competitors, or mutualists. Conversely, successful protection may depend on responses of these other species. Empirical data and previous theory indicate that fisheries status and life-history attributes strongly influence species' responses to protection. Both direct effects and indirect effects of protection (through species interactions) have been documented. A predator-prey model depicting the dynamics of two species in a two-patch habitat (a no-take reserve and a fished area) revealed conditions under which the predator and prey may decline after reserve establishment. Not surprisingly, model results suggest that management scenarios and life-history traits leading to high predator population growth are more likely to produce prey declines following reserve establishment. Interestingly, trade-offs between enhancing predator and enhancing prey occurred at low fishing intensities regardless of the prey and predator life-history traits. At high fishing rates, reserve establishment generally outweighed predation effects and resulted in increased abundance of both predator and prey. Simple spatial models can help determine the range of possible responses of interacting species to protection and can yield some general insights for their management.

AB Lacertids are the dominant group of lizards throughout the Mediterranean Basin. Their role in food web transfer of matter and energy from arthropods and other small invertebrates to birds and mammals constitutes a major function within Mediterranean ecosystems. For many years, prey consumption by lacertids was thought to be almost indiscriminate, not much more than a by-product of habitat use. However, increasing evidence does not support this passive view. Analyses of prey availability have revealed active prey selection/avoidance in several species. Others show an internal tendency (i.e., historical constraints) to consume specific animal items (ants, clumped prey) or plant matter (seeds, nectar, pollen, leaves). Behavioural experiments showed that lacertids not only identify different prey types by both visual and chemical cues but also modify their feeding behaviour integrating past experiences. Furthermore, size, sex, reproductive state, body condition, tail loss and probably other lizard features are relevant for feeding ecology. However, less attention has been devoted to abiotic factors such as temperature and humidity. More experimental studies of the influences of competitors, predators and parasites on diet are needed. Even though it is controversial, optimal foraging theory provides a conceptual background for future studies. The evolutionary history of the various lacertid lineages, which constrains their morphology and physiology and eventually produces exaptative traits, is to be considered as well. Finally, methodology in field sampling, lab work and statistical analysis needs to be developed. Recommendations are given as to when and where to sample, which compartment should be analysed, which is the appropriate sample size, how to assess trophic availability, which statistical descriptors should be used and how they should be compared.

AB Growth rings of Mesozoic fossil woods have often been used for paleoclimatological inferences. Most of the Studies, however, rest upon uniformitarian deductions based on the observation of conifers from the present boreal temperate realm, whereas warm climates dominated during the Mesozoic. We propose a new approach, based on the study of the distribution of growth ring types among 643 samples from the Jurassic-Cretaceous interval. A clear picture emerges from analysis, consistent with what is known of Mesozoic climates from other sources. Woods with no rings are encountered in a wide latitudinal zone, extending up to 75degreesN and 65degreesS during the Late Cretaceous. Woods with well-developed latewood do not occur at low latitude and disappeared from the Northern Hemisphere during the Late Cretaceous. Our data set also shows that the taxonomic distribution of growth ring types is not regular. Among the genera encountered, 40% can build only one type of ring. The genus Agathoxylon never displays thick latewood, although it ranges from 75degreesS to 70degreesN. This demonstrates that growth ring studies must include a taxonomic analysis.

AB We sought to assess the effects of forest fragmentation, introduced Rattus rattus, exotic tree plantations and secondary vegetation on the endemic rodent Eliurus webbi (Nesomyinae) and the lemur Microcebus murinus in the littoral forests of southern Madagascar. For E. webbi the number of individuals caught, the body mass of males and the percentage of females in the population were positively correlated with the size of the forest fragments. Capture rates and population characteristics of the other two species were uncorrelated with fragment size. None of the endemic species was caught outside the native forest while R. rattus inhabited all vegetation formations except for a newly planted corridor of tree saplings. Capture rates of both endemic species were uncorrelated with the number of R. rattus caught at the same site and thus did not indicate replacement of native species by R. rattus. The study demonstrated negative effects of fragmentation on capture rates of E. webbi and changes in their population characteristics. Exotic tree plantations or secondary vegetation seem to represent unsuitable or marginal habitats for the endemic species.

AB We experimentally examined how several aspects of fruit presentation affected fruit preferences of migrating birds, both free-ranging and captive. We found that free-ranging birds prefer accessible over inaccessible fruit of a given plant species, and that manipulation of accessibility in the field can be a useful tool for measuring the relative strength of fruit preferences between plant species. Bicolored diplays had a greater number of hits (experimental displays with at least a single fruit taken) and a greater proportion of fruits removed (from all experimental displays) than unicolored displays for fruit of two plant species. Proximity of heterospecific fruit crops (separate vs simultaneous encounter of fruits of different plant species) had no evident effect on fruit preferences. Birds showed clear preferences for fruit of particular plant species when a variety of species exhibiting a range of nutritional rewards were offered simultaneously, but the preferences had no clear correspondence to gross characteristics of pericarp chemistry, such as percent lipid or percent sugar. Both free-ranging and captive migrant birds responded similarly to experiments examining fruit preferences when the fruit of two plant species were encountered separately or simultaneously on artificial fruit displays. The captive birds made consistent choices among individuals, experimental treatments, and replicates of treatments. These findings demonstrate that environmental context of fruit presentation can have strong effects on fruit preferences of migrating birds, which should contribute to the diffuse nature of the evolutionary interaction between bird dispersers and fruiting plants. The diffuse nature of this interaction may in turn decrease the ability to identify the effect of bird fruit choice on selection on fruiting traits. Finally, we suggest a method for examining the relative competitive abilities of native versus exotic plant species in attracting bird dispersers, and indicate how this knowledge can be applied in biological control programs for eradicating problem exotic plant species.

AB Species that coexist in diverse natural communities interact in complex ways that alter each other's abundances and affect selection on each other's traits. Consequently, predicting trait evolution in natural communities may require understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics involving a number of species. In August 2016, the American Society of Naturalists sponsored a symposium to explore evolution in a community context, focusing on microevolutionary processes. Here we provide an introduction to our perspectives on this topic by defining the context and describing some examples of when and how microevolutionary responses to multiple species may differ from evolution in isolation or in two-species communities. We find that indirect ecological and evolutionary effects can result in nonadditive selection and evolution that cannot be predicted from pairwise interactions. Genetic correlations of ecological traits in one species can alter trait evolution and adaptation aswell as the abundances of other species. In general, evolution in multispecies communities can change ecological interactions, which then feed back to future evolutionary changes in ways that depend on these indirect effects. We suggest avenues for future research in this field, including determining the circumstances under which pairwise evolution does not adequately describe evolutionary trajectories.

AB Understanding how human societies interacted with environmental changes is a major goal of archaeology and other socio-natural sciences. In this paper, we assess the human-environment interactions in the Pampa del Tamarugal (PDT) basin of the Atacama Desert over the last 13,000 years. By relying on a socioenvironmental model that integrates ecosystem services with adaptive strategies, we review past climate changes, shifting environmental conditions, and the continuities and discontinuities in the nature and intensity of the human occupation of the PDT. As a result we highlight the importance of certain key resources such as water, an essential factor in the long-term trajectory of eco-historical change. Without water the outcome of human societies becomes hazardous. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ancient tropical grassy biomes are often misrecognized as severely degraded forests. I trace this confusion to several factors, with roots in the nineteenth century, including misinterpretations of the nature of fire in savannahs, attempts to reconcile savannah ecology with Clementsian succession, use of physiognomic (structural) definitions of savannah and development of tropical degradation frameworks focused solely on forests. Towards clarity, I present two models that conceptualize the drivers of ecosystem degradation as operating in both savannahs and forests. These models highlight how human-induced environmental changes create ecosystems with superficially similar physiognomies but radically different conservation values. Given the limitation of physiognomy to differentiate savannahs from severely degraded forests, I present an alternative approach based on floristic composition. Data from eastern lowland Bolivia show that old-growth savannahs can be reliably distinguished by eight grass species and that species identity influences ecosystem flammability. I recommend that scientists incorporate savannahs in tropical degradation frameworks alongside forests, and that savannah be qualified as old-growth savannah in reference to ancient grassy biomes or derived savannah in reference to deforestation. These conceptual advances will require attention not only to tree cover, but also to savannah herbaceous plant species and their ecologies.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'Tropical grassy biomes: linking ecology, human use and conservation'.

AB The estimation of carbon accumulation in restoration areas over time is an important step for the evaluation of the success of restoration programs and to indicate the best practices for forest management and conservation. In the present study, we evaluated the aboveground biomass (AGB) of 10 tree species (fast-growing and slow-growing tree species) that are representative of the Brazilian Atlantic forest to test if biomass accumulation varies with tree age and ecological group (fast- and slow-growing). We also used regression models to simulate how much carbon is sequestered over time in restoration areas of tropical wet forests. The results exhibited differences between the two groups in terms of biomass accumulation; the slow-growing species accumulated an almost two-fold higher amount of total biomass (379.4 kg) than the fast-growing species (208.56 kg). The estimated age of the individuals explained the biomass accumulation: the long-lived and slow-growing species accumulate less biomass over a longer time, and the short-lived fast-growing species accumulate more biomass over a shorter period. These differences suggest that the fast-growing tree species contribute more to the carbon stock during the early years (approximately 37 years) of the restoration and that the slow-growing species contribute more significantly during the later stages of succession. We estimated that second-growth forests (4160 years old) accumulate more than two-fold carbon than immature forest (21-40 years old) and much more than ten-fold carbon than young forests (7-20 years old). These differences in carbon sequestration magnitudes suggest that services provided by restoration areas, can increase exponentially in the first 60 years, and this is particularly important for future conservation and management of areas undergoing restoration.

AB In tropical dry forests, spatial heterogeneity in soil water availability is thought to determine interspecific differences in key components of resource use strategies, such as leaf phenology and xylem function. To understand the environmental drivers of variation in leaf phenology and xylem function, we explored the relation of soil water potential to topographic metrics derived from a digital elevation model. Subsequently, we compared nine xylem hydraulic, mechanical and storage traits in 18 species in three phenological classes (readily deciduous, tardily deciduous, and evergreen) in the dry tropical forest of Chamela, Mexico. Soil water potential was negatively correlated with elevation, insolation and water flow accumulation. Evergreen species characterized low-elevation moist sites, whereas deciduous species dominated hills and dry sites. Overall, evergreen species had lower xylem specific conductivity than deciduous species, and tardily deciduous species were different from readily deciduous and evergreen species in five of eight xylem traits. In dry tropical forests, water availability promotes divergence in leaf phenology and xylem traits, ranging from low wood density, evergreen species in moist sites to a combination of low wood density, readily deciduous species plus high wood density, tardily deciduous species in dry sites.

AB Understanding how species will respond to global change depends on our ability to distinguish generalities from idiosyncrasies. For diverse, but poorly known taxa, such as insects, species traits may provide a short-cut to predicting species turnover. We tested whether ant traits respond consistently to habitat complexity across geographically independent ant assemblages, using an experimental approach and baits. We repeated our study in six paired simple and complex habitats on three continents with distinct ant faunas. We also compared traits amongst ants with different foraging strategies. We hypothesised that ants would be larger, broader, have longer legs and more dorsally positioned eyes in simpler habitats. In agreement with predictions, ants had longer femurs and dorsally positioned eyes in simple habitats. This pattern was most pronounced for ants that discovered resources. Body size and pronotum width responded as predicted for experimental treatments, but were inconsistent across continents. Monopolising ants were smaller, with shorter femurs than those that occupied or discovered resources. Consistent responses for several traits suggest that many, but not all, aspects of morphology respond predictably to habitat complexity, and that foraging strategy is linked with morphology. Some traits thus have the potential to be used to predict the direction of species turnover, changes in foraging strategy and, potentially, evolution in response to changes in habitat structure.

AB A central aim of forest ecologists is to quantify the relative importance of different community assembly mechanisms in tropical and subtropical tree communities. Recent work in this field has focused on the importance of functional trait similarity and abiotic filtering. While important, none of this work has simultaneously: linked these trait dispersion patterns to the underlying abiotic environment, considered dispersal limitation and quantified the degree to which patterns of trait dispersion may be explained simply by shared ancestry. Here we use data from a subtropical Chinese forest to accomplish this goal. We first examine the trait dispersion (leaf area, specific leaf area, seed mass, wood density, maximum height and five traits together) on local scales by comparing the observed trait dispersion pattern to that expected from a null model. Then we use a variance partitioning approach to examine the degree to which spatial proximity, environmental similarity or the phylogenetic dispersion of the species determine the observed trait dispersion. The results show that, on local scales, trait dispersion is often non-randomly filtered. Further the widespread trait clustering observed is largely explained by the environment and space, while the phylogenetic dispersion of species in a sample explains relatively little. This result further underscores that inferring an assembly mechanism from a pattern of phylogenetic dispersion is tenuous. The work is important in that it is the first to partition the variation in tree trait diversity into its spatial, environmental and phylogenetic components and that it demonstrates that functional trait data often lack enough phylogenetic signal on local scales to confidently link patterns of trait and phylogenetic dispersion. Ultimately, the findings suggest a strong role for abiotic filtering and dispersal limitation during community assembly on local spatial scales and that shared evolutionary history plays a relatively small role.

AB The concept of density dependence represents the effect of changing population size on demographic rates and captures the demographic role of social and trophic mechanisms (e.g. competition, cooperation, parasitism or predation). Ecologists have coined more than 60 terms to denote different statistical and semantic properties of this concept, resulting in a formidable lexicon of synonymies and polysemies. We have examined the vocabulary of density dependence used in the modern ecological literature from the foundational lexicon developed by Smith, Allee, Haldane, Neave and Varley. A few simple rules suffice to abate terminological inconsistency and to enhance the biological meaning of this important concept. Correct citation of original references by ecologists and research journals could ameliorate terminological standards in our discipline and avoid linguistic confusion of mathematically and theoretically complex patterns.

AB Mining activities represent a major source of environment contamination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of bees and ants as bioindicators to detect the heavy metal impact in post-mining areas. A biomonitoring programme involving a combination of honeybee hive matrices analysis and ant biodiversity survey was conducted over a 3-year period. The experimental design involved three monitoring stations where repeated sampling activities focused on chemical detection of cadmium (Cd), chrome (Cr) and lead (Pb) from different matrices, both from hosted beehives (foraging bees, honey and pollen) and from the surrounding environment (stream water and soil). At the same time, ant biodiversity (number and abundance of species) was determined through a monitoring programme based on the use of pitfall traps placed in different habitats inside each mining site. The heavy metal content detected in stream water from the control station was always below the analytical limit of quantification. In the case of soil, the content of Cd and Pb from the control was lower than that of mining sites. The mean heavy metal concentrations in beehive matrices from mining sites were mainly higher than the control, and as a result of regression and discriminant analysis, forager bee sampling was an efficient environmental pollution bioindicator. Ant collection and identification highlighted a wide species variety with differences among habitats mostly associated with vegetation features. A lower variability was observed in the polluted landfill characterised by lack of vegetation. Combined biomonitoring with forager bees and ants represents a reliable tool for heavy metal environmental impact studies.

AB Forests cover much of the earth's surface and are regularly logged. Well established ecological theory predicts, and the results of extensive silvicultural studies demonstrate the role of disturbance in maintaining species richness in forests; however, logging and other human initiated disturbance is often credited with the degradation of forest ecosystems throughout the world. Presented here are the results of a meta-analysis of 19 published studies investigating 25 distinct paired human-disturbed and primary forests in the tropical and temperate biomes. Regardless of whether studies were grouped across biomes or considered independently, the current literature indicates a significant reduction in tree species richness following logging. While the reasons for this reduction in richness are as diverse as the forests considered here, some common themes are clear. Although logging may increase the richness of early successional tree species, it also tends to reduce the richness of late successional trees. This occurs both through the altering biotic and abiotic processes regulating resource availability and through size-class and species based selection biases common in logging. Logging also makes primary forests more accessible, setting the stage for a chronic human disturbance cycle. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The relative importance of local, regional and historical factors in controlling the spatial patterns of plant species distribution is still poorly known and challenging for conservation ecology. We conducted an empirical study to link the spatial variation of species and environments among forest patches embedded in contrasted agricultural matrices. We compared how forest herb communities responded to spatial environmental gradients and past forest cover. We found low values of beta-diversity in both unfragmented and highly fragmented systems, independently from local and regional diversities. As fragmentation increased, the spatial structure of local plant communities was more complex and spatial effects explained an increasing proportion of beta-diversity, suggesting that the importance of dispersal limitations increased and played out at broad spatial scales. However, where spatio-temporal isolation of forest patches was the highest, local species assemblages could not be explained, suggesting that the metacommunity functioning was disrupted. Where the historical continuity was high, local environmental characteristics explained a significant amount of species assemblages within metacommunities, suggesting habitat-selection processes. Beta-diversity and variations in presenceabsence of species were also influenced by the intensity of landscape management, via the permeability of both forest edges and the matrix. This spatially-explicit analysis of metacommunities revealed that forest fragmentation impacts beta-diversity by altering not only the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes, but also the spatial scales at which they act. These results provide empirical support for the conservation of ancient forests and the maintenance of a high connectedness between fragments within agricultural landscapes.

AB Understanding variation in physiological adaptations to thermal stress is vital when investigating intertidal species' distribution patterns. The thermal sensitivities of two limpets, Cellana grata and C. tore uma, differed in accordance with their vertical distributions. Cardiac performance was maintained at higher temperatures similar to 47 degrees C) for the high-zone C. grata than the mid-zone C. toreuma (similar to 42 degrees C). At 40 degrees C, C. grata maintained regular heart function for similar to 4 h, while heart function of C. toreuma decreased rapidly. Heat shock protein expression revealed that C. toreuma had two constitutive isoforms, Hsp77 and Hsp72, and C. grata one inducible form, Hsp75, which was upregulated at 40 degrees C, suggesting C. grata has a more effective heat shock response than C. toreuma. The temperature-adaptive differences in cardiac thermal tolerance and Hsp expression match observed differences in thermally induced mortalities with the onset of summer and may help predict differential effects of climate change on the two congeners.

AB Climatic oscillations, heterogeneity in elevation, topographical position, and isolation time in southwestern Patagonia have been important in promoting diversification of the biota. Geological studies have shown that this region had wide ice-free areas during periods of the last glacial maximum and provided forested refugia for the biota during Pleistocene glaciations. In this study, we sampled the endemic frog Eupsophus calcaratus from 20 localities, covering most of its distribution and including glaciated and non-glaciated regions. We collected DNA sequences for three mitochondrial regions (D-loop, cyt b, 16S), and describe patterns of variation consistent with a history of both the displacement to glacial refugia and recent recolonization to extensively glaciated regions. The inferred demographic history and divergence times of the lineages of E. calcaratus suggest that the Pleistocene had profound effects on the genetic patterns within this taxon in which some populations were able to survive in refugia within colder regions followed by demographic increases but without evidence of significant range expansion. The mtDNA gene tree recovers six major haploclades of E. calcaratus, which we consider diagnostic of species lineages. These results contribute to our understanding of how geological events, predominately glacial oscillations, have influenced current population structure of a broad-ranging, ectothermic vertebrate in the Valdivian Forest region of southern South America.

AB An essential issue in future climate negotiations is how to bring developing countries on board. This paper proposes and applies the two-level interest-based model to analyze the factors that affect the likely stances of the "Plus Five" countries (Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and South Africa) on international climate negotiations. This study finds mitigation capability to be a crucial factor which consists of at least such sub-factors as per capita income, energy endowment, and economic structure, while ecological vulnerability does not seem to play an important role which includes reductions in agricultural outputs, sea-level rise, climate-related natural disasters, and others. The paper proposes six options in an ascending order of stringency that the Plus Five are likely to adopt. The paper suggests that the "Basic Four" (the Plus Five excluding Mexico), particularly China and India, are less likely to adopt a voluntary commitment to an emissions cap on the national economy in the near future than Mexico, which has the highest mitigation capability among all five. The Basic Four are likely to adopt more stringent climate polices with increasing mitigation capabilities, suggesting the importance of effective international financial and technology transfer mechanisms and further tighten emission reduction targets from developed countries.

AB The terciopelo Bothrops asper is the only lancehead species widely distributed in the humid lowlands of Middle America and northwestern South America. Its large body size, relative abundance and cryptic habits contribute to the high incidence of snakebites induced by this species throughout its distribution. The terciopelo plays an important role in ecosystems, both as prey and as a generalist predator. Diet comprises a great variety of prey items, including some species that are considered nuisances. B. asper, as other lancehead species, exhibits a notable ontogenetic shift in diet, consuming ectotherms (mainly frogs and lizards) when young, and increasingly incorporating birds, rodents, and other small mammals with maturity. Adult terciopelos also consume large anurans, especially when enclothermic prey availability is low.
   Using radiotelemetry we determined home range and movement patterns from 28 individual B. asper at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Overall home range estimates are relatively small compared with other pitvipers, averaging between 3.71 ha and 5.95 ha; home range size did not differ between males and females. Movement patterns are largely aseasonal and consist of short (< 10 m) movements between daytime shelter and nocturnal ambush sites within a given area, interspersed with longer distance (>50 M) movements to new foraging areas. Habitat use is related to prey availability and therefore to foraging strategy. Our data support a strong preference for areas near swamps by both sexes. Reproduction in B. asper is highly seasonal, and - apparently - biannual. Reproductive cycles in Costa Rica are tightly related to rainfall patterns. Therefore, the timing of breeding differs between populations in the Caribbean and Pacific lowlands. Bothrops asper is adapted to areas with low levels of disturbance along the agricultural frontier, and consequently it is not rare to find it in or near human dwellings. However, despite popular belief, no evidence supports a purported increase in population density of this species in Costa Rica. Despite human persecution and substantial modification of habitat, B. asper is a species with a conservation status of least concern, and probably will likely persist well into the future. Thus, it is important to learn how to coexist with this species, and to improve mechanisms for the prevention and treatment of accidental snakebite and its consequences. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB 1. On thermally stressful rocky shores, small, slow-moving ectotherms such as limpets exhibit morphological characteristics such as high-spired and heavily ridged shells which may reduce the likelihood of reaching stressful or lethal body temperatures.
   2. The effects of shell height and shell surface area on predicted limpet body temperatures were tested with a previously developed heat budget model. The model was parameterized with morphological data from three species (Lottia gigantea, Patella vulgata and Siphonaria gigas), which differ dramatically in their morphology and in the body temperatures they are likely to reach in the field.
   3. Limpet models and standard cones with higher height : length ratios lost heat to convection more readily than models with lower spired shells.
   4. Heavily ridged shells lost heat to convection more readily than smoother shells, but this effect was only pronounced at high wind velocities.
   5. When the heat budget model parameters were applied to a real environmental data set, the model predicts that maximum body temperatures and cumulative thermal stress vary among species. These differences are related primarily to the height : length ratio of the shell, and to a lesser extent to the presence of ridges.
   6. These results suggest that some intra- and interspecific variation in limpet morphology may be phenotypic or evolutionary responses to variation in environmental temperatures. Our findings are supported by observed patterns of limpet morphological variation across natural thermal gradients.

AB Research that connects the effects of urbanization on biodiversity and ecosystem services is lacking. Ants perform multifarious ecological functions that stabilize ecosystems and contribute to a number of ecosystem services. We studied responses of ant communities to urbanization in the Lake Tahoe basin by sampling sites along a gradient of urban land development. We sampled ant communities, measured vegetation characteristics, quantified human activities, and evaluated ant-community responses by grouping ants into service-providing units (SPUs), defined as a group of organisms and their populations that perform specific ecosystem services, to provide an understanding of urbanization impacts on biodiversity and their delivery of ecosystem services. Species richness and abundance peaked at intermediate levels of urban development, as did the richness of 3 types of ant SPUs (aerators, decomposers, and compilers). With increasing land development aerator and decomposer ants significantly declined in abundance, whereas compiler ants significantly increased in abundance. Competing models demonstrated that precipitation was frequently among the strongest influences on ant community structure; however, urban development and human activities also had a strong, negative influence on ants, appearing in most models with Delta AIC(c) < 2 for species richness and abundance patterns of SPUs and generalists. Response diversity was observed within SPUs, which suggests that the corresponding ecosystem services were maintained until development reached 30-40%. Our data provide evidence that ecosystem functions, such as water infiltration and soil productivity, may be diminished at sites subject to greater levels of urbanization and that conserving ant communities and the ecosystem services they provide could be an important target in land-use planning and conservation efforts.

AB Habitat fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. Despite their importance for conservation, the genetic consequences of small-scale habitat fragmentation for bat populations are largely unknown. In this study, we linked genetic with ecological and demographic data to assess the effects of habitat fragmentation on two species of phyllostomid bats (Uroderma bilobatum and Carollia perspicillata) that differ in their dispersal abilities and demographic response to fragmentation. We hypothesized that population differentiation and the effect of habitat fragmentation on levels of genetic diversity will be a function of the species' mobility. We sequenced mtDNA from 232 bats caught on 11 islands in Gatun Lake, Panama, isolated from the mainland for ca 90 yr, and in adjacent, continuous forest on the mainland. Populations of both species showed significant genetic differentiation (F-ST). Consistent with our prediction, population subdivision was lower in the highly mobile U. bilobatum (F-ST = 0.01) compared to the less vagile C. perspicillata (F-ST = 0.06), and only the latter species showed a pattern indicative of isolation by distance and, in addition, an effect of fragmentation. Genetic erosion as a result of fragmentation was also only detectable in the less mobile species, C. perspicillata, where haplotype diversity was lower in island compared to mainland populations. Our results suggest that some Neotropical bat species are prone to loss of genetic variation in response to anthropogenic small-scale habitat fragmentation. In this context, our findings point toward mobility as a good predictor of a species' vulnerability to fragmentation and altered population genetic structure.

AB Despite their narrow distribution, Australian rainforests still contain considerable levels of diversity and include many ancient, but often rare, lineages. Very little is known about the general biology of rainforest species, yet their long-term management depends on a better understanding of the main factors leading to rarity. For instance, are they highly endemic taxa, at the early stages of expansion, nearing the end of a period of decline, or persisting at low numbers over the long term? In this study we combine molecular, environmental, and ecological data to identify the factors responsible for the narrow distribution of a paleoendemic rainforest tree: Elaeocarpus sedentarius (Elaeocarpaceae). Between-population and between-generation comparisons of genetic diversity across all known populations of E. sedentarius show evidence of mutation-drift equilibrium rather than evidence of a recent bottleneck. Similarly, floristic and environmental data negate the hypothesis of rarity as a consequence of highly specialized habitat requirements. Instead, genetic structure and the available ecological data support the hypothesis of dispersal limitation as the main cause of endemism and that the species may have attained genetic equilibrium without realizing its full niche potential. We suggest that these factors are likely to explain narrow endemism in a broader range of taxa.

AB Competition is believed to be a central force limiting local diversity and controlling the structure of plant communities. However, it has been proposed that the stressed understory environment limits total understory plant density to such low levels that competitive exclusion cannot be an important factor limiting the local diversity of understory plants. To evaluate the importance of inter-seedling competition, we performed a seedling competition experiment with five shade-tolerant species in a tropical moist forest in Panama. Three-month-old seedlings were transplanted into the forest singly or with their roots intertwined with a single conspecific or heterospecific seedling in all pairwise species combinations. If competition is important, performance (survival, stem height, and number of leaves after one and six years) would be expected to be lowest with a conspecific neighbor and greatest without a neighbor. The experiment was replicated in five 0.24-m(-2) plots at each of 20 sites in tall secondary forest. To test whether seedling performance differed among treatments we fitted linear mixed models (LMM) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), treating species identity and microsite (site and plot) as random effects. The five shade-tolerant study species all experienced good establishment with relatively high survival and growth rates. The neighbor treatment consistently affected seedling performance, but the effect was always very small, both in absolute terms and relative to the much stronger species and microsite effects. Seedlings with a conspecific neighbor consistently performed worse than seedlings with a heterospecific neighbor, but having no neighbor generally did not cause superior performance relative to the other treatments. We conclude that direct competitive interactions are relatively unimportant among understory plants in humid tropical forests.

AB This study analyses the effect of resource availability (i.e. sheep dung) on dung beetle communities in an arid region of Central Spain, both at regional and at local scales. A total of 18 sites within 600 km(2) were sampled for the regional analysis and 16 sites within the 30 km(2) of an Iberian municipality were sampled for the local analysis. Spatial and environmental characteristics of sampling sites were also compiled at both scales, including measures of grazing activity (livestock density at regional scale, and two counts of rabbit and sheep dung at local scale). At a regional scale, any environmental or spatial variable can help to explain the variation in abundance. However, species richness was related to summer precipitation and composition was related to elevation. At local scale, abundance is not significantly related to any of the environmental variables, but species richness was related to the local amount of sheep dung (27% of variance). The amount of dung in a 2-km buffer around the site accounts for 27-32% of variance in abundance and 60-65% of variance in species richness. The presence of the flock with the highest sheep density explains 53% of abundance variability and 73% of species richness variance. A cluster analysis of localities identified two main groups, one characterized by a lower abundance and species richness that can be considered a nested subsample of the species-rich group. The mean and maximum amount of sheep dung in the sites separated by less than 2 km are the only significant explanatory variables able to discriminate both groups.
   These results suggest that grazing intensity (and the associated increase in the amount of trophic resources) is a key factor in determining local variation in the diversity and composition of dung beetle assemblages. However, dung beetle assemblages are not spatially independent at the analysed resolution, and the amount of dung in the surroundings seems to be more important for locally collected species than the dung effectively found in the site. Although differences in the availability and quantity of trophic resources among nearby sites could be affecting the population dynamics and dispersion of dung beetles within a locality, sites with larger populations, and greater species numbers would not be able to exercise enough influence as to bring about a complete local faunistic homogenization.

AB Soil biota and chemistry were compared between harvester ant (Messor andrei) nests and adjacent, non-ant soil from a semi-arid, serpentine grassland. The major soil groups (bacteria, fungi, nematodes, miscellaneous eukaryotes, and microarthropods) were quantified. All soil groups examined were more abundant and diverse in ant nests than in non-ant soil, and all soil nutrients were similarly enriched inside nests. A principal component analysis indicated that the enrichment of bacteria and fungi inside ant nests explained the majority of variation in the other response variables. Thus, it appears that M. andrei performs some activity and/or enriches one or more nutrients (e.g. phosphorous), which heavily impacts the base of the soil foodweb (bacteria and fungi). This suggests that these ant nests exert significant effects on the resident soil biota via bottom-up processes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1 Propagule ( diaspore) predation by crabs has been shown to be a major source of mortality for mangroves. We measured predation by crabs on seeds of nine tropical mangrove species in multifactorial experiments by following the fates of tethered propagules.
   2 We tested whether planting, intertidal position and canopy gaps influenced predation of propagules and whether the predation of propagules was reduced in the presence of conspecifics. We also tested if predation influenced patterns of propagule establishment.
   3 Mortality due to predation ranged from 22 to 100%, with Aegiceras corniculatum > Avicennia marina > Bruguiera parviflora > Aegialitis annulata > B. exaristata > Ceriops australis > C. decandra =B. gymnorrhiza > Rhizophora stylosa . Initial predator preference was correlated with the size of propagules.
   4 Propagule planting (prone vs. implanted) and canopy type had the largest magnitude of effects across all species for treatment effects. Propagules dispersed in the prone position had more mortality while those dispersed into canopy gaps were generally less preyed upon. Three species were tested for dominance-predation by regression of stand relative density with final predation by crabs for canopy treatments. No species had significant effects that supported the hypothesis.
   5 Predation by crabs often changed with intertidal position but showed no consistent pattern among species or gap treatments. Interactions of canopy treatment and tidal position showed that predation by crabs did not have a major influence on the zonation of mangroves in our study sites.
   6 Analyses of covariance of predation and establishment showed that establishment success is strongly controlled by predation in six of the nine species tested. This suggests that herbivores have a greater impact on recruitment than do microhabitat effects on resources. The combined effects of predator refuge and growth preference enhance recruitment in large canopy gaps. Crab predators appear to maintain the floristic similarity between canopy gaps and surrounding forests in tropical mangrove forests of northern Australia by removing allopatric species from gaps.

AB The abundance of competent epineustonic larvae of the gastropod Concholepas concholepas (Gastropoda: Muricidae) in nearshore waters at 2 sites along the central coast of Chile was examined through monthly plankton tows from July 1999 to June 2000, Larvae were found in plankton collections from July 1999 to February 2000 with maximum abundance in September and October. Settlement in artificial collectors deployed onshore on the lower intertidal zone showed the same unimodal pattern with a settlement peak during October and November. Variation in larval distribution among sampling dates was related to the occurrence of north-south winds. We found that C, concholepas larvae were more abundant closer to shore after moderate southerly wind periods than on calm days, probably because of the shoreward advection of the upper sea surface layer. While sampling during a strong coastal upwelling event (produced by strong southwesterly winds), C. concholepas larvae were only found in the upwelled waters between the front and the coast. This unusual pattern contrasts with what would be expected for typical epineustonic larvae, suggesting the existence of a mechanism of transport or retention by which C. concholepas larvae stay near coastal settling areas, thus avoiding offshore dispersion.

AB Classifications of tree species into regeneration guilds or functional groups are often based on a limited number of life history characteristics indicative of requirements for early establishment, with the assumption that these traits are correlated with growth requirements of larger individuals. We tested the validity of this assumption for Alseis blackiana, a common canopy tree in central Panama, by examining its seed germination, seedling growth, and sapling distribution, growth, and mortality. We found that the early life history of Alseis is characteristic of pioneer species: the seed germination rate was much higher in forest gaps than in the forest understory, small seedlings were absent from the understory, and seedlings showed strong plastic responses to variation in light. Seedling relative growth rate, leaf area production rate, and maximum carbon assimilation rates of Alseis are much more similar to those of the pioneer tree Miconia argentea than to those of the non-pioneer tree Tetragastris panamensis. However, in contrast to Miconia, established seedlings of Alseis are capable of remarkable persistence in the understory; in a 1-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, the mortality rate for 722 saplings <1 cm dbh was <4% per year between 1986 and 1998. We suspect that shade tolerance in Alseis is achieved by both physiological and morphological adaptations, e.g., efficient light interception by thin, nonoverlapping leaves, tolerance to litterfall damage, and a high resprouting capacity. These results show that existing functional group classifications do not account for the full range of seedling trait combinations found in tropical trees and indicate that a gap requirement for seedling establishment need not limit the abundance of adult individuals in a stand.

AB 1. The Chilean rocky coast has been exploited for food by coastal gatherers for at least 8500 years BP and probably was an important factor in how prehistoric people were able to colonize the South Americas Pacific Rim. The main species targeted in the past were the same as those today except that now the gatherers are resident and the fishing activity is more intense and persistent.
   2. With many pertinent studies from around the world having been published on this topic, mostly conducted in Marine Reserves, this review tries to identify the main patterns that can help us recognize, in the Chilean intertidal, the degree of exploitation on wave exposed and wave protected rocky shore habitats.
   3. Three clear patterns were identified depending on the trophic level adopted by the human gatherers in the food chain of the intertidal zone. First, when the humans act as herbivores, collecting the large laminarian Durvillaea antarctica, adult plants disappear from the accessible sites, especially the midlittoral, semi-exposed and exposed habitats.
   4. Second, when humans harvest the ecologically important herbivorous archeogastropoda Fissurella spp., this results in the red alga Mazzaella laminarioides covering almost 100% of the midlittoral rocks. Third, when humans become top predators by collecting the muricid carnivore Concholepas concholepas, then bivalves, mainly Perumytilus purpuratus, cover the rocks in multiple layers.
   5. These patterns contribute to the evaluation of the state of conservation of the Chilean rocky intertidal shores, especially because the north and the south are beginning to be connected by a new coastal road. Thus it is necessary to evaluate urgently, on a large spatial scale, the state of conservation of these communities, in order to help select the appropriate places for establishing Marine Reserves.

AB Patterns of distribution with respect to microhabitat do not necessarily reflect the "preferred" situation for a given species. Carefully controlled experiments are required to test the model that behaviour rather than processes of recruitment or mortality maintains the pattern. The model that behaviour could maintain associations between intertidal gastropods (Bembicium auratum) and microhabitat provided by oysters and rock pools was examined experimentally. All individuals transplanted to plots on bare rock dispersed, whereas up to 50% of control animals remained in situ after being moved within or between plots of oysters or rock pools. Disproportionately large numbers of animals recaptured after the experiment were found among oysters or in rock pools. The scope and limitations of conclusions from such experiments are discussed in addition to some alternative approaches to testing the behavioural "preference" model. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Formation and closure of canopy gaps was monitored for three years in 12 ha of primary rain forest at Nouragues, French Guiana. At the first inventory, in April 1991, 74 openings in the canopy >4 m(2) (sensu Brokaw 1982a) were located; 60 of these gaps were formed before January 1990. Between January 1990 and December 1993, 5 to 15 gaps were annually formed, opening 0.64-1.33% of the forest canopy each year. Of all gaps, 41% were created by a falling, snapped tree, 34% by a falling, uprooted tree, 22% by a falling branch, and 3% by a falling dead stem. A refined nearest neighbour analysis showed that gaps formed after January 1990 were clustered: uprooting of trees seemed to be related to shallow soils, and relatively many other trees fell when a tree uprooted, independent oi the dbh of the uprooted tree. In 37 gaps, canopy openness in the gap centre (determined by hemispherical photographs) was monitored over three years. In 54% of the gaps, canopy openness increased in two successive years. It is reasoned that edges of especially large gaps may frequently be re-disturbed by falling trees or branches. Results suggest that gaps have closed after around 15 years. More data are needed to verify this.

AB The composition of the germinable seed bank was studied in four vegetation states of the Festuca pallescens grasslands in semiarid Patagonia during four years. The aim of this study was to test whether above-ground vegetation states resulting from grazing exclusion or different combinations oi grazing and topography are reflected in different states of the germinable seed bank. The size of the total and dicot germinable seed bank was positively related to the total cover in each stale. Dicots dominated all germinable seed bank states. Carex patagonica increased its cover as well as its germinable seed bank under grazing disturbance. Grazing did not reduce the germinable seed bank of perennial grasses in uplands where the grazing pressure is lower as compared with slopes. In slopes the germinable seed bank of perennial grasses was significantly reduced by grazing. A reduction of the length oi the grazing period in late spring increases the germinable seed bank of perennial grasses both in upland and slope. These results are interpreted in the frame of a model of management techniques where grazing exclusion during late spring and late summer increases the seed bank of the perennial grasses and promotes their establishment in uplands. The artificial addition of seeds of perennial grasses and the manipulation of the soil surface in order to increase ''safe sites'' appear as management alternatives that deserve further evaluation to improve plant reestablishment in slopes.

AB Climatic stresses limit plant growth and productivity. In the past decade, tree improvement programs were mainly focused on yield but it is obvious that enhanced stress resistance is also required. In this review we highlight important drought avoidance and tolerance mechanisms in forest trees. Genomes of economically important trees species with divergent resistance mechanisms can now be exploited to uncover the mechanistic basis of long-term drought adaptation at the whole plant level. Molecular tree physiology indicates that osmotic adjustment, antioxidative defense and increased water use efficiency are important targets for enhanced drought tolerance at the cellular and tissue level. Recent biotechnological approaches focused on overexpression of genes involved in stress sensing and signaling, such as the abscisic acid core pathway, and down-stream transcription factors. By this strategy, a suite of defense systems was recruited, generally enhancing drought and salt stress tolerance under laboratory conditions. However, field studies are still scarce. Under field conditions trees are exposed to combinations of stresses that vary in duration and magnitude. Variable stresses may overrule the positive effect achieved by engineering an individual defense pathway. To assess the usability of distinct modi fications, large-scale experimental field studies in different environments are necessary. To optimize the balance between growth and defense, the use of stress-inducible promoters may be useful. Future improvement programs for drought resistance will bene fit from a better understanding of the intricate networks that ameliorate molecular and ecological traits of forest trees.

AB Partitioning of soil phosphorus (P) pools has been proposed as a key mechanism maintaining plant diversity, but experimental support is lacking. Here, we provided different chemical forms of P to 15 tree species with contrasting root symbiotic relationships to investigate plant P acquisition in both tropical and subtropical forests. Both ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees responded positively to addition of inorganic P, but strikingly, ECM trees acquired more P from a complex organic form (phytic acid). Most ECM tree species and all AM tree species also showed some capacity to take up simple organic P (monophosphate). Mycorrhizal colonisation was negatively correlated with soil extractableP concentration, suggesting that mycorrhizal fungi may regulate organic P acquisition among tree species. Our results support the hypothesis that ECM and AM plants partition soil P sources, which may play an ecologically important role in promoting species coexistence in tropical and subtropical forests.

AB Despite its negative impacts on the environment and biodiversity, tree plantations can contribute to biodiversity conservation in fragmented landscapes, as they harbor many native species. In this study, we investigated the impact of Eucalyptus plantations on the taxonomic and functional diversity of ant communities, comparing ant communities sampled in managed and unmanaged (abandoned for 28 years) Eucalyptus plantations, and native Atlantic rain forests. Eucalyptus plantations, both managed and unmanaged, reduced the functional diversity and increased the similarity between ant communities leading to functional homogenization. While communities in managed plantations had the lowest values of both taxonomic and functional ant diversities, ant communities from unmanaged plantations had similar values of species richness, functional redundancy and Rao's Q compared to ant communities from forest patches (although functional richness was lower). In addition, communities in unmanaged Eucalyptus plantations were taxonomically and functionally more similar to communities located in managed plantations, indicating that Eucalyptus plantations have a severe long-term impact on ant communities. These results indicate that natural regeneration may mitigate the impact of Eucalyptus management, particularly regarding the functional structure of the community (a diversity), although it does not attenuate the effects of long term homogenization in community composition (beta diversity).

AB Specialist herbivores and pathogens could induce negative conspecific density dependence among their hosts and thereby contribute to the diversity of plant communities. A small number of hyperdiverse genera comprise a large portion of tree diversity in tropical forests. These closely related congeners are likely to share natural enemies. Diverse defenses could still allow congeners to partition niche space defined by natural enemies, but interspecific differences in defenses would have to exceed intraspecific variation in defenses. We ask whether interspecific variation in secondary chemistry exceeds intraspecific variation for species from four hyperdiverse tropical tree genera. We used novel methods to quantify chemical structural similarity for all compounds present in methanol extracts of leaf tissue. We sought to maximize intraspecific variation by selecting conspecific leaves from different ontogenetic stages (expanding immature vs. fully hardened mature), different light environments (deep under-story shade vs. large forest gaps), and different seasons (dry vs. wet). Chemical structural similarity differed with ontogeny, light environment, and season, but interspecific differences including those among congeneric species were much larger. Our results suggest that species differences in secondary chemistry are large relative to within-species variation, perhaps sufficiently large to permit niche segregation among congeneric tree species based on chemical defenses.

AB Generally Early Triassic floras are believed to be depauperate, suffering from protracted recovery following the Permian-Triassic extinction event. Here we present palynological data of an expanded East Greenland section documenting recovered floras in the basal Triassic (Griesbachian) and a subsequent fundamental floral turnover, postdating the Permian-Triassic boundary extinction by about 500 kyrs. This event is marked by a swap in dominating floral elements, changing from gymnosperm pollen-dominated associations in the Griesbachian to lycopsid spore-dominated assemblages in the Dienerian. This turnover coincides with an extreme delta C-13(org) negative shift revealing a severe environmental crisis, probably induced by volcanic outbursts of the Siberian Traps, accompanied by a climatic turnover, changing from cool and dry in the Griesbachian to hot and humid in the Dienerian. Estimates of sedimentation rates suggest that this environmental alteration took place within some 1000 years. Similar, coeval changes documented on the North Indian Margin (Pakistan) and the Bowen Basin (Australia) indicate the global extent of this crisis. Our results evidence the first profound disruption of the recovery of terrestrial environments about 500kyrs after the Permian-Triassic extinction event. It was followed by another crisis, about 1myrs later thus, the Early Triassic can be characterised as a time of successive environmental crises.

AB Abstract
   Landscape ecology plays a vital role in understanding the impacts of land-use change on biodiversity, but it is not a predictive discipline, lacking theoretical models that quantitatively predict biodiversity patterns from first principles. Here, we draw heavily on ideas from phylogenetics to fill this gap, basing our approach on the insight that habitat fragments have a shared history. We develop a landscape 'terrageny', which represents the historical spatial separation of habitat fragments in the same way that a phylogeny represents evolutionary divergence among species. Combining a random sampling model with a terrageny generates numerical predictions about the expected proportion of species shared between any two fragments, the locations of locally endemic species, and the number of species that have been driven locally extinct. The model predicts that community similarity declines with terragenetic distance, and that local endemics are more likely to be found in terragenetically distinctive fragments than in large fragments. We derive equations to quantify the variance around predictions, and show that ignoring the spatial structure of fragmented landscapes leads to over-estimates of local extinction rates at the landscape scale. We argue that ignoring the shared history of habitat fragments limits our ability to understand biodiversity changes in human-modified landscapes.

AB Previous studies that tracked the movements of single bird species within human-modified landscapes have shown that the ability of forest birds to move across matrix habitat differs among species. Functional guild specificity as well as landscape characteristics have been shown to influence bird movements, entailing different movement behaviour of birds within a community. Studies investigating how both these factors influence the movements of entire bird assemblages across fragmented landscapes are essential but have rarely been conducted. In this study, we determined how species' traits and different forest matrices influence bird movements among nine forest patches in a highly fragmented South African landscape. We combined 90h of bird observations with capturemarkrecaptures (104754 mist-net hours) to distinguish between movements among patches (all birds that conduct long-distance movements across the landscape) and movements within patches (all resident birds that conduct only short-distance movements within a fragment). Overall, we detected a high bird movement activity across the fragmented landscape. Dietary specialization, habitat affinity and body mass strongly shaped the relative distribution of bird species across the nine fragments with frugivorous birds, forest specialists and large-bodied species showing the highest movement abilities. In contrast, resident insectivores and forest generalists tended to move only within particular forest fragments. Our results suggest that remnant forest fragments may represent valuable stepping stones as well as permanent habitat for local bird assemblages. We emphasize that beside the conservation of natural forests, the maintenance of nearby, structurally rich forest fragments is pivotal in maintaining regional forest bird assemblages in human-modified landscapes.

AB Cyclocarya paliurus has been used for drug formulations and ingredients in functional foods in China. Field studies were conducted to examine the relationships between environmental factors and flavonoid accumulation. A split-plot randomized design was used to establish three shading treatments and three fertilization levels, and growth parameters and flavonoid contents were detected. The greatest biomass production was achieved in intermediate shade and fertilization treatment, and leaf production per seedling increased by 139.5% compared to the treatment without shade and fertilization. Overall, shade and fertilization had a significantly negative effect on contents of total flavonoid, kaempferol, quercetin, and isoquercitrin in leaves of C. paliurus. However, the greatest accumulation of total flavonoid in the leaves was observed in intermediate shade and fertilization treatment, achieving 364.4 g/plant. The results suggest that manipulating the field growing conditions and optimizing the silvicultural system would be important for obtaining the greatest yield of targeted health-promoting substances.

AB Most of the described and probably undescribed species on Earth are insects. Global models of species diversity rarely focus on insects and none attempt to address unknown, undescribed diversity. We assembled a database representing about 13,000 records for ant generic distribution from over 350 regions that cover much of the globe. Based on two models of diversity and endemicity, we identified regions where our knowledge of ant diversity is most limited, regions we have called "hotspots of discovery." A priori, such regions might be expected to be remote and untouched. Instead, we found that the hotspots of discovery are also the regions in which biodiversity is the most threatened by habitat destruction. Our results not only highlight the immediate need for conservation of the remaining natural habitats in these regions, but also the extent to which, by focusing on wellknown groups such as vertebrates, we may fail to conserve the far greater diversity of the smaller species yet to be found.

AB We explore the potential for payments for ecosystem services (PES) to reconcile conservation and development goals, using a case study of an experimental PES intervention around the Nyungwe National Park in Rwanda. The scheme involves the purchase of biodiversity conservation services from local communities in four selected locations. Although a portion of the payment is awarded at the household level, it is the collective action of the community that determines the level of the payment. Contracts are negotiated annually and include performance indicators within each participating community. We examine the ability of PES to achieve conservation and development objectives, through three sub-questions: Is the PES scheme effective? Is it legitimate and fair? Is it equitable? Our findings indicate that the relationship between these evaluation criteria is complex, with both trade-offs and synergies. In this case study the effectiveness of PES is dependent on the equitable distribution of the payment, participants' belief and acceptance of the service being paid for, institutional histories that aid in the establishment of legitimacy and fairness, and the complementary nature of PES to more conventional enforcement methods.

AB Ants are widely found in Mediterranean soils, where they increase water infiltration rates by forming soil macropores during nest construction. While higher water infiltration usually results in lower soil erosion rates, new soil brought to the surface by ant activity could increase sediments available for erosion. This could be especially important in intensively-managed citrus orchards, where surface mineral soil is exposed due to the lack of vegetation cover as a consequence of herbicide treatments. In the summer of 2009 rainfall simulations of low frequency-high intensity rainstorms were conducted in an orange orchard in eastern Spain on plots that contained ant nests and adjacent paired-plots without ant nests. Since soil erosion is a scale-dependent process, we used three plot sizes (0.25 m(2), 1 m(2), and 12 m(2)) to determine the effect of ant burrowing and nesting on soil and water losses. Ant nests decreased water losses from 22.5% at 0.25 m(2) to 10.6% at 12 m(2), but soil erosion rates were nearly double in areas with ant activity (0.56 to 0.59 Mg ha(-1) h(-1)), as compared to soil with no ants (0.31 to 036 Mg ha(-1) h(-1)). Our results indicate that the presence of ants can increase soil erosion when rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration capacity of the ant macropores. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Stem diameter increments of the broadleaved deciduous tree species Tabebuia chrysantha were measured with high-resolution dendrometers in a tropical lower montane forest and in a dry forest in southern Ecuador, the latter showing a distinct dry season. Those analyses were complemented by wood anatomical studies on regularly collected microcores to determine the season of active cambial growth and the time of formation of annual growth boundaries. The length of the cambial active period varied between 3 and 7 months at the tropical lower montane forest and 2 and 4 months in the dry forest, respectively. During dry days, amplitudes of daily stem diameter variations correlated with vapour pressure deficit. During October and November, inter-annual climate variations may lead to dry and sunny conditions in the tropical lower montane forest, causing water deficit and stem diameter shrinkage in T. chrysantha. The results of the climate-growth analysis show a positive relationship between tree growth and rainfall as well as vapour pressure deficit in certain periods of the year, indicating that rainfall plays a major role for tree growth.

AB Physical barriers, such as rivers and roads, constrain the movement of animals, usually by preventing access to adjacent habitats and impeding dispersal. Fences are artificial barriers that are commonly used as a conservation tool to intentionally restrict movements of animals to within protected reserves. However, the potential edge-effect of fences on the behaviour of animals within reserves is poorly understood. We examined the effect of fences on the movement patterns of African elephant (Loxodonta africana), an ecosystem modifier, in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. We used linear and non-linear models to determine the relationship between minimum distance from fence and seasonal daily net displacement of six GPS-collared female elephant. Elephant movement patterns were best explained by a piecewise regression that showed a strong negative relationship between minimum distance from fence and daily net displacement up to a "breakpoint" distance of 2551 m in the dry season and 3829 m in the wet season. The effect of the fence dissipated beyond this distance in both seasons. The increased tortuosity in movement patterns of elephant in the central area of the reserve suggested that they used this area more intensively for foraging compared to the peripheral area, as confirmed by differences in habitat selection. This occurs despite there being no difference in habitat composition between these areas. The decreased use of areas near the fence and more intensive foraging in the central areas constitute an important edge-effect of fences. Since elephant are ecosystem engineers, such edge-effects could potentially cascade throughout the reserve, adversely altering ecologically processes, particularly in reserves with a high edge-to-area ratio.

AB P>1. As trees in a given cohort progress through ontogeny, many individuals die. This risk of mortality is unevenly distributed across species because of many processes such as habitat filtering, interspecific competition and negative density dependence. Here, we predict and test the patterns that such ecological processes should inscribe on both species and phylogenetic diversity as plants recruit from saplings to the canopy.
   2. We compared species and phylogenetic diversity of sapling and tree communities at two sites in French Guiana. We surveyed 2084 adult trees in four 1-ha tree plots and 943 saplings in sixteen 16-m2 subplots nested within the tree plots. Species diversity was measured using Fisher's alpha (species richness) and Simpson's index (species evenness). Phylogenetic diversity was measured using Faith's phylogenetic diversity (phylogenetic richness) and Rao's quadratic entropy index (phylogenetic evenness). The phylogenetic diversity indices were inferred using four phylogenetic hypotheses: two based on rbcLa plastid DNA sequences obtained from the inventoried individuals with different branch lengths, a global phylogeny available from the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, and a combination of both.
   3. Taxonomic identification of the saplings was performed by combining morphological and DNA barcoding techniques using three plant DNA barcodes (psbA-trnH, rpoC1 and rbcLa). DNA barcoding enabled us to increase species assignment and to assign unidentified saplings to molecular operational taxonomic units.
   4. Species richness was similar between saplings and trees, but in about half of our comparisons, species evenness was higher in trees than in saplings. This suggests that negative density dependence plays an important role during the sapling-to-tree transition.
   5. Phylogenetic richness increased between saplings and trees in about half of the comparisons. Phylogenetic evenness increased significantly between saplings and trees in a few cases (4 out of 16) and only with the most resolved phylogeny. These results suggest that negative density dependence operates largely independently of the phylogenetic structure of communities.
   6. Synthesis. By contrasting species richness and evenness across size classes, we suggest that negative density dependence drives shifts in composition during the sapling-to-tree transition. In addition, we found little evidence for a change in phylogenetic diversity across age classes, suggesting that the observed patterns are not phylogenetically constrained.

AB Plants and animals often exhibit strong and persistent growth variation among individuals within a species. Persistently fast-growing individuals have a higher chance of reaching reproductive size, do so at a younger age, and therefore contribute disproportionately to population growth (lambda). Here we introduce a new approach to quantify this "fast-growth effect." We propose using age-size-structured matrix models in which persistently fast and slow growers are distinguished as they occur in relatively young and old age classes for a given size category. Life-cycle pathways involving fast growth can then be identified, and their contribution to lambda is quantified through loop analysis. We applied this approach to an example species, the tropical rainforest tree Cedrela odorata, that shows persistent growth variation among individuals. Loop analysis showed that juvenile trees reaching the 10-cm diameter class at below-median age contributed twice as much to lambda as slow juvenile growers. Fast growth to larger-diameter categories also contributed disproportionately to lambda. The results were robust to changes in parameter values and life-history trade-offs. These results show that the fast-growth effect can be strong in long-lived species. Persistent growth differences among individuals should therefore be accommodated for in demographic models and life-history studies.

AB Understanding the mechanisms that shape the distribution of organisms can help explain patterns of local and regional biodiversity and predict the susceptibility of communities to environmental change. In the species-rich tropics, a gradient in rainfall between wet evergreen and dry seasonal forests correlates with turnover of plant species. The strength of the dry season has previously been shown to correlate with species composition. Herbivores and pathogens (pests) have also been hypothesized to be important drivers of plant distribution, although empirical evidence is lacking. In this study we experimentally tested the existence of a gradient in pest pressure across a rainfall gradient in the Isthmus of Panama and measured the influence of pests relative to drought on species turnover. We established two common gardens on the dry and wet sides of the Isthmus using seedlings from 24 plant species with contrasting distributions along the Isthmus. By experimentally manipulating water availability and insect herbivore access, we showed that pests are not as strong a determinant of plant distributions as is seasonal drought. Seasonal drought in the dry site excluded wet-distribution species by significantly increasing their seedling mortality. Pathogen mortality and insect herbivore damage were both higher in the wet site, supporting the existence of a gradient in pest pressure. However, contrary to predictions, we found little evidence that dry-distribution species suffered significantly more pest attack than wet-distribution species. Instead, we hypothesize that dry-distribution species are limited from colonizing wetter forests by their inherently slower growth rates imposed by drought adaptations. We conclude that mechanisms limiting the recruitment of dry-distribution species in wet forests are not nearly as strong as those limiting wet-distribution species from dry forests.

AB Hunting of hornbills by tribal communities is widespread in logged foothill forests of the Indian Eastern Himalaya. We investigated whether the decline of hornbills has affected the dispersal and recruitment of 3 large-seeded tree species. We hypothesized that 2 low-fecundity tree species, Chisocheton paniculatus and Dysoxylum binectariferum (Meliaceae) bearing arillate fruits, are more dispersal limited than a prolifically fruiting drupaceous tree Polyalthia simiarum (Annonaceae), which has potential dispersers other than hornbills. We estimated the abundance of large avian frugivores during the fruiting season along transects in 2 protected and 2 disturbed forests. We compared recruitment of the tree species near (< 10 m) and far (10-40 m) from parent trees at protected and disturbed sites. Median abundance of Great (Buceros bicornis), Wreathed (Aceros undulatus), and Oriental Pied Hornbills (Anthracoceros albirostris) were significantly lower in disturbed forests, but sites did not differ in abundances of the Mountain Imperial Pigeon (Ducula badia). Overall, tree species showed more severely depressed recruitment of seedlings (77% fewer) and juveniles (69% fewer) in disturbed than in protected forests. In disturbed forests, 93% fewer seedlings of C. paniculatus were beyond parental crowns, and a high number of all seedlings (42%) accumulated directly under reproductive adults. In contrast, D. binectariferum and P. simiarum were recruitment rather than dispersal limited, with fewer dispersed seedlings surviving in disturbed than in protected forests. Results are consistent with the idea that disturbance disrupts mutualisms between hornbills and some large-seeded food plants, with the caveat that role redundancy within even small and specialized disperser assemblages renders other tree species less vulnerable to loss of regular dispersal agents.

AB It is becoming increasingly apparent that the future of the Amazon rainforest is under threat from both climate change and agricultural practices such as deforestation and biomass burning. Atmospheric aerosols are likely to play an important role in the interaction between deforestation, fire and drought, but until now, observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in this region have been limited to time series of less than 7 years for satellite retrievals, or to single-site measurements. Here we use a 13-year time series of Along Track Scanning Radiometer derived AOD measurements to examine the role of aerosols in biosphere-climate interactions over the Amazon. The seasonal cycle of AOD shows peaks in March and September. The September peak is caused by local dry-season biomass burning. The March peak has not been identified previously but is coincident with more remote fires located in northern South America. A decreasing trend in dry-season AOD between 1995 and 2000 and a subsequent increase from 2000 to 2004 can be explained by deforestation practices driven by economic forces, whereas even higher AOD levels in 2005 were probably caused more by the exceptional drought of that year. Throughout the time series, dry-season AODs are inversely correlated with dry-season precipitation, suggesting a positive feedback between aerosols and drought that may contribute to enhanced drought under climate change.

AB Neutral models in ecology have attracted much attention in recent literature. They can provide considerable insight into the roles of non-species-specific factors (e.g. stochasticity, dispersal, speciation) on community dynamics but often require intensive simulations, particularly in spatial settings. Here, we clearly explain existing techniques for modelling spatially explicit neutral processes in ecology using coalescence. Furthermore, we present several novel extensions to these methods including procedures for dealing with system boundaries which enable improved investigation of the effects of dispersal. We also present a semi-analytical algorithm that calculates the expected species richness in a sample, for any speciation rate. By eliminating the effect of stochasticity in the speciation process, we reduce the variance in estimates of species richness. our benchmarks show that the combination of existing coalescence theory and our extensions produces higher quality results in vastly shorter time scales than previously possible: years of simulation time are reduced to minutes. As an example application, we find parameters for a spatially explicit neutral model to approximate the species richness of a tropical forest dataset. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rules governing the REDD (Reductions of Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) scheme have yet to be established. Different national interests compete within the debate oil baselines in order to maximize expected gains. The scheme Could have a deleterious impact on the carbon market through massive hot air creation (fake emission reductions), and ultimately oil the Current international climate change regime derived from the cap-and-trade architecture adopted by the Kyoto Protocol. The political economy of avoided deforestation is frequently overlooked as is the issue of additionality, although both of them are more critical with deforestation at national level than they Could be with project-based CDM. An alternative REDD architecture which relies on I special fund would not only allow protection of the 0 carbon market against massive flooding by non additional credits, but could also help finance potentially efficient policies and measures. Sustaining long-term adequate funding is still an issue to be addressed on a multilateral basis.

AB Uncertainty in the implementation and outcomes of conservation actions that is not accounted for leaves conservation plans vulnerable to potential changes in future conditions. We used a decision-theoretic approach to investigate the effects of two types of investment uncertainty on the optimal allocation of global conservation resources for land acquisition in the Mediterranean Basin. We considered uncertainty about (1) whether investment will continue and (2) whether the acquired biodiversity assets are secure, which we termed transaction uncertainty and performance uncertainty, respectively. We also developed and tested the robustness of different rules of thumb for guiding the allocation of conservation resources when these sources of uncertainty exist. In the presence of uncertainty in future investment ability (transaction uncertainty), the optimal strategy was opportunistic, meaning the investment priority should be to act where uncertainty is highest while investment remains possible. When there was a probability that investments would fail (performance uncertainty), the optimal solution became a complex trade-off between the immediate biodiversity benefits of acting in a region and the perceived longevity of the investment. In general, regions were prioritized for investment when they had the greatest performance certainty, even if an alternative region was highly threatened or had higher biodiversity value. The improved performance of rules of thumb when accounting for uncertainty highlights the importance of explicitly incorporating sources of investment uncertainty and evaluating potential conservation investments in the context of their likely long-term success.

AB Expansion of human activiteis results in habitat fragmentation, a phenomenon that ha s been widely recognized in the last decades as one of the major threats to world's biodiversity. The transformation of a continuous forest into a fragmented area results ina hyper-dynamic landscape with unpredictable consequences to overall ecosystem health. The effct of the fragmentation process on Trypanosoma cruzi infection amonmg small wild mammals was studied in an Atlantic Rain Forest lanscspe. Comapring continuous forest to fragmented habitat, marsupials were less abundant than rodents in the continuous lanscape. An overall decrease in small wild mamal richness was observed in the smaller fragments. An anti T-cruzi seroprevalence of 18%(82/440) was detected by immonuflourescense assay. Moreover, this seroprevalence was higher in the fragmented habitat in the continuous forest. According to the collected data, 3 main factors seem to modulate infection by T. cruzi in small wild mammals; (i) habitat fragmentation; (ii) biodiversity loss; (iii) increase of marsupial abudance in mammal communities. Furthermore, an extremely mild controlled infection by T. cruzi was detected since no patent parasitaemia could be detected in fresh blood samples, and no parasites were isolated by haemoculture.

AB 1 We quantify the effects of spatial structure on individual, population and community biomass within a natural community of annuals for two years (1994 and 1996) in which competition operated differently.
   2 Using field-parameterized neighbourhood models in which we had previously estimated the spatial scale and magnitude of competitive effects, we perform virtual experiments in which we manipulate spatial structure relative to that observed. We first remove segregation by randomly re-labelling all annual plants in a focal plant's neighbourhood and then give individuals of all species the same average number of neighbours by re-locating individuals within the overall pattern of annuals.
   3 The natural spatial structure generally acted to promote species coexistence. In 1994, when the strength of individual-level competition within species was already greater than that between species, the natural spatial structure enhanced this effect for six out of seven species by increasing the relative frequency of intraspecific contacts. Average plant biomass increased by 0.24-38% when spatial locations were randomized.
   4 In 1996, when a single competitive hierarchy operated, the natural spatial structure systematically benefited small-seeded, weakly competitive species while having weak negative effects on large-seeded, strong competitors. Randomizing spatial locations decreased the biomass of the species with the smallest seeds by 12% but increased the biomass of the species with the largest seeds by < 1%. This asymmetry increased dramatically when we used the model to increase the competitive advantage of large seeds artificially. Randomizing spatial locations decreased the biomass of the species with the smallest seeds by 37% but increased the biomass of the species with the largest seeds by only 2.7%.
   5 Effects of spatial structure on total community biomass were always small (maximum 7%). This was because common species always have weak spatial structure, and they draw down the effect on the community as a whole.
   6 Our analysis, for the first time, quantifies the magnitude and direction of the effects of spatial structure in a natural community, and supports the conclusions of theoretical models that spatial structure can have substantial impacts on component species and community dynamics.

AB We investigated the role of seed predation by rodents in the recruitment of the fleshy-fruited trees Taxus baccata, Ilex aquifolium and Crataegus monogyna in temperate secondary forests in NW Spain. We measured the densities of dispersed seeds, early emerged seedlings, established recruits and adults, at four sites over a period of 2 years. Seed predation among species was compared by seed removal experiments and analysis of rodent larder-hoards. The three species differed markedly in local regeneration patterns. The rank order in the seed rain following decreasing seed density was flex, Taxus and Crataegus. However, Crataegus established 3.3 times more seedlings than Taxus. For all species, there was a positive linear relationship between the density of emerged seedlings and seed density, suggesting that recruitment was seed-rather than microsite-limited. A consistent pattern of seed selection among species was exerted by rodents, which preferred Taxus and, secondarily, flex seeds to Crataegus seeds. Predation ranking was the inverse of that of seed protection against predators, measured as the mass of woody coat per mass unit of the edible fraction. Recruitment potential, evaluated as the ratio of seedlings to seeds, was negatively related to seed predation, with the rank order Crataegus>Ilex>Taxus. The selective early recruitment limitation exerted by predation may have a demographic effect in the long term, as judged by the positive relationship between early seedling emergence and the density of established recruits. By modulating the pre-emptive competition for seed safe sites, rodents may preclude the progressive exclusion of species that produce low numbers of seeds (i.e. Crataegus) by those dominant in seed number (i.e. flex, Taxus), or at least foster the evenness for site occupation among seedlings of different species.

AB Brazil is the world leader in amphibian diversity, with 765 species, most of which have been described in the last 40 years. The Brazilian Official List of Threatened Species and the results of a workshop for the Global Amphibian Assessment indicate that 26 species are threatened. The majority of these occur in the Atlantic Forest, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. The main threat to amphibians is the destruction of their habitats through deforestation, conversion into agricultural land, mining, wildfires, and infrastructure development and urbanization. In Brazil little is known about other causes of amphibian decline observed worldwide, such as pesticides, infectious diseases, climate change, invasive species, or wildlife trade. Brazilian conservation policies include such important legal instruments as the Official List of Threatened Species and the selection of priority areas for conservation measures in all of Brazil's major biomes. Although there is little information on geographic distributions and the natural history and ecology of the large majority of the currently recognized species, a. number of important regional studies for amphibian conservation are under way. Net; species are discovered each year.

AB We studied an assemblage of 17 species of bird-pollinated Ecuadorian plants (from 14 angiosperm families), including taxa pollinated by short-billed (trochiline) and sickle-billed (hermit) hummingbirds. Hummingbirds are widely supposed to ignore fragrance while visiting flowers. We collected floral headspace odours in order to test the general prediction that specialist hummingbird-pollinated flowers are scentless. In nine out of 17 of these species we failed to detect any odours using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), whereas the remaining eight species produced trace levels of volatile compounds. Most of these odour compounds were of terpenoid or lipoxygenase derivation and are commonly emitted by vegetative as well as floral plant tissues. Further studies will be required to determine whether these weak odours attract alternative pollinators, repel enemies or represent vestiges of a scented ancestry.

AB I examined the effects of seed mass on performance of seedlings of Artocarpus heterophyllus L. (Moraceae), a large evergreen late successional shade-tolerant tree species in three contrasting light conditions. Seed mass varied many fold from 1.5 to 14 g in A. heterophyllus. Germination and germination time showed a significant correlation with seed mass. Germination differed significantly among three light regimes (50%, 25% and 3%). Seed mass and light level significantly affected seedling survival. The seedlings that emerged from large seeds survived better than those from small seeds under all light regimes. Survival of seedlings was maximum in 25% light regime for all seed mass classes but did not differ significantly from that at 50% light regime. Survival was significantly lower in 3% light as compared to 50% and 25% light regimes. Seedling vigor (expressed in terms of seedling height, leaf area and dry weight) was also significantly affected by seed mass and light regimes. Seedlings that emerged from larger seeds and grew under 50% light regime produced the heaviest seedlings, while those resulting from smaller seeds and grown under 3% light regime produced the lightest seedlings. Resprouting capacity of seedlings after clipping was significantly affected by seed mass and light regime. Seedlings emerging from larger seeds were capable of resprouting several times successively. Resprouting was more pronounced under 50% and 25% light regimes as compared to 3% light. Success of A. heterophyllus regeneration appears to be regulated by an interactive effect of seed mass and light regime. (C) 2003 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Studies of tree seedling physiology and growth under field conditions provide information on the mechanisms underlying inter- and intraspecific differences in growth and survival at a critical period during forest regeneration. I compared photosynthetic physiology, growth and biomass allocation in seedlings of three shade-tolerant tree species, Virola koschynii Warb., Dipteryx panamensis (Pittier) Record & Mell and Brosimum alicastrum Swartz., growing across a light gradient created by a forest-pasture edge (0.5 to 67% diffuse transmittance (%T)). Most growth and physiological traits showed nonlinear responses to light availability, with the greatest changes occurring between 0.5 and 20 %T. Specific leaf area (SLA) and nitrogen per unit leaf mass (N-mass) decreased, maximum assimilation per unit leaf area (A(area)) and area-based leaf N concentration (N-area) increased, and maximum assimilation per unit leaf mass (A(mass)) did not change with increasing irradiance. Plastic responses in SLA were important determinants of leaf N and A a across the gradient. Species differed in magnitude and plasticity of growth; B. alicastrum had the lowest relative growth rates (RGR) and low plasticity. Its final biomass varied only 10-fold across the light gradient. In contrast, the final biomass of D. panamensis and V koschynii varied by 100- and 50-fold, respectively, and both had higher RGR than B. alicastrum. As light availability increased, all species decreased biomass allocation to leaf tissue (mass and area) and showed a trade-off between allocation to leaf area at a given plant mass (LAR) and net gain in mass per unit leaf area (net assimilation rate, NAR). This trade-off largely reflected declines in SLA with increasing light. Finally, A(area) was correlated with NAR and both were major determinants of intraspecific variation in RGR. These data indicate the importance of plasticity in photosynthetic physiology and allocation for variation in tree seedling growth among habitats that vary in light availability.

AB This study reports extraordinarily high density estimates for the wild pig (Sus scrofa) from ail aseasonal tropical Forest site within the species' native range. At Pasoh Forest Reserve, a 2500 ha area of lowland dipterocarp rain forest in Peninsular Malaysia, line transects were used to estimate pig density front May to October in 1996 and 1998. In 1990, 44 sightings of S. scrofa consisting of 166 individuals were recorded along 81 km of transects. In 1998, 39 sightings documented 129 individuals along 79.9 km of transects. Estimated population density was 47.0 pigs/km(2) in 1996 and 27.0 pigs/km(2) in 1998. Sus scroll biomass in this forest was estimated at 1837 kg/km(2) and 1346 kg/km(2) in 1996 and 1998, respectively. Differences between Years were attributed to changes in the density of young pigs, coincident with a mast-seeding year of dipterocarp trees in 1996. Pig densities at Pasoh Forest Reserve were much higher than at other forest locations within the species' native range in Europe and Asia. Because Pasoh Forest Reserve is a forest fragment, two factors likely account for the extremely high pig densities: (1) local extinction of natural predators (mainly tigers and leopards) and (2) an abundant Year-round food Supply of African oil palm fruits from extensive plantations bordering the reserve.

AB The small high-shore littorinid, Littorina unifasciata, is the most abundant gastropod on many shores in New South Wales, Australia. It is usually found in dense clusters while emersed during low tide. Previous work has shown that the degree of aggregation varies spatially among shores, between different heights on the shore, between habitats with different aspect and among replicate sites in the same general area. Factors that might influence the degree of aggregation were not identified.
   In this study, aggregation at different stages of the tide and under different weather conditions was examined to test the models that aggregation and dispersal in L. unifasciata occur in response to the drying and wetting of the substratum by the tides or weather. Aggregation was found to be greater when the substratum was dry, irrespective of the state of the tide. It was proposed that environmental conditions would be harsher during neap than spring tides and when the time of low tide was nearer mid-day and, hence, snails would be more aggregated at these times. Aggregation was therefore examined with respect to the timing and duration of low tide. Although aggregation could be correlated with the time of low tide in some mid-shore sites, there was no such correlation higher on the shore. In addition, the time of low tide accounted for very little of the variability in aggregation from time to time.
   Finally, the influence of high temperatures and desiccation on the tendency to aggregate and the effects of aggregation on the temperatures and water reserves of the snails were examined experimentally in the field. Aggregated snails had larger water reserves and greater temperatures than did solitary animals, but neither the temperature of the snails, nor their water reserves, influenced their tendency to aggregate.

AB Regional variation in the characteristics of gaps larger than 10 m2 was determined for three forest sites on different soils, along a climatic and vegetation gradient in the tropical moist forest of Tai National Park, Ivory Coast. The total inventoried area was 71 ha. The three sites were strikingly similar with regard to gap density, gap size distribution, and total gap area. Average gap density was 2.1 gaps ha-1, of which 0.7 gaps ha-1 were estimated to have been created during the last year. Average gap size was 41 m2 (55 m2 for newly formed gaps). Total gap area was on average 0.8 percent of the total inventoried area, versus 0.4 percent for the gaps formed during last year.
   Mode of gap formation differed considerably between the sites, and reflected site-dependent soil characteristics and floristic and structural composition of the vegetation. In Zagne, the northernmost, driest site, branch fall was the major mode of gap formation (47%), in Tai, the middle site, this was tree snapping (48%), and in Para, the southernmost, wettest site with hardened soil layers, tree uprooting was conspicuous (20%). An apparent paradox was found that at the site with the largest trees (Zagne) relatively many small canopy gaps were created. Branch fall is the preferential mode of senescence of emergent tree species; they slowly drop their branches when they die-off, creating many branch fall gaps.
   Though modes of gap formation differed between the sites, they resulted in similar gap size distributions. The differences in abiotic and biotic characteristics of the forest zones do not result in a clearly different gap regime. Canopy gaps in the Tai National Park are small, and forest turnover time is long (ca 240 years) compared to other tropical moist forests, resulting in a less dynamic, fine textured forest mosaic consisting of small eco-units.

AB This paper explores the causes and consequences of seed and seedling mortality of the tree Virola nobilis (Myristicaceae) Central Panama in order to understand the advantage to local seed dispersal by birds and monkeys. Post-dispersal mortality due to insects (primarily Conotrachelus spp., Curculionidae) accounts for 30-35% of seed and seedling death during the first 12 weeks after seed fall. Because more seeds and seedlings are killed under and near fruiting trees than 15-45 m away, seed dispersal confers a 20-40 fold advantage on seeds carried 45 m from fruiting adults. In contrast, > 60% of seed and seedling death during the first year is due to seed predation by mammals, with > 90% due to mammals among the < 2% seeds that survive until maternal endosperm is exhausted +/- 12 weeks after seed fall. Mortaliy due to mammals is independent of distance from parent trees, confering no advantage to seed dispersal. Insects account for variation in mortality attributable to distance effects, mammals to between site effects.
   Early weevil infestations put a premium on seed removal by large birds (Ramphastos swainsonii, R. sulfuratus, Penelope purpurascens), which carry > 50% of the seeds that they eat > 40 m, as compared with smaller birds (Baryphthengus martii, Tityra semifasciata, Trogon massena) and monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi), which leave most or all of the seeds that they eat under or near the tree crown.

AB Time series observations of interspecific competition among fouling organisms on experimental panels were carried out in Tomioka Bay, Japan, using a photosampling technique for 122 d. Altogether 17 species of fouling organisms belonging to various taxonomic groups such as Ascidia, Bryozoa, sponges, Crustacea, Polychaeta and algae were observed. The results of 990 interspecific interactions among the 13 dominant species are presented in the form of a matrix, with significance of the interactions tested using the Chi-square contingency test. The hierarchical order followed the sequence ascidians > sponges > bryozoans > brown algae > barnacles > polychaetes > green algae. The main type of interaction observed during the study was overgrowth of one species by another (71.58 %), while standoffs accounted for the rest. The competitive dominance followed a hierarchical order with numerous back-loops. According to the Chi-square results, the colonial ascidian Diplosoma mitsukurii was ranked as the most dominant species. The correlation between the area coverage of a species and the number of its interactions was found to be highly significant. The merits of time series observations in a competition study of sessile invertebrates compared with static methodology are emphasized.

AB The pollination biology and breeding systems of Eriotheca pubescens and E. gracilipes have been studied. These two species occur as trees in cerrado vegetation, the neotropical savannas of Central Brazil, with partially sympatric distributions. They have similar phenology and floral structure, although the flowers of E. pubescens are larger. Both species have nectar flowers pollinated by large Anthophoridae bees but the main pollinators of each species differ in size. The species have markedly different breeding systems: late-acting self-incompatibility in E. gracilipes and apomixis stimulated by pollination in E. pubescens.

AB Polyploidy is a common mode of speciation that can have far-reaching consequences for plant ecology and evolution. Because polyploidy can induce an array of phenotypic changes, there can be cascading effects on interactions with other species. These interactions, in turn, can have reciprocal effects on polyploid plants, potentially impacting their establishment and persistence. Although there is a wealth of information on the genetic and phenotypic effects of polyploidy, the study of species interactions in polyploid plants remains a comparatively young field. Here we reviewed the available evidence for how polyploidy may impact many types of species interactions that range from mutualism to antagonism. Specifically, we focused on three main questions: (1) Does polyploidy directly cause the formation of novel interactions not experienced by diploids, or does it create an opportunity for natural selection to then form novel interactions? (2) Does polyploidy cause consistent, predictable changes in species interactions vs. the evolution of idiosyncratic differences? (3) Does polyploidy lead to greater evolvability in species interactions? From the scarce evidence available, we found that novel interactions are rare but that polyploidy can induce changes in pollinator, herbivore, and pathogen interactions. Although further tests are needed, it is likely that selection following whole-genome duplication is important in all types of species interaction and that there are circumstances in which polyploidy can enhance the evolvability of interactions with other species.

AB Estimates of extinction risk for Amazonian plant and animal species are rare and not often incorporated into land-use policy and conservation planning. We overlay spatial distribution models with historical and projected deforestation to show that at least 36% and up to 57% of all Amazonian tree species are likely to qualify as globally threatened under International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria. If confirmed, these results would increase the number of threatened plant species on Earth by 22%. We show that the trends observed in Amazonia apply to trees throughout the tropics, and we predict thatmost of the world's >40,000 tropical tree species now qualify as globally threatened. A gap analysis suggests that existing Amazonian protected areas and indigenous territories will protect viable populations of most threatened species if these areas suffer no further degradation, highlighting the key roles that protected areas, indigenous peoples, and improved governance can play in preventing large-scale extinctions in the tropics in this century.

AB Intraspecific trait variation is hypothesized to influence the relative importance of community assembly mechanisms. However, few studies have explicitly considered how intraspecific trait variation among ontogenetic stages influences community assembly across environmental gradients. Because the relative importance of abiotic and biotic assembly mechanisms can differ among ontogenetic stages within and across environments, ontogenetic trait variation may have an important influence on patterns of functional diversity and inferred assembly mechanisms. We tested the hypothesis that variation in functional diversity across a topo-edaphic gradient differs among ontogenetic stages and that these patterns reflect a shift in the relative importance of different assembly mechanisms. In a temperate forest in the Missouri Ozarks, USA, we compared functional diversity of leaf size and specific leaf area (SLA) of 34 woody plant species at two ontogenetic stages (adults and saplings) to test predictions about how the relative importance of abiotic and biotic filtering changes among adult and sapling communities. Local communities of adults had lower mean SLA and lower functional dispersion of SLA than expected by chance, particularly at the resource-limited end of the topo-edaphic gradient, suggesting an important role for abiotic filtering among co-occurring adults. In contrast, local communities of saplings often had higher functional dispersion of leaf size and SLA than expected by chance regardless of their location along the topo-edaphic gradient, suggesting an important role for biotic filtering among co-occurring saplings. Moreover, the overall strength of trait-environment relationships varied between saplings and adults for both leaf traits, generally resulting in stronger environmental shifts in mean trait values and trait dispersion for adults relative to saplings. Our results illustrate how community assembly mechanisms may shift in their relative importance during ontogeny, leading to variable patterns of functional diversity across environmental gradients. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of integrating ontogeny, an important axis of intraspecific trait variability, into approaches that use plant functional traits to understand community assembly and species coexistence.

AB AimWe conducted the first comprehensive quantitative review on the effects of habitat fragmentation on Neotropical primates to examine how both patch disturbance and landscape variables modulate species-area relationships (SARs) and species persistence in fragmented forest landscapes.
   LocationNeotropical forests, from Mexico to Argentina.
   MethodsWe use species occupancy data from 705 forest fragments and 55 adjacent continuous forests nested within 61 landscapes, which we compiled from 96 studies reporting data on patch-scale species composition and patch size/location. Presence-absence data on 19 species functional groups and an index of hunting pressure and matrix type were assigned to each forest patch. We adopted a multilevel analysis, examining SARs and patterns of species retention coupled with the additive effects of hunting pressure and landscape connectivity both across all forest patches and 728 sites nested within 38 landscapes containing four or more sites.
   ResultsWe uncovered a consistent effect of patch area in explaining primate species richness. Over and above area effects, however, SARs were strongly modulated by levels of hunting pressure at the landscape scale in predicting species occurrence and aggregate assemblage biomass. Matrix type was also a good predictor of both extant species richness and aggregate biomass when only non-hunted sites were considered, with patches in more permeable matrices containing more species.
   Main conclusionsAlthough the importance of patch area in predicting species persistence is undeniable, we found that SARs were clearly affected by within-patch human exploitation of increasingly isolated primate populations. Both expanding the number of forest reserves and enforcing protection within nominal protected areas are therefore required to ensure the long-term persistence of full primate assemblages. We highlight the importance of considering multiple anthropogenic effects in assessing the synergistic effects of land use to explain patterns of species persistence in fragmented tropical forest landscapes.

AB Understanding the factors that drive species richness and composition at multiple scales is of crucial importance for conservation. Here we evaluated how habitat heterogeneity-at the local and landscape scales-affects the diversity of ants in the Brazilian Cerrado. The Cerrado is a biodiversity hotspot that is characterized as a mosaic of habitats, including savannas of variable structure (the dominant vegetation), grasslands, and forests. We sampled ground-dwelling ants in four habitats, representing a gradient of increasing tree cover and decreasing grass cover. Twelve sites, distributed along two degrees of latitude, were sampled. Our sampling revealed a highly diverse and patchily distributed fauna comprising 150 species (from 44 genera), of which nearly 40% were found in only one site. On average, we found fewer species in the least structurally complex habitat. However, there was relatively little variation in species density among the remaining habitats despite strong differences in vegetation structure among them. Ant species composition varied markedly among sites and such differences were related to variations in vegetation structure but not to inter-site distances (latitude). Similar results were obtained when overall ant species richness (gamma diversity) was partitioned additively into three components: alpha(1) (diversity within sampling sites), beta(1) (diversity among sites within the same habitat type), and beta(2) (diversity among sites from different habitats). The beta(2) component contributed much more to gamma diversity than did the remaining diversity components, indicating that conservation of the Cerrado ant fauna depends on the maintenance of habitat diversity.

AB Recent studies have shown that tropical and subtropical forests expanded during the late Holocene, but rates and mechanisms of expansion are still unknown. Here, we investigate how a forest-grassland mosaic changed over the past 10,000 years at the southernmost limit of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We used soil organic matter carbon isotopes (delta C-13 and C-14) to quantify and date changes in vegetation, examining soil properties and leaf traits of tree species (nutrient content, delta C-13, delta N-15, and specific leaf area-SLA) to describe potential mechanisms of expansion. Our results show that after several millennia of stability, forests have been expanding over grasslands through continuous, but very slow, border dynamics and patch formation (< 100 m since similar to 4,000 YBP). This process of expansion coincided with past changes in climate, but biotic feedback mechanisms also appear to be important for the long-term persistence and expansion of forests. Soil fertility and microbial biomass match current rather than past vegetation distribution, increasing progressively across the gradient: grasslands < isolated trees < forest patches < forests. Foliar delta N-15 values of trees that are able to colonize the grassland are consistently lower across this vegetation gradient, suggesting an increasingly greater reliance on symbiotic nutrient uptake from grasslands to forests. No significant relationships were found between soil and leaf nutrients, but SLA explained variation in leaf N, P, and K (positive relationships) and in leaf delta C-13 (negative relationship). These findings suggest that a tradeoff between tree growth and water use efficiency is an important regulator of forest-grassland dynamics in the study region.

AB 1. Behavioural adaptations of ectotherms to thermally heterogeneous environments are still overlooked in the literature despite the fact that organismal behaviour could enhance survival in the warming world. This is particularly critical in the intertidal where most ectotherms live at, or near to the upper limit of thermal tolerance.
   2. This study investigated (i) the environmental factors determining the body temperatures of the intertidal gastropod Nerita atramentosa, (ii) the space-time variability in environmental and individual body temperatures and (iii) the potential variability in N. atramentosa thermoregulatory behaviours, i. e. microhabitat selection and aggregation.
   3. Thermal imaging was used to assess the body temperatures of N. atramentosa and surrounding substrata over two seasons (autumn and summer), at two shore levels (low-vs. high-shore levels) within two habitats of different topographic complexity (rock platform and boulders) on the same rocky shore.
   4. Snail body and substratum temperatures were significantly and positively correlated within each habitat at both seasons. Substratum temperature may thus be considered as a primary driver of body temperatures of organisms that attach to a substratum. Substratum temperature and other variables such as solar irradiance critically need to be integrated in climate-change models that use single climatic variables (e. g. air temperature) that are not necessarily correlated with individual body temperatures in nature.
   5. The high space-time variability in both substratum and body temperatures reinforces the growing evidence that small spatial scale variations may surpass those observed at larger spatial scales.
   6. Nerita atramentosa thermoregulatory behaviour under high thermal stress appeared to be habitat specific.
   7. The small spatial scale heterogeneity in environmental and individual temperatures and in thermoregulatory behaviours has stressed the need to focus on body temperature patterns at the niche level and to integrate the organismal behaviour in climate-change models.

AB Background: Plants interact with each other, nutrients, and microbial communities in soils through extensive root networks. Understanding these below ground interactions has been difficult in natural systems, particularly those with high plant species diversity where morphological identification of fine roots is difficult. We combine DNA-based root identification with a DNA barcode database and above ground stem locations in a floristically diverse lowland tropical wet forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, where all trees and lianas >1 cm diameter have been mapped to investigate richness patterns below ground and model rooting distributions.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: DNA barcode loci, particularly the cpDNA locus trnH-psba, can be used to identify fine and small coarse roots to species. We recovered 33 species of roots from 117 fragments sequenced from 12 soil cores. Despite limited sampling, we recovered a high proportion of the known species in the focal hectare, representing approximately 14% of the measured woody plant richness. This high value is emphasized by the fact that we would need to sample on average 13 m(2) at the seedling layer and 45 m(2) for woody plants >1 cm diameter to obtain the same number of species above ground. Results from inverse models parameterized with the locations and sizes of adults and the species identifications of roots and sampling locations indicates a high potential for distal underground interactions among plants.
   Conclusions: DNA barcoding techniques coupled with modeling approaches should be broadly applicable to studying root distributions in any mapped vegetation plot. We discuss the implications of our results and outline how second-generation sequencing technology and environmental sampling can be combined to increase our understanding of how root distributions influence the potential for plant interactions in natural ecosystems.

AB We examined variation in the flowering phenology of Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) plants monitored during an 8-month period with reference to a light gradient (20%, 52%, 75% and 100% of full sunlight), and related these results to photosynthetic features, growth and fruit yield. With strong phenotypically plastic response to light, relative growth rate and photosynthetic capability continually increased with increasing irradiance and their maximum values were much similar to those of the pioneer species. Shade did not increase the apparent quantum yield and reduce the light saturation point and respiration rate. Thus, it was suggested that P. valubilis is a high-light demanding species. Shade delayed initial flowering date and decreased flower and fruit parts. An earlier initiation of flowering was associated with higher flower biomass and plant total biomass, in turn; the latter was positively correlated with fruit biomass across light gradients. These results suggested that an optimized crop management practice should be adopted to ensure that P. volubilis be grown under conditions with minimal shading. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB 2. In a large remnant of Atlantic forest, we compared forest structure at 36 Atta cephalotes nests to control sites and assessed shifts in microclimate along transects from nests up to 24 m into the forest (11 representative colonies).
   3. Nests (average size: 55 m2) were virtually free of understorey vegetation with a high proportion of dead stems (up to 70%).
   4. Canopy openness above colonies increased by roughly 40% compared with controls (5.3% at colony vs. 3.7% at control sites).
   5. At nest centres, about 6% of the total radiation penetrated through the sparse canopy. Light levels declined exponentially, reaching a third (2%) in the unaffected forest understorey.
   6. Likewise, maximum soil temperatures and daily amplitudes declined exponentially from 25 to 23 degrees C and 1.6 to 0.8 degrees C, respectively. Soil moisture increased significantly along transects, yet the effect was small and no differences were detected for air temperature and humidity.
   7. We extrapolated that individual A. cephalotes nests modify the microclimate in an area of almost 200 m2 on average. For the population, this amounts to 6% of the area along forest edges, where colonies are strongly aggregated, compared with only 0.6% in the forest interior.
   8. Nests changed microclimate to an extent that has been reported to impact seed germination, plant growth, and survival of seedlings, conclusively demonstrating that leaf-cutting ants act as ecosystem engineers.

AB Uncertainties in the rate of biomass variation with forest ageing in tropical secondary forests, particularly in belowground components, limit the accuracy of carbon pool estimates in tropical regions. We monitored changes in above- and belowground biomass, leaf area index (LAI), and biomass allocation to the leaf component to determine the variation in carbon accumulation rate with forest age after shifting cultivation in Sarawak, Malaysia. Nine plots in a 4-year-old forest and fourteen plots in a 10-year-old forest were monitored for 5 and 7 years, respectively. Forest and plant part biomass were calculated from an allometric equation obtained from the same forest stands. Both above- and belowground biomass increased rapidly during the initial decade after abandonment. In contrast, a much slower rate of biomass accumulation was observed after the initial decade. LAI also increased by approximately double from the 4-year-old to 10-year-old forest, and then gently increased to the 17-year-old forest. We also found that allocation variation in leaf biomass and nitrogen was closely related to the rate of biomass accumulation as a forest aged. During the first decade after abandonment, a high biomass and nitrogen allocation to the leaf component may have allowed for a high rate of biomass accumulation. However, reduction in those allocations to leaf component after the initial decade may have helped to suppress the biomass accumulation rate in older secondary forests. Roots accounted for 14.0-16.1% of total biomass in the 4-17-year-old abandoned secondary forests. We also verified the model predicted values for belowground biomass by Cairns et al. (1997) and Mokany et al. (2006), although both models overestimated the values throughout our data sets by 45-50% in the 10-year-old forest. The low root:shoot ratio in the secondary forests may have caused this overestimation. Therefore, our results suggest that we should modify the models to estimate belowground biomass considering the low root:shoot ratio in tropical secondary forests. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Investigations of structure in ecological communities need to move beyond the dichotomy between niche and neutral theory to broader conceptual frameworks that accommodate both neutral stochastic and biological structuring processes in organizing species assemblages. We propose and test a framework that integrates niche and neutral-assembly perspectives and determines their relative contributions in structuring diverse shrub species assemblages in a parkland savanna. Our approach proposes that stochastic dispersal processes initially govern the assemblage of species in discrete shrub clusters developing in grassland, but that community structure subsequently develops through the progressive action of first positive, then negative interactions among species. A comparison of observed patterns of occurrence and niche models for 12 shrub cluster species against neutral predictions revealed that neutral stochastic, island biogeographic processes accounted for most patterns of species occurrence. One species showed strong evidence of successional differentiation, whereas evidence of slight recruitment biases for five others was equivocal. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of an approach that accommodates contributions of both neutral and niche assembly rather than assuming either process alone is sufficient to account for community structure. Further development and testing of robust and falsifiable neutral theory will allow ecologists to critically evaluate the relative roles of niche differentiation and neutral, stochastic processes in structuring communities.

AB Background: Developing effective conservation plans for multi-functional landscapes requires an accurate knowledge of the relative conservation value of different land-uses. A growing number of tropical ecologists have evaluated conservation value using the number (or proportion) of species that are unique to primary or old-growth forests. However, estimates of the conservation value of modified land-uses may be inflated by the presence of occasional species (e. g. singletons and doubletons) that may be unable to exist as viable populations in isolation.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We use a unique 15-taxa dataset from a mixed-use forest landscape in the Brazilian Amazon to test the hypothesis that the removal of occasional species from sample data can increase estimates of the value of primary forest for biodiversity conservation.
   Conclusions/Significance: Estimates of conservation value that are based on the proportion of species that are unique to tropical primary or old-growth forests are highly sensitive to decisions researchers make regarding the inclusion or exclusion of occasional species. By removing singletons from modified forest samples, and considering only those species known to occur in primary forest, we almost double estimates of the conservation value of tropical primary forests.

AB P>Several recent advances in coexistence theory emphasize the importance of space and dispersal, but focus on average dispersal rates and require spatial heterogeneity, spatio-temporal variability or dispersal-competition tradeoffs to allow coexistence. We analyse a model with stochastic juvenile dispersal (driven by turbulent flow in the coastal ocean) and show that a low-productivity species can coexist with a high-productivity species by having dispersal patterns sufficiently uncorrelated from those of its competitor, even though, on average, dispersal statistics are identical and subsequent demography and competition is spatially homogeneous. This produces a spatial storage effect, with an ephemeral partitioning of a 'spatial niche', and is the first demonstration of a physical mechanism for a pure spatiotemporal environmental response. 'Turbulent coexistence' is widely applicable to marine species with pelagic larval dispersal and relatively sessile adult life stages (and perhaps some wind-dispersed species) and complements other spatial and temporal storage effects previously documented for such species.

AB We examined how differences in local forest-management institutions relate to disparate anthropogenic forest disturbance and forest conditions among three neighboring montane forests in Tanzania under centralized, comanaged, or communal management. Institutional differences have been shaped by decentralization reforms. We conducted semistructured interviews with members of forest management committees, local government, and village households and measured anthropogenic disturbance, tree structure, and species composition in forest plots. We assessed differences in governance system components of local institutions, including land tenure, decision-making autonomy by forest users, and official and de facto processes of rule formation, monitoring, and enforcement among the three management strategies. We also assessed differences in frequencies of prohibited logging and subsistence pole cutting, and measures of forest condition. An adjacent research forest served as an ecological reference for comparison of forest conditions. Governance was similar for comanaged and centralized management, whereas communal managers had greater tenure security and decision-making autonomy over the use and management of their forest. There was significantly less illegal logging in the communal forest, but subsistence pole cutting was common across all management strategies. The comanaged forest was most disturbed by recent logging and pole cutting, as were peripheral areas of the larger centralized forest. This manifested in more degraded indicators of forest conditions (lower mean tree size, basal area, density of trees >= 90 cm dbh, and aboveground biomass and higher overall stem density). Greater tenure security and institutional autonomy of the communal strategy contributed to more effective management, less illegal logging, and maintenance of good forest conditions, but generating livelihood benefits was a challenge for both decentralized strategies. Our results underscore the importance of well-designed institutional arrangements in forest management and illustrate mechanisms for improved forest governance and conservation in the context of Tanzanian decentralization reforms.

TI Dynamics of the Leaf-Litter Arthropod Fauna Following Fire in a
   Neotropical Woodland Savanna

   POPULATIONS; DISTURBANCE; MANAGEMENT; EXCLUSION
AB Fire is an important agent of disturbance in tropical savannas, but relatively few studies have analyzed how soil-and-litter dwelling arthropods respond to fire disturbance despite the critical role these organisms play in nutrient cycling and other biogeochemical processes. Following the incursion of a fire into a woodland savanna ecological reserve in Central Brazil, we monitored the dynamics of litter-arthropod populations for nearly two years in one burned and one unburned area of the reserve. We also performed a reciprocal transplant experiment to determine the effects of fire and litter type on the dynamics of litter colonization by arthropods. Overall arthropod abundance, the abundance of individual taxa, the richness of taxonomic groups, and the species richness of individual taxa (Formiciade) were lower in the burned site. However, both the ordinal-level composition of the litter arthropod fauna and the species-level composition of the litter ant fauna were not dramatically different in the burned and unburned sites. There is evidence that seasonality of rainfall interacts with fire, as differences in arthropod abundance and diversity were more pronounced in the dry than in the wet season. For many taxa the differences in abundance between burned and unburned sites were maintained even when controlling for litter availability and quality. In contrast, differences in abundance for Collembola, Formicidae, and Thysanoptera were only detected in the unmanipulated samples, which had a lower amount of litter in the burned than in the unburned site throughout most of our study period. Together these results suggest that arthropod density declines in fire-disturbed areas as a result of direct mortality, diminished resources (i.e., reduced litter cover) and less favorable microclimate (i.e., increased litter desiccation due to reduction in tree cover). Although these effects were transitory, there is evidence that the increasingly prevalent fire return interval of only 1-2 years may jeopardize the long-term conservation of litter arthropod communities.

AB The Angkor basin of Cambodia, the site of the great Angkor temple complex, has experienced explosive tourism growth since the 1993 onset of national political stability and renewed international investment, which in turn has driven increasing demand for water, wood, and biomass fuel, and rapid and extensive land-use and land-cover change. We use multi-temporal Landsat imagery (1989-2005) to describe the rate and extent of land-cover change throughout the Angkor basin. While 50% of the landscape remained in rice agriculture it is notable that a larger proportion of the area was deforested (23.4%) than experienced forest regrowth (4.9%). Most forest loss occurred between the Angkor temple complex and Phnom Kulen National Park, and was due in part to charcoal production to serve the tourist industry, and also conversion to permanent agriculture. The small area of forest increase was concentrated along the eastern boundary of the main Angkor complex. The interplay among global (tourism, climate), regional (national policies, large-river management), and local (construction and agriculture, energy and water sources to support the tourism industry) factors drives a distinctive but complex pattern of land-use and land-cover change.

AB Informed decision on the management of natural resources requires an understanding of the complex dynamics of socio-economic and biophysical factors. This study aimed at exploring the land use change in southern Burkina Faso at regional and local levels and the underlying causes of change. The local level study was conducted in two villages, Boala and Yale, in Sissili Province. Aerial photos from 1984 and 1997 and satellite images from 1986 and 2002 were employed to describe the land use dynamics. The spatial approach was combined with field data collected in 2003 and 2005 for ground-truth checking and gathering other relevant data. Semi-structured questionnaire was used for gathering data on socioeconomic factors driving land use changes at local level. At regional scale, the annual rate of change in forest land, grazing land, gallery forest and cropland was -0.4, -0.9, -1.6 and 3.8%, respectively. The size of croplands increased by 14% in some districts with an equivalent annual rate of conversion to cropland estimated at 0.6% during 1986-2002. At the local level, the size of croplands increased from 7 to 14% in Boala and from 21 to 30% in Yale at the expense of shrinking of forest cover from 78 to 40% in the former and from 41 to 18% in the latter village. Rural migration (3.3% at regional level, and as high as 97% in Yale and 9% in Boala) coupled with extensive subsistence farming, large-scale commercial farming, intensive fuelwood extraction and other disturbances were the main factors driving land use change. In conclusion, the results show that in a decade and half the southern region of Burkina Faso has moved from a sparsely populated area with subsistence farming to a more complex zone of production characterized by high competition between different land use types. Integrated management of the natural resources in the region should, therefore, be given more attention. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tree plantations of native and exotic species are frequently used to compensate for forest loss in the tropics. However, these plantations may support lower species diversity and different communities than natural forest. We therefore investigated bird communities in stands of natural forest, different types of tree plantations and secondary forest in Kakamega Forest, western Kenya. We compared birds differing in habitat specialisation, i.e. forest specialists, generalists, and visitors. We recorded significant differences in mean species richness and number of individuals among the different forest types. Stands of natural forest and plantations of indigenous tree species comprised more species and individuals than plantations of exotic tree species and secondary forest. This was caused by a significant decline of forest specialists and generalists from natural forest and indigenous plantations to exotic plantations and secondary forest. Species composition of the bird communities did not differ between natural forest stands and plantations of a mixture of indigenous tree species, but clearly changed between natural forest and plantations of single tree species. These findings demonstrate that natural forest areas are needed for the conservation of forest bird diversity, but that plantations with a mixture of indigenous tree species can have similarly high conservation value.

AB Proliferation of lianas in canopy gaps can restrict tree regeneration in tropical forests through competition. Liana effects may differ between tree species, depending on tree requirements for above- and below-ground resources. We conducted an experiment in a shade house over 12 months to test the effect of light (7 and 27% external irradiance) on the competitive interactions between seedlings of one liana species and three tree species and the contribution of both above- and below-ground competition. Seedlings of the liana Acacia kamerunensis were grown with tree seedlings differing in shade tolerance: Nauclea diderrichii (Pioneer), Khaya anthotheca (Non-Pioneer Light Demander) and Garcinia afzelii (Non-Pioneer Shade Bearer). Trees were grown in four competition treatments with the liana: no competition, root competition, shoot competition and root and shoot competition. Both root and root-shoot competition significantly reduced relative growth rates in all three tree species. After one year, root-shoot competition reduced growth in biomass to 58% of those (all species) grown in no competition. The root competition treatment had a more important contribution in the effect of the liana on tree growth. Tree seedlings did not respond to competition with the liana by altering their patterns of biomass allocation. Although irradiance had a great effect on tree growth and allocation of biomass, the interaction between competition treatments and irradiance was not significant. Nauclea diderrichii, the tree species which responded most to the effects of competition, showed signs of being pot-bound, the stress of which may have augmented the competition effects. The understanding of the interaction of above- and below-ground competition between lianas and trees and its moderation by the light environment is important for a proper appreciation of the influence of lianas on tropical forest regeneration.

We present a baseline analysis of the effects of habitat modification on birds in a lower montane forest landscape in Ecuador, comparing avian community composition in landscape elements subjected to different levels of human modification: primary forest, secondary forest, edge habitat and agricultural land. We use data from a point count survey of 300 counts at 150 sites to test whether community composition and density of birds with different reported habitat preferences and foraging strategies change among landscape elements. Species richness and diversity were lowest in agricultural land, but on some measures, equally low in primary forest. Richness and diversity peaked in secondary forest and edge habitat, but ordination and density analysis revealed clear differences in their species composition. While secondary forest contained mostly forest-preferring species, edge habitat harboured a mix of forest and open-land birds. There was a clearly structured gradient in species composition across landscape elements, with densities of habitat specialists, foraging guilds and families varying considerably from primary forest to agricultural land. Agricultural land was characterised by an assemblage of widespread, abundant species very different from that in core forest habitats. As such, while the majority of montane forest birds appear resilient to a certain level of habitat modification, they cannot persist, and are displaced, where forest has been cleared outright. We argue that, for Andean montane forests, preservation of mature secondary forest offers flexibility in supplementing preserved primary forest areas to provide sufficient habitat for the persistence of this incredibly diverse but severely threatened bird community.

AB One of the leading determinants of the structure and dynamics of marine populations is the rate of arrival of new individuals to local sites. While physical transport processes play major roles in delivering larvae to the shore, these processes become most important after larvae have survived the perils of life in the plankton, where they usually suffer great mortality. The lack of information regarding larval feeding makes it difficult to assess the effects of food supply on larval survival, or the role larvae may play in nearshore food webs. Here, we examine the spectrum of food sizes and food types consumed by the larvae of two intertidal barnacle species and of the predatory gastropod Concholepas concholepas. We conducted replicated experiments in which larvae were exposed to the food size spectrum (phytoplankton, microprotozoan and autotrophic picoplankton) found in nearshore waters in central Chile. Results show that barnacle nauplii and gastropod veligers are omnivorous grazers, incorporating significant fractions of heterotrophs in their diets. In accordance with their feeding mechanisms and body size, barnacle nauplii were able to feed on autotrophic picoplankton (< 5 mu m) and did not consume the largest phytoplankton cells, which made the bulk of phytoplankton biomass in spring-summer blooms. Balanoid nauplii exhibited higher ingestion rates than the smaller-bodied chthamaloid larvae. Newly hatched C. concholepas larvae also consumed picoplankton cells, while competent larvae of this species ingested mostly the largest phytoplankton cells and heterotrophic protozoans. Results suggest that persistent changes in the structure of pelagic food webs can have important effects on the species-specific food availability for invertebrate larvae, which can result in large-scale differences in recruitment rates of a given species, and in the relative recruitment success of the different species that make up benthic communities.

AB Levels of commercialization, size class profile and fruit production of Sclerocatya birrea (marula) trees were studied in the Bushbuckridge region of South Africa. A stage-based population matrix model was used to estimate the sustainable yield for S. birrea fruit. The trees begin to bear fruit at an average size of 42.8 cm in circumference and this relates to an approximate age of 19 years. For a stable size class profile, the population growth rate, lambda, was 1.1828758. The observed size class profile did not conform to the stable stage size class profile, obtained from the model. Thus, it was not possible to predict the state of the observed population.
   Using the model, it was estimated that 92% of fruit could be removed without impacting the current population profile. The management of other more destructive forms of S. birrea resource use (such as bark or firewood harvesting), however, do need to be monitored to limit negative impacts on the population that may reduce fruit availability for regeneration or cropping.

AB Intraspecific, negative density dependence may contribute to the maintenance of diversity by limiting the dominance of common species. Shorea quadrinervis Slooten (Dipterocarpaceae) is one of the dominant canopy trees in a species-rich tropical rain forest in Southeast Asia. We test whether juvenile density and performance and overall population growth rate of S. quadrinervis decline with increasing local abundance of conspecific adult trees.
   We mapped the 357 S. quadrinervis adults (greater than or equal to15 cm dbh) in 75 ha at Gunung Palung National Park, Indonesian Borneo, and compared the dynamics of juveniles <1 cm dbh between eight areas (80 in diameter plots) with high densities of conspecific adults and eight containing low densities. Within these 16 areas, we mapped 5215 S. quadrinervis juveniles and followed their growth and survival for two years. Plots with high and low density of S. quadrinervis adults did not differ in understory light, slope, aspect, or soil properties nor in the total density (all species combined) of either adults or juveniles.
   We evaluated four kinds of evidence. All were consistent with the hypothesis of negatively density-dependent population dynamics: (1) Density and size: Although the density of juveniles <25 cm tall per capita adult increased with local adult density, the pattern reversed for juveniles >75 cm tall. This suggests positive density-dependent seedling recruitment followed by negative density-dependent juvenile dynamics. (2) Foliar condition: Juveniles had more leaves per Unit height where adult density was low. Growth and survival increased more with leaf number than with height. (3) Juvenile dynamics: Growth and survival were higher where adult density was low. Previous work suggests that herbivores may drive this negative density dependence in juvenile performance. (4) Population dynamics: We modeled population growth rate (X) for each of the 16 areas using separate matrix models parameterized with empirical juvenile transition rates. We found that X declined with local adult density (r(2) = 0.40), and this trend was robust to the inclusion of El Ni (n) over tildeo conditions. We conclude that replacement of adults in the canopy is less likely in areas where conspecific adults are more abundant, tending to limit the dominance of S. quadrinervis in the canopy.

AB Adaptive trade-offs underlie the specialisation that permits habitat partitioning in species rich plant communities. We investigated the influence of the trade-offs that determine differences in growth and survival among six species of neotropical pioneer trees in gaps in semideciduous forest in Panama. Seedlings of Miconia argentea, Cecropia insignis, Luehea seemannii, Trema micrantha, Ochroma pyramidale and Croton bilbergianus were planted into artificial small (25 m(2)), medium (64 m(2)) and large (225 m(2)) gaps in secondary forest in the Barro Colorado Nature Monument. Trema and Ochroma suffered greater than or equal to50% mortality across all gap sizes, while Cecropia had high mortality only during the dry season and in the small gaps, and Miconia and Croton suffered low to zero mortality across all environments. The highest growth rates in large gaps were attained by Cecropia seedlings and in the smaller gaps by Miconia seedlings, although there were indications that Trema and Ochroma required gaps that were larger than any used in this study. Variation in growth and mortality could not be attributed to differences in foliar herbivore damage. Instead, there was strong evidence of a trade-off between maximum growth in the wet season and the ability to survive seasonal drought, particularly in small gaps. We conclude that variation in allocation in response to multiple limiting resources may be as important as allocation to growth and defence in determining the habitat preferences of neotropical pioneers.

DE dendrochronology; mangrove forest dynamics; Rhizophora mangle
AB Ring analysis was carried out on 39 Rhizophora mangle trees from two saline and one brackish forest sites on a peninsula in north Brazil. All trees showed constant growth over their entire life span, however the distinctiveness of growth rings was greater in trees from the saline areas than in trees from the brackish site. The mean radial increments form a pattern of three distinct groups ('fast', 'medium', and 'slow' growth). Although all three growth groups contained trees from each study site, trees from the brackish and the frequently inundated saline area presented a significantly higher growth rate (3.3 mm y(-1)) than the trees growing in a saline, seldom inundated area. Radiocarbon analysis showed that R. mangle forms annual rings in the region. The mean age of each forest, derived from the mean stem radius, the growth rates, and the tree affiliation to each growth group, explains forest's density and basal area. For the trees from a saline area belonging to the medium growth group (mean increment 2.5 mm y(-1)), the cambial growth correlates significantly with the precipitation in the transition months between the dry and the rainy season. The slowest growing trees (1.2 mm y(-1)) showed a close relationship between the ring width and the number of months with rainfall < 50 mm. Based on these results, we propose that the local abiotic factors influence the individual growth rates but their effect on the forest structure is modified by biotic factors, such as neighborhood competition.

AB Light intensity and root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal ( AM) fungi are considered important factors affecting the performance of rain forest plants, yet few studies have examined how these two factors interact. Whether AM colonization promoted growth or caused shifts in biomass allocation in seedlings of four species of Australian rain forest tree (Flindersia brayleana, Acmena resa, Cryptocarya mackinnoniana and Cryptocarya angulata), grown in a glasshouse under light conditions that mimicked the shaded understory (3% PAR) and small light gaps (10% PAR), was examined. Seedlings were grown in sterilized field soil and either inoculated with AM fungi or provided sterile inoculum. Four major findings emerged. First, in all species, seedlings grown in small gap light intensities were larger than seedlings grown in understory light intensities. Second, when seedling biomass was included as a covariate, variation in light intensity was associated with significant shifts in biomass allocation. In all species, leaf area ratio was lower at 10% PAR than at 3% PAR, while root-to-shoot ratio showed the opposite pattern in one of the four species ( C. mackinonniana). Third, although percentage root length colonized by AM fungi was greater at 10% PAR than 3% PAR in all species, this difference could be accounted for by variation in seedling size in all species except C. angulata. Fourth, growth and biomass allocation responses to AM colonization varied with light intensity and plant species. AM colonization promoted growth in both light regimes only in F. brayleana, while it had no effect on growth in C. mackinnoniana and C. angulata in either light regime and promoted growth only under high light in A. resa. AM colonization had no effect on leaf area ratio or root-to-shoot ratio in any of the species, and significantly altered specific root length in only one of the four species ( C. mackinnoniana). These findings suggest that rain forest seedlings are highly variable in their growth responses to AM colonization and that some of this variability is related to the light intensity of the environment. Given that seedlings may spend many years in the shaded understory, these differences among species could have important effects on long-term seedling performance and seedling community dynamics.

AB From September 1999 to 2000, field acorn burying experiments were conducted to examine the effects of gaps, litter cover and burying position, and simulated defoliation and cotyledon removal on oak (Quercus liaotungensis Koidz.) seedling establishment and biomass allocation in the understory of mixed oak forest in Dongling Mountain, Northern China. The effects of shrub and tree overstory were also studied in shrubland simultaneously.
   We found that acorn germination increased from 43.4 to 61.6%, that seedling recruitment increased from 33 to 47.6%, and that growth improved significantly in gaps relative to that in understory habitats in mature oak forest. Both acorn germination and seedling recruitment showed strong positive correlation with openness of acorn burying sites (R-2 = 0.659, P = 0.001 and R-2 = 0.477, P = 0.034, respectively). Both acorn germination and seedling recruitment improved in order as follows for different burying treatments: placed on litter < on ground surface < buried at 5 cm depth in soil < buried at 3 cm depth in soil < covered with litter on ground surface. Furthermore, different burying treatments influenced seedling growth and biomass allocation. Seedling grew tallest with thin stems from acorns covered by litter on the ground. Burying acorns too deeply in soil caused seedlings to allocate more dry mass to stem growth, and resulted in later emergence, shoot height decreases and leaf number reduction, which may lead to high mortality due to competition for light in shaded understorys. Simulated defoliation affected seedling dry mass accumulation significantly (R-2 = -0.899, P < 0.001) after considering defoliated loss during treatment, and complete defoliation caused mortality to rise to 16.7%. Similarly, cotyledon removal influenced seedling dry mass accumulation (R-2 = -0.746, P < 0.001), but had more serious effects on survival, causing 50% death where cotyledon were removed completely 1 month after emergence. The growth decline may increase mortality risks in future in shaded environments. In shrubland, we found that shrub or tree overstorys significantly improved acorn germination (from 4.4 to 26.7%), seedling survival (from 11.1 to 100%) and recruitment (from 0.5 to 26.7%), but had no effects on growth in the first growing season. At open sites in shrubland, seedling death resulted from direct or indirect effects of high light incidence. Overall, less acorn germination, seedling survival and recruitment occurred in shrubland than those beneath the mature forest canopy.
   In conclusion, in mature forest of Q. liaotungensis, we suggest that selected-cutting or canopy disturbance to permit light access to the understory will help to improve poor natural regeneration. With additional cage protection from browsers on acorns and herbivory free methods, burying acorns at 3 cm depth in soil or placed on ground with litter cover were the most effective methods to produce large number of seedlings. With facilitation of shrub or tree overstorys at early seedling stages in shrubland, direct burying acorns at 3 cm depth in soil was the most effective and economical technique for oak reforestation in such open early successional habitats.

AB Population estimates from 1987 to 1995 are reported for the terrestrial anuran, Eleutherodactylus coqui, from four long-term study plots in the Luquillo Experimental Forest of northeastern Puerto Rico. The major factor influencing population size during this time was Hurricane Hugo, which deposited much of the canopy onto the forest floor in 1989. This increase in ground-level structure was in parr responsible for a six-fold increase in the number of adult frogs in 1990 and a large increase in the number of juvenile frogs in 1991. Population densities since Hurricane Hugo have been influenced by succession, with continued high densities associated with thickets of Cecropia and Heliconia. Treefalls, which are similar to hurricanes on a local scale, also were shown to influence population sizes. Years with prolonged dry periods reduced numbers of juvenile frogs, but rainfall patterns alone did not explain most population variation. Population levels of invertebrate predators were related to variation in frog numbers.

AB The close correspondence between the bills of hummingbirds and the lengths of the flowers they feed from has been interpreted as an example of coadaptation. Observations of birds feeding at flowers longer and shorter than their bills, however, and the lack of experimental mental evidence for any feeding advantage to short bills, seem to contradict this interpretation. I address this problem by considering a little-studied dimension of floral morphology: corolla diameter. In laboratory experiments on female ruby-throated hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris), probing abilities (maximum extraction depths) increased with increasing corolla diameter. Handling times increased with decreasing corolla diameter, resulting in ''handling time equivalents'', i.e., flowers having the same handling times but different lengths and diameters. Longer-billed birds had greater maximum extraction depths and shorter handling times than shorter-billed birds at all corolla diameters greater than the width of the bill. In contrast, shorter-billed birds made fewer errors inserting their bills into narrow flowers. Hence, differences in bill lengths apparently are associated with trade-offs in foraging abilities, whereby longer-billed birds are able to feed at long flowers and may do so more quickly, whereas shorter-billed birds are able to feed more successfully at narrow flowers.

AB Evolutionary causes and ecological consequences of sexual differences in hermit crabs were examined through their life history patterns, habitats, behavioral responses to seasonal and size differences in the utilization of vacant shell resources and intraspecific competitive ability. The sand-dwelling hermit crab, Diogenes nitidimanus, and the sand snail, Umbonium moniliferum, were extremely abundant in the study area, comprising a virtually single resource and utilizer system. Size-frequency distributions of the crabs were nearly flat for males but had a prominent peak for larger females, suggesting different patterns of growth and mortality for the two sexes. No conspicuous peak in the size range of small crabs was obvious in size-frequency histograms for each sex from September to the following June. Males were larger than females.
   The number and size of vacant shells produced by the population of U. moniliferum, estimated from their survivorship and growth curves, indicated that both extremely small and large shells were readily available, whereas medium-sized shells suitable for small crabs were relatively rare. This resulted in small crabs using shells that were damaged, much smaller than the sizes they preferred, and of less common species or species that did not inhabit the sand flat.
   Habitat use by males was more diverse than by females. The males used shells of U. moniliferum and other snails inhabiting the sand flat and shells of preferred size more frequently than did females, and also tended to use shells that were larger and more variable in size, Shells that were broken or epibiota covered were less preferred by both sexes, although epibiota-covered shells were used more frequently by males. Broken shells were used at similar frequency by both sexes.
   Crabs supplied with shells of a similar size distribution to that available in the field were cultured for 1 yr. Males tended to grow faster than females, exhausting the limited supply of medium-sized shells. The smaller crabs restrained their growth until such shells became available, explaining the absence of a peak of small crabs in the field population. Although the sex ratio of the field population was female biased, that of the laboratory population was 1:1, indicating that males had a higher mortality rate in the field.
   These results suggest that males are better intraspecific competitors than females in the acquisition of vacant shells. This quality enables males to grow larger, which is advantageous in the acquisition of females. However, shell scarcity produced greater stress in males resulting in their higher mortality rate.

AB Large areas of rainforest in Asia have been converted to plantations, with uncertain effects on soil biodiversity. Using standard metagenetic methods, we compared the soil biota of bacteria, fungi, and nematodes at three rainforest sites in Malaysia with two rubber plantation sites with similar soils and geology. We predicted the following: (1) that the rubber sites would have a lower alpha- and beta-diversity than the rainforest sites, due to the monospecific canopy cover and intensive management with herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers, and (2) that due to differences in the physical and biotic environment associated with cultivation, there would be distinct communities of bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. However, regarding (1), the results showed no consistent difference in alpha- and beta-diversity of bacteria, fungi, or nematodes between rainforest and rubber plantation sites. It appears that conversion of rainforest to rubber plantations does not necessarily result in a decrease in diversity of soil biota. It may be that heterogeneity associated with the cultivation regimen compensates for loss of biotically imposed heterogeneity of the original rainforest. Regarding (2), as predicted there were statistically significant differences in community composition between rainforest and rubber plantation for bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. These differences could be related to a range of factors including light level, litter fall composition, pH, C and N, selecting a distinct set of soil taxa, and it is possible that this in itself would affect long-term soil function.

AB 1. A longstanding goal of ecology and conservation biology is to understand the environmental and biological controls of forest succession. However, the patterns and mechanisms that guide successional trajectories, especially within tropical forests, remain unclear.
   2. We collected leaf functional trait and abiotic data across a 110-year chronosequence within a tropical dry forest in Costa Rica. Focusing on six key leaf functional traits related to resource acquisition and competition, along with measures of forest stand structure, we propose a mechanistic framework to link species composition, community trait distributions and forest structure. We quantified the community-weighted trait distributions for specific leaf area, leaf dry matter concentration, leaf phosphorus concentration, leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio and leaf stable isotopic carbon and nitrogen. We assessed several prominent hypotheses for how these functional measures shift in response to changing environmental variables (soil water content, bulk density and pH) across the chronosequence.
   3. Increasingly, older forests differed significantly from younger forests in species composition, above-ground biomass and shifted trait distributions. Early stages of succession were uniformly characterized by lower values of community-weighted mean specific leaf area, leaf stable nitrogen isotope and leaf phosphorus concentration. Leaf dry matter concentration and leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio were lower during earlier stages of succession, and each trait reached an optimum during intermediate stages of succession. The leaf carbon isotope ratio was the only trait to decrease linearly with increasing stand age indicating reduced water use efficiency in older forests. However, in contrast with expectations, community-weighted trait variances did not generally change through succession, and when compared to null expectations were lower than expected.
   4. The observed directional shift in community-weighted mean trait values is consistent with the 'productivity filtering' hypothesis where a directional shift in water and light availability shifts physiological strategies from 'slow' to 'fast'. In contrast with expectations arising from niche based ecology, none of the community trait distributions were over-dispersed. Instead, patterns of trait dispersion are consistent with the abiotic filtering and/or competitive hierarchy hypotheses.

AB Published maps of global tree cover derived from Landsat data have indicated substantial changes in forest area from 2000 to 2012. The changes can be arranged in different patterns, with different consequences for forest fragmentation. Thus, the changes in forest area do not necessarily equate to changes in forest sustainability.
   The objective is to assess global and regional changes in forest fragmentation in relation to the change of forest area from 2000 to 2012.
   Using published global tree cover data, forest and forest interior areas were mapped in 2000 and 2012. The locations of forest interior change were compared to the locations of overall forest change to identify the direct (pixel level) and indirect (landscape level) components of forest interior change. The changes of forest interior area were compared to the changes of total forest area in each of 768 ecological regions.
   A 1.71 million km(2) (3.2 %) net loss of global forest area translated to a net loss of 3.76 million km(2) (9.9 %) of forest interior area. The difference in loss rates was consistent in most of the 768 ecological regions. The indirect component accounted for 2.44 million km(2) of the net forest interior change, compared to 1.32 million km(2) that was attributable to the direct component.
   Forest area loss alone from 2000 to 2012 underestimates ecological risks from forest fragmentation. In addition to the direct loss of forest, there was a widespread shift of the remaining global forest to a more fragmented condition.

AB Aim The drivers of phylogenetic beta diversity include both local processes (e.g. environmental filtering) and regional processes (e.g. dispersal limitation). The role of environmental filtering can be investigated more directly by analysing community-environment associations, but dispersal limitation is one of the most challenging processes to examine. We investigated the role of traits related to dispersal - flight capacity, body size and voltinism - as drivers ofphylogenetic distance decay relationships in Neotropical stream insect communities.
   Location Headwater streams spread over 600km in south-eastern Brazil.
   Methods We compiled a data set of aquatic insect communities inhabiting streams across the State of SAo Paulo (Brazil). Then, we investigated environmental and spatial signals on phylobetadiversity patterns of aquatic insects using Mantel tests, multiple regressions on distance matrices and variation partitioning. We employed null models to investigate whether phylogenetic distance decay differed from pure compositional distance decay. We deconstructed the data set based on dispersal-related traits; we then ran distance decay analyses for these subsets separately.
   Results Geographical distance, rather than environmental distance, better explained the patterns of phylobetadiversity. We found that the phylogenetic decay relationship differed from the relationship expected for the null models only for univoltine, large-bodied genera with a high-flight capacity.
   Main conclusions Dispersal limitation, rather than species sorting, was the main driver for phylogenetic beta diversity in the metacommunity that we studied. We suggest that life-history strategies and mainly voltinism drive the distance decay of similarity in the insect communities examined. We additionally discuss the role of dispersal events over time to explain differences in distance decay patterns among tropical and other regions.
