Harvesting effects on Paracentrotus lividus population structure: A case study from northwestern Sardinia, Italy, before and after the fishing season. Journal of Coastal Research, 28(3), 570-575. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.
   The edible sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus is commercially exploited in many European countries. In recent years, however, its stocks have shown a large reduction in several regions because of overfishing. This paper reports the effects of harvesting on P. lividus population structure in shallow rocky reefs from a central-western Mediterranean area where this activity is intensively practiced. Density, size (test diam), and biomass of sea urchin were assessed in October 2004 (just before the fishing season) and in May 2005 (immediately after the fishing season) at two locations where intense P. lividus harvest occurs and at two controls within an adjacent Marine Protected Area (MPA) where P. lividus harvest is prohibited. Density, size, and average biomass of P. lividus were significantly higher at the protected areas than at the exploited ones. In particular, large-sized specimens (test diam >5 cm) were notably less abundant at the fished locations; however, very similar results were detected for both the periods examined (i.e., before and after the fishing season), suggesting that effects of pressing activity of harvest through the past years may have produced effects much more evident than those attributable to the single fishing season. These results reveal the existence of a heavy-fishing impact on P. lividus in northwestern Sardinia and the urgent need of regulating its harvesting to prevent severe direct effects on its populations.

AB The rainforest of Mexico has been degraded and severely fragmented, and urgently require restoration. However, the practice of restoration has been limited by the lack of species-specific data on survival and growth responses to local environmental variation. This study explores the differential performance of 14 wet tropical early-, mid- or late-successional tree species that were grown in two abandoned pastures with contrasting land-use histories. After 18 months, seedling survival and growth of at least 7 of the 14 tree species studied were significantly higher in the site with a much longer history of land use (site 2). Saplings of the three early-successional species showed exceptional growth rates. However, differences in performance were noted in relation to the differential soil properties between the experimental sites. Mid-successional species generally showed slow growth rates but high seedling survival, whereas late-successional species exhibited poor seedling survival at both the study sites. Stepwise linear regressions revealed that the species integrated response index combining survivorship and growth measurements, was influenced mostly by differences in soil pH between the two abandoned pastures. Our results suggest that local environmental variation among abandoned pastures of contrasting land-use histories influences sapling survival and growth. Furthermore, the similarity of responses among species with the same successional status allowed us to make some preliminary site and species-specific silvicultural recommendations. Future field experiments should extend the number of species and the range of environmental conditions to identify site generalists or more narrowly adapted species, that we would call sensitive.

AB Traditional approaches to the study of species persistence in fragmented landscapes generally consider a binary classification of habitat being suitable or unsuitable; however, the range of human-modified habitats within a region may offer a gradient of habitat suitability (or conservation value) for species. We identified such a gradient by comparing bird assemblages among contrasting land uses (pine plantations of different age, annual crops, clear cuts and cattle pastures) in the Upper Parana Atlantic forest. Bird assemblages and vegetation structure were characterized in an extensive area of 4400 km(2) in Argentina and Paraguay during the breeding seasons of 2005-2010. Similarity of bird assemblages between anthropogenic habitats and the native forest and the proportion of forest species increased with vegetation vertical structure, while the proportion of open-area species decreased. As a consequence, mature tree plantations were the most suitable habitats for forest species and were mainly used by frugivores and bark insectivores. In contrast, open habitats were the least suitable habitat for forest species and were used primarily by insectivores. Human-created habitats that are structurally complex can be used by a subset of forest species, and may improve functional connectivity and mitigate edge effects. The conservation of large tracks of native forests, however, is critical for the long-term persistence of the entire bird assemblage, especially for native forest dependent species.

AB Frontier expansion in the Brazilian Amazon is often described as "boom-bust" development. We critically assess this characterization by mapping and estimating statistical models of welfare as a function of deforestation at the municipal level. After controlling for potential confounding variables and spatial autocorrelation, estimation results are consistent with a frontier "boom" generated by exploitation of natural resources, followed by a "bust" during which forests continue to fall but there is no compensating gain in welfare. However, average per capita welfare increases again with deforestation at very high levels. This second turning point in average welfare, along with the strong bivariate correlation between deforestation and municipal GDP/km(2), may encourage local leaders to equate deforestation with development. This confirms the need for international incentive payments for global public goods, such as biodiversity and carbon sequestration, that are provided by the Amazon forest. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Flat fees in payment for environmental services (PES) schemes promote administrative ease, and are perceived as egalitarian. However, when environmental-service (ES) buyers are heterogeneous in their income and water-consumption levels, this scheme may not be optimal, as total payments might become too low and services under-supplied. This paper estimates willingness to pay (WTP) higher fees from hydrological-service buyers in an ongoing PES initiative in an Andean watershed in Colombia, where small, flat user payments have been introduced. ES users fall into two highly heterogeneous categories: smallholder peasants and recreational-house owners. We perform a contingent valuation analysis in a representative sample of 218 households. For improved water services, ES buyers on average are willing to pay monthly about US$1 premium over current flat PES rate. Users' heterogeneity, however, affects significantly this outcome: while recreational-house owners are willing to pay monthly on average US$1.61 more than the current fee, smallholders only US$0.41. Spatial variables, such as distance to the water distribution point and to the town center, importantly influence WTP. Results may help designing user-driven PES schemes in line with efficiency and equity objectives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forest fragmentation threatens the sustainability of forest communities in the eastern United States. Forest communities exhibiting either a low total area or low percentage of intact forest are subject to relatively higher risk of shifts in stand composition towards edge-adapted and invasive species. Such changes in stand composition could result in local extirpation of communities, homogenization of forest communities at broader spatial scales, and a consequential reduction of the biodiversity values of forestland. To evaluate current conditions, we combined forest inventory data with land cover data to compare 70 forest communities in terms of the amount and ownership of intact (i.e., not fragmented) forest, and the proximate causes (i.e., adjacent land cover) of fragmentation. Only 45% of total forestland area was intact in 4.41-ha neighborhoods, but that varied from 13% to 78% among forest communities. Among 10 community groups, the proximate causes of fragmentation reflected their typical geographic context, and the relative importance of fragmentation by development was higher in mostly-forested neighborhoods than in less-forested neighborhoods. Fragmentation was also higher on privately owned forestland than on public forestland. Because of the regional dominance of only a few forest communities and private land ownership, the total regional area of intact forest was driven more by the total area of those strata than by their fragmentation characteristics. The results provide insight for targeting land management strategies to maintain the diversity and regional distributions of intact forest communities. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Since 1989 we have monitored small mammal populations at a semiarid site in north-central Chile with a large-scale livetrapping grid complex. Selective exclusions of vertebrate predators or putative small mammal competitors, or both, have yielded relatively small or mostly transitory effects, or both, on small mammal population dynamics and plant community composition. During the study period 5 El Nino-high rainfall episodes have occurred lasting 1-3 years. Resident or core small mammals such as Abrothrix olivaceus, Phyllotis darwini, and Octodon degus experience dramatic fluctuations during and following rainfall pulses. Temporary resident or opportunistic species such as Oligoryzomys longicaudatus and A. longipilis disappear from the thorn scrub for varying periods of time. All species persist in more mesic nearby habitats near dry stream courses (aguadas). Since a 3-year high rainfall event in 2000-2002 mean annual rainfall has increased in this region, mainly due to a lack of prolonged droughts. Under these conditions, and building on a qualitative model proposed by Noy-Meir, long-lived species might become more abundant. Changes in the small mammal assemblage are consistent with these predictions; O. degus, a caviomorph rodent with a long life span, now comprises a more constant proportion of the small mammal biomass in the thorn scrub, and we have documented reduced variation in species diversity. Increased rainfall, a predicted consequence of global climate change in this region, might be leading to changes in small mammal assemblage structure and composition and ultimately will result in a more stable, less oscillatory assemblage in the thorn scrub. Additionally, invasive groups such as introduced lagomorphs and ephemeral plants might become more abundant in this community. The long-term consequences of changes in rainfall patterns due to El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSOs), with important teleconnections to global-scale phenomena, will lead to diverse changes at the community level here.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) programmes are widely recognized as novel and innovative mechanisms that seek to promote the conservation of biodiversity while simultaneously improving human livelihoods. A number of national-level PES programmes have made significant contributions to advancing knowledge of these mechanisms. Namibia's community-based natural resources management (CBNRM) programme effectively operates as one such large-scale PES programme, making it one of the world's longest-standing schemes. In this review, Namibia's CBNRM scheme is compared and contrasted with the formal definition of a PES programme, some of the outcomes that the programme has produced illustrated by examples, and the challenges that must still be faced identified. Most of the requirements for a PES programme are present in Namibia's CBNRM programme, and when it does not meet these criteria, it is not exceptional. Notwithstanding the increases in wildlife populations and financial benefits that have been associated with the programme, a major challenge going forward revolves around diversifying the number of services produced. Namibia's CBNRM programme has much to contribute to the design of large-scale PES schemes.

AB Tropical and subtropical forests provide important ecosystem goods and services including carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. These forests are facing increasing socioeconomic pressures and are rapidly being degraded and fragmented. This analysis focuses on the rate of change and patterns of fragmentation in a collective forest area in Zhejiang province, China, during the time period 1988-2005. The research consisted of two parts. The first was the development of general land cover maps and the identification of land cover changes by interpreting Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) time series imagery. The second part involved the computation and analysis of forest fragmentation metrics. For this portion of the study, fragmentation statistics were analyzed, and images were developed to depict forest fragmentation patterns and trends. Results revealed that there was a net loss of 7.8% in forest coverage, dropping from 66.8% in 1988 to 59.0% in 2005, primarily caused by agricultural expansion and poor forest management practices. An acceleration of forest fragmentation was also witnessed during the time intervals, which was evidenced by a decreasing trend in interior forest (57.2% in 1988, 55.0% in 1996 and 54.8% in 2005 respectively) coupled with the scales of the selected geospatial metrics. Continued forest loss and fragmentation are closely correlated with the existing political, educational, institutional and economic processes of contemporary China. To unlock the developmental potentials of the collective forests and to effectively mitigate the rate of forest loss and fragmentation, reforms of forest tenure and ecological immigration practices are recognized as a prospective alternative. The produced fragmentation maps further illustrates the importance of assessing landscape change history, especially the spatiotemporal patterns of forest fragments, when developing landscape level plans for biodiversity conservation, land use management and ecologically sustainable forestry.

AB The regulating services provided by ecosystems are amongst the most important for the sustainability of resource use, and yet they are also amongst the least understood. This paper considers one set of regulating mechanisms - the buffering functions of wetlands - and considers the information needed to identify both the value of the services offered by wetlands, and their substitutes. Using data from a catchment discharging water and nutrients to the Kenyan segment of Lake Victoria, the Yala catchment, the paper models the interactions between agriculture and fisheries as mediated by wetlands at the lake margin. More particularly, it estimates the value of the forgone nutrient retention function involved in the conversion of the wetland to agriculture, and the scope for providing the same services through land use change elsewhere in the catchment. The total cost of the payments that would compensate farmers for on-farm nutrient buffering services is 3.86 M US$ year(-1), or 35% of the total gains from wetland conversion to crop production. This finding contributes to an understanding of both the value of regulating services and how they might most effectively be delivered in alternative ways. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Amazonian forest bird communities are among the richest in the world. Even so, relatively little is known about the organization of the entire avian community at local scales or about differences across Amazonia. These are fundamental data not only for understanding the processes generating and maintaining tropical diversity, but also as a baseline for evaluating anthropogenic changes to Amazonian forests. Here we provide a description of the entire bird community for a 100 ha plot of terra firme forest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, near Manaus, Brazil, based on spot-map and mist net surveys augmented by additional field and analytical techniques. Although our results are from a single plot surveyed in a single year, our methods and interpretation reflect nearly 30 years of ornithological research at the site. We found 228 species on the plot, of which 207 were considered part of the core regional avifauna. Median density was five individuals/100 ha. Only 13 species (6% of the core species) had densities >= 20 individuals on the plot, although 55 species (27%) had <= 2 individuals. No species had territories smaller than 3 ha; median territory size was 11 ha for the 103 species for which we could make reasonable estimates. Measured by numbers of species or individuals, the plot was dominated by insectivores (54% of species, 62% of individuals). Biomass, however, was dominated by frugivores and granivores (59%). Compared to available data from other Amazonian forests, our site appears to have comparable richness of a similar set of species, but lower density and greater patchiness. Our results suggest that the area required to support populations of many species will be even greater in central Amazonia than in western Amazonia.

AB P>1. Mixed-wood boreal forests are often considered to undergo directional succession from shade-intolerant to shade-tolerant species. It is thus expected that overstorey gaps should lead to the recruitment of shade-tolerant conifers into the canopy in all stand development stages and that the recruitment of shade-intolerant hardwoods would be minimal except in the largest gaps.
   2. We analysed short-term gap dynamics over a large 6-km2 spatial area of mixed-wood boreal forest across a gradient of stands in different developmental stages with different times of origin since fire (expressed as stand 'age') that were affected differentially by the last spruce budworm (SBW) outbreak. Structural measurements of the canopy from lidar data were combined with spectral classification of broad species groups to characterize the gap disturbance regime and to evaluate the effect of gap openings on forest dynamics.
   3. Estimated annual gap opening rates increased from 0.16% for 84-year-old stands to 0.88% for 248-year-old stands. Trees on gap peripheries in all stands were more vulnerable to mortality than interior canopy trees.
   4. Due to recovery from the last SBW outbreak 16 years previously, gap closure rates were higher than opening rates, ranging from 0.44% to 2.05% annually, but did not show any relationship with stand age. There was, however, a continuing legacy of the last SBW outbreak in old-conifer stands in terms of a continued high mortality of conifers. In all stands, the majority of the openings were filled from below, although a smaller but significant proportion filled from lateral growth of gap edge trees.
   5. Synthesis. The forest response to moderate- to small-scale disturbances in old-growth boreal forest counters the earlier assumption that the transition from one forest state to the next is slow and directional with time since the last fire. Overall, a small 6% increase in hardwoods was observed over 5 years, largely due to regeneration in-filling of hardwoods in gaps instead of successional transition to more shade-tolerant conifers. Gaps are vital for hardwood maintenance while transition to softwoods can occur without perceived gap-formation as overstorey trees die, releasing understorey trees.

AB Agroforestry on small-scale farms has potential to provide important ecological services, such as carbon sequestration and maintenance of biological diversity, while also providing on-farm products for domestic use and marketing. Payments for environmental services (PES) are an increasingly popular mechanism for encouraging production of ecological services on agricultural lands and may also contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable farming practices through adoption of new farming technologies. There is little current information, however, on the degree to which PES increase tree planting relative to a baseline or the effects of program participation on farmer livelihoods. This study examined the initial impacts of a recent PES program for agroforestry in southern Costa Rica by: (1) assessing the efficiency of PES in increasing reforestation relative to baseline tree planting activities; (2) examining farmer perceptions of socioeconomic and environmental impacts of PES; and (3) exploring obstacles to adoption of agroforestry practices. Thirty-six participant and non-participant farmers were given semi-structured interviews. Key informant interviews were conducted with forestry engineers, farmers' associations, NGOs, and government agencies. Farmers reported positive economic benefits in the first 2-3 years of program participation. PES participants also planted substantially more trees and more species than non-participant farmers. The PES program was effective in overcoming initial economic and technical obstacles that made adoption of agroforestry unattractive. Strong local organizations played a key role in facilitating adoption. Additional investment in short- to medium-term technical support will likely be necessary for broad retention of agroforestry practices beyond the life of the PES contracts.

AB Biogeographers study all patterns in the geographic variation of life, from the spatial variation in genetic and physiological characteristics of cells and individuals, to the diversity and dynamics of biological communities among continental biotas or across oceanic archipelagoes. The field of island biogeography, in particular, has provided some genuinely transformative insights for the biological sciences, especially ecology and evolutionary biology. Our purpose here is to review the historical development of island biogeography theory during the 20th century by identifying the common threads that run through four sets of contributions made during this period, including those by Eugene Gordon Munroe (1948, 1953), Edward O. Wilson (1959, 1961), Frank W. Preston (1962a,b), and the seminal collaborations between Wilson and Robert H. MacArthur (1963, 1967), which revolutionized the field and served as its paradigm for nearly four decades. This epistemological account not only reviews the intriguing history of island theory, but it also includes fundamental lessons for advancing science through transformative integrations. Indeed, as is likely the case with many disciplines, island theory advanced not as a simple accumulation of facts and an orderly succession of theories and paradigms, but rather in fits and starts through a reticulating phylogeny of ideas and alternating periods of specialization and reintegration. We conclude this review with a summary of the salient features of this scientific revolution in the context of Kuhn's structure, which strongly influenced theoretical advances during this period, and we then describe some of the fundamental assumptions and tenets of an emerging reintegration of island biogeography theory.

AB Aims
   We aim to examine the canopy gal) characteristics and evaluate their influence on regeneration, dominance and the early growth of woody species in seasonally dry Shorea robusta forests (Sal forests).
   Methods
   Sixty canopy gaps were surveyed in six randomly located transects belts in seasonally dry subtropical Sal forests of central Nepal. Each transect belt was followed until 10 gap sites were encountered. The equation for the area of all ellipse was used to calculate the size of canopy gip, measuring the longest axis and its perpendicular shorter axis. Number, sizes, ages and causes of tree fall, creating canopy gaps, along with number and sizes of border trees were identified and recorded. Detailed gap inventories were carried out using square 25-m(2) quadrats placed in the middle of each gap. All individuals >2 m in height within the quadrat were identified at the species level and their diameter all breast height was measured. We assigned a nested 4-m(2) quadrat to the corner of each 25-m(2) quadrat, within which all woody individuals >10 cm tall were identified at the species level, and counted them and their regeneration mechanisms were identified. The height and collar diameter of the tallest individuals were measured. Descriptive statistics was calculated for the variables of interests and Pearson correlation, linear regression, independent-sample t-test and chi-square test were used to relate them and to test for their associations.
   Important Findings
   The study found mean gap size of 283 m(2) and similar to 50% gaps of 10-15 years old. Gaps created by natural single-tree falls were significantly more numerous, and their mean size was significantly smaller than those resulting from artificial causes or multiple-tree falls. Gal) size correlated with the basal area of felled trees, but it did not correlate with the number of tree falls. While tree fall basal area was significantly positively correlated to the seed-originated seedling to resprout ratio, it was negatively correlated, along with gal) area and the basal size of retained trees, to seedling growth, The relative seedling density of Terminalia alata increased with increases in gal) areas, while that of S.robusta decreased with increases in tree fall basal area, thereby lowering the plot-level dominance. However, the relative seedling densities of Eugenia operculata and Syzigium cumini were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with tree fall basal area.

AB Perceptual range is used as a measure of the ability of animals to perceive the landscape, and can be used to infer functional connectivity between habitat patches such as forest remnants. A relationship of perceptual range with body mass was proposed by Mech and Zollner, but effects of life-history traits and environmental conditions were also acknowledged. We evaluated perceptual ranges and the influence of body mass, wind speed and direction, and grass height in four marsupial species of the Atlantic Forest of south-eastern Brazil. Release experiments were conducted and orientation towards the forest was determined using the spool-and-line technique. In 111 animals released. Didelphis aurita had the highest perceptual range (200 m), followed by Philander frenatus and Micoureus paraguayanus (100 m), and by Marmosops incanus (< 100 m). None of the species presented homing behaviour, and there was no difference in orientation abilities between sexes. Perceptual range was overestimated based on the equations of Mech and Zollner, but species were ordered in perceptual range according to their body size. Distance to the Forest was a common determinant of the orientation in P. frenatus and M. paraguayanus, but grass height and wind direction were also important. Orientation of Didelphis aurita was determined by wind direction, showing anemotactic behaviour. Body mass is likely to affect perceptual ranges in didelphid marsupials, but only in interspecific comparisons. Within a species perception depends on the environmental context. Variables other than distance must be considered to estimate functional connectivity of the landscape based on perceptual range.

AB Interactions among species occur across a continuum from negative to positive and can have a critical role in shaping population and community dynamics. Growing evidence suggests that inter- and intra-specific interactions can vary in strength or even switch direction (i.e., negative to positive) depending on environmental conditions, consumer pressure, and also among life-history stages. We tested the hypothesis that seedlings and adults of the intertidal annual forb Suaeda linearis growing on New England shores exhibit positive density-dependence under physically stressful conditions high on the shore (i.e., greater temperatures, evaporative stress), but negative density-dependence under physically milder conditions low on the shore. Among experimental treatments of plant density (dense versus sparse) at each shore height, plant biomass, length, and number of leaves/branches were greater in dense stands high on the shore (positive density-dependence), but greater in sparse stands low on the shore (negative density-dependence). Such responses were consistent among life-history stages and generally consistent between sites. As a more direct measure of fitness, per capita seed production was also positively density-dependent high on the shore, but negatively density-dependent low on the shore. These results support the current theory predicting an increase in the frequency of positive interactions with increasing environmental stress and further emphasize the previously understated role of positive interactions in shaping and maintaining populations and communities.

AB Questions: Do lianas alter the relative success of tree species during regeneration? Are the effects of lianas on tree seedlings moderated by canopy openness? How are patterns of biomass allocation in tree seedlings affected by liana competition?
   Location: Tropical moist semi-deciduous forest in Ghana.
   Methods: Seedlings of the trees Nauclea diderrichii (pioneer), Khaya anthotheca (non-pioneer light demander) and Garcinia kola (non-pioneer shade bearer) were planted with the lianas Acacia kamerunensis (fast growing) and Loeseneriella rowlandii (slow growing) in large and small gaps (ca. 15% and 8% PAR respectively) and in the forest understorey (ca. 4% PAR). Seedling survival, growth and biomass allocation were measured.
   Results: Canopy openness moderated the interaction between liana and tree seedlings. The nature of the interaction was both liana and tree species specific and displayed temporal variation. Acacia competition effects were stronger in sites with greater canopy openness. In big gaps, Acacia reduced significantly the biomass of Nauclea by 32% and Khaya by about 50%. Khaya growth in leaf area was five times greater without Acacia, while Nauclea and Garcinia were not affected. Acacia was more plastic than Loeseneriella in response to the environment and the tree species. Our results show that while Loeseneriella, with lower rates of growth, did not affect seedling growth of the three species evaluated, Acacia could alter the relative success of tree species during regeneration.
   Conclusions: There is evidence that competitive effects by Acacia on tree regeneration through competition could modify tree species capacity to establish. Effects by lianas at the regeneration phase may have important implications for forest management.

AB When invasive woody plants become dominant, they present an extreme challenge for restoration of native plant communities. Invasive Morella faya (fire tree) forms extensive, nearly monospecific stands in wet and mesic forests on the Island of Hawai'i. We used logging, girdling, and selective girdling over time (incremental girdling) to kill stands of M. faya at different rates, with the objective of identifying a method that best promotes native forest re-establishment. We hypothesized that rapid canopy opening by logging would lead to establishment of fast-growing, non-native invaders, but that slower death of M. faya by girdling or incremental girdling would increase the establishment by native plants adapted to partial shade conditions. After applying the M. faya treatments, seed banks, seed rain, and plant recruitment were monitored over 3 years. Different plant communities developed in response to the treatments. Increased light and nitrogen availability in the logged treatment were associated with invasion by non-native species. Native species, including the dominant native forest tree, (Metrosideros polymorpha) and tree fern (Cibotium glaucum), established most frequently in the girdle and incremental girdle treatments, but short-lived non-native species were more abundant than native species. A diverse native forest is unlikely to develop following any of the treatments due to seed limitation for many native species, but girdling and incremental girdling promoted natural establishment of major components of native Hawaiian forest. Girdling may be an effective general strategy for reestablishing native vegetation in areas dominated by woody plant invaders.

AB Interspecific differences in morphology, biomass allocation and phenotypic plasticity along an experimental irradiance gradient and two contrasting water regimes were studied for eight Mediterranean woody species at the seedling stage; a critical demographic stage in Mediterranean plant communities. We tested whether species variation in these traits can explain previously reported interspecific differences in performance under shade and drought. Four irradiance levels (1%, 6%, 20% and 100% of full sunlight) and two water regimes (well watered and water-stressed conditions) in 6% and 100% irradiance levels were established. Quercus species exhibited the largest seeds, the highest total dry mass and also the highest root-shoot ratio, but their leaf mass fraction (LMF) and leaf area ratio (LAR) were low. Pistacia terebinthus, and Arbutus unedo exhibited the opposite traits. From those traits that correlated with seed size only LAR resulted significantly linked to survival in deep shade. None of the traits studied correlated with survival under water-stressed conditions. Overall phenotypic plasticity was negatively correlated with survival in deep shade but no correlation was found with survival under water-stressed conditions. Our results highlight the importance of low LAR and low phenotypic plasticity as potential determinants of enhanced performance under shade during the very early seedling stages of Mediterranean woody species. Low LAR was also positively correlated with seed size and consequently, its relationship with enhanced performance under shade might change at later life stages of the plant when seed reserves are no longer available.

AB Macroecology is a big-picture, statistical approach to the study of ecology. By focusing on broadly occurring patterns and processes operating at large spatial and temporal scales and ignoring localized and fine-scaled details, macroecology aims to uncover general mechanisms operating at organism, population and ecosystem levels of organization. Although such an approach is evident in writings dating from the mid- to late 1800s, not until 1989 was the domain of macroecology clearly articulated. Since then there has been an exponential growth in publications employing a macroecological perspective. Here we (1) briefly review the history of macroecology, with emphasis on cultural, scientific and technological innovations that made this approach possible, (2) highlight current developments in the field, including its increasing linkages with biogeography and other disciplines, and (3) point to likely future directions. We also touch upon methodological, statistical and institutional challenges faced by this and other highly interdisciplinary approaches. Our review of macroecology is especially timely, since it has been 20 years since the term was coined and the seminal paper published.

TI When Donors Get Cold Feet: the Community Conservation Concession in

AB There is consensus that payments for biodiversity services are a promising conservation tool, yet the implementation of applied schemes has been lagging behind. This paper explores some reasons why potential biodiversity buyers may hesitate. It describes the case of an unsuccessful attempt to establish a community conservation concession in the village of Setulang (East Kalimantan, Indonesia) to safeguard a biologically valuable area from predatory logging. Potential biodiversity donors did not engage in this payments-for-environmental-services scheme mainly because of their limited time horizon and uneasiness about the conditionality principle. Other complicating factors included overlapping land claims, and the diagnosis of the externality at hand. We conclude that new investment modalities and attitudes are needed if potential biodiversity buyers are to exploit the advantages of this innovative tool. We also provide some tangible recommendations on factors to consider when designing a compensation scheme for conservation at the community level.

AB Questions: To what extent are the distributions of tropical rain forest tree ferns (Cyatheaceae) related to environmental variation, and is habitat specialization likely to play a role in their local coexistence?
   Location: Lowland rain forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica.
   Methods: Generalized linear (GLM) and generalized additive (GAM) logistic regression were used to model the incidence of four tree fern species in relation to environmental and neighbourhood variables in 1154 inventory plots regularly distributed across 6 km(2) of old-growth forest. Small and large size classes of the two most abundant species were modelled separately to see whether habitat associations change with ontogeny.
   Results: GLM and GAM model results were similar. All species had significant distributional biases with respect to micro-habitat. Environmental variables describing soil variation were included in the models most often, followed by topographic and forest structural variables. The distributions of small individuals were more strongly related to environmental variation than those of larger individuals. Significant neighbourhood effects (spatial autocorrelation in intraspecific distributions and non-random overlaps in the distributions of certain species pairs) were also identified. Overlaps between congeners did not differ from random, but there was a highly significant overlap in the distributions of the two most common species.
   Conclusions: Our results support the view that habitat specialization is an important determinant of where on the rain forest landscape tree ferns grow, especially for juvenile plants. However, other factors, such as dispersal limitation, may also contribute to their local coexistence.

AB Here long-term monitoring data taken at 33 sites in southern and central California coast and islands were used to evaluate the size structure of the large intertidal limpet, Lottia gigantea in restricted-access and in easily accessible intertidal zones that encompass a wide range of ecological variables. Using multi-dimensional analysis of population size structures, we found that sites on islands and strictly protected mainland sites have significantly larger median limpet sizes and a greater range of limpet sizes than unprotected mainland sites, while no pattern occurs in latitudinal or regional comparison of sites. Although intertidal predators such as oystercatchers were not the primary focus of the monitoring efforts, extensive natural history notes taken during sampling visits support the argument that predation was not a primary cause for the size structure differences. Finally, substratum differences were determined not to have biased the observation of larger limpets in protected sites. In regard to human interactions with limpets, we conclude that the degree of enforcement against poaching is the better predictor of limpet size structure than proximity to population centers or visitation to intertidal sites.

AB Matrix population growth models are standard tools for forecasting population change and for managing rare species, but they are less useful for predicting extinction risk in the face of changing environmental conditions. Deterministic models provide point estimates of X, the finite rate of increase, as well as measures of matrix sensitivity and elasticity. Stationary matrix models can be used to estimate extinction risk in a variable environment, but they assume that the matrix elements are randomly sampled from a stationary (i.e., non-changing) distribution. Here we outline a method for using nonstationary matrix model!; to construct realistic forecasts of population fluctuation in changing environments. Our method requires three pieces of data: (I) field estimates of transition matrix elements, (2) experimental data on the demographic responses of populations. to altered environmental conditions, and (3) forecasting data on environmental drivers. These three pieces of data are combined to generate a series of sequential transition matrices that emulate a pattern of long-term change in environmental drivers. Realistic estimates of population persistence and extinction risk can be derived from stochastic permutations of such a model. We illustrate the steps of this analysis with data from two population's of Sarracenia purpurea growing in northern New England. Sarracenia purpurea is a perennial carnivorous plant that is potentially at risk of local extinction because of increased nitrogen deposition. Long-term monitoring records or models of environmental change can be used to generate time series of driver variables under different scenarios of changing environments. Both manipulative and natural experiments can be used to construct a linking function that describes how matrix parameters change as a function of the environmental driver. This synthetic modeling approach provides quantitative estimates of extinction probability that have an explicit mechanistic basis.

AB We used clearcut logging in establishing four replicated sizes of canopy openings (0.016, 0.08, 0.4, and 2.0 ha) in a southern Appalachian hardwood forest in 1981 to examine the long-term effects of disturbance size on plant community structure, biomass accumulation, aboveground net primary productivity (NPP), and mode of recovery. The reestablishment of NPP and biomas following logging was 6-7-fold greater in large than small openings by 17 years. Total biomass in the 2.0 ha openings (127.3 Mg ha(-1)) recovered 59.5% as NPP (19.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) reached 225% of precut forest levels. Biomass accumulation was 2.6-3.6-fold greater in interior than edge locations of all but the 0.016 ha gaps. The absence of significant patch size or edge vs. interior differences in tree densities suggests that growth rates of individual trees were enhanced in more insolated microenvironments. Sprouting (86-95% of tree NPP) was much more important than advance regeneration (4-10%) or seedling germination (< 2%) during early recovery in all opening sizes. Canopy dominant Quercus and Carya trees exhibited limited sprouting following disturbance. Instead, shade-intolerant Robinia pseudoacacia and Liriodendron tulipifera were major sprouters that used N-fixation (Robinia) and rapid growth (Liriodendron) in attaining 7.4 and 5.9 fold greater biomass accumulation, respectively in 2.0 ha than 0.016 ha opening sizes. Seedling germination and understory production were extensive in all openings following logging, but declined rapidly as the young tree canopy began closing by 4-6 years. The relative importance of shade-intolerant tree biomass approximately doubled over 17 years as shade-tolerant tree seedlings, herbs, and shrubs gradually regained importance under the emerging canopy. Sprouting caused the persistence of a tree species composition in all openings that remained relatively similar to the precut forest. Large disturbances on mountain slopes of the southern Appalachians generally promote sprouting and rapid recovery, whereas small disturbances in low-elevation cove forests lead to a gradual recovery through seedling germination and/or advance regeneration. Continued logging in the southern Appalachians will increase the relative size and frequency of large disturbances, further the importance of sprouting of shade-intolerant species, and lead to more even-aged forest stands throughout the region.

AB Buffer strips are strips of forest retained along streamsides after harvesting to mitigate negative impacts of forestry on aquatic and riparian fauna and water quality. The capacity of riparian buffer strips of old-growth forest to maintain species richness and abundance of natural bird communities was explored in coastal montane forest on Vancouver Island, Canada. Breeding bird communities in buffer strips of varying widths along rivers were compared with controls of equivalent area in uncut old-growth riparian forest to identify shifts in species richness, diversity, abundance and composition. We observed that effects on riparian bird communities were greatest in very narrow buffers with high amounts of edge habitat. Several forest-interior species were found almost exclusively in wider buffers and abundances dropped dramatically between wide (125 in) and medium (41 in) width buffers with replacement by open-edge species in narrow buffers. Species composition of communities in wide buffers were very similar to controls while narrow buffers shared less than half of their species with controls. Species richness and diversity increased in buffers over the three years while remaining constant in controls. Increases in species richness and abundance within buffers were positively correlated with similar increases in the adjacent clearcuts, suggesting that regeneration in clearcuts may facilitate recolonization of forest in remnant buffers. For the forest-interior species found primarily in wide buffers, buffers > 100 m may need to be retained. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Valuable timber tree species frequently show poor regeneration after selective logging in tropical forests. Small size of logging gaps, lack of soil disturbance, and limited seed availability have each been blamed for observed regeneration failures. We investigated seed germination and seedling performance using a split-plot factorial design involving light availability and litter removal for six Central African timber tree species, hypothesizing that canopy gaps and litter removal would improve seedling establishment, and that less shade-tolerant species would show stronger responses to both factors. Contrary to our expectations, significantly more germinants established on intact litter than on exposed mineral soil 3 mo after seeding. After 18 me, seedling survival, height and diameter growth, leaf area, and rooting depth were all much higher in gap plots than in the understory for all species, with the exception of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei, a highly shade-tolerant species whose survival was higher in the understory Leaf production was negatively influenced by litter removal in the least shade-tolerant species, Nauclea diderrichii, with weak or positive effects in other species. G. dewevrei, while displaying a low-light threshold for growth, exhibited a surprisingly high growth response to increasing light comparable to more shade-intolerant species, a response that may help explain its local competitive dominance in the region. Due to the rapid closure of small gaps, we suggest that shade-intolerant species such as N. diderrichii, Khaya anthotheca, and Entandrophragma utile might benefit from more intensive silvicultural practices that create larger canopy gaps.

AB Aim We assessed the effects of latitude, altitude and climate on the alpha diversity of rain forest trees in the Western Ghats (WG) of India. We tested whether stem densities, dominance, the prevalence of rarity, and the proportion of understorey trees are significantly correlated with alpha diversity.
   Locatiaon The WG is a chain of mountains c. 1600 km in length, running parallel to the western coast of the Indian peninsula from above 8degrees N to almost 21degrees N latitude. Wet forests occur as a narrow strip in regions with heavy rainfall.
   Methods To assess tree diversity we used data from 40 small plots, < 1 ha in area, where all trees greater than or equal to 3.18 cm d.b.h. had been inventoried. These plots were distributed across 7 latitudinal degrees and at elevations between 200 and 1550 m. Fisher's alpha was used as a measure of diversity. For each plot, the proportion of trees belonging to the understorey, the proportion of trees belonging to the most abundant species in the plot, as a measure of dominance, and the proportionate representation of singletons, as a measure of rarity, were estimated, and correlated with Fisher's alpha, elevation, rainfall and seasonality.
   Results Annual rainfall and seasonality increased towards the north, but were not significantly correlated. Tree diversity increased significantly with decreasing seasonality. Tree diversity was not significantly correlated with stem density or with the proportion of understorey tree species, but was significantly correlated with tree dominance and rarity. Dominance increased and rarity significantly decreased with increasing seasonality.
   Main conclusions This study demonstrates that seasonality influences rain forest tree diversity in the WG of India. The relationship between alpha diversity, dominance and rarity lends correlative support for the Janzen-Connell pest pressure hypothesis.

AB We estimated fusion frequency with respect to coancestry in the bryozoan Celleporella hyalina, whose briefly planktonic sexually produced larvae settle on algal substrata and proceed to form encrusting colonies by iterative budding. Frequency of fusion between paired colonies growing on an artificial substratum was positively correlated with coefficient of relatedness, with allorecognition ability increasing during the early stages of colonial growth after larval settlement. Parents repressed the growth of F-1 progeny with which they had fused. The results are concordant with the Feldgarden-Yund model of selection for self-recognition, which regards fusion with kin as an inevitable source of error whose cost diminishes with increasing relatedness. Contrary to fusion compatibility, gametic compatibility is negatively correlated with coancestry, indicating a need for further research on the possibility of common or linked genetic control that has opposite effect at somatic and gametic levels.

AB 1 Matrix models were used to evaluate the effect of chestnut blight infection on transition probabilities and population growth rates for American chestnuts. Disease-free, epidemic and recovering (i.e. pathogen infected with a double-stranded (ds) RNA hypovirus) populations were compared.
   2 Population growth rates (lambda) did not differ significantly over time or with disease status. However, predicted stable stage distributions differed between population types, with disease-free and recovering populations more similar to each other than either was to epidemic populations.
   3 Survival had the highest proportional contribution to population growth rates as revealed by elasticity analyses. However, reductions in stasis of the largest trees contributed most to reductions in population growth rate when comparing diseased with disease-free populations using LTRE.
   4 The presence of hypovirus reduces pathogen virulence, allowing individual American chestnut trees to increase in size. Where dsRNA has spread, chestnut populations in Michigan have attained population dynamics similar to those found in disease-free populations.
   5 Matrix models and life table response experiments can be used to detect important pathogen-mediated changes in the dynamics of host populations.

AB Since the 1800s, brocket deer have been an important source of meat and income for subsistence and professional hunters in the Peruvian Amazon. Today, local people continue to hunt brocket deer for subsistence meat and for sale in local meat markets. Although brocket deer are not hunted as frequently as peccaries, they make a significant contribution to rural household economies. This study assessed the sustainability of hunting of brocket deer by local communities in the Tamshiyacu Tahuayo Communal Reserve (TTCR), northeastern Peru. We analyzed data from 1991 to 1999 using density comparisons, hunting pressures, an age structure model, and a harvest model comparing results between heavily hunted, slightly hunted, and non-hunted sites. The four approaches agreed that brocket deer are harvested sustainably. The sustainability of brocket deer hunting will depend on the continued presence of other valuable wildlife species (e.g. peccaries and large rodents), which are more preferred due to their ease of hunting and higher rates of encounters. Gross productivity indicates that brocket deer are showing resilience in the form of density dependent reproductive adjustments in the TTCR, but they may still be vulnerable to overhunting. Consequently, current levels of harvesting may be continued until further ecological and biological information on the species' population trends assist in defining more reliable sustainable offtake levels.

AB We compared growth, photosynthetic performance and shade adaptation of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) plants growing in natural shade (33, 55 and 77% reduction in incoming radiation) to control plants growing in full sunlight. Stem diameter and plant height, measured over a 15-month period, were greatest in plants grown in full sunlight, and both parameters decreased with increasing shade. At 7 and 14 months after planting (MAP), total plant dry mass was highest in control plants and lowest in plants in 77% shade. Expansion of the fourth leaf whorl, monitored at 5-6 MAP, was slowest in plants in 77% shade and fastest in unshaded plants, which had more leaves and higher leaf areas and inter-whorl shoot lengths. In response to increasing shade, specific leaf area increased, whereas leaf weight ratio and relative growth rate decreased. Chlorophyll a/b ratio decreased with increasing shade, indicating shade-induced partitioning of chlorophyll into light-harvesting complexes. Compared to the response in unshaded plants, CO2 assimilation saturated at lower photosynthetic photon flux densities in plants in 77% shade, with a lower upper-asymptote to the light response curve. Chlorophyll fluorescence revealed no evidence of sustained photoinhibitory damage in unshaded plants. Dynamic photoinhibition decreased with increasing shade, with the greatest depression in the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence around midday. We conclude that shade adaptation and shade-induced reductions in dynamic photoinhibition account for the enhanced early growth of rubber in light shade.

AB Shell preferences, as shown by laboratory choice experiments, are important determinants of shell utilization under natural conditions. Size and shell species preferences of the hermit crab Calcinus tibicen were determined for the three most occupied [Stramonita haemastoma (Linnaeus, 1767), Leucozonia nassa (Gmelin, 1791) and Pisania auritula (Link, 1807)] shell species along the rocky shore of Grande beach, Ubatuba, Brazil, taking into account the sexual condition of the individuals. All experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions using a glass aquarium where the hermit crabs (independent on their sex condition) were placed naked with a large number of shells of appropriate sizes. The chosen shells were determined after 72 h. The preferred shell species and size were determined by regression analysis. C. tibicen showed no significant choice among the three gastropod shell species. Shell size experiments revealed that the preference of hermit crabs was strongly associated with shell weight and internal volume. The shell adequacy index (SAD decreased with increasing crab size and showed that the population was occupying relatively adequate shells (SAI = 0.99 +/- 0.19). The present data lead us to conclude that shell selection by hermit crabs involves individual and sexual preferences taking into account the shell features that best provide protection and survival, principally in the rocky inter-tidal studied area, characterized by intense wave action.

AB Microbial biomass and activity as well as N-availability were measured in the mounds of three ant species strongly differing in foraging strategy and mound architecture: Myrmica scabrinodis, Lasius niger and L. flavus. Soil microbial biomass (C-mic) was significantly increased in the mounds of all three ant species. This positive effect was due to the accumulation of organic matter (C-org) within the mounds. Microbial activity was increased in M. scabrinodis mounds only. Available N-min was accumulated in all mound types, independent of the feeding mode of the ants, with Lasius mounds having significantly higher N-min content than M. scabrinodis mounds. It is hypothesised that the differences between the mound types are due to differences in nest architecture, especially the integration of grassy vegetation. Higher microbial activity in M. scabrinodis mounds may be a consequence of supplementary energy provided by root exudates. The amount of N-min in M. scabrinodis mounds may be reduced by increased plant uptake and by immobilisation within the microbial biomass. (C) 2001 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB In forested ecosystems, insects and pathogens play an important role in ecosystem function, and there is increasing evidence that these organisms are primary determinants of forest structure and composition. Recent research has confirmed this even in sub-boreal forests, where fire was traditionally thought to be the major agent of disturbance and hence the main driver of successional processes. This paper presents a conceptual model of biotic disturbance ecology in sub-boreal forests of central B.C. We also describe how forest management practices can lead to forest health problems by disrupting these ecological processes, and the natural population dynamics of insects and pathogens.

AB We assessed density- and distance-dependence in herbivore effects and juvenile condition for four species of Shorea, the most speciose genus in the dominant canopy family of southeast Asian rain forest trees (Dipterocarpaceae). Herbivore damage was quantified as partial leaf loss on young leaves, and whole plant foliar condition as the product of the fraction of leaf nodes containing leaves and the fraction of tissue remaining on extant leaves. Adults of the four species were centers of high total, as well as conspecific, density of juveniles(<1 m tall). For two species, S. hopeifolia and S. pinanga, herbivore damage declined significantly with distance, decreasing by 40% and 51% respectively, between 5 m and 35 m from the parent. For the same two species, foliar condition improved significantly between 5 m and 35 m, increasing by 45% for S. hopeifolia and 24% for S. pinanga. If foliar condition influences juvenile survival and growth, more widely dispersed seeds of these species are more likely to recruit to the canopy. In contrast, there was no significant distance-dependence for S. parvifolia or S. longisperma. Among species, herbivore damage was greatest in those species with greatest local juvenile abundances, i.e., those with highest densities, leaf size, juvenile foliar mass and/or foliar mass/m(2) ground area, but was unrelated to the toughness of mature leaves. However, distance was a better predictor of herbivore damage than was conspecific juvenile density, as evaluated by backward elimination regressions, for both S. hopeifolia and S. pinanga. For foliar condition, the best predictor was distance for S. pinanga, but conspecific density for S. hopeifolia, whose juveniles were smallest and occurred at the highest densities. Total juvenile density (all woody plants) was eliminated as a factor in all cases. The species-specificity of effects (i.e., their dependence on conspecific distance or density), together with the marked differences among congeneric species, caution against generalizations regarding distance-dependent effects in diverse forests.

We studied three such species in the montane rainforest in southeastern Brazil.  Abutilon rufinerve, A. regnellii and A. aff. regnellii present the following combination of ornithophilous and chiropterophilous features:  bell to bowl-shaped flowers lasting about 30 h, coloured pinkish to purplish, or yellowish, crepuscular (dusk or dawn) anthesis, and very faint cabbage odour.  The flowers are visited and pollinated by a species of phyllostomid bat at night, and by several species of hummingbirds during the day.  Although somewhat intermediate between ornithophily and chiropterophily, the floral features of the three species of Abutilon tend towards the bat-pollination syndrome.

AB This field study examined competition for space among encrusting bryozoans on artificial panel substrata used to simulate the habitat found on the undersides of boulders. In all 1761 interactions were analysed, involving 16 species of cheilostomes (genera Callopora, Celleporella, Cribrilina, Electra, Escharella, Escharoides, Haplopoma, Membraniporella, Microporella, Phaeostachys, Schizomavella, Schizoporella and Umbonula) and two ctenostome genera (Alcyonidium and Flustrellidra). Neither absolutely transitive nor intransitive arrangements of competitive outcome occurred among the species. Instead, the high incidence of 'ties' and reversals of outcome produced a network-like arrangement. In terms of outcome alone Escharoides coccinea (Abildgaard), Membraniporella nitida (Johnston) and Schizoporella unicornis (Johnston in Wood) were apparently 'overgrowth dominants', Alcyonidium spp. and Cribrilina cryptooecium Norman were 'intermediate dominants' and Callopora lineata (L.), Callopora craticula (Alder), Celleporella hyalina (L.) and Electra pilosa (L.) were 'inferior competitors' for space. The effects of four variables on the outcome of specific competitive encounters were assessed in detail and included (i) the identity of the colony encountered, (ii) the angle of contact between the competing colonies, (iii) the location (two sites, on both the east and west coasts of Scotland) and (iv) the year (1983, 1984). Models incorporating these variables were developed, using the Generalized Linear Interactive Modelling System (GLIM), to examine their influence on the outcome of bryozoan encounters. All of these factors contributed to explaining the considerable variability in the outcome of competitive interactions. The species were not, however, affected equally by all the variables, although encounter angle and year were significant for dominants and encounter angle, site and year all were significant for intermediate species.

AB Background and aims Ancient Amazon soils are characterised by low concentrations of soil phosphorus (P). Therefore, it is hypothesised that plants may invest a substantial proportion of their resources belowground to adjust their P-uptake strategies, including root morphological, physiological (phosphatase enzyme activities) and biotic (arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations) adaptations. Since these strategies are energy demanding, we hypothesise that trade-offs between morphological traits and root phosphatase exudation and symbiotic associations would occur. Specifically, we expected that plants which invest in finer roots, and therefore have greater ability to explore large soil volumes, would have a high investment in physiological adaptations such as enhanced phosphatase production. In contrast, we expected that plants with predominantly thicker roots would invest more in symbiotic associations, in which carbon is traded for P acquired from AM fungal communities. Methods We collected absorptive roots (<2 mm diameter) from a lowland Central Amazon forest near Manaus, Brazil. We measured fine root diameter, specific root length (SRL), specific root area (SRA), root tissue density (RTD), root phosphatase activity (APase) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi colonisation. Results Root morphological traits were related to APase activity, with higher APase activity in roots with higher SRL and SRA but lower RTD. However, the degree of AM colonisation was not related to any measured root morphological trait. Conclusions Fine absorptive roots likely benefit from having low RTD, high SRL, SRA and APase exudation to acquire P efficiently. However, because AM colonisation was not related to root morphology, we suggest that investment in multiple P-uptake strategies is required for maintaining productivity in Central Amazon forests.

AB Invasive pant species (invaders hereafter) have notable effects on the structure and functions of native ecosystems. Plant functional diversity plays a more important role than plant taxonomic diversity in driving ecosystem processes. Moreover, landscape heterogeneity in urban ecosystems may lead to a significant variation in the invasion process. Thus, it is important to evaluate the effects of invaders invasion on the taxonomic and functional diversity of native communities across different types of urban ecosystems to better understand the mechanism underlying successful invasion, especially in heterogeneous landscapes in urban ecosystems. This study aims to determine the effects of an invader Canada goldenrod (Solidago canadensis L.) on the taxonomic and functional diversity of native communities by using a comparative study in nine types of urban ecosystems in East China. Canada goldenrod and coexisting natives tend to functionally converge in all urban ecosystem types. Thus, differences in the functional traits between Canada goldenrod and coexisting natives support the habitat filtering hypothesis. Canada goldenrod invasion did not significantly affect the taxonomic diversity of plant communities. Most of the functional diversity indices of plant communities significantly increased under Canada goldenrod invasion. The increased values of some functional diversity of plant communities under Canada goldenrod invasion may cause an promotion in the utilization of resources at the interspecific degree rely largely on the niche complementarity effects. The relative abundance of Canada goldenrod was positively correlated with various indexes of functional diversity of plant communities (including some of community-weighted means, Rao's quadratic entropy, and Mason alpha functional diversity), rather than taxonomic diversity of plant communities. Thus, the invasibility of plant community may be more closely associated with functional diversity than taxonomic diversity of plant communities. Specifically, the invasibility of plant community from the invaded area reached a maximum in traffic land among the nine types of urban ecosystems because of it's higher plant functional diversity. The higher plant functional diversity is supported by a highly heterogeneous landscape structure and creates a great variety of ecological conditions for plants mainly caused by anthropogenic land use. Overall, landscape heterogeneity in urban ecosystems can obviously increase the invasion degree of invaders via shifts in the functional diversity of plant communities.

AB Toxicants have both sub-lethal and lethal effects on aquatic biota, influencing organism fitness and community composition. However, toxicant effects within ecosystems may be altered by interactions with abiotic and biotic ecosystem components, including biological interactions. Collectively, this generates the potential for toxicant sensitivity to be highly context dependent, with significantly different outcomes in ecosystems than laboratory toxicity tests predict. We experimentally manipulated stream macroinvertebrate communities in 32 mesocosms to examine how communities from a low-salinity site were influenced by interactions with those from a high-salinity site along a gradient of salinity. Relative to those from the low-salinity site, organisms from the high-salinity site were expected to have greater tolerance and fitness at higher salinities. This created the potential for both salinity and tolerant-sensitive organism interactions to influence communities. We found that community composition was influenced by both direct toxicity and tolerant-sensitive organism interactions. Taxon and context-dependent responses included: (i) direct toxicity effects, irrespective of biotic interactions; (ii) effects that were owing to the addition of tolerant taxa, irrespective of salinity; (iii) toxicity dependent on sensitive-tolerant taxa interactions; and (iv) toxic effects that were increased by interactions. Our results reinforce that ecological processes require consideration when examining toxicant effects within ecosystems.

AB 1. In the Mediterranean Sea, dense populations of the gorgonian Paramuricea clavata shape marine animal forests, characterizing the seascapes of coralligenous habitats. Despite concerns for its health, with several anthropogenic threats and recent mass mortality events, mainly triggered by thermal anomalies, the understorey of its forests and the ecological processes that they promote are still little known. Here, the abundance and composition of epibenthic assemblages inside and outside P. clavata forests were investigated across the central and western Mediterranean Sea, by applying a multifactorial sampling design. 2. In spite of the large variability in the structures of epibenthic assemblages at local and regional scales, the gorgonian understoreys share some common features, such as higher abundances of calcareous builder organisms and reduced invasion by the non-indigenous alga Caulerpa cylindracea, compared with the adjacent unforested rocky bottoms. Paramuricea clavata showed non-linear density-dependent relationships with algal turfs and non-encrusting algae belonging to the genus Peyssonnelia. Moreover, by entrapping benthic mucilaginous aggregates with their branches, these gorgonians risk topical necrotic lesions, but may reduce the suffocation risks for understorey organisms. 3. Overall, P. clavata forests may enhance bioconstruction processes and increase resistance and resilience of the benthic assemblages in the Mediterranean coralligenous habitats. This species and its forests, together with their understoreys, should be considered as essential elements of the ecology of the Mediterranean Sea, and therefore worthy of specific and effective protection measures. 4. Conservation strategies should reduce the risk of mechanical damage by regulating fishing activities, anchorages, and scuba diving where gorgonian forests are present. Moreover, when evident alterations are documented, restoration actions should be implemented to recover the integrity of gorgonian forests.

AB Drought and nutrient deficiency are the principal factors limiting crop production in arid and semi-arid areas. Conservation tillage can maintain and increase grain yields by enhancing soil fertility and conserving more soil water in the field. However, farmers without access to mineral fertilizers cannot compensate for the soil nutrient deficiencies for crop production, and the crops will suffer yield reductions. Site-specific fertilizer application with conservation tillage practice management is the key to achieving a high and sustainable crop yield. A longterm (2007-2016) two-factor, spilt-plot experiment was established to assess the effects of fertilization {balanced fertilization (BF), low fertilization (LF), conventional fertilization (CF)} and conservation tillage practices {no tillage (NT), subsoiling (ST), conventional tillage (CT)} on grain yield, soil water and soil nutrients. The aim of this experiment was to select an optimal fertilization and tillage management system for crop production in the Loess Plateau, a typical semi-arid and rainfed area of China. Ten-year data showed that subsoiling with balanced fertilization (BST) increased the grain (6465 kg ha(-1)) and straw yield (9792 kg ha(-1)), but no tillage with balanced fertilization (BNT) was observed to provide the highest economic profit for farmers (6416 yuan ha(-1)). No tillage with low fertilization (LNT) was the optimal management for soil water conservation in fields that could preserve more soil water in fallow land (mean value: 425 mm) and provide more soil water during the wheat (mean value: 387 mm) and maize (mean value: 420 mm) growth season. The LNT consumed less soil water in the crop growth season (mean value: 105.4 mm), but the BST (18.5 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) showed a higher water use efficiency (WUE). The BF and NT showed better soil nutrient conditions (soil organic matter(SOM), available N, P and K) over the ten years and provided better soil water and balanced soil nutrient conditions for crop growth. The BNT and BST were recommended as the optimal and economic fertilization with tillage management systems for maintaining high grain yields by using soil water efficiently and enhancing soil fertility in a winter wheat-spring maize rotation on the Loess Plateau.

AB The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) has been a central topic in ecology for more than 20 years. While experimental and theoretical studies have produced much knowledge of how biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning, it remains poorly understood how habitat fragmentation affects the BEF relationship.
   To develop a framework that connects habitat fragmentation to the BEF relationship from a landscape perspective.
   We reviewed the literature on habitat fragmentation, BEF, and related fields, and developed a framework to analyze how habitat fragmentation affects the BEF relationship through altering biodiversity, environmental conditions, and both, based on the pattern-process-scale perspective in landscape ecology.
   Our synthesis of the literature suggests that habitat fragmentation can alter BEF relationship through several processes. First, habitat fragmentation causes the non-random loss of species that make major contributions to ecosystem functioning (decreasing sampling effect), and reduces mutualistic interactions (decreasing complementarity effects) regardless of the changes in species richness. Second, environmental conditions within patches and ecological flows among patches vary significantly with the degree of fragmentation, which potentially contributes to and modulates the BEF relationship.
   Habitat fragmentation can affect the BEF relationship directly by altering community composition, as well as indirectly by changing environmental conditions within and among habitat patches on both local and landscape levels. The BEF relationship obtained from small plots and over short time periods may not fully represent that in real landscapes that are fragmented, dynamic, and continuously influenced by myriad human activities on different scales in time and space.

AB Tailings are artificial soil-forming substrates that have not been created by the natural processes of soil formation and weathering. The extreme pH environment and corresponding low availability of some macro-and micronutrients in alkaline tailings, coupled with hostile physical and geochemical conditions, present a challenging environment to native biota. Some significant nutritional constraints to ecosystem reconstruction on alkaline tailings include i) predominant or complete absence of combined nitrogen (N) and poor soil N retention; ii) the limited bioavailability of some micronutrients at high soil pH (e.g., Mn, Fe, Zn and Cu); and iii) potentially toxic levels of biologically available soil phosphorus (P) for P-sensitive plants. The short regulatory time frames (years) for mine closure on tailings landforms are at odds with the long time required for natural pedogenic processes to ameliorate these factors (thousands of years). However, there are similarities between the chemical composition and nutrient status of alkaline tailings and the poorly-developed, very young calcareous soils of biodiverse regions such as southwestern Australia. We propose that basic knowledge of chronosequences that start with calcareous soils may provide an informative model for understanding the pedogenic processes required to accelerate soil formation on tailings. Development of a functional, stable root zone is crucial to successful ecological restoration on tailings, and three major processes should be facilitated as early as possible during processing or in the early stages of restoration to accelerate soil development on alkaline tailings: i) acidification of the upper tailings profile; ii) establishment of appropriate and resilient microbial communities; and iii) the early development of appropriate pioneer vegetation. Achieving successful ecological restoration outcomes on tailings landforms is likely one of the greatest challenges faced by restoration ecologists and the mining industry, and successful restoration on alkaline tailings likely depends upon careful management of substrate chemical conditions by targeted amendments.

AB Agricultural producer participation and spatial coordination of land use decisions are key components for enhancing the effective delivery of ecosystem services from private land. However, inducing participation in Payment for Ecosystem Services schemes for coordinating land management choices is challenging from a policy design perspective owing to transaction costs associated with participation. This paper employs a laboratory experiment to investigate the impact of such costs on participation and land use in the context of an Agglomeration Bonus (AB) scheme. The AB creates a coordination game with multiple Nash equilibria related to alternative spatially-coordinated land use patterns. The experiment varies transaction costs between two levels (high and low), which affects the risks and payoffs of coordinating on the different equilibria. Additionally, an option to communicate is implemented between neighbors arranged on a local network to facilitate spatial coordination. Results indicate a significant difference in participation and performance under high and low transaction costs, with lower uptake and performance when transaction costs are high. These effects are, however, impacted by transaction costs faced in the past Communication improves both AB participation rates and performance with the effect being greater for participants facing high transaction costs.

AB Plant biomass consumers (mammalian herbivory and fire) are increasingly seen as major drivers of ecosystem structure and function but the prevailing paradigm in temperate forest ecology is still that their dynamics are mainly bottom-up resource-controlled. Using conceptual advances from savanna ecology, particularly the demographic bottleneck model, we present a novel view on temperate forest dynamics that integrates consumer and resource control.
   We used a fully factorial experiment, with varying levels of ungulate herbivory and resource (light) availability, to investigate how these factors shape recruitment of five temperate tree species. We ran simulations to project how inter-and intraspecific differences in height increment under the different experimental scenarios influence long-term recruitment of tree species.
   Strong herbivore-driven demographic bottlenecks occurred in our temperate forest system, and bottlenecks were as strong under resource-rich as under resource-poor conditions. Increased browsing by herbivores in resource-rich patches strongly counteracted the increased escape strength of saplings in these patches.
   This finding is a crucial extension of the demographic bottleneck model which assumes that increased resource availability allows plants to more easily escape consumer-driven bottlenecks. Our study demonstrates that a more dynamic understanding of consumer-resource interactions is necessary, where consumers and plants both respond to resource availability.

AB Forest degradation is the long-term and gradual reduction of canopy cover due to forest fire and unsustainable logging. A critical consequence of this process is increased atmospheric carbon emissions. Although this issue is gaining attention, forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon has not yet been properly addressed. The claim here is that this process is not constant throughout Amazonia and varies according to colonization frontiers. Moreover, the accurate characterization of degradation requires lengthy observation periods to track gradual forest changes. The forest degradation process, the associated timeframe, spatial patterns, trajectories, and extent were characterized in the context of the Amazon frontiers of the 1990s using 28 years (1984-2011) of annual Landsat images. Given the large database and the characteristic of logging and burning, this study used data mining techniques and cell approach classification to analyze the spatial patterns and to construct associated trajectories. Multi-temporal analysis indicated that forest degradation in the last two decades has caused as many interannual landscape changes as have clear-cuts. In addition, selective logging, as a major aspect of forest degradation, affected a larger amount of forest land than did forest fire. Although a large proportion of logged forest was deforested in the following years, selective logging did not always precede complete deforestation. Instead, the results indicate that logged forests were abandoned for approximately 4 years before clearance. Throughout the forest degradation process, there were no recurrent forest fires, and loggers did not revisit the forest. Forest degradation mostly occurred as a result of a single selective logging event and was associated with low-intensity forest damage.

AB Cloud cover is the main limitation of using remote sensing to study Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change, and Land Surface Temperature (1ST) in tropical area like Malaysia. In order to study LULC change and its effect on LST, the Landsat images were utilized within Geographical Information System (GIS) with the aim of removing the effect of cloud cover and image's gaps on the Digital Number (DN) of the pixels. 5356 points according to pixels coordinate which represent the 960 m to 960 m area were created in GIS environment and matched with thermal bands of the study area in remote sensing environment. The DNs of these points were processed to extract 1ST and imported in GIS environment to derive the temperature maps. Temperature was found to be generally higher in 2010 than in 2000. The comparison of the highest temperature area in the temperature maps with ground stations data showed that the topographical characteristics of the area, and the wind speed, and direction influence the occurrence of Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. This study concludes that integration of remote sensing data and GIS is a useful tool in urban LST detection in tropical area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Amazon Basin is a region of global importance for the carbon and hydrological cycles, a biodiversity hotspot, and a potential centre for future economic development. The region is also a major source of water vapour recycled into continental precipitation through evapotranspiration processes. This review applies an ecohydrological approach to Amazonia's water cycle by looking at contributions of water resources in the context of future agricultural production. At present, agriculture in the region is primarily rain-fed and relies almost exclusively on green-water resources (soil moisture regenerated by precipitation). Future agricultural development, however, will likely follow pathways that include irrigation from blue-water sources (surface water and groundwater) as insurance from variability in precipitation. In this review, we first provide an updated summary of the green-blue ecohydrological framework before describing past trends in Amazonia's water resources within the context of land use and land cover change. We then describe green- and blue-water trade-offs in light of future agricultural production and potential irrigation to assess costs and benefits to terrestrial ecosystems, particularly land and biodiversity protection, and regional precipitation recycling. Management of green water is needed, particularly at the agricultural frontier located in the headwaters of major tributaries to the Amazon River, and home to key downstream blue-water users and ecosystem services, including domestic and industrial users, as well as aquatic ecosystems.

AB The phenomenon of distinct, absent or indistinct growth rings is a highly variable feature used for wood identification and a wide range of tree-ring studies. Causes for its variability are not yet fully understood. There is also a lack of consensus within the scientific community about how distinct and indistinct tree rings should be defined and classified. We use a selection of 103 Central African rainforest trees to analyse the anatomy of growth-ring boundaries of 103 Central African rainforest species and assessed the influence of the climate, tree organ and leaf shedding behaviour on growth-ring distinctness and anatomy. We observed a high variability of tree-ring boundaries anatomy and distinctness within and among individuals and species. Although, for some semi-deciduous species, higher incidence of distinct growth rings appears to be related with a more pronounced seasonal climate, no general trends are observed for the assembly of studied species. Growth rings are variable within individuals depending on the considered organ: trunks tend to show more distinct rings than branches. Growth-ring distinctness is difficult to implement as a trait to measure tree performance when only based on abrupt changes in fibre size and cell wall thickness. From the potential growth-ring markers identified in the IAWA list of hardwood features, those applying to vessel and parenchyma density and distended rays appear to be more useful in tropical trees than abruptly flattened latewood fibres or abrupt changes in vessel diameter.

AB Advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) technology have provided the tools to comprehensively and accurately characterize the microbial community in the respiratory tract in health and disease. The presence of commensal and pathogenic bacteria has been found to have important effects on the lung immune system. Until relatively recently, the lung has received less attention compared to other body sites in terms of microbiome characterization, and its study carries special technological difficulties related to obtaining reliable samples as compared to other body niches. Additionally, the complexity of the alveolar immune system, and its interactions with the lung microbiome, are only just beginning to be understood. Amidst this complexity sits Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), one of humanity's oldest nemeses and a significant public health concern, with millions of individuals infected with Mtb worldwide. The intricate interactions between Mtb, the lung microbiome, and the alveolar immune system are beginning to be understood, and it is increasingly apparent that improved treatment of Mtb will only come through deep understanding of the interplay between these three forces. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the lung microbiome, alveolar immunity, and the interaction of each with Mtb. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Our understanding of the principal controls on litter decomposition is critical for our capacity to predict how global changes will impact terrestrial ecosystems. Although climate, litter quality and soil organisms clearly modulate carbon (C) and nutrient turnover, land-use change affecting plant species composition and structure can alter the relative importance of such controls. We took advantage of prior land-use changes of intentional planting of exotic forest species along a broad precipitation gradient [250-2200mm mean annual precipitation (MAP)] in Patagonia, South America, where we established five paired sites in natural vegetation and adjacent 35-year-old pine plantations. We explored direct and interactive effects of precipitation and plant community structure on litter decomposition with insitu decomposition, common litters and reciprocal transplants, in addition to an evaluation of microenvironmental changes. Surface litter decomposition in natural vegetation (NV) was similar in all sites along the gradient, independent of litter quality, MAP or soil characteristics, while mass loss demonstrated a significant positive linear relationship with MAP in pine plantations (PP). Decomposition of common litters in PP was markedly reduced with respect to NV, which was > 50% faster at the arid extreme of the gradient. C:N ratios predicted decomposition only in PP, and differences in decomposition were highly correlated with impacts of vegetative cover on incident solar radiation.Synthesis. Concurrent changes in plant cover in NV with increasing MAP resulted in reduced incident solar radiation at the soil surface and decreased the relative importance of photodegradation as a control on surface mass loss. These changes eclipsed direct effects of water availability, litter quality and soil nutrients. In contrast, increased shade and recalcitrant litter with afforestation in PP sites combined such that photodegradation was entirely eliminated as a control and biotic decomposition was much reduced. While afforestation projects are promoted as a strategy to mitigate increased atmospheric carbon dioxide due to human activity, our results highlight that primary controls of litter decomposition were substantially altered with unexpected consequences for the C balance of these ecosystems.

AB The global oceans contribute to human wellbeing by providing marine ecosystermservices, but the ability of the oceans to continue providing these services is jeopardised by anthropogenic impacts. There is a limit to marine conservation that has not been adequately addressed: finance. This paper reviews the state of marine conservation funding, identifies associated challenges, and recommends possible ways forward. We identify five challenges: 1) funding for marine conservation is inadequate in terms of the size, duration, and diversity of revenue, 2) finance mechanisms are under-developed and under-utilised, 3) finance is often disconnected from conservation planning, 4) the environmental side-effects of economic activity increase the gap in global conservation funding, and 5) few individuals and programmes specialise in marine conservation finance and integrate its disparate lines of thinking. We then propose five solutions: 1) financial strategies for marine conservation, 2) increased research on and development of finance mechanisms, 3) integration of financial planning into conservation planning, 4) engagement of businesses in reducing the gap in conservation funding for marine ecosystems, and 5) definition, focus, and specialists for the emerging field of marine conservation finance. Multi-sector and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to reduce the marine conservation-funding gap and sustain marine ecosystem services. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated how legal logging history and recent illegal logging affected forest bird community structure in Ghana. Ghanaian forests belong to West Africa's highly fragmented Upper Guinea rain forests, part of a global priority "biodiversity hotspot" under intense pressure from anthropogenic degradation. Between 1995 and 2010, officially-reported legal logging intensities increased up to similar to 600%, while illegal logging, which now accounts for 80% of timber extraction in Ghana, has driven logging intensities to similar to 6 times greater than the maximum sustainable rate. We collected data in 2008-2010 and used a comparable dataset collected in 1993-1995 to assess impacts of recent logging on understory bird communities in large forest fragments (100-524 km(2)) in southwest Ghana. Forest understory bird species abundance declined by >50% during this period. Species richness also showed declining trends. Whereas analysis based on data collected in 1993-1995 estimated a partial post-logging recovery of the understory bird community at that time, data from 2008-2010 showed no indication of post,logging recovery, likely due to ongoing illegal logging following intensive legal logging operations. Forest generalist species and sallying insectivores declined significantly in logged compared to unlogged forests. These severe declines of Upper Guinea forest understory birds indicate the rapidly deteriorating conservation status of a biodiversity hotspot and could signal collapsing ecosystem processes. Immediate conservation actions are urgently required to protect surviving forest fragments from further degradation and avian declines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Current theoretical studies on mechanisms promoting species co-existence in diverse communities assume that species are fixed in their mating behavior. Each species is a discrete evolutionary unit, even though most empirical evidence indicates that inter-specific gene flow occurs in plant and animal groups. Here, in a data-driven meta-community model of species co-existence, we allow mating behavior to respond to local species composition and abundance. While individuals primarily out-cross, species maintain a diminished capacity for selfing and hybridization. Mate choice is treated as a variable behavior, which responds to intrinsic traits determining mate choice and the density and availability of sympatric inter-fertile individuals. When mate choice is strongly limited, even low survivorship of selfed offspring can prevent extinction of rare species. With increasing mate choice, low hybridization success rates maintain community level diversity for extended periods of time. In high diversity tropical tree communities, competition among sympatric congeneric species is negligible, because direct spatial proximity with close relatives is infrequent. Therefore, the genomic donorship presents little cost. By incorporating variable mating behavior into evolutionary models of diversification, we also discuss how participation in a syngameon may be selectively advantageous. We view this behavior as a genomic mutualism, where maintenance of genomic structure and diminished inter-fertility, allows each species in the syngameon to benefit from a greater effective population size during episodes of selective disadvantage. Rare species would play a particularly important role in these syngameons as they are more likely to produce heterospecific crosses and transgressive phenotypes. We propose that inter-specific gene flow can play a critical role by allowing genomic mutualists to avoid extinction and gain local adaptations.

AB In the field, leaves may face very different light intensities within the tree canopy. Leaves usually respond with light-induced morphological and photosynthetic changes, in a phenomenon known as phenotypic plasticity. Canopy light distribution, leaf anatomy, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and pigment composition were investigated in an olive (Olea europaea, cvs. Arbequina and Arbosana) orchard planted with a high-density system (1,250 trees ha(-1)). Sampling was made from three canopy zones: a lower canopy (< 1 m), a central one (1-2 m), and an upper one (> 2 m). Light interception decreased significantly in the lower canopy when compared to the central and top ones. Leaf angle increased and photosynthetic rates and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) decreased significantly and progressively from the upper canopy to the central and the lower canopies. The largest leaf areas were found in the lower canopy, especially in the cultivar Arbequina. The palisade and spongy parenchyma were reduced in thickness in the lower canopy when compared to the upper one, in the former due to a decrease in the number of cell layers from three to two (clearly distinguishable in the light and fluorescence microscopy images). In both cultivars, the concentration of violaxanthin-cycle pigments and beta-carotene was higher in the upper than in the lower canopy. Furthermore, the de-epoxidized forms zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin increased significantly in those leaves from the upper canopy, in parallel to the NPQ increases. In conclusion, olive leaves react with morphological and photosynthetic changes to within-crown light gradients. These results strengthen the idea of olive trees as "modular organisms" that adjust the modules morphology and physiology in response to light intensity.

AB I highlight new and emerging threats to tropical forests, the world's most biologically diverse ecosystems. The drivers of tropical forest destruction and key perils to biodiversity have changed over the past decade and will continue to evolve in the future. Industrial drivers of forest conversion, such as logging, large-scale soy and cattle farming, oil-palm plantations, and oil and gas development, have escalated in importance, buoyed by rapid globalization, economic growth, and rising standards of living in developing nations. Biofuels are likely to grow rapidly as a driver of future forest destruction. Climate change is similarly emerging as a potentially serious driver of change in the tropics, and many species, including certain amphibians, primates, and plants, are being harmed by emerging pathogens.. In general, old-growth forests are vanishing rapidly and being replaced by fragmented, secondary, and selectively logged forests, particularly in impoverished tropical countries. Road expansion continues apace and is increasingly imperiling the world's last tropical frontiers. Human population growth, especially in developing nations, remains an important underlying threat to forests. These various environmental dangers often operate in concert, magnifying their impacts and posing an even greater threat to tropical forests and their biodiversity.

AB The analysis of soil phosphorus (P) in fractions of different plant availability is a common approach to characterize the P status of forest soils. However, quantification of organic and inorganic P fractions in different extracts is labor intensive and therefore rarely applied for large sample numbers. Therefore, we examined whether different P fractions can be predicted using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
   We used the Hedley sequential extraction method (modified by Tiessen and Moir, 2008) with increasingly strong extractants to determine P in fractions of different plant availability and measured near-infrared (NIR) spectra for soil samples from sites of the German forest soil inventory and from a nature reserve in southeastern China.
   The R-2 of NIRS calibrations to predict P in individual Hedley fractions ranged between 0.08 and 0.85. When these fractions were combined into labile, moderately labile and stable P pools, R-2 of calibration models was between 0.38 and 0.88 (all significant). Model prediction quality was higher for organic than for inorganic P fractions and increased with the homogeneity of soil properties in soil sample sets. Useable models were obtained for samples originating from one soil type in subtropical China, whereas prediction models for sample sets from a range of soil types in Germany were only moderately useable or not useable.
   Our results indicate that prediction of Hedley P fractions with NIRS can be a promising approach to replace conventional analysis, if models are developed for sets of soil samples with similar physical and chemical properties, e.g., from the same soil type or study site.

AB Habitat availability-or how much habitat species can reach at the landscape scale-depends primarily on the percentage of native cover. However, attributes of landscape configuration such as the number, size and isolation of habitat patches may have complementary effects on habitat availability, with implications for the management of landscapes. Here, we determined whether, and at which percentages of native cover, the number, size and isolation of patches contribute for habitat availability. We quantified habitat availability in 325 landscapes spread across the state of Rio de Janeiro, in the Atlantic Forest hotspot, with either high (>50 %), intermediate (50-30 %), low (30-10 %) or very low (<10 %) percentage of native cover, and for six hypothetical species differing in inter-patch dispersal ability. Above 50 % of native cover, the percentage of cover per se was the only determinant of habitat availability, but below 50 % the attributes of landscape configuration also contributed for habitat availability. The number of patches had a negative effect on habitat availability in landscapes with 50-10 % of native cover, whereas patch size had a positive effect in landscapes with <10 % of native cover. The different species generally responded to the same set of landscape attributes, although to different extents, potentially facilitating decision making for conservation. In landscapes with >50 % of native cover, conservation actions are probably sufficient to guarantee habitat availability, whereas in the remaining landscapes additional restoration efforts are needed, especially to reconnect and/or enlarge remaining habitat patches.

AB Riparian forests provide important habitat for many wildlife species and are sensitive to landscape change. Among terrestrial invertebrates, dung beetles have been used to investigate the effects of environmental disturbances on forest structure and diversity. Since many studies demonstrated a negative response of dung beetle communities to increasing forest fragmentation, and that most dung beetle species had a more pronounced occurrence during warmest seasons, three hypotheses were tested: (1) Scarabaeinae richness, abundance, diversity and evenness are lower in thinner riparian zone widths than in wider widths during the warmest seasons; (2) Scarabaeinae richness and abundance are positively influenced by leaf litter coverage and height and canopy cover; and (3) Scarabaeinae composition varies with the reduction in riparian vegetation and among annual seasons. We selected four fragments with different riparian zone widths in three secondary streams in southern Brazil. In each fragment, four sampling periods were carried out seasonally between spring 2010 and winter 2011. We collected dung beetles using pitfall traps with two types of bait. We collected 1289 specimens distributed among 29 species. In spring and summer, dung beetle richness was higher in fragments with the widest riparian zone than in those with a thinner riparian zone, and it did not vary between fragments in fall and winter seasons. Dung beetle abundance did not differ among fragments with different riparian zone widths, but it was higher in spring and summer than fall and winter. Richness and abundance were positively influenced by leaf litter. While dung beetle diversity was higher in fragments with wider riparian zone widths than in those with thinner widths, the evenness was similar among fragments. Dung beetle composition differed between the fragments with the widest and thinnest riparian zones, and it also varied among the seasons. Our results suggest that decreased riparian zones affect negatively to dung beetle community structure in southern Brazil. Fragments with thinner riparian zones had lower beetle richness in warmest seasons and an altered community composition. In this sense, the dung beetles are potentially good indicators of riparian forest fragmentation since some species were indicators of a particular riparian zone width. From a conservation perspective, our results demonstrate that the new Brazilian Forest Code will greatly jeopardize not only the terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity of these ecosystems, but also countless other ecological functions.

AB A focus of ecology is to determine drivers of community assembly. Here, we investigate effects of immigration and species sorting (environmental selection) on structuring aquatic bacterial communities in both colonised and previously uncolonised environments. We used nonsterilised and presterilised water from three chemically distinct ponds to establish microcosms, which were opened for 12, 24, 48, 96 or 167h and then closed again to allow airborne bacterial immigration and subsequent succession. Community similarity, richness, evenness and the parameters of a neutral model were investigated after 167h. Immigration appeared to govern the assembly of communities in the presterilised water as there were no significant differences in evenness among microcosm communities containing water from each pond. Statistical estimation of neutral model parameters confirmed these findings, because the estimated immigration rate changed significantly with time of exposure to immigration. Species sorting also occurred because significant differences in community similarity (for presterilised and nonsterilised communities) and evenness (only for nonsterilised communities) were detected among microcosms containing different pond water; the magnitude of these differences was greater for communities in nonsterilised microcosms. Our study provides evidence for both processes being important during the colonisation of aquatic environments and presents a novel way to apply the neutral model.

AB A seasonal period of water deficit characterizes tropical dry forests (TDFs). There, sympatric tree species exhibit a diversity of growth rates, functional traits, and responses to drought, suggesting that each species may possess different strategies to grow under different conditions of water availability. The evaluation of the long-term growth responses to changes in the soil water balance should provide an understanding of how and when coexisting tree species respond to water deficit in TDFs. Furthermore, such differential growth responses may be linked to functional traits related to water storage and conductance. We used dendrochronology and climate data to retrospectively assess how the radial growth of seven coexisting deciduous tree species responded to the seasonal soil water balance in a Bolivian TDF. Linear mixed-effects models were used to quantify the relationships between basal area increment and seasonal water balance. We related these relationships with wood density and sapwood production to assess if they affect the growth responses to climate. The growth of all species responded positively to water balance during the wet season, but such responses differed among species as a function of their wood density. For instance, species with a strong growth response to water availability averaged a low wood density which may facilitate the storage of water in the stem. By contrast, species with very dense wood were those whose growth was less sensitive to water availability. Coexisting tree species thus show differential growth responses to changes in soil water balance during the wet season. Our findings also provide a link between wood density, a trait related to the ability of trees to store water in the stem, and wood formation in response to water availability.

AB Eucalyptus plantations cover more than 20 Mha worldwide and are almost exclusively monospecific. However, in native forests Eucalyptus species often grow in mixtures. Mixed species stands of trees can be more productive than monospecific stands but despite the implications of this effect, for plantations and native Eucalyptus forests, the effects of mixing eucalypts has received little attention. The aim of this study was to examine whether two species that naturally coexist (Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill and Eucalyptus pilularis Sm.) grow faster in mixtures than their respective monocultures. Monocultures and 1:1 mixtures, and stands of two initial planting densities (1250 and 2500 trees ha(-1)), were used to compare the productivity and stand structures of mixtures and monocultures and to quantify inter- and intra-specific competition. Interactions between these Eucalyptus species increased their relative yields in mixtures by 10-30%. This was associated with changes in stand structure where the diameter distributions of both species became less positively skewed (lower proportions of small trees). Mixing effects were relatively consistent as the stands developed suggesting that if this complementarity effect is used in plantations there is considerable silvicultural flexibility, such that these mixed plantations could be used on both shorter rotations for biomass or pulp-logs as well as longer rotations for solid wood products. This study also suggests that interactions between co-occurring Eucalyptus species in natural forests might actually facilitate individual tree growth, in addition to simply enabling co-existence.

AB Disentangling how communities of soil organisms are deterministically structured by abiotic and biotic factors is of utmost relevance, and few data sets on co-occurrence patterns exist in soil ecology compared to other disciplines. In this study, we assessed species spatial co-occurrence and niche overlap together with the heterogeneity of selected soil properties in a gallery forest (GF) of the Colombian Llanos. We used null-model analysis to test for non-random patterns of species co-occurrence and body size in assemblages of earthworms and whether the pattern observed was the result of environmental heterogeneity or biotic processes structuring the community at small scales by means of co-inertia analysis (CoIA). The results showed that earthworm species co-occurred more frequently than expected by chance at short distances, and CoIA highlighted a significant specific relationship between earthworm species and soil variables. The effect of soil environmental heterogeneity on one litter-feeding species but also the impact of soil-feeding species on soil physical properties was revealed. Correlogram analysis on the first axis extracted in the CoIA showed the scale of the common structure shared by the fauna and soil variable tables. The earthworm community was not deterministically structured by competition and co-occurrence of competing species was facilitated by soil environmental heterogeneity at small scales in the GF. Our results agreed with the coexistence aggregation model which suggests that spatial aggregation of competitors at patchily distributed resources (environment) can facilitate species coexistence.

AB Understanding tree growth in response to rainfall distribution is critical to predicting forest and species population responses to climate change. We investigated inter-annual and seasonal variation in stem diameter by three emergent tree species in a seasonally dry tropical forest in southeast Para, Brazil. Annual diameter growth rates by Swietenia macrophylla demonstrated strong positive correlation with annual rainfall totals during 19972009; Hymenaea courbaril growth rates demonstrated weak positive correlation, whereas Parkia pendula exhibited weak negative correlation. For both Swietenia and Hymenaea, annual diameter growth rates correlated positively and significantly with rainfall totals during the first 6 mo of the growing year (July to December). Vernier dendrometer bands monitored at 4-wk intervals during 35 yr confirmed strong seasonal effects on stem diameter expansion. Individuals of all three species expanded in unison during wet season months and were static or even contracted during dry season months. Stems of the deciduous Swietenia contracted as crowns were shed during the early dry season, expanded slightly as new crowns were flushed, and then contracted further during 35 wk flowering periods in the late dry season by newly mature crowns. The three species physiographic distribution patterns at the study site may partially underlie observed differences in annual and seasonal growth. With most global circulation models predicting conditions becoming gradually drier in southeast Amazonia over the coming decades, species such as Swietenia that perform best on the wet end of current conditions may experience reduced growth rates. However, population viability will not necessarily be threatened if life history and ecophysiological responses to changing conditions are compensatory.

AB Cyclones, which change tree communities and alter forest structure, are thought to have had a significant selective pressure on the flora and fauna of Madagascar. Very little information, however, is available on the actual impact of cyclones on Malagasy ecosystems. On 21 January 2009, Cyclone Fanele made landfall on the western coast of Madagascar with sustained winds of 185 km/h. We examined the immediate effects of the cyclone on tropical dry forest structure in the Kirindy Mitea National Park. In July and August 2009, we measured the height, diameter at breast height (dbh), and damage for 1361 trees in nine 25 x 25 m plots. We found that: (1) over 95 percent of trees experienced some sort of damage, including 8.8 percent mortality; (2) understory and emergent trees experienced significantly higher mortality than canopy trees; and (3) stem density was reduced 9.2 +/- 4.5 percent and biomass was reduced 13.4 +/- 8.1 percent after the cyclone. Dbh was the best predictor of trunk damage and mortality. This extensive alteration of forest structure will have a substantial short- and long-term impact on the biotic communities of western Madagascar.

AB This paper contributes to the debate on the economic and social implications of carbon forestry through the study of 42 programs in Africa using carbon offset payments to fund tree-planting activities. Such projects may be understood as multi-layered collective action problems: growing trees for carbon offsets requires not only international financial incentives to plant trees, but also local institutions to monitor, impose sanctions, and distribute benefits. Consistent with economic theories, large projects appear to realize economies of scale. Contrary to expectations, community-based projects on lower-quality sites often successfully generate and sell offsets, while private for-profit initiatives appear susceptible to collapse.

AB Internationally, there is political impetus towards providing incentive mechanisms, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES), that motivate land users to conserve that which benefits wider society by creating an exchange value for conservation services. PES may incorporate a number of conservation goals other than just maximizing the area under a certain land use, so as to optimize multiple benefits from environmental conservation. Environmental additionality (conservation services generated relative to no intervention) and social equity aspects (here an equitable distribution of conservation funds) of PES depend on the conservation goals underlying the cost-effective targeting of conservation payments, which remains to be adequately explored in the PES literature. This paper attempts to evaluate whether multiple conservation goals can be optimized, in addition to social equity, when paying for the on-farm conservation of neglected crop varieties (landraces), so as to generate agrobiodiversity conservation services. Case studies based on a conservation auction in the Bolivian and Peruvian Andes (through which community-based groups identified the conservation area and the number of farmers taking part in conservation, as well as the payment required), identified significant cost-effectiveness tradeoffs between alternative agrobiodiversity conservation goals. There appears to be a non-complementary relationship between maximizing conservation area under specific landraces (a proxy for genetic diversity maintenance) and the number of farmers conserving such landraces (a proxy for agricultural knowledge and cultural traditions maintenance). Neither of the two are closely connected with maximizing the number of targeted farming communities (a proxy for informal seed exchange networks and hence geneflow maintenance). Optimizing cost-effectiveness with regard to conservation area or number of farmers would also be associated with a highly unequal distribution of payments. Multi-criteria targeting approaches can reach compromise solutions, but frameworks for these are still to be established and scientifically informed about the underlying link between alternative conservation goals and conservation service provision.

AB There is a widespread view that forest plantations with exotic species are green deserts, unable to sustain biodiversity. Few studies have demonstrated, however, that planted stands of exotic trees have a greater negative effect on the plant diversity of savanna vegetation. We compared the native woody flora under four stands of slash pine of about 45 years old with four stands where the previously existing native Cerrado vegetation was preserved and protected from disturbances for the same period, has changed into dense vegetation - the "cerradao", at Assis municipality, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Aiming at understanding the potential ecological filters driving these communities, we assessed air and soil humidity, light availability and classified the native species on the basis of shade tolerance, dispersal syndrome and biomes in which they occur (Atlantic Forest or Cerrado). We recorded an average of 70 (+/- 13) species under pine stands and 54 (+/- 16) species in cerradao. Of the total of 136 species recorded, 78 occurred in both habitats, eight were exclusive to the "cerradao" (shade tolerant and also occurring in forest ecosystems) and 18 were recorded only under pine stands (82% heliophytic, exclusive to the Cerrado biome). Among the functional attributes and abiotic variables analyzed, only light availability explained the floristic differences found. Since richness was higher under pine, we refuted the hypothesis that exotic species constrain the establishment of the native species richness in the understory. On the other hand, the dark environment under the closed-canopy of the "cerradao" acts as a filter inhibiting the establishment of typical Cerrado species. Since pine stands, if managed in long cycle, maintain a reasonable pool of Cerrado endemic species in the understory pine plantations may be a good starting point for savanna restoration.

AB Australians could be willing to pay from $878m to $2b per year for Indigenous people to provide environmental services. This is up to 50 times the amount currently invested by government. This result was derived from a nationwide survey that included a choice experiment in which 70% of the 927 respondents were willing to contribute to a conservation fund that directly pays Indigenous people to carry out conservation activities. Of these the highest values were found for benefits that are likely to improve biodiversity outcomes, carbon emission reductions and improved recreational values. Of the activities that could be undertaken to provide the services, feral animal control attracted the highest level of support followed by coastal surveillance, weed control and fire management. Respondents' decisions to pay were not greatly influenced by the additional social benefits that can arise for Indigenous people spending time on country and providing the services, although there was approval for reduced welfare payments that might arise.

AB 1. Local and regional patterns of plant species richness in tropical rain forests, as well as their possible drivers, remain largely unexplored. The main hypotheses for local species richness (alpha diversity) are (i) local environmental determinism with species-saturated communities, and (ii) regional control, in which the immigration of species from the regional species pool (gamma diversity) determines how many species coexist locally. The species pool hypothesis suggests a combined influence of local and regional drivers on alpha diversity. Differences in gamma diversity may arise from divergent environmental conditions or biogeographic histories.
   2. We investigated the cross-scale determinants of palm alpha and gamma diversity across the western Amazon using a large field-based data set: a census of all palm individuals in 312 transects, totalling 98 species. We used regression-based variation partitioning to understand how habitat, topography and region influence alpha diversity, and correlations to assess the importance of the present environment (climate, soil, regional topography) and history (long-term habitat stability) for average regional alpha diversity and gamma diversity, including the link between these two diversity measures (species pool effect).
   3. Variation in alpha diversity was primarily explained by region (36%) and habitat (18%), whereas the effect of topography was negligible (1%). Within habitats, region was even more important (up to 69% explained variation). Within regions, habitat and topography covaried and had a variable but an important influence. The pure effect of topography remained of minor importance (up to 13%).
   4. Average regional alpha diversity was related to gamma diversity, precipitation seasonality and possibly long-term habitat stability. Gamma diversity was related to long-term habitat stability, and possibly current climate.
   5. Synthesis. Gamma diversity strongly influenced alpha diversity, although a clear influence of local environment was also evident, notably habitat type, with a minor, more geographically variable effect of small-scale topography. Apart from gamma diversity, the factor most strongly related to regional alpha diversity was precipitation seasonality, while gamma diversity itself was strongly linked to long-term habitat stability. These results imply that plant species richness is contingent on both contemporary and historical factors with a strong link between local species richness and the regional species pool.

AB There are few empirical data, particularly collected simultaneously from multiple sites, on extinctions resulting from human-driven land-use change. Southeast Asia has the highest deforestation rate in the world, but the resulting losses of biological diversity remain poorly documented. Between November 2006 and March 2008, we conducted bird surveys on six landbridge islands in Malaysia and Indonesia. These islands were surveyed previously for birds in the early 1900s, when they were extensively forested. Our bird inventories of the islands were nearly complete, as indicated by sampling saturation curves and nonparametric true richness estimators. From zero (Pulau Malawali and Pulau Mantanani) to 15 (Pulau Bintan) diurnal resident landbird species were apparently extirpated since the early 1900s. Adding comparable but published extinction data from Singapore to our regression analyses, we found there were proportionally fewer forest bird extinctions in areas with greater remaining forest cover. Nevertheless, the statistical evidence to support this relationship was weak, owing to our unavoidably small sample size. Bird species that are restricted to the Indomalayan region, lay few eggs, are heavier, and occupy a narrower habitat breadth, were most vulnerable to extinction on Pulau Bintan. This was the only island where sufficient data existed to analyze the correlates of extinction. Forest preservation and restoration are needed on these islands to conserve the remaining forest avifauna. Our study of landbridge islands indicates that deforestation may increasingly threaten Southeast Asian biodiversity.

AB Soil compaction and light availability influence plant growth via different mechanisms. In general, soil compaction has a direct effect on roots, whereas light affects leaves and stems. Although plants in nature are exposed to variable levels of soil compaction and light, no study on the potential mutual interactions of these limiting factors in woody plants has to the authors' knowledge been reported to date. The aim of this work was therefore to elucidate the effects of soil compaction and light availability on growth and biomass allocation in the deciduous oak Quercus pyrenaica. To this end, a study was conducted at two light levels (viz. 3% and 100% of incident light, designated as low-light and high-light, respectively) under a wide range of soil compaction (0.02-3 MPa as penetration resistance) in a greenhouse. Total biomass was found to be positively affected by both light and soil compaction. There was marginally significant interaction between the effects of the two factors on total biomass, which was positively affected by soil compaction only under high-light conditions. Soil compaction had a strong, negative effect on the length of the main root; thus, at maximum soil compaction, such a length was roughly one-half that observed at lower compaction levels. Also, the specific root length of main root (root length to root mass ratio) was reduced by roughly one-half in highly compacted soils. These results suggest that an unfavourable combination of soil compaction and light availability may have severely adverse effects on woody plant performance in drought periods since plants with short roots can hardly access water at deep soil levels. The strength of this effect may be modulated by light availability. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Papua New Guinea (PNG) has become the focus of climate change mitigation initiatives such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, but defensible estimates of forest carbon are lacking. Here we present a methodology for estimating aboveground forest carbon, and apply it to a large Permanent Sample Plot system maintained by Papua New Guinea Forest Research Institute. We report the first estimates of forest carbon in lowland tropical forest in PNG. Average aboveground carbon in stems > 10 cm diam. for 115 selectively harvested 1-ha plots in lowland tropical forest was 66.3 +/- 3.5 Mg C/ha (95% CI) while for 10 primary forest plots the average was 106.3 +/- 16.2 Mg C/ha. We applied ratios based on field observations, in-country studies, and the literature to estimate unmeasured pools of aboveground carbon (stems < 10 cm diam., fine litter and coarse woody debris). Total aboveground carbon was estimated at 90.2 and 120.8 Mg C/ha in selectively harvested and primary lowland forest, respectively. Our estimate for primary tropical forest is lower than biome averages for tropical equatorial forest, and we hypothesize that frequent disturbances from fire, frost, landslides, and agriculture are limiting carbon stock development. The methodology and estimates presented here will assist the PNG government in its preparedness for mitigation initiatives, are of interest to communities that are seeking to participate in voluntary carbon markets, and will encourage transparency and consistency in the estimation of forest carbon.

AB Trait-based resource competition in plants, wherein more similar plants compete more strongly for resources, is a foundation of niche-based explanations for the maintenance of diversity in plant communities. Alternatively, neutral theory predicts that community diversity can be maintained despite equivalent resource requirements among species. We examined interactions at three life history stages (germination, survival, and juvenile-adult growth) for three native and three exotic California annual species in a glasshouse experiment. We varied plant density and species composition in small pots, with pots planted with either intraspecific seeds or in a three species mix of intra- and interspecific neighbors. We saw a range of facilitative, neutral, and competitive interactions that varied significantly by species, rather than by native or exotic status. There were more competitive interactions at the emergence and juvenile-adult growth stages and more facilitative interactions for survival. Consequently, the relative strength of competition in intraspecific versus mixed-species communities depended on whether we considered only the juvenile-adult growth stage or the entire life history of the interacting plants. Using traditional analysis of juvenile-adult growth only, all species showed negative density-dependent interactions for final biomass production. However, when the net effect of plant interactions from seed to adult was considered, which is a prediction of population growth, two native species ceased to show negative density dependence, and the difference between intraspecific and mixed-species competition was only significant for one exotic species. Results were consistent with predictions of neutral, rather than niche, theory for five of six species.

AB Global climate change (GCC) can have profound effects on species whose ecology is governed primarily by climatic factors. The ecology of small mammals inhabiting semiarid Chile is strongly affected by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During La Nina events in this area, dry conditions prevail and species may disappear from the thorn-scrub habitat. Conversely, El Nino events bring high rainfall, and associated pulses of food trigger small-mammal population increases. We used capture-mark-recapture to study responses of the degu (Octodon degus), a dominant small mammal, to variation in rainfall over 18 years. In response to a recent trend toward wetter conditions, degus reached record-high densities and maintained more stable numbers in the area. Underlying mechanisms involved variation in adult survival, juvenile persistence, and fecundity linked to rainfall changes during consecutive years (i.e., rainfall phases). During prolonged droughts, degus had low survival and produced fewer offspring, with low persistence. Following high rainfall, these parameters reversed; consecutive wet years resulted in further increases. Weak declines in fecundity and adult survival and high persistence of juveniles explained delayed responses to deteriorating conditions in initial dry years. If GCC leads to increased frequency of El Nino events, we anticipate greater numerical dominance of degus in semiarid Chile and possible range expansion. Furthermore, degus have strong impacts on other small mammal and some plant species, are important prey species, and are agricultural pests and disease reservoirs. Hence, GCC has the potential to dramatically influence their ecology in northern Chile and to have cascading effects on other components of this system.

AB Habitat fragmentation imposes profound impacts on the tropical forest microclimate, but the microclimatic configuration of isolated forest patches and its implications for biodiversity persistence and habitat management are not clear. In this study we assessed a set of 10 aged (> 80 years) fragments (3.0 - 3,500 ha in size) of the Atlantic forest to examine to what extent fragment microclimatic attributes are correlated with distance to the nearest edge as frequently proposed in the literature. We used 129 sampling points and took a total of 516 measures of air temperature and humidity, vapor pressure deficit and light incidence to characterize the microclimate of forest fragments in terms of their relative deviation from the surrounding matrix. Fragments as a whole presented strong internal variation and strongly differed from the microclimate exhibited by the open matrix of sugar-cane fields. Distance to nearest edge, percentage of forest cover around the measurement point, percentage of edge-affected area, and geographical orientation of the nearest edge all proved to have minor effects on the microclimate of forest fragments. Conversely, we identified percentage of forest cover and fragment area as the most significant explanatory variables driving their microclimatic configuration: as forest cover increases at landscape scale, forest microclimate deviates less from the open matrix (a forest-mediated matrix buffering). Our results suggest that microclimatic conditions are spatially complex, as they do not correlate with the distance to the nearest forest edges; rather, they are driven by a forest-mediated buffering of the surrounding matrix that minimizes heat and humidity exchanges between forest and non-forest habitats, thus shaping the microclimatic signature of isolated forest fragments.

AB High rates of old growth (OG) forest destruction and difficult farming conditions result in increasing cover of secondary forests (SF) in the Amazon. In this setting, it is opportune to ask which animals use newly available SF and which stay restricted to OG. This study presents a comparison of SF and OG site occupancy by nocturnal birds in terra firme forests of the Amazon Guianan shield, north of Manaus, Brazil. We tested species-specific occupancy predictions for two owls (Lophostrix cristata/Glaucidium hardyi), two potoos (Nyctibius leucopterus/Nyctibius griseus) and two nightjars (Caprimulgus nigrescens/Nyctidromus albicollis). For each pair, we predicted that one species would have higher occupancy in OG while the other would either be indifferent to forest type or favor SF sites. Data were collected in 30 OG and 24 SF sites with monthly samples from December 2007 to December 2008. Our analytic approach accounts for the possibility of detection failure and for spatial autocorrelation in occupancy, thus leading to strong inferences about changes in occupancy between forest types and between species. Nocturnal bird richness and community composition were indistinguishable between OG and SF sites. Owls were relatively indifferent to forest type. Potoos followed the a priori predictions, and one of the nightjars (C. nigrescens) favored SF instead of OG as predicted. Only one species, Nyctib. leucopterus, clearly favored OG. The landscape context of our SF study sites, surrounded by a vast expanse of continuous OG forest, partially explains the resemblance between SF and OG fauna but leaves unexplained the higher occupancy for SF than OG sites for several study species. The causal explanation of high SF occupancy remains an open question, but the result itself motivates further comparisons for other groups, as well as recognition of the conservation potential of SF.

AB Leaf-cutting ants consume up to 10% of canopy leaves in the foraging area of their colony and therefore represent a key perturbation in the nutrient cycle of tropical forests. We used a chronosequence of nest sites on Barro, Colorado Island, Panama, to assess the influence of leaf-cutting ants (Atta colombica) on nutrient availability in a neotropical rainforest. Twelve nest sites were sampled, including active nests, recently abandoned nests (<1 year) and long-abandoned nests (>1 year). Waste material discarded by the ants down-slope from the nests contained large concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in both total and soluble forms, but decomposed within one year after the nests were abandoned. Despite this, soil under the waste material contained high concentrations of nitrate and ammonium that persisted after the disappearance of the waste, although soluble phosphate returned to background concentrations within one year of nest abandonment. Fine roots were more abundant in soil under waste than control soils up to one year after nest abandonment, but were not significantly different for older sites. In contrast to the waste dumps, soil above the underground nest chambers consistently contained lower nutrient concentrations than control soils, although this was not statistically significant. We conclude that the 'islands of fertility' created by leaf-cutting ants provide a nutritional benefit to nearby plants for less than one year after nest abandonment in the moist tropical environment of Barro Colorado Island.

AB Mapping forest disturbance history is essential for assessing forest fragmentation conditions and the effectiveness of management approaches, and it is crucial for the understanding of terrestrial and atmospheric carbon flux. In this study, our analysis maps and characterizes the wall-to-wall forest change patterns in Mississippi over the time period 1987-2005, by interpreting 132 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scenes using a vegetation change tracker (VCT) model. Our analysis revealed that a gradual decelerating forest fragmentation during the time period 1987-1993 gave way to an accelerating fragmentation during the period 1994-2005. This unique trend in forest fragmentation was a consequence of forest logging, regeneration practices and natural disturbance regimes. In addition, for the most part of the 1990s and between 2000 and 2005, Mississippi lost about 2% of its forest on an annual basis, but many of the losses were offset by forest regeneration from previous disturbances. Forest spatial change information derived from this analysis has provided valuable insights regarding regional forest management practices and socioeconomic impacts, which will be beneficial for land managers to develop ecologically sustainable forest management strategies and biodiversity conservation practices.

AB Patterns in property values provide strong signals about the future and sustainability of land use. This paper analyzes the determinants of land value in an Amazonian frontier settlement. We estimate hedonic price functions to identify factors that affect the value of farm properties in the western Brazilian Amazon. Distance to market explains nearly one-third of the variation in farm value, as predicted by the von Thunen model. After controlling for location relative to the central market and for municipality, we find that investment in the farms (as reflected in the stocking rate of pastures and the establishment of home gardens) has the next largest impact on land value. The value per hectare of land is negatively related to total lot size, suggesting that any economies of scale are outweighed by the cost of accessing remote corners of large properties. We do not find that land values are related to available measures of biophysical factors or to historic or current land use. Our results do not identify any premium for forest cover or for land uses considered to be more sustainable than pasture on the property itself. However, farm values are affected by neighboring land cover, specifically, the extent of barren land. Thus, local knowledge of factors contributing to future productivity. as summarized in land values, confirms that soil exhaustion can lead to a general decline in property values, while investments in a property both as a homestead and as a farm can help sustain frontier settlements.

AB 1. To provide reliable tools for landscape management in tropical regions, it is important to recognise the emergent properties of landscape heterogeneity and to understand their influence on different components of biodiversity.
   2. The effects of habitat type, patch size and shape, canopy cover, distance between habitats, and elevation were examined on the partitioned diversity (alpha, beta and gamma) of dung beetles in a transformed landscape in southern Mexico.
   3. In total, 4109 individuals belonging to 28 species of dung beetle were recorded in the entire landscape. Alpha diversity was similar among habitats, although species composition was more similar between forest remnants and living fences than between living fences and pastures. Beta diversity was related to differences in elevation and distance between habitats. The distance between fragments was significantly correlated with the mean number of beetle captures and species richness per site. Gamma diversity depended more on species turnover (beta diversity) than on local species richness.
   4. In general, living fences and pastures with trees, and small forest patches retain a significant proportion of the fauna typically associated with pristine forest habitats. The remaining tracts of forest, along with the contemporary landscape elements may offer suitable habitats for future recolonisation by other insect species in heavily disturbed landscapes in tropical Mexico.

AB This study aimed to characterize the soil seed bank under secondary vegetation in an area degraded by kaolin mining in Bras Pires, MG, Brazil. Forty soil samples of 0.5 x 0.5 m were collected to the depth of 5.0 cm. The soil samples were maintained in nursery for four months, half in shading of 11.5% (light), and half in shading of 60% (shade). Seed germination was compared under the two shade conditions (11.5% and 60%), utilizing the t test for independent samples. Thirty-six species belonging to 17 botanical families were sampled. The families with the largest number of species were Asteraceae with 9, Rubiaceae with 5, and Poaceae with 4. Most of the species sampled (66.7%) were herbaceous. The most abundant species were the herbaceous Urochloa decumbens (Stapf) R. D. Webster, Cenchrus sp. and Eragrostis sp., and the shrub Leandra niangaeformis Cogn. Among the tree species, Luehea grandiflora Mart. and Trema micranta (L.) Blume presented the largest number of individuals. The largest density of the herbs originating from the disturbed surrounding areas indicates a low resilience of the vegetation in the degraded area, in case a severe disturbance occurs.

AB In this paper we address the effects of anthropogenic disturbance and replacement of Brazilian Coastal sandy vegetation (restingas) on dung beetles communities. We sampled dung beetles in the four main vegetative physiognomies of Guriri Island, Espirito Santo State: forest restinga, restinga Clusia, disturbed restinga (from burning events), and pastures. We placed four sets of two pitfall traps (baited with horse and human dung) in four independent areas of each vegetation type, and collected 14,534 individuals of 13 dung beetle species. Neither log(10) of individuals nor log(10) of species richness were good predictors of restinga disturbance. However, a significant amount of variation in dung beetle abundance and richness could be explained by bait type. Ordination of these sites using hybrid multidimensional scaling revealed a gradient of habitat disturbance from undisturbed restinga samples to pasture. Dung beetle communities along this gradient demonstrated a complete turnover in species composition, from restinga-specialists to invasive and generalists species respectively. This complete turnover signals the local extirpation of forest-adapted species in disturbed and converted areas. Only a single dung beetle species in preserved restingas is protected by Brazilian law (Dichotomius schiffleri). Given the extent of the clearing of restinga habitat, the conservation status of dung beetles associated with restinga forest gives cause for concern.

AB The spatial distribution of most species in ecosystems is nonuniform. New theories try to explain patterns observed at multiple scales in terms of neutral processes such as birth, death, and migration. We have devised an experimental, niche-free ecosystem where the amplitude of neutral patchiness can be precisely measured. Spatial distribution of species in this system is extremely clustered. We demonstrate that this clustering is entirely attributed to neutral causes and show that the most basic properties of life can provoke intricate spatial structures without clues from the environment.

TI Testing the accuracy of fecal-based analyses in studies of trophic

SO COPEIA
LA English
DT Article
ID DIET
AB Trophic niche studies are essential for evaluating ecological interactions between and within species and their evolutionary implications. For example, fundamental aspects of a wide range of hypotheses concerning population divergence, evolution of sexual dimorphism, and adaptations to fluctuating environments rely on dietary evidence. The accuracy of different methodologies used to estimate trophic specializations is therefore a fundamental issue. Under the assumption that direct observations of gastric contents provide accurate information about dietary preferences, I examined how reliably diet is reflected in fecal pellets. I conducted two main comparative tests on living lizards. First, I fed individuals of 23 species with hard- and soft-bodied organisms, and compared fecal pellets. Second, 0 examined prey items from natural diets represented in feces and gastric contents (stomach-flushing) in a wild population of the lizard Liolaemus tenuis. My results reveal that fecal samples provide inaccurate estimates of lizard trophic preferences, mainly because soft-bodied organisms are destroyed by digestive processes. Even though soft-bodied prey may be essential dietary items (as inferred from gastric analysis), these organisms may be almost entirely absent from feces. I suggest that direct gastric analyses should be the preferred method for analyzing reptilian diets.

AB Question: To what extent do small-scale disturbances in the forest canopy, created by natural disturbance agents, affect stand development? Doubts exist as to whether small canopy openings have any real effect on the understory tree recruitment, especially in boreal forests.
   Location: Conifer and mixed stands in the Gaspesian region in eastern Quebec. The main natural disturbance agents are recurring outbreaks of Choristoneura fumiferana ( eastern spruce budworm) and winds.
   Methods: Linear transects in 27 sites were used to describe the gap (< 0.1 ha) regime parameters, including gap fraction, gap size and change in disturbance severity through time. Three stand types were distinguished, based on a gradient of abundance of tree host species for the eastern spruce budworm. The impact of gaps was evaluated on the basis of changes in the number, the period of recruitment, and the composition of tree saplings present within gap areas. Changes were measured along the gap size gradient, and according to the pattern of recent budworm epidemics.
   Results: The gap fraction is highly variable (18%-64%) and is on average relatively high (42%). Gap sizes have a positively skewed distribution. In most cases the growth rate among gap filling saplings increased sufficiently to date disturbance events. The composition and the structure of understory trees were affected by gap formation. The number of shade-intolerant tree species did increase during or following periods of particularly severe canopy disturbances. However, the establishment or survival of shade intolerant species was not restricted to larger gaps or more intensely disturbed periods.
   Conclusions: In sub-boreal forests of Eastern Canada, small scale disturbances in the tree canopy influence stand regeneration dynamics, but not to the extent that parameters such as sapling composition and recruitment patterns depend on gap regime characteristics.

AB Spatial patterns presented by the opossums Caluromys philander, Philander frenata and Micoureus demerarae were studied, through radio-tracking, in a landscape composed of eight small (1.3-13.3 ha) forest fragments surrounded by a matrix of open vegetation in south-eastern Brazil. Sixteen individuals were fitted with radio-collar transmitters and monitored for 2-8 mo. Fixes were obtained by the 'homing-in on the animal' technique. Numbers of locations of each individual varied from 6 to 1.17, Home ranges sizes ranged from 2.5-7.0 ha for C. philander, 0.6-7.4 ha for P. frenata and 0.8-1.7 ha for M. demerarae. Fragments, both edges and interiors, were used more often than the matrix; they are the primary habitat for these marsupials in the landscape. The matrix was used for foraging by P. frenata and C. philander, and traversed in five movements between fragments by P. frenata. Ability to use fragment edges and the matrix is important in explaining how these marsupials are able to persist in the landscape.

In this article, we argue that a focus on allometry and metabolic scaling theory provides the basis to begin to mechanistically link and understand patterns observed at ecological and evolutionary timescales. To make our case, we draw on and review several recently published papers and present new analyses. We argue that together, this synthesized work supports the notion that selection has maximized the scaling of resource exchange surfaces (e.g., photosynthetic surface areas) yet simultaneously minimizes the scaling of transport times and resistances. As a result, the scaling of plant metabolism, in turn, has profoundly influenced the evolution and ecology of plant form, function, and diversity, probably since the inception of the chlorophytes. In particular, we discuss preliminary support for the notion that stabilizing selection for 3/4-power scaling of metabolism, in addition to competition for similar limiting resources, has led to the emergence of regular ecological patterns that have likely been prevalent throughout plant evolution.

AB 1. Carbohydrate storage has been attributed an important role in the ability to tolerate shade, yet empirical support for this idea has been patchy. We asked if carbohydrate-storage patterns of seedling evergreens in low light are correlated with variation in shade tolerance, and how these patterns change with seedling size.
   2. We measured biomass distribution and total non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations of leaves, stems and roots of two seedling size classes of six evergreens growing in a temperate rainforest understorey. Light requirements of the six species were quantified by calculating the 10th percentile of the distribution of established seedlings in relation to canopy openness.
   3. NSC averaged 14% of the dry mass of small seedlings (40-60 mm tall), and 22% of that of large seedlings (400-600 mm tall). This difference was entirely due to variation in starch reserves, which on average accounted for 60% of NSC in small seedlings and 84% in large seedlings.
   4. NSC concentrations of leaves and roots (but not stems) of large seedlings were negatively correlated with species' shade tolerance, but no such pattern was found in small seedlings. Leaf NSC on an area basis was not related to species' shade tolerance in either size class.
   5. Partitioning of the NSC pool between leaves, stems and roots of small seedlings was closely related to variation in shade tolerance. Small seedlings of shade-tolerant species had a relatively low proportion of their NSC pool in leaves and a high proportion in roots. This is likely to ensure the retention of the greater part of the NSC pool even in the event of extensive defoliation, and the availability of reserves to replace lost leaves. In contrast, the large leaf-mass fraction of large seedlings of shade-tolerant species (46-47% of biomass) meant that these plants had a large proportion of their NSC pool in foliage.
   6. Results suggest that, in Chilean rainforest evergreens, any adaptive relationship of carbohydrate storage with shade tolerance may be confined to young seedlings, involving interspecific variation in the partitioning of reserves between leaves and other organs, rather than especially high NSC concentrations in shade-tolerant species.

AB Interannual variations in terrestrial carbon cycle over tropical rainforests affect the global carbon cycle. Terrestrial ecosystem models show the interannual relationship between climate changes due to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and net primary production over tropical rainforests. However, we need an independent analysis using satellite-based vegetation index and climate parameters. In the present study, we extracted the ENSO-related interannual variations from time-series in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and climate data from 1981 to 2000, and analysed their relevance. We detected relationships among NDVI, ENSO, and climate parameters from long-term data with negative NDVI-ENSO, NDVI-temperature, and positive NDVI-precipitation relations. These correlations suggest that interannual variability in vegetation activities over tropical rainforests could be extracted from NDVI time-series despite noise components in NDVI data, and that interannual changes in precipitation and temperature caused by ENSO play a more important role in vegetation activities over tropical rainforests than in incoming surface solar radiation.

AB Connell's intermediate disturbance. hypothesis predicts that the highest diversity is maintained at intermediate levels of disturbance; We have examined this hypothesis by observing differences in biodiversity of terrestrial isopods along a gradient of disturbance from two undisturbed primary tropical rainforest sites, to a logged site, a mixed native fruit orchard and a commercial oil palm plantation, in Sabah, East Malaysia. We describe a standardised protocol for the rapid assessment of isopod biodiversity on tropical forest floor sites and for measuring environmental variables to which we have related differences in species richness and relative abundance of the isopods:. The results do not support Connell's hypothesis because there were no significant differences in diversity, species richness or equitability between disturbed sites and the nearest primary forests. The relative abundance of individual species was highest in the most disturbed environment. We suggest that this may be because particular species are well adapted to exploiting resources under the more 'r' selection conditions created by disturbance. Possible reasons for why the observations do not conform with predictions from the intermediate disturbance hypothesis are discussed. We conclude that Huston's dynamic equilibrium model is more appropriate than the intermediate disturbance hypothesis in predicting the effects of disturbance of tropical rainforests on these arthropod macro-decomposers.

AB In order to study the influence of dispersal ability on community structure of ground beetles (carabidae), 15 lake islands and 2 mainland sites of the lake Mamry archipelago, northern Poland, were sampled by using pitfall traps. Of the 71 ground beetle species detected, 47 were macropterous, 16 wing-dimorphic and 8 brachypterous. Macropterous species had lower site abundances and occupied fewer sites than dimorphic and brachypterous species. There were trends from macropterous to brachypterous species towards a nested distribution across the sites and towards over-dispersed (aggregated) species co-occurrences. Canonical correspondence analysis pointed to site isolation and area as main factors influencing site abundance and spatial distribution. Our results imply that further studies on species co-occurrences and community assembly have to consider dispersal ability as a key element influencing ecological distributions at the regional scale.

AB Questions: What is the mechanism of bog ground layer colonization post-fire? Is species colonization stochastic or does facilitation occur?
   Location: Boreal bog peatland near Crow Lake, Alberta, Canada.
   Methods: Diaspore-addition treatments were applied in 2003 to autoclaved peat samples from high and low microtopographic positions within a recently burned bog. Colonization was assessed within the plots in 2005 and compared to control plots to determine treatment success and patterns of colonization.
   Results: A significant degree of ground layer colonization was found two years after fire, with Polytrichum strictum dominating the site. Colonization was greater in low (wet) plots, although only P. strictum and Sphagnum angustifolium had significant colonization. No effect of diaspore addition was observed and Sphagnum was only found in conjunction with P. strictum.
   Conclusions: Environmental conditions and species life history strategy are more important than diaspore availability for post-fire colonization. True mosses (e.g. P. strictum) appear to facilitate Sphagnum colonization.

AB To study the degree of edaphic specialization in Amazonian plants, the distribution patterns of seven species of Polybotrya ferns were studied in 109 sites in a climatically uniform area of northwestern Amazonia (Colombia, Ecuador and northern Peru). The two most abundant species of Polybotrya were found in about two-thirds of the sites with almost 7000 individuals each, the rarest species occurred in just one site with 40 individuals. Each of the seven species appeared to have a unique realised niche, when niche dimensions were defined by gradients in soil texture, soil cation content, and inundation. The species also differed in how broadly or narrowly they were distributed along each gradient. Some species were practically never found in the same sites, whereas others co-occurred with a high frequency, in spite of showing clearly different abundance patterns among sites. A single site only contains a small part of the edaphic variation present in the landscape, and a small proportion of any species' niche space, so broad-scale studies are needed to adequately describe and compare species' niches and to assess to what degree niche differences promote species coexistence. The distribution patterns in Polybotrya are consistent with, but do not prove, that ecological speciation may have been important in the radiation of the genus. If such a pattern is found to be common in other Amazonian plants, this would indicate that each evolutionary lineage has adapted to the available habitats largely independently of the others.

AB Biogeographical studies frequently reveal positive correlations between species richness and estimates of environmental water and/or energy. A popular interpretation of this relationship relates the supply of water and energy to productivity, and then, in turn, to richness. Productivity-diversity theories are now legion, yet none has proved sufficiently intuitive to gain broad acceptance. Like productivity, heterogeneity is known to influence diversity at fine spatial scales, yet the possibility that richness might relate to water-energy dynamics at coarse spatial scales via a heterogeneity-generating mechanism has received little attention. In this paper we outline such a conceptual model for plants that is internally consistent and testable. We believe it may help to explain the capacity of environments receiving different inputs of water and energy to support variable numbers of species at a range of spatial scales, the pervasive correlation between productivity and richness, some exceptions to the productivity-diversity relationship, the form of productivity-diversity curves and the link between richness and environmental 'harshness'. The model may also provide an answer to one of the most venerable puzzles in the field of diversity studies: why high inputs of water and energy correspond to more species rather than simply more individuals.

AB This study analyzes the variations in the structure and composition of ant communities in burned Pinus nigra forests in central Catalonia (NE Spain). Pinus nigra forests do not recover after fire, changing to shrublands and oak coppices. For this reason, we suggest that ant communities of burned P. nigra forests will change after fire, because the post-fire scenario, in particular with the increase of open areas, is different to the unburned one, and more favourable for some species than for others. In four locations previously occupied by P. nigra forests where different fires occurred 1, 5, 13 and 19 yr before the sampling, we sampled the structure and composition of ant communities with pitfall traps, tree traps and net sweeping in unburned plots and in plots affected by canopy and understory fire. The results obtained suggest that canopy and understory fire had little effect on the structure of ant communities. Thus, many variables concerning ant communities were not modified either by fire type (understory or canopy fire) or by time since fire. However, a number of particular species were affected, either positively or negatively, by canopy fire: three species characteristic of forest habitats decreased after fire, while eight species characteristic of open habitats increased in areas affected by canopy fire, especially in the first few years after fire. These differences in ant community composition between burned and unburned plots imply that the maximum richness is achieved when there is a mixture of unburned forests and areas burned with canopy fire. Moreover, as canopy cover in P. nigra forests burned with canopy fire is not completed in the period of time studied, the presence of the species that are characteristic of burned areas remains along the chronosequence studied, while the species that disappear after fire do not recover in the period of time considered. Overall, the results obtained indicate that there is a persistent replacement of ant species in burned P. nigra forests, as is also the case with vegetation.

AB Although many studies have shown that ant nests tend to increase soil nutrient concentrations, only a few have examined ant impact on soil biota. To date, no one has examined the mechanism behind this complex 'ant effect.' In this study, we employed a 2 x 2 complete factorial design (water x food) in the field to mimic the effects of harvester ant nests (Messor andrei) on soil. We hypothesized that, in the absence of ants, addition of moisture and food (seeds and insects) would interact to produce conditions found in ant nests. Our results indicated that the addition of food to the soil (regardless of water addition) best mimicked the conditions found inside M. andrei nests. Both food-treated and ant-nest soils supported higher numbers of bacteria, nematodes, miscellaneous eukaryotes, and microarthropods compared to the other soil treatments. Microbial richness was also highest in ant and food-treated samples. Moreover, the ant effect in our experiment occurred in just two months. Because ants are a widespread, abundant group with many long-lived species, they could substantially influence soil properties and belowground food webs and may have important restoration/conservation implications for terrestrial communities.

AB The mechanisms underlying responses of invertebrates to forest edges remain poorly understood. Here, we use an experimental approach to investigate the predation rates on butterflies in two neotropical forest fragments. Neither distance from forest edge nor degree of forest openness affected predation rates on artificial caterpillars. The mean predation rate of artificial caterpillars on Barro Colorado Island (1500 ha) was significantly higher than that on Peninsula Gigante (2600 ha) likely due to density-dependent effects. Our study demonstrates the utility of artificial predation experiments for rapid assessment of relative lepidoptera predation rates in tropical forests.

AB Mechanistic theories of plant competition developed to explain changes in community structure and dynamics along resource availability gradients have been mostly applied to temperate forests and grasslands where light and nutrients are the two main limiting resources. In contrast, the mechanisms underlying the structure and dynamics of water-limited plant communities have been little explored. Also previous mechanistic models rely either on complex simulators, which are difficult to interpret or on simple conceptual models, which ignore too many critical details. In this study, we develop a model of stand dynamics for light and water-limited forests of intermediate complexity and we provide an analytical framework for its analyses. The model is an individual-based simulator that describes the feedback between transpiration, stomatal function and soil water dynamics with asymmetrical competition for light and water. Trees allocate carbon to three main compartments: shoot, stem and roots. We use the model to explore general patterns that may emerge across levels of biological organization from the leaf to the stand. Model predictions are consistent with a number of features of Mediterranean forests structure and dynamics. At the plant-level the leaf-based tradeoff between carbon gain and water loss expresses as a tradeoff between mortality and growth. This tradeoff explains plant morphological changes in above-ground biomass and root to shoot allocation along a water availability gradient. At the community-level, tradeoffs among carbon acquisition and water loss govern the sign of plant interactions along the gradient. Coexistence among morphological types was not observed for the range of parameters and environmental conditions explored. Overall the model provides an unifying explanation for the observed changes in the sign of plant to plant interactions along environmental gradients as well as a process-based formulation that can be linked to empirical studies.

AB A growing realization that the oceans are being degraded has led to calls for a fundamental shift in the management of activities that affect marine ecosystems. Insights from research in coastal marine ecosystems will help shape policies that consider interactions between ecosystem components. The concept of connections is central to coastal marine ecology. Connections between: (1) ecosystem structure and functioning; (2) land and sea; (3) marine habitats; (4) species; (5) diverse stressors; and (6) knowledge and uncertainty are of particular importance. These linkages provide conceptual and tactical guidance to inform the transition to ecosystem-based management for the oceans. Conceptual guidance includes recognizing of linkages, expecting of surprises, and avoiding hubris in management. Tactical guidance includes managing coastal systems at watershed scales, emphasizing monitoring, using area-based management, and incorporating the recognition of uncertainties into decision-making. Ultimately, successful management of human activities that affect the oceans will require integrating these conceptual and tactical approaches.

ID PREDATION; HABITAT; TREES
AB Seed predation and desiccation present major limitations to the use of direct seeding as an efficient forest restoration technique. The study was designed based on the premise that scarifying seeds before sowing them in fields cleared of weeds would shorten seed dormancy to decrease the time available for seed predation to occur and that burial conceals seeds from potential predators. Therefore, the effects of four treatments (scarification, burial, application of mulch and scarification with burial) were tested on seed germination of four native forest tree species, sown in abandoned agricultural land in an upper watershed in Doi Suthep-Pui National Park, northern Thailand. The four tree species studied were Sapindus rarak, Lithocarpus elegans, Spondias axillaris and Erythrina subumbrans. Field tests showed that instead of rodents, ants were the seed predators. Scarification without burial did not accelerate seed germination in the field due to desiccation and severe predation by ants. Burial helped protect the seeds from predation as well as blocked direct sunlight and increased moisture retention, thus preventing desiccation of seeds. Seeds that benefit from scarification but which are susceptible to seed predation and desiccation should be scarified and buried to a depth twice the diameter of the seed (3-5 cm). For certain suitable species, this technique could offer an effective, cost-efficient alternative to outplanting nursery-raised seedlings for forest restoration projects, particularly in montane areas.

AB Seedling dynamics were followed in a Puerto Rican forest for 20 months following a severe hurricane to study the interactive effects of hurricane debris, nutrients, and light on seedling diversity density, growth, and mortality. Three treatments (debris removal, an unaltered control with hurricane debris, and chemical fertilization added to hurricane debris) altered levels of forest debris and soil nutrients. Canopy openness was measured twice using hemispherical photographs of the canopy. We examined the demographic responses of six common species to treatments over time. Seedling densities increased for all six species but the only significant treatment effects were increased densities of the pioneer tree Cecropia and the shrub Palicourea in the debris removal treatment. Seedling growth declined with declining light levels for four species but not for the pioneer tree Alchornea or the non-pioneer tree Dacryodes. Only Cecropia and the non-pioneer tree Chionanthus had treatment effects on growth. Mortality also differed among species and tended to be highest in the fertilized plots for all but Cecropia and Dacryodes. We found only come of the expected differences between pioneer and non-pioneer plants, as each species had a unique response to the patchy distributions of organic debris, nutrients, and light following the hurricane. High local species diversity was maintained through the individualistic responses of seedlings after a disturbance.

AB Wildfires may be started naturally by lightning or artificially by humans. In the savanna regions of southern Africa, lightning fires tend to occur at the start of the wet season, during October and November, while anthropogenic fires are usually started during the dry season, between July and August. A long-term field manipulation experiment initiated in the Kruger National Park in 1952 was used to explore whether this seasonal divergence affects tree abundance, spatial pattern, size and architecture. After 44 years of prescribed burning treatments that simulated the seasonal incidence of lightning and anthropogenic fires, mean densities of the locally-dominant shrub, Colophospermum mopane, were 638 and 500 trees ha(-1) respectively. Trees in burnt plots had aggregated distributions while trees in unburnt plots had random distributions. Significant differences (p < 0.001) were recorded in a range of morphological parameters including tree height, canopy diameter, mean stem circumference and number of stems. The incidence of resprouting also differed significantly between treatments, with burnt trees containing a high proportion of coppiced stems. The differences in tree size and architecture between the mid-dry season and early-wet season burning plots suggest that anthropogenic fires applied during July and August cannot substitute for a natural lightning fire regime. Anthropogenic fire yields a landscape that is shorter, more scrubby and populated by numerous coppiced shrubs than the landscape generated by natural lightning fire conditions.

AB Seed removal was evaluated at the macro- and micro-habitat level in areas differing in successional stage in the Bolivian Amazon. The successional stages consisted of secondary forests of 2, 10 and 20 years old and primary forest. Seeds of nine tree species were artificially dispersed and the number of seeds removed was evaluated over 7 weeks. Several stand characteristics were measured at the sites where seeds were dispersed. Seed removal at the end of the experiment varied from 50 to 100% depending on the species, and from 74 to 90% depending on successional stage. In general, the removal rate decreased with an increase in age of successional stage. The seed removal rate was related to liana density and not to litter thickness. Different microhabitat characteristics explained the seed removal rate of four species but microhabitat characteristics did not explain the decrease in seed removal rate with an increase in forest age. The results support the idea that post-dispersal seed removal reduces the number of seeds available for germination, consequently playing an important role in the regeneration of abandoned agricultural areas.

AB Orientation of the hermit crabs Clibanarius antillensis to solid and striped targets of different visual angles was tested in a circular arena upon exposure to background sea water, calcium concentrations, gastropod odor. predatory fish odor, and seagrass odor. The test hypotheses were that (1) this hermit crab has the capacity to use visual cues for orientation and (2) it discriminates between objects on the basis of visual and chemical information. Adult crabs were tested during the day without their gastropod shells, and orientation varied with concentration and chemical cue. In general, orientation increased as concentration increased up to a maximum orientation response and then declined at higher concentrations. Solid targets representing gastropod shells attracted crabs in the presence of calcium and gastropod odor. Orientation toward striped targets representing seagrass increased in the presence of seagrass odor. Finally, orientation directly away from a target (predator avoidance response) was only observed in the presence of predator odor. Thus, both hypotheses were supported.

AB On a monoaxial erect stem of trees with continuous leafing, the older leaves would be quickly shaded by newer (upper) leaves if the trees did not have any compensating mechanisms to avoid self-shading. We hypothesized that the dynamic adjustment of leaf deployment, by regulating the patterns of leaf growth and by changing leaf orientation as leaves age, is a compensating mechanism. To verify this hypothesis, we analyzed leaf development and crown structure of a Far Eastern tropical pioneer tree species, Macaranga gigantea (Rub. f. et Toll.) M.A., which unfolds huge leaves directly on a monoaxial stem with a short leafing interval. Petioles required more than 90 days for full elongation and the petiole angle (the angle between the petiole axis and the vertical) increased over time. Thus, a series of leaves on a stem progressively increased in petiole length and petiole angle from the youngest to the oldest leaves. This is beneficial because it decreases the degree of self-shading within a crown. A simulation suggested that an average crown for the M. gigantea seedlings, which was constructed using empirically determined morphometric data cannot entirely eliminate self-shading within the crown. But an average crown had a lower degree of self-shading, with less dry mass allocation to the petiole than simulated crowns that were identical to the average crown in all but one respect: they had constant petiole lengths or petiole angles. We conclude that M. gigantea seedlings reduce self-shading by regulating elongation of the petiole and changes in the petiole angle with increasing leaf age.

TI Foraging in the limpet Patella vulgata: the influence of rock slope on
   the timing of activity
SO JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM

DT Article
ID PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR; RHYTHMS; STRESS
AB Preliminary observations of limpet activity at Lough Hyne, in south-west Ireland, showed chat individuals on steep slopes were primarily active at night, when emersed; while those on near-horizontal rocks were often active during daytime submersion. Observations over an lid period of limpet populations on a near-vertical and a near-horizontal site, only 45 m apart, confirmed that animals on the near-vertical site were active on nocturnal low tides, whilst those on the near-horizontal site were active on daytime high waters. A short-term survey at ten sites, which had limpets on both extremes of slope (i.e. either near-vertical or near-horizontal), showed that limpets on near-horizontal surfaces were, on average, more active at daytime high waters than those on near-vertical faces. In 1996 and 1997 surveys of activity at daytime high, and nocturnal low waters were conducted at sites (14-15) with varying rock slopes (similar to 3-87 degrees). In all cases, limpets on more steep slopes were active at nocturnal emersion whilst animals on more gentle slopes were active on daytime submersion periods. In most cases these trends were significant and explained between 22-40% and 37-44% of the variation in activity with site in 1996 and 1997 respectively Analysis of the head orientation of limpets on their home scars showed that animals orientated in a down shore direction at all sites (1997 data) suggesting that limpets do perceive and respond to slope. Whilst slope does appear to influence the timing of limpets' activity (and especially on very steep or gently sloping sites) it does not account for a large degree of the variation in activity and, on sites with slopes between 30 and 60 degrees, is likely to work in combination with other factors.

AB Edges resulting from forest clear-cutting and treefall gaps can affect plant populations and consequently the distribution of species across landscapes. These two types of disturbance might interact to exacerbate or ameliorate "edge effects'', a rarely tested possibility. We focused on the effects of distance from forest edge (0-10, 30-40, 60-70, and 190-200 m) and habitat within forest fragments (treefall gaps and intact forest) on the early stages of development of Palicourea gibbosa and Faramea affinis, two common shrubs of montane forests in southwest Colombia. Seed germination and seedling growth did not change with distance from forest edge. Within forest fragments, however, seed germination and seedling growth were higher in treefall gaps than in intact forest understory for both species. In contrast, seed predation was influenced by distance from forest edge and in P gibbosa it depended on habitat. Seed predation was highest in the forest interior (190-200 m from forest edge) and in P. gibbosa this was true only in treefall gap habitats. These results suggest that animal mediated processes such as post-dispersal seed predation are more likely than physiological processes to be affected by anthropogenic edges. Our results provide some evidence that treefall gaps may interact with "edge effects", however, they are inconclusive as to whether they exacerbate or ameliorate them.

AB The population status of an endemic cactus (Mammillaria gaumeri) was assessed in coastal Yucatan, Mexico. Similar numbers of mature plants were found in open and full sun microhabitats. Plants in full sun bad more ramets and were of larger diameter. There was a correlation between M. gaumeri abundance and the biomass of a disturbance indicator, Myrmecophila tibicinis (Orchidacea). Higher seedling survival in shade microhabitats and aggregated distribution of adults suggests that shrubs serve as nurse plants. Initial mortality rates of seedlings were many times higher in full sun microhabitats than in shade conditions. Herbivory had no effect on seedling survival. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB Gap regeneration of major tree species was examined, based on the pattern of gap phase replacement, in primary old-growth stands of warm-temperate, cool-temperate and subalpine forests, Japan. Using principal component analysis, the gap-regeneration behavior of major tree species could be divided into three guilds and that of Fagus crenata (monodominant species of cool-temperate forests). The criteria used for this division were total abundance of canopy trees and regenerations and relative abundance of regenerations to canopy trees. The gap-regeneration behavior of species in the first guild was that canopy trees regenerate in gaps from seedlings or saplings recruited before gap formation; they had higher total abundance and more abundant regenerations relative to their canopy trees. The gap-regeneration behavior of F. crenata was same as species in the first guild, but F. crenata had less abundant regenerations relative to its canopy trees. Species in the second guild had lower total abundance and less abundant regenerations to their canopy trees. The guild contained species whose canopy trees regenerate in gaps from seedlings or saplings recruited after gap formation or regenerate following largescale disturbance. The third guild consisted of species with lower total abundance and more abundant regenerations relative to their canopy trees. The gap-regeneration behavior of some species in this guild was that trees regenerate in gaps from seedlings or saplings recruited before gap formation, and grow, mature, and die without reaching the canopy layer, while the gap-regeneration behavior of other species was same as that of species in the first guild or F. crenata. Major tree species of subalpine forests were not present in the third guild.

AB Over 4000 bryozoan-bryozoan interactions were recorded from a total of 985 rocks from six locations at Signy Island in the maritime Antarctic. The majority of these interactions were interspecific meetings. The identity of the competitive species was a major influence on the outcome of encounters, whereas depth and surface area of rocks had little significant influence. The assemblage of bryozoans could be ranked into a clear hierarchy with a competitively dominant species. Zooidal height and colony growth morphology were found to be important factors in overall overgrowth rank. Few interspecific encounters resulted in indeterminate outcomes, but a tied outcome was found to be most likely between competitors of similar overgrowth rank. In contrast, intraspecific meetings mostly resulted in tied outcomes. Species with a higher proportion of colonies on the upper surfaces of rocks were found to have a lower incidence of tied outcomes. One explanation may be the potentially more successful larval dispersal on upper rock surfaces in higher water flow, and the resulting decreased likelihood of neighbours being related. Several incidences of homosyndrome were also observed in three bryozoan species.

AB We examined the effectiveness with which two common understory birds, Andropadus latirostris and A. tephrolaemus (Pycnonotidae), dispersed seeds of a tropical pioneer forest tree, Maesa lanceo(ata (Myrsinaceae). Relative dispersal effectiveness of each species was assessed in terms of quantity and quality of seed dispersal. The number of seeds dispersed was examined by quantifying the tree visitation frequency, duration of time in the tree and number of fruits ingested, and probability that the bird would deposit seeds under the parent tree. The quality of seed dispersal was examined using defecation frequency, number of seeds defecated through time following ingestion of a cohort of 20 fruits, seed viability after passage through the gut, and general diet analysis. A,ndropadus tephrolaemus and A. latirostris were the most common visitors to M. lanreolata and accounted for 49.1 percent and 17.3 percent of all animal visits to the tree, respectively. The mean (and standard deviation) residence times in the tree were 2.82 +/- 1.65 min for A. tephrolaemus and 3.14 +/- 1.70 min for A. latirostris. Individuals of both species are estimated 23 to 25 fruits per visit (3-20 seeds/fruit). Mean minimum seed passage times were 17.8 +/- 1.93 min for A. tephrolaemus and 12.9 +/- 0.80 min for A. latirostris. Seeds were viable after passing through the birds' gut. The majority of seeds passed through the gut within 20 min of the first defecation that contained seeds, and nearly all seeds passed within 80 min of ingestion. Mean time between defecations was 2.6 min for A. tephrolaemus and 2.2 min for A. latirostris. Frequency of return to the tree combined with the short tree residence rimes and defecation rates suggest that both species are unlikely to defecate more than 5 percent or 10 percent of seeds under the parent tree. Both species consistently dispersed most seeds away from the parent tree; A. tephrolaemus may be a more important disperser for the tree, however, because of its higher visitation rate.

AB Postdispersal seed predation on six native plant species was examined in an area of disturbed hardwood forest and in adjacent intact forest in eastern Pennsylvania. The study was conducted for 21 days in October and 24 days in November 1992, 3 yr after a tornado created a large gap by uprooting most of the canopy trees within a 2-ha area; the remainder of the forest was undisturbed. We used three species with seeds longer than 1 cm and three with seeds shorter than 1 cm in order to test the prediction that seeds of large-seeded species are consistently preferred. The magnitude and rate of seed predation were compared among species, between habitats and between months. In October, there was severe predation on all six species in the gap, but the large-seeded species experienced more seed predation than did small-seeded species in the forest. The magnitude of seed predation did not differ among species in either habitat in November. The magnitude of seed predation declined between October and November but much more so in the forest than in the gap, perhaps due to a covering of leaf litter that accumulated during the experiment. Seed predation rates differed among species but were generally higher in the gap and during the October experiment. These results show strong spatial and temporal patterns in seed predation and suggest that dispersal from the gap into the adjacent forest would prove beneficial for establishment provided that growing conditions there are suitable or that seeds are capabIe of remaining dormant until suitable conditions occur.

ID REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; PLANTS; COMMUNITY; GUAYANA
AB Floral biology and pollination mechanisms of 33 herbaceous monocot species were studied in the tropical cloud forest of Henri Pittier National Park, Venezuela. The frequency distribution of pollination systems was as follows: cantharophily (35.1%), ornithophily (24.3%), melittophily (16.2%), myiophily (10.8%), anemophily (8.1%), and chiropterophily (5.4%). Of 71 visiting species recorded on 33 plant species, 67.6% were pollinators and 32.4% were only visitors; coleopterans and dipterans were the most diverse groups. Studies of floral biology showed that 46.9% of the species were monoe cious-dichogamous and 53.1% were hermaphroditic -adichogamous. Among adichogamous species, 15.6% were herkogamous. The pollination units were the flowers or inflorescences in hermaphroditic and monoecious species. Bat-, bird-, and bee-pollinated species produced nectar, although pollen was also found as a reward in bee- and bat-pollinated species; beetle pollination was associated with floral parts as the reward. Floral longevity of vertebrate pollinated species ranged from 10 to 24 hours; floral longevity for bee-pollinated species was similar or longer than for vertebrate-pollinated species. For cantharophilous and wind-pollinated species, pollination unit longevity was increased by the longevity of the female flowers. These different patterns in time of anthesis, floral longevity, and pollinator species, together with vertical and horizontal species distribution, are mechanisms that promote pollination specificity and intraspecific pollen transportation in the understory cloud forest.

AB Foraging ecology and diet of eight species of epiphyte-searching insectivorous birds were studied in the Talamanca mountains of Costa Rica to determine degree of epiphyte specialization. To measure species' selectivity for epiphytic substrates, quantitative data on epiphyte availability was compared to actual bird use of epiphytes. Associations between each species and its foraging substrates, foraging maneuvers, and diets suggested a continuum in foraging behaviors across the eight species. At one end of this continuum were substrate-restricted species, whose foraging behavior and prey choice appear to have been mediated by the nature of their foraging substrates. At the other end of the continuum were prey-specific species, whose foraging behavior and substrate choice appear to have been determined by the nature of their prey. Four species in the study area (approximately 8% of the resident avifauna) were epiphyte specialists: Pseudocolaptes lawrencii on arboreal bromeliads, Margarornis rubiginosus on bryophytes, Lepidocolaptes affinis on bryophytes and foliose lichens, and Troglodytes ochraceus on epiphytic root masses.

Documentation of genetic variation for and covariation among reproductive phenologies is important because it is this variation/covariation that will determine the potential for response to evolutionary forces. To address this problem, I conducted a breeding experiment to determine narrow-sense heritabilities for and genetic correlations among the phenologies of life-history events and plant size in Chamaecrista fasciculata, a temperate summer annual plant species. Paternal families showed no evidence of heritable variation for two estimates of plant size, six measures of reproductive phenology or two fitness components. Similarly, paternal estimates of genetic correlations among these traits were low or zero. In contrast, maternal estimates of heritability suggested the influence of maternal parent on one estimate of plant size and four phenological traits. Likewise, maternal effects influenced maternal estimates of genetic correlations. These maternal effects can arise from three sources: endosperm nuclear, cytoplasmic genetic and/or maternal phenotypic. The degree to which the phenology of one life-history trait acts as a constraint on the evolution of other phenological traits depends on the source of the maternal influence in this species.

AB Little is known about the reproductive biology of the Crassulaceae. We studied a population of Echeveria gibbiflora in the Pedregal de San Angel ecological preserve in Mexico City, Mexico. Each flower is open and producing nectar 7 to 8 days. On the days of maximum nectar production (flowers 4-6 days old) an average of 14.5 mul accumulates in a flower per day. The maximum rate of nectar production is between 0700 and 0900 hours. The average sugar concentration in the nectar is 43.7%. In a given flower, pollen is exposed and the stigmas are receptive at the same time. The average natural fruit-set-and seed-set are 56.6% and 35.5%, respectively. The pollen-ovule ratio is 124, and the plants are fully self-compatible. The flowers are pollinated by only one species of hummingbird (Cynanthus latirostris) and are never visited by insects. Pollen movement is very limited (mean of pollinator flight distances = 0.72 m, mean distance fluorescent dyes = 0.92 m). Seed dispersion is by gravity and wind, and also is very limited (an average of 1.07 m). The total genetic neighborhood area is 15 m2 to 17 m2, producing a neighborhood effective population size (N(b)) of 5.01 to 39.7 individuals. This is a very small N(b), indicating that genetic drift may be a dominant force in the evolution of this species.

AB Several factors potentially influencing predation rates on the hermit crab Pagurus longicarpus (Say) were investigated near northeastern Gulf of Mexico salt marshes.  Relative predation rates for hermit crabs in different shell types were measured at four tidal levels at four sites using tethering techniques.  Predation differed between sites, but not between tidal levels at most sites.  Shell species, shell size, and shell damage also had no influence on predation rates.  Limited trammel netting indicated that several species of hermit crab predators were common across the intertidal zone.  In the laboratory, hermit crabs that were allowed to bury fell prey to striped burrfish Chilomycterus schoepfii (Walbaum) significantly less frequently than hermit crabs that could not.  P. longicarpus may depend more on behavioral adaptations such as burying, rather than qualities of the shell shelter, to evade the array of predators in this habitat.

TI Brazil's Amazon Soy Moratorium reduced deforestation
SO NATURE FOOD
LA English
DT Article
ID FOREST CONSERVATION; POLICY; LIMITS; RATES
AB Between 2004 and 2012, multiple policies contributed to one of the great conservation successes of the twenty-first century-an 84% decrease in the rate of Brazilian Amazon deforestation. Among the most prominent of these policies is the Amazon Soy Moratorium (ASM), an agreement by grain traders not to purchase soy grown on recently deforested land. The ASM inspired widespread adoption of similar zero-deforestation commitments, but its impact is poorly understood due to its overlap with other conservation policies. Here, we apply an econometric triple-differences model to remotely sensed deforestation data to isolate the ASM's impact within Brazil's Arc of Deforestation. We show that the ASM reduced deforestation in soy-suitable locations in the Amazon by 0.66 +/- 0.32 percentage points relative to a counterfactual control, preventing 18,000 +/- 9,000 km(2) of deforestation over its first decade (2006-2016). Although these results highlight potential benefits of private conservation policies, the ASM's success was dependent on complementarities with public property registries and deforestation monitoring.
   Disentangling the impacts of anti-deforestation interventions from other conservation efforts remains a challenge. An econometric analysis of remotely sensed data reveals the efficacy of the Soy Moratorium in the Brazilian Arc of Deforestation and the extent to which its success relies on complementary policies.

AB Millions of people are dependent on tropical forests for livelihood. However, their dependence on meagre incomes from nontimber forest products (NTFPs) and payment for ecosystem services (PES) are leading to continuing poverty. It is doubtful if the program, Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD + ) has yet achieved much in its primary goal of forest conservation, and the chance of it helping to alleviate rural poverty is slim. Forest conservation per se hardly creates economic opportunities, beyond survival, for rural people. Our efforts for conserving forests and their biodiversity will remain less effective as long as there are so many enclaves of trenchant poverty within and around them in the landscapes and we continue to by-pass practical routes to poverty alleviation. Poverty can be alleviated only if local actions spur economic development in which local communities have a rightful and fair share and can earn rewards for their entrepreneurships.
   Wood is a renewable, recyclable, versatile and sustainable natural resource. The demands for wood products are rising in developing countries, as their economies grow. They also face endemic wood deficits. This provides opportunities to pro-actively develop commercial forestry as a path to rural development and poverty alleviation. That would also assist national climate change mitigation measures, because forests sequester carbon, wood products are largely carbon positive and timber- based options are on hand to substitute for high emission materials such as concrete, steel and aluminium used to build our living environments.
   To move along this path, the businesses of tree growing by small-growers and local value adding should be strengthened, catalysing the entrepreneurial spirits of local people. Central to this is the need to put in place strategies to improve the productivity of and value from small scale enterprises; yet there is a serious lack of research and application to serve this key need. Among other constraints faced by small-growers include, lack of transparent and legal rights to land ownership in several countries, layers of bureaucratic regulations and the current international forest certification systems which are cumbersome and unaffordable for small-growers. Actions are possible and needed for simplifying or removing road blocks on all these fronts, along with, importantly, the development of markets for diverse products. Growth of the forestry sector as an engine for rural development warrants far greater recognition and investment than has been the case so far. We need to reimagine and strengthen the role of forestry including commercial wood business - green growth - as an effective path to rural development and poverty alleviation.

AB The beneficial effects of organic acids (OAs) excretion from plant roots were first proposed as being associated with the mechanism of superior phosphorus utilization by the cluster roots of white lupin (Lupinus albus L.), and these effects are now widely accepted as pleiotropic effects associated with stress tolerance of plants. Excreted OAs detoxify rhizotoxic aluminum, recruit beneficial bacterium for induced systemic resistance, and modify root architecture to enhance phosphorus starvation. OA excretion is probably optimized in the carbon economy and is coordinately regulated with other traits that additively confer each stress factor. Here we present an overview of the molecular physiology of OA excretion from roots, how plants activate OA excretion, and how this excretion can be managed as a specific response.

AB As cyclonic wind storms (hurricanes and typhoons) increase in frequency and intensity with climate change, it is important to understand their effects on the populations and communities of tropical trees they impact. Using tree demographic data from four large, tropical forest dynamics plots that differ in cyclonic storm frequency, we compare tree population and community dynamics. Additionally, we assess the effect of cyclonic storms on three functional traits, specific leaf area, wood density, and tree height of the dynamic tree assemblages. Mortality, growth and recruitment rates and the intrinsic rates of population growth of species differed across the plots, and were most dynamic, especially for stems 1-2 cm in diameter, at the plot which had an intermediate level of cyclonic storm frequency. Functional assemblages of species had the greatest degree of temporal variation in relation to disturbance, as measured by the change in functional divergence for the two plots with more intermediate cyclonic storm recurrence. Therefore, cyclonic storms affecting these plots generally have a greater effect on forest composition and dynamism than comparable cyclonic storms do on the plot which experiences cyclonic storms more frequently. Thus, we provide some evidence that community-wide demographic resistance to cyclonic storms is generally lower at an intermediate frequency of storms. While cyclonic storm strength and timing are important determinants of the within forest variation in tree dynamics and functional trait assemblages, we also show that cyclonic storm timing and frequency shapes tropical forest dynamics and functional composition across forests. We conclude that, over a given time interval, sites with intermediate levels of damaging cyclonic wind disturbance express a greater potential for life-history variation in the forest community, when compared to sites with less or more frequent disturbance.

TI Consequences of interspecific variation in defenses and herbivore host

AB We summarize work on a speciose Neotropical tree genus, Inga (Fabaceae), examining how interspecific variation in anti-herbivore defenses may have evolved, how defenses shape host choice by herbivores and how they might regulate community composition and influence species radiations. Defenses of expanding leaves include secondary metabolites, extrafloral nectaries, rapid leaf expansion, trichomes, and synchrony and timing of leaf production. These six classes of defenses are orthogonal, supporting independent evolutionary trajectories. Moreover, only trichomes show a phylogenetic signature, suggesting evolutionary lability in nearly all defenses. The interspecific diversity in secondary metabolite profiles does not arise from the evolution of novel compounds, but from novel combinations of common compounds, presumably due to changes in gene regulation. Herbivore host choice is determined by plant defensive traits, not host phylogeny. Neighboring plants escape each other's pests if their defenses differ enough, thereby enforcing the high local diversity typical of tropical forests. Related herbivores feed on hosts with similar defenses, implying that there are phylogenetic constraints placed on the herbivore traits that are associated with host use. Divergence in defensive traits among Inga appears to be driven by herbivore pressure. However, the lack of congruence between herbivore and host phylogeny suggests that herbivores are tracking defenses, choosing hosts based on traits for which they already have adaptations. There is, therefore, an asymmetry in the host-herbivore evolutionary arms race.

AB Environmental stressors and changes in land use have led to rapid and dramatic species losses. As such, we need effective monitoring programs that alert us not only to biodiversity losses, but also to functional changes in species assemblages and associated ecosystem processes. Ants are important components of terrestrial food webs and a key group in food web interactions and numerous ecosystem processes. Their sensitive and rapid response to environmental changes suggests that they are a suitable indicator group for the monitoring of abiotic, biotic, and functional changes. We tested the suitability of the incidence (i.e. the sum of all species occurrences at 30 baits), species richness, and functional richness of ants as indicators of ecological responses to environmental change, forest degradation, and of the ecosystem process predation on herbivorous arthropods. We sampled data along an elevational gradient (1000-3000m a.s.l.) and across seasons (wetter and drier period) in a montane rainforest in southern Ecuador. The incidence of ants declined with increasing elevation but did not change with forest degradation. Ant incidence was higher during the drier season. Species richness was highly correlated with incidence and showed comparable results. Functional richness also declined with increasing elevation and did not change with forest degradation. However, a null-model comparison revealed that the functional richness pattern did not differ from a pattern expected for ant assemblages with randomly distributed sets of traits across species. Predation on artificial caterpillars decreased along the elevational gradient; the pattern was not driven by elevation itself, but by ant incidence (or interchangeable by ant richness), which positively affected predation. In spite of lower ant incidence (or ant richness), predation was higher during the wetter season and did not change with forest degradation and ant functional richness. We used path analysis to disentangle the causal relationships of the environmental factors temperature (with elevation as a proxy), season, and habitat degradation with the incidence and functional richness of ants, and their consequences for predation. Our results would suggest that the forecasted global warming might support more active and species-rich ant assemblages, which in turn would mediate increased predation on herbivorous arthropods. However, this prediction should be made with reservation, as it assumes that the dispersal of ants keeps pace with the climatic changes as well as a one-dimensional relationship between ants and predation within a food-web that comprises species interactions of much higher complexity. Our results also suggested that degraded forests in our study area might provide suitable habitat for epigaeic, ground-dwelling ant assemblages that do not differ in incidence, species richness, functional richness, composition, or predation on arthropods from assemblages of primary forests. Most importantly, our results suggest that the occurrence and activity of ants are important drivers of ecosystem processes and that changes in the incidence and richness of ants can be used as effective indicators of responses to temperature changes and of predation within mega-diverse forest ecosystems.

AB As ecology and evolution become ever more entwined, many areas of ecological theory are being re-examined. Eco-evolutionary analyses of classic coexistence mechanisms are yielding new insights into the structure and stability of communities. We examine fluctuation-dependent coexistence models, identifying communities that are both ecologically and evolutionarily stable. Members of these communities possess distinct environmental preferences, revealing widespread patterns of limiting similarity. This regularity leads to consistent changes in the structure of communities across fluctuation regimes. However, at high amplitudes, subtle differences in the form of fluctuations dramatically affect the collapse of communities. We also show that identical fluctuations can support multiple evolutionarily stable communities - a novel example of alternative stable states within eco-evolutionary systems. Consequently, the configuration of communities will depend on historical contingencies, including details of the adaptive process. Integrating evolution into the study of coexistence offers new insights, while enriching our understanding of ecology.

AB In seasonal plant communities, it is recognized that topography-related variation in water availability and solar radiation determine vegetation structure and community composition; however, the effects on functional structure, particularly through changes in resource use strategies of plants are still poorly understood. This study examines the effects of slope aspect and topographic position on functional trait dominance in a tropical dry forest landscape and explores whether strategies for coping with drought (avoidance vs. tolerance) segregate spatially along the water stress gradient created by the interaction of these two topographic factors. The study was conducted in the Balsas river basin in south-central Mexico. Functional traits were evaluated in 63 species of trees (>= 2.5 cm diameter at breast height) dominant in plots located at three topographic positions (low, medium and high) and on two slope aspects (north and south). Eight leaf and four stem functional traits, relating to the plants' ability to avoid or tolerate water and temperature stress, were measured. Community-level functional traits were strongly affected by topographic position while only a weak signal was detected by the slope aspect. Contrary to our expectations, attributes associated with drought tolerance predominated on the lower topographic positions of the slopes, (moister and warmer sites), while on the upper parts with drier soil, but cooler air, attributes associated with water stress avoidance dominated. In addition, variation in the dominance of leaf pulvini and trichomes along the topographic gradient suggests environmental filtering by elevated air temperatures and water stress, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that the upper topographic positions that generate a shorter and more fluctuating water-availability window, favor readily-deciduous plants with high levels of water storage in their tissues, traits allowing for a rapid avoid of water stress, whereas on the lower topographic positions, where the soil remains moist for longer periods of time, tardily-deciduous species thrive with dense, low-water content tissues, attributes that are associated with physiological tolerance to drought.

AB Trait-based studies in community ecology have generally focused on the community as a unit where all species occur due to stochasticity, determinism or some mixture of the two. However, the processes governing population dynamics may vary greatly among species. We propose a core-transient framework for trait-based community studies where a core group of species has a strong link to the local environment while transient species have weaker responses to the environment. Consistent with the expectations of the framework, we found that common species exhibit clear linkages between performance and their environment and traits while rare species tend to have weaker or non-significant relationships. Ultimately, trait-based ecology should move beyond applying a set of processes to a community as a whole and towards quantifying inter-specific variation in the drivers of population dynamics that ultimately scale up to determine community structure.

AB In occupying an intermediate trophic position, herbivorous insects serve a vital link between plants at the base of the food chain and parasitoids at the top. Although these herbivore-mediated indirect plant-parasitoid interactions are well-documented, new studies have uncovered previously undescribed mechanisms that are fundamentally changing how we view tri-trophic relationships. In this review we highlight recent advances in this field focusing on both plant-driven and parasitoid-driven outcomes that flow up and down the trophic web, respectively. From the bottom-up, plant metabolites can impact parasitoid success by altering host immune function; however, few have considered the potential effects of other plant defense strategies such as tolerance on parasitoid ecology and behavior. From the top-down, parasitoids have long been considered plant bodyguards, but in reality the consequences of parasitism for herbivory rates and induction of plant defensive chemistry are far more complicated with cascading effects on community-level interactions.

AB Lianas are a common plant growth form in tropical forests, where they compete intensely with trees, decreasing tree recruitment, growth, and survival. If the detrimental effects of lianas vary significantly with tree species identity, as is often assumed, then lianas may influence tree species diversity and community composition. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that liana abundance and biomass are increasing relative to trees in neotropical forests, which will likely magnify the detrimental effects of lianas and may ultimately alter tree species diversity, relative abundances, and community composition. Few studies, however, have tested the responses of multiple tree species to the presence of lianas in robust, well-replicated experiments. We tested the hypotheses that lianas reduce tree seedling growth and survival, and that the effect of lianas varies with tree species identity. We used a large-scale liana removal experiment in Central Panama in which we planted 14 replicate seedlings of 14 different tree species that varied in shade tolerance in each of 16 80x80m plots (eight liana-removal and eight unmanipulated controls; 3136 total seedlings). Over a nearly two-yr period, we found that tree seedlings survived 75% more, grew 300% taller, and had twice the aboveground biomass in liana-removal plots than seedlings in control plots, consistent with strong competition between lianas and tree seedlings. There were no significant differences in the response of tree species to liana competition (i.e., there was no species by treatment interaction), indicating that lianas had a similar negative effect on all 14 tree species. Furthermore, the effect of lianas did not vary with tree species shade tolerance classification, suggesting that the liana effect was not solely based on light. Based on these findings, recently observed increases in liana abundance in neotropical forests will substantially reduce tree regeneration, but will not significantly alter tropical tree species diversity, relative abundance, or community composition.

ID ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; BIODIVERSITY; CHALLENGES
AB A preponderance of evidence suggests humanity is causing a mass extinction event: the sixth mass extinction since the rise of complex life on Earth:This paper takes this empirical conclusion as given and asks a philosophical question: what is the meaning of the sixth mass extinction? How should we think about it, what should we do about it, and what does it tell us about humanity and our place in the world? Conservationists typically see mass extinction as an immense loss, as does most of the general public. But how best to characterize this loss is not immediately clear, and how we do so has important practical implications. This paper focuses on three common and plausible ways to think about the sixth mass extinction: as a loss of important resources (a mistake); as interspecies genocide (a crime); and as evidence that humanity is a cancer on the biosphere (as an inevitability). Considered together, these three approaches clarify the meaning of the sixth mass extinction and suggest how humanity ought to respond to it. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Payments for watershed services (PWS) as a policy tool for enhancing water quality and supply have gained momentum in recent years, but their ability to lead to sustainable watershed outcomes is uncertain. Consequently, the demand for effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of PWS impacts on coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) and their implications for watershed sustainability (WS) is increasing. The theoretical foundations and practical applications of WS frameworks, which integrate biophysical and socioeconomic indicators to assess progress toward WS goals, have been extensively explored but rarely applied to PWS. We develop the PWS-WS framework as an approach for guiding indicator selection to improve knowledge about the complex drivers, interactions, and feedback between PWS and CHANS. A review of the PWS and WS literatures provides a basis for comparing and contrasting indicators. Using two case studies, we illustrate how applying the PWS-WS framework using a place-based, contextualized approach enhances potential for sustainable watershed outcomes.

AB Tropical forests are being rapidly altered by logging, and cleared for agriculture. Understanding the effects of these land use changes on soil fungi, which play vital roles in the soil ecosystem functioning and services, is a major conservation frontier. Using 454-pyrosequencing of the ITS1 region of extracted soil DNA, we compared communities of soil fungi between unlogged, once-logged, and twice-logged rainforest, and areas cleared for oil palm, in Sabah, Malaysia. Overall fungal community composition differed significantly between forest and oil palm plantation. The OTU richness and Chao 1 were higher in forest, compared to oil palm plantation. As a proportion of total reads, Basidiomycota were more abundant in forest soil, compared to oil palm plantation soil. The turnover of fungal OTUs across space, true beta-diversity, was also higher in forest than oil palm plantation. Ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungal abundance was significantly different between land uses, with highest relative abundance (out of total fungal reads) observed in unlogged forest soil, lower abundance in logged forest, and lowest in oil palm. In their entirety, these results indicate a pervasive effect of conversion to oil palm on fungal community structure. Such wholesale changes in fungal communities might impact the long-term sustainability of oil palm agriculture. Logging also has more subtle long term effects, on relative abundance of EcM fungi, which might affect tree recruitment and nutrient cycling. However, in general the logged forest retains most of the diversity and community composition of unlogged forest.

AB Response of growth and secondary metabolites to light intensity are useful measurements to determine suitable silviculture treatments for the cultivation of medicinal plants. Here, we analyzed the growth, flavonols (total flavonol, quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin) content, flavonols yield per plant, and expression of flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes in 2-year Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) seedlings at four different light intensities (100, 76, 40, and 25 % of full sunlight) in a greenhouse setting. Across all light intensities, the 76 % sunlight treatment produced the highest growth of total biomass, root, stem, and leaf, indicating negative effects of either fulllight or heavy shading on Ginkgo seedling development. Both flavonols (total flavonol, quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin) content and expression of flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes [PAL (Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase), CHS (Chalcone synthase), F3H (Flavanone 3-hydroxylase), and FLS (Flavonol synthase)] in leaves were highest under 100 % sunlight, suggesting that full sunlight promotes the expression of flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes and increases flavonoid biosynthesis. The highest and lowest flavonol contents were found in leaves and stems, respectively. The 76 % sunlight treatment produced the highest flavonols yield while the 100 % sunlight produced the highest flavonoids content in leaves, indicating that flavonol production per unit land area depends not only flavonol content but also biomass. Overall, in order to achieve the highest flavonols yield per area in Ginkgo leaf-harvesting plantations, it is important to manipulate light conditions of field.

AB A central issue in evolutionary biology is the exploration of functional trait variation among populations and the extent to which this variation has adaptive value. It was recently proposed that specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen concentration per mass (N-mass) and water use efficiency in cork oak play an important role in adaptation to water availability in the environment. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we explored, first, whether there was population-level variation in cork oak (Quercus suber) for these functional traits throughout its distribution range; if this were the case, it would be consistent with the hypothesis that different rainfall patterns have led to ecotypic differentiation in this species. Second, we studied whether the population-level variation matched short-term selection on these traits under different water availability conditions using two fitness components: survival and growth. We found high population-level differentiation in SLA and N-mass, with populations from dry places exhibiting the lowest values for SLA and N-mass. Likewise, reduced SLA had fitness benefits in terms of growth for plants under dry conditions. However, contrary to our expectations, we did not find any pattern of association between functional traits and survival in nine-year-old saplings despite considerable drought during one year of the study period. These results together with findings from the literature suggest that early stages of development are the most critical period for this species. Most importantly, these findings suggest that cork oak saplings have a considerable potential to cope with dry conditions. This capacity to withstand aridity has important implications for conservation of cork oak woodlands under the ongoing climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Land-use and land-cover (LULC) change is one of the largest drivers of biodiversity loss and carbon emissions globally. We use the tropical rainforests of the Amazon, the Congo basin and South-East Asia as a case study to investigate spatial predictive models of LULC change. Current predictions differ in their modelling approaches, are highly variable and often poorly validated. We carried out a quantitative review of 48 modelling methodologies, considering model spatio-temporal scales, inputs, calibration and validation methods. In addition, we requested model outputs from each of the models reviewed and carried out a quantitative assessment of model performance for tropical LULC predictions in the Brazilian Amazon. We highlight existing shortfalls in the discipline and uncover three key points that need addressing to improve the transparency, reliability and utility of tropical LULC change models: (1) a lack of openness with regard to describing and making available the model inputs and model code; (2) the difficulties of conducting appropriate model validations; and (3) the difficulty that users of tropical LULC models face in obtaining the model predictions to help inform their own analyses and policy decisions. We further draw comparisons between tropical LULC change models in the tropics and the modelling approaches and paradigms in other disciplines, and suggest that recent changes in the climate change and species distribution modelling communities may provide a pathway that tropical LULC change modellers may emulate to further improve the discipline. Climate change models have exerted considerable influence over public perceptions of climate change and now impact policy decisions at all political levels. We suggest that tropical LULC change models have an equally high potential to influence public opinion and impact the development of land-use policies based on plausible future scenarios, but, to do that reliably may require further improvements in the discipline.

AB Major insights into the relationship between life-history features and fitness have come from Lotka's proof that population growth rate is determined by the level (expected amount) of reproduction and the average timing of reproduction of an individual. But this classical result is limited to age-structured populations. Here we generalize this result to populations structured by stage and age by providing a new, unique measure of reproductive timing (T-c) that, along with net reproductive rate (R-0), has a direct mathematical relationship to and approximates growth rate (r). We use simple examples to show how reproductive timing T-c and level R-0 are shaped by stage dynamics (individual trait changes), selection on the trait, and parent-offspring phenotypic correlation. We also show how population structure can affect dispersion in reproduction among ages and stages. These macroscopic features of the life history determine population growth rate r and reveal a complex interplay of trait dynamics, timing, and level of reproduction. Our results contribute to a new framework of population and evolutionary dynamics in stage-and-age-structured populations.

AB The evidence for character displacement as a widespread response to competition is now building. This progress is largely the result of the establishment of rigorous criteria for demonstrating character displacement in the animal literature. There are, however, relatively few well-supported examples of character displacement in plants. This review explores the potential for character displacement in plants by addressing the following questions: (1) Why aren't examples of character displacement in plants more common? (2) What are the requirements for character displacement to occur and how do plant populations meet those requirements? (3) What are the criteria for testing the pattern and process of character displacement and what methods can and have been used to address these criteria in the plant literature? (4) What are some additional approaches for studying character displacement in plants? While more research is needed, the few plant systems in which character displacement hypotheses have been rigorously tested suggest that character displacement may play a role in shaping plant communities. Plants are especially amenable to character displacement studies because of the experimental ease with which they can be used in common gardens, selection analyses, and breeding designs. A deeper investigation of character displacement in plants is critical for a more complete understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes that permit the coexistence of plant species.

AB Pollinators serve critical roles for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, and have an estimated annual value of over $150 billion for global agriculture. Mounting evidence from agricultural systems reveals that pollinators are declining in many regions of the world, and with a lack of information on whether pollinator communities in natural systems are following similar trends, identifying factors which support pollinator visitation and services are important for ameliorating the effects of the current global pollinator crisis. We investigated how fire affects resource structure and how that variation influences floral pollinator communities by comparing burn versus control treatments in a southeastern USA old-field system. We hypothesized and found a positive relationship between fire and plant density of a native forb, Verbesina alternifolia, as well as a significant difference in floral visitation of V. alternifolia between burn and control treatments. V. alternifolia density was 44% greater and floral visitation was 54% greater in burned treatments relative to control sites. When the density of V. alternifolia was experimentally reduced in the burn sites to equivalent densities observed in control sites, floral visitation in burned sites declined to rates found in control sites. Our results indicate that plant density is a proximal mechanism by which an imposed fire regime can indirectly impact floral visitation, suggesting its usefulness as a tool for management of pollination services. Although concerns surround the negative impacts of management, indirect positive effects may provide an important direction to explore for managing future ecological and conservation issues. Studies examining the interaction among resource concentration, plant apparency, and how fire affects the evolutionary consequences of altered patterns of floral visitation are overdue.

AB Temporal and spatial variability in rainfall and subsequent resource flows often drive large changes in bird demography and the structure of avian assemblages in arid regions. Here, we describe broad avian functional group responses to rainfall across four vegetation classes in the Simpson Desert, central Australia, over a period when both dry and wet conditions prevailed. Birds were surveyed in eucalypt woodlands, gidyea woodlands, mixed Acacia (mulga) shrublands and spinifex-dominated hummock grasslands in this region between 2006 and 2008 using a spatially nested hierarchical sampling design with fixed radius point counts as replicates. Predictably, the composition of bird communities varied across vegetation classes as well as over time. Generalist feeders and insectivorous birds dominated assemblages during dry periods, whereas granivorous species were most abundant and widespread following heavy rains. Carnivores and specialist nectarivores responded variably throughout the sampling period regardless of habitat. The dynamics of granivores were especially interesting; large numbers of nomadic species moved into the study area in response to rainfall, highlighting a key role for this group in shaping community structure. This study represents the first attempt to investigate avian functional group dynamics across differing vegetation types in a variable but low productivity landscape. The findings confirm that community composition is spatially and temporally dynamic, and prompt further investigation into the roles that habitat and resource limitation play in defining bird communities in arid Australia.

AB Land cover change in watersheds affects the supply of a number of ecosystem services, including water supply, the production of timber and nontimber forest products, the provision of habitat for forest species, and climate regulation through carbon sequestration. The Panama Canal watershed is currently being reforested to protect the dry-season flows needed for Canal operations. Whether reforestation of the watershed is desirable depends on its impacts on all services. We develop a spatially explicit model to evaluate the implications of reforestation both for water flows and for other services. We find that reforestation does not necessarily increase water supply, but does increase carbon sequestration and timber production.

AB The stability of tropical systems has been hypothesized to explain the evolution of complex behavioral interactions among species. We evaluate the degree to which one highly evolved social system, mixed-species flocks, are stable in space and time in French Guiana, where flocks were characterized 17 years apart. These flocks are led by alarm-calling "sentinels," which may benefit from food flushed by other "beater" species. Using null models, we found that flock roost sites, home range overlap, and composition were more similar than expected by chance; home ranges were nearly identical between the two time periods. Such extremely stable conditions may be essential for the evolution and maintenance of the sentinel-beater system that appears to characterize some flocks. These results may reflect an evolutionarily stable strategy among potentially interdependent species within mixed-species flocks, where home ranges contribute to stability by being far larger than the most common local disturbances in the forest.

Ecosystem service valuation has been a hot topic in ecological economic research. The objective of this study was to analyze the changes in ecosystem services in response to oasis land-use change. Landsat images of September 2000 and ALOS images of September 2008 were combined with the published ecosystem service value coefficients about the world and China ecosystem to quantify land-use and ecosystem service changes. A sensitivity analysis was employed to determine the effect of manipulating these coefficients on the estimated values. The results indicate that: (1) the total value of ecosystem services in the Ugan-Kuqa River Delta Oasis increased from 8012 million Yuan in 2000 to 8323 million Yuan in 2008, mainly caused by the increasing areas of wetland. and high-cover grassland. Forest land produced most of the ecosystem services value of the study area, about 22% of the total value; (2) the aggregated ecosystem service value of forestland, cropland, medium-cover grassland, wetland, and water body was about 85% of the total value, indicating that these land-use categories play important roles in ecosystem services of the area; (3) waste treatment and soil formation were the top two ecological functions with high service value, contributing about 37% of the total services value; and (4) results of sensitivity analysis showed that the total ecosystem services value estimated in this study area was relatively inelastic with respect to the value coefficients. Therefore, the estimation in this study area was robust in spite of uncertainties on the value coefficients. The study suggests that a reasonable land-use plan should be made with emphasis on protecting wetland and grassland for maintaining stability and sustainable development of oases.

AB The processes involving pH modification, carboxylate exudation and phosphorus (P) dynamics in the rhizosphere of crops grown in intercropping are poorly understood. Two groups of maize (Zea mays L.) or faba bean (Vicia faba L.) plants (monocropping) or one group of plant of each species (intercropping) were grown between three 1-mm-thick soil layers; the central soil layer is referred to as inter-rhizosphere, and the two outer soil layers are designated sole-rhizosphere. Faba bean intercropped with maize had an 11% increase in shoot biomass and a 15% increase in P uptake compared with monocropped faba bean. The cropping pattern did not significantly influence maize growth. After 4 weeks of growth, faba bean significantly decreased soil pH in both the sole- and inter-rhizosphere in monocropping, but no effects were apparent for the intercropping rhizosphere. The major carboxylates in the rhizosphere of faba bean were malate (18-45nmolg(-1) soil) and maleate (1.2-2.4nmolg(-1) soil). Only trace amounts of carboxylates were measured in the rhizosphere of monocropped maize. However, intercropped maize had a high concentration of malate (similar to 11nmolg(-1) soil) in both sole- and inter-rhizosphere; the malate was likely exuded by faba bean and was then diffused to the sole-rhizosphere of intercropped maize. The amount of malate exuded by intercropped faba bean was 19% higher than with monocropped plants. The results indicate that diffusion of protons and carboxylates extended the interaction zone between maize and faba bean, and may have contributed to enhancements of P uptake in the intercropping system.

AB Should society have the right to freely available clean air and water, or should people be required to pay for these as commodities just as they do for many other goods or services that they consume? With this question and further questions on environmental governance in mind, we reviewed the paradigm shift in natural resource management from the polluter pays principle (PPP), which focuses on polluters and enforcement of thresholds, to the principle of payments for ecosystem services (PES), which emphasizes provider-based economic approaches. Given that there are conflicts of interest over natural resources and ecosystem services (ESs), these conflicts could be resolved through rights and/or cost assignments via third-party intervention, i.e., by the "state," or through private compensation beyond initial regulation and state-initiated assignments of cost. Our analysis includes an in-depth literature review and a description of existing policies on ESs. We also examine the so-called Coase theorem based on a "neutral" situation where no rights or costs are distributed in advance. This theorem provides room for the PPP approaches and the provider-gets approaches. Both of these approaches should ensure, given certain assumptions, an economically efficient allocation of resources; however, they still ignore two indispensable issues, namely, the ecologically sustainable scale and inherent qualities of ecosystems and the distributional effects. With regard to the relationship between these two sets of approaches and their respective relationship to the legal framework, PES programs can evolve instead of PPP where no regulations are in place, existing regulations are deemed to be insufficiently formulated, or regulations are not enforced at all. We also further address some critical issues that can arise when PES programs evolve instead of PPP in practice, such as the general necessity of PES to coexist with basic rights and legal obligations, inappropriate lexicographic claims from providers of ESs, alongside claims for potential damages and the relationship of PES with the intrinsic motivation of service providers. Critically, insufficient attention has been paid to the fact that by replacing the earlier PPP doctrine with the "provider-gets" principle, rights are redistributed from the public to the service provider with important distributional implications for society. Therefore, the replacement of PPP with PES includes obstacles as well as opportunities, in particular for the relationship between rich and poor, and developing and developed countries.

AB This study explores the long-term effects of fire treatments on biomass and nutrient pools in an open savanna from Central Brazil. Treatments included early, middle and late dry season burns every 2 years, a middle dry season burn every 4 years, and protection from fire on five 4-ha plots. We quantified aboveground biomass of graminoids and forbs/sub-shurbs, and their nutrient concentrations and stocks in both dry and wet seasons, and below-ground biomass down to 30-cm depth. We found strong differences between wet and dry season, with biomass and nutrient concentrations being highest in the wet season, across all fire treatments. Fire treatments had significant effects on plant nutrient stocks and root distribution, although total biomass was not affected. Concentrations of the most volatile nutrients (N, S, K and P) were higher in the herbaceous aboveground biomass of the quadrennial and the unburnt plots, suggesting that increases in fire frequency would reduce the amount of nutrients in aboveground biomass and increase the concentration of fine roots at the soil surface. Results highlight the role of fire in maintaining community dynamics in the Brazilian savanna. Overall, the quadrennial burn appears to be the optimal fire regime in open Cerrado vegetation.

AB Establishing which factors determine species distributions is of major relevance for practical applications such as conservation planning. The Amazonian lowlands exhibit considerable internal heterogeneity that is not apparent in existing vegetation maps. We used ferns as a model group to study patterns in plant species distributions and community composition at regional and landscape scales. Fern species composition and environmental data were collected in 109 plots of 250 x 2 m distributed among four sites in Brazilian Amazonia. Interplot distances varied from 1 to ca 670 km. When floristically heterogeneous datasets were analyzed, the use of an extended Sorensen dissimilarity index rather than the traditional Sorensen index improved model fit and made interpretation of the results easier. Major factors associated with species composition varied among sites, difference in cation concentration was a strong predictor of floristic dissimilarity in those sites with pronounced heterogeneity in cation concentration. Difference in clay content was the most relevant variable in sites with uniform cation concentrations. In every case, environmental differences were invariably better than geographic distances in predicting species compositional differences. Our results are consistent with the ideas that: (1) the relative predictive capacity of the explanatory variables depend on the relative lengths of the observed gradients; and (2) environmental gradients can be hierarchically structured such that gradients occur inside gradients. Therefore, site-specific relationships among variables can mask the bigger picture and make it more difficult to unravel the factors structuring plant communities in Amazonia.

AB This review focuses on the semiochemical interactions between ants and their soil environment. Ants occupy virtually every ecological niche and have evolved mechanisms to not just cope with, but also manipulate soil organisms. The metapleural gland, specific to ants was thought to be the major source of semiochemical antimicrobial compounds targeting general or specific deleterious microbes. The extremely diverse variety of semiochemicals and their sources with antimicrobial activity or potential activity is highlighted. The leaf-cutting ants and fire ant provide the most researched species, in part because they cause significant economic damage. The leaf-cutting ant is particularly interesting because researchers have uncovered unexpected interactions between leaf-cutting ant fungal farm, parasitic fungi, bacteria, yeasts, and ant defensive semiochemicals. These complex relationships highlight the multidimensional aspects of ants and the soil environment in which they live.

AB Understanding the pattern of species diversity and soil factors can enhance our knowledge of the mechanism of vegetation recovery, however, there is still a gap in the knowledge of succession rate and trend for species diversity in relation to soil nutrients during the vegetation recovery process. Patterns of species diversity and soil nutrients during the tropical vegetation recovery as well as the correlation between species diversity and soil nutrients were explored in Hainan Island, located in southern China. Plots assigned as grassland stage (GS), shrub stage (SS), secondary forest stage (SFS), and primary forest stage (PFS) were established using a chronosequence approach. Results showed that species richness and evenness increased from GS to PFS. Species dominance/diversity curves were fitted using the lognormal distribution model ( = 0.891-0.972). Species richness for the herb layer was maximal at SFS, whereas species richness for both the shrub layer and tree layer reached their maximum at PFS. Species turnover and soil total phosphorus decreased, whereas organic matter and total nitrogen increased from GS to PFS. Organic matter and total nitrogen were both positively correlated with species richness and total coverage, and total phosphorus was positively correlated with species turnover. The results clearly demonstrate that diversity asymptotically increases and positively correlates with increasing soil fertility, and the total phosphorus value is predicted to be an important soil factor that affects successional rate during tropical vegetation recovery processes.

AB (Fire and dynamics of a woody community in the cerrado of Barra do Garcas, Mato Grosso, Brazil). Studies on the dynamics and structure of woody vegetation after natural fires in Parque Estadual da Serra Azul have shown that fire affects plant survival and growth. The response of vegetation to fire depends on intensity, frequency and duration of burning. Ten plots (20 x 50 m) (Area 1) were burned in 2002 and 2005. Another ten plots (Area 2) were burned in 2002, 2005 and 2007. In January 2009, in Area 1, tree mortality was lower (2.0%) and recruitment (3.7%) higher than that observed Area 2 (4.3% and 0.05% respectively). Plant mortality decreased with increasing size class. In Area 2, there was a reduction in plant size (height and diameter). The resprouting pattern after fire was related to plant size. Smaller size classes had higher proportions of resprouting at the base of the stem while the larger size classes had more resprouts at the tree crown. In Area 2, species richness was reduced (estimated by Jacknife and Chao 2). Our results suggest that the tolerance of adult trees and smaller plants due to resprouting may explain the persistence of the woody cerrado community submitted to a fire regime interval over five years.

AB Background and Aims A long-running debate centres on whether shade tolerance of tree seedlings is mainly a function of traits maximizing net carbon gain in low light, or of traits minimizing carbon loss. To test these alternatives, leaf display, light-interception efficiency, and simulated net daily carbon gain of juvenile temperate evergreens of differing shade tolerance were measured, and how these variables are influenced by ontogeny was queried.
   Methods The biomass distribution of juveniles (17-740 mm tall) of seven temperate rainforest evergreens growing in low (approx. 4%) light in the understorey of a second-growth stand was quantified. Daytime and night-time gas exchange rates of leaves were also determined, and crown architecture was recorded digitally. YPLANT was used to model light interception and carbon gain.
   Results An index of species shade tolerance correlated closely with photosynthetic capacities and respiration rates per unit mass of leaves, but only weakly with respiration per unit area. Accumulation of many leaf cohorts by shade-tolerant species meant that their ratios of foliage area to biomass (LAR) decreased more gradually with ontogeny than those of light-demanders, but also increased self-shading; this depressed the foliage silhouette-to-area ratio (STAR), which was used as an index of light-interception efficiency. As a result, displayed leaf area ratio (LAR(d) = LAR x STAR) of large seedlings was not related to species shade tolerance. Self-shading also caused simulated net daily carbon assimilation rates of shade-tolerant species to decrease with ontogeny, leading to a negative correlation of shade tolerance with net daily carbon gain of large (500 mm tall) seedlings in the understorey.
   Conclusions The results suggest that efficiency of energy capture is not an important correlate of shade tolerance in temperate rainforest evergreens. Ontogenetic increases in self-shading largely nullify the potential carbon gain advantages expected to result from low respiration rates and long leaf lifespans in shade-tolerant evergreens. The main advantage of their long-lived leaves is probably in reducing the costs of crown maintenance.

AB Background and Aims While the climbing habit allows vines to reach well-lit canopy areas with a minimum investment in support biomass, many of them have to survive under the dim understorey light during certain stages of their life cycle. But, if the growth/survival trade-off widely reported for trees hold for climbing plants, they cannot maximize both light-interception efficiency and shade avoidance (i.e. escaping from the understorey). The seven most important woody climbers occurring in a Chilean temperate evergreen rainforest were studied with the hypothesis that light-capture efficiency of climbers would be positively associated with their abundance in the understorey.
   Methods Species abundance in the understorey was quantified from their relative frequency and density in field plots, the light environment was quantified by hemispherical photography, the photosynthetic response to light was measured with portable gas-exchange analyser, and the whole shoot light-interception efficiency and carbon gain was estimated with the 3-D computer model Y-plant.
   Key Results Species differed in specific leaf area, leaf mass fraction, above ground leaf area ratio, light-interception efficiency and potential carbon gain. Abundance of species in the understorey was related to whole shoot features but not to leaf level features such as specific leaf area. Potential carbon gain was inversely related to light-interception efficiency. Mutual shading among leaves within a shoot was very low (<20%).
   Conclusions The abundance of climbing plants in this southern rainforest understorey was directly related to their capacity to intercept light efficiently but not to their potential carbon gain. The most abundant climbers in this ecosystem match well with a shade-tolerance syndrome in contrast to the pioneer-like nature of climbers observed in tropical studies. The climbers studied seem to sacrifice high-light searching for coping with the dim understorey light.

AB Relative to closed-canopy tropical forests, tree seedlings planted in open grown areas are exposed to higher light intensity, air temperatures, vapor pressure deficit, and greater seasonal fluxes of plant available water than mature tropical forests. The species-specific adaptive capacity to respond to variable precipitation and seasonality in open grown conditions, therefore, is likely to affect species performance in large-scale reforestation efforts. In the present study, we compared the photosynthetic characteristics of eight tropical tree species within and between seasons at two study sites with contrasting dry season intensities. All species except Pseudosamanea guachapele reduced leaf physiological function between the wet and dry seasons. The contrasting severity of seasonal drought stress at the study sites constrained growth rates and photosynthetic characteristics differently. Variation of photosynthetic characteristics at the species level was high, particularly in the dry season. Faster growing species at the less seasonal site, Terminalia amazonia, Inga punctata, Colubrina glandulosa, and Acacia mangium, exhibited a greater adaptive capacity than the other species to down-regulate leaf photosynthesis between seasons. As the dry season was more severe at the more seasonal site, most species strongly reduced physiological function regardless of relative growth rates, except two species (Tectona grandis and P. guachapele) with widespread distributions and relatively high drought tolerance. Our results underscore the need to consider seasonal drought tolerance when selecting tree species for specific reforestation sites. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The authors present results on the relationship between treering proxies and regional precipitation for several sites in tropical South America. The responsiveness of oxygen isotopes (delta O-18) and seasonal growth as precipitation proxies was first validated by high-resolution sampling of a Tachigali myrmecophila from Manaus, Brazil (3.1 degrees S, 60.0 degrees W). Monthly growth of Tachigali spp. was significantly correlated with monthly precipitation. Intra-annual measurements of cellulose delta O-18 in Tachigali spp. were also significantly correlated with monthly precipitation at a lag of approximately one month. The annual ring widths of two tropical tree taxa, Cedrela odorata growing in the Amazon (12.6 degrees S, 69.2 degrees W) and Polylepis tarapacana growing in the Altiplano (22.0 degrees S, 66.0 degrees W), were validated using bomb-derived radiocarbon C-14. Estimated dates were within two to three years of bomb-inferred C-14 dates, indicating that these species exhibit annual rings but uncertainties in our chronologies remain. A multiproxy record spanning 180 years from Cedrela spp. showed a significant negative relationship between cellulose delta O-18 and January precipitation. A 150-yr record obtained from Polylepis spp. also showed a significant negative relationship between delta O-18 and March precipitation, whereas annual ring width showed a significant positive correlation with December precipitation. These proxies were combined in a multivariate framework to reconstruct past precipitation, revealing a significant increase in monsoon precipitation at the Amazon site since 1890 and a significant decrease in monsoon precipitation at the Altiplano since 1880. Proxy time series also showed spatial and temporal coherence with precipitation variability due to El Nino forcing, suggesting that oxygen isotopes and ring widths in tropical trees may be important diagnostics for identifying regional differences in the response of the tropical hydrologic cycle to anthropogenic warming.

AB This paper examines the possibilities that information and communication technology (ICT) provides for the achievement of environmental sustainable development - one of the key millennium development goals (MDGs). We base our paper on primary and secondary empirical data pertaining to the history of the governance of the Brazilian Amazon and the role of geographic information systems (GISs) in the region. Specifically, we argue that in order for the MDG to be achieved what is required is a thorough understanding of the differing institutional logics that have surrounded the past and current use of GIS in the Amazon region. We will argue that due to conflicting institutional logics the changes that have taken place in relation to the MDG of sustainability should be understood as being both emergent and contested. We will claim that the design and use of ICTs reflects the ways in which these conflicting logics are worked out at any moment in time. We conclude that in order for ICT to contribute to the MDGs, it is important to attend to the historical and contested institutional context and the potential for ICTs to be enacted in unanticipated ways.

AB Two issues of central importance to conservation are developing an improved understanding of the relative roles of state protected areas and local institutions and developing effective strategies for creating community-based incentives for conservation. We provide a case study of northern Tanzania's Maasai Steppe to explore these issues in the context of a savannah ecosystem where wildlife is mobile and depends extensively on community lands for seasonal habitats. We compare the impacts and outcomes of four approaches to developing local incentives for wildlife conservation on community lands: protected area benefit-sharing, trophy hunting donations, village-private tourism concession contracts, and a direct payment scheme for habitat conservation. Tourism and direct payment concession areas have resulted in large areas of community land being protected for wildlife by villages as a result of the conditional and contractual nature of these ventures. By contrast, other approaches that provide economic benefits to communities but are not conditional on defined conservation actions at the local level demonstrate little impact on wildlife conservation on community lands. In spatially extensive ecosystems where protected areas cover limited areas and wildlife relies heavily on community and private lands, strategies based on maximizing the direct income of communities from wildlife are fundamental to the sustainability of such systems.

AB The nature and extent of microbial biodiversity remain controversial with persistent debates over patterns of distributions (i.e. cosmopolitanism versus endemism) and the processes that structure these patterns (neutrality versus selection). We used culture-independent approaches to address these issues focusing on two groups of ciliates, the Oligotrichia (Spirotrichea) and Choreotrichia (Spirotrichea) across an environmental gradient. We assessed SSU rDNA diversity in ciliate communities at six stations in Long Island Sound spanning the frontal region that separates the fresher Connecticut River outflow plume from the open Sound. As in previous studies, we find one abundant cosmopolitan species (Strombidium biarmatum), a few moderately abundant sequences, and a long list of rare sequences. Furthermore, neither ciliate diversity nor species composition showed any clear relationship to measured environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, accessory pigment composition and chorophyll). Overall, we observed that diversity decreased moving from nearshore to offshore. We also conducted analyses to detect clustering among the sampled communities using the software Unifrac. This approach revealed three significant clusters grouping samples from nearshore, surface and deep/well mixed stations. We find no strong fit of our communities to log series, geometric or log normal distributions, though one of the 3 clusters is most consistent with a log series distribution. However, when we remove the abundant cosmopolitan species S. biarmatum, all three clusters fit to a log series distribution. These analyses suggest that, with the exception of one cosmopolitan species, the oligotrich and choreotrich communities at these stations may be distributed in a neutral manner.

AB Plant invasions have tremendous potential to alter food webs by changing basal resources. Recent studies document how plant invasions may contribute to increased arthropod abundances in detritus-based food webs. An obvious mechanism for this phenomenon-a bottom-up effect resulting from elevated levels of detritus from the invasive plant litter-has not been explicitly studied. We examined the effects of an annual grass invasion on ground arthropod assemblages in the coastal sage scrub (CSS) of southern California. Bottom-up food web theory predicts that the addition of detritus would increase generalist-feeding arthropods at all trophic levels; accordingly, we expected increases in fungi, Collembola, and common predators such as mites and spiders. For the common ant taxa, habitat alteration may also be important for predicting responses. Thus we expected that Forelius mccooki and Pheidole vistana, the most common ant species, would decline because of changes in soil temperature (F. mccooki) and habitat structure (P. vistana) associated with litter. We studied trends observationally and conducted a 3-year experiment in which we manipulated litter quantity. In contrast to other published studies, most detritus-based arthropod taxa declined in areas of high grass invasion, and, within trophic levels, responses often varied idiosyncratically. For the two most common taxa, a native ant (F. mccooki), and predatory mites in the Anystidae, we experimentally linked declines in abundance to increased levels of invasive grass litter. Such declines, especially those exhibited by the most common ant taxa, could have cascading effects on the CSS ecosystem, where ants are numerically dominant and thus may have broad influences on food web and ecosystem properties. Our results highlight that accurately predicting arthropod responses to invasive plant litter requires careful consideration of the structural and food resources provided by detritus to each particular food web.

AB Conserving natural vegetation cover is of critical importance for maintaining the ecological integrity and hydrological properties of large river basins (more than 100 000 km(2)). Recent estimates indicate that more than 700 000 km(2) of Brazilian Amazon have already been deforested, and to reduce further losses and preserve the important natural and cultural resources in this region, large conservation areas have been created by the Brazilian government. The present study analysed land cover and land use change in the major watersheds of the Brazilian Amazon, in order to evaluate the current balance between deforestation and conservation of natural areas in the region. The results show that watersheds draining the southern part of the basin have suffered the highest deforestation rates, with the largest losses (8.3-20% of total basin area) occurring in the Madeira, Tapajos, Xingu, Araguaia and Tocantins river basins. Most large watersheds already have significant deforestation in their headwaters, which can affect hydrological functions and ecological sustainability. The greatest allocation of land for conservation was encountered in the Trombetas, Xingu and Negro watersheds, where conservation areas occupied 92.5, 56.9 and 50.6% of the total basin, respectively. While extensive areas of the Amazon biome have been deforested, on the scale of large watersheds there is a positive balance between conservation areas and deforestation, and on average the area delimited by conservation areas is more than three times larger than the deforested areas. An analysis by subwatersheds, however, indicates that certain regions have achieved more critical levels of deforestation, in some situations affecting more than 80% of the subwatersheds.

AB Mixed dipterocarp forests are perhaps the single most important rain forest type in the wet tropics. Only a few studies have purposefully examined differences in resource availability across mixed dipterocarp forest landscapes by simply measuring the abiotic variables of light, soil nutrition and soil water availability in relation to forest structure. We sought to directly measure the environment of canopy gaps across elevation and geology-from lowland mixed dipterocarp forest (100 m amsl) to lower montane dipterocarp forest (1200 m amsl) in southwest Sri Lanka. Middle elevation gap sites (300-900 m amsl) were subdivided into valley, mid-slope and ridge topographic positions. Eighteen natural disturbances all of which were canopy openings caused by tree fall, were randomly selected within primary rain forest that ranged across 100-1200 m elevation. Plots were placed in gap centers and in adjacent understories and measurements taken of forest structure (basal area, canopy height, canopy cover index, CCI), shade (light sensors-photosynthetically active radiation [PAR], canopy hemispherical photographs-global site factor [GSF]) and soil nutrition (pH, exchangeable Al, K, Mg and Ca; Total N; and plant available P). Soil moisture was measured at bi-weekly intervals for five years across middle elevation sites only (300900 m amsl). Stand basal area, mean canopy height, and canopy cover index all declined with increase in elevation. Understory PAR and GSF decreased with increases in canopy height, basal area and CCI Size of canopy opening decreased with increase in elevation, but PAR and GSF increased. Valley sites had significantly greater levels of mean percent soil water content as compared to mid-slope and ridge sites of middle elevation sites. However, at the onset of the southwest monsoons in May all sites were similar. Differences were most pronounced during the dry season (December-April). No differences in soil moisture content could be found between gap and understory microsites. K and Ca in gap centers and adjacent forest understories increased with increase in elevation and change in associated geology. pH increased and Al decreased with elevation and associated geology but only for forest understory conditions. Results demonstrate strong differentiation in soil and light resources with elevation that appears related to size of tree-fall disturbance, stature of the forest, topographic position and underlying geology and soil-weathering environment. This suggests that forest management and conservation practices need to develop and tailor techniques and treatments (silviculture) to the forest that emulate and/or account for change in elevation, geology and topographic position. Further studies are needed to identify which are the primary underlying mechanisms (e.g. temperature, wind, soil nutrients, soil moisture availability) defining change in forest structure across elevation.

AB 1. Tropical forests have highly diverse and often dense understorey vegetation. However, little is known about the demography of tropical understorey species and their response to common events like flooding and gap formation that change the prevailing environmental conditions.
   2. We studied the influence of flooding and canopy gaps on the demography of the widespread clonal herb Heliconia metallica in 16 populations in the Peruvian Amazon over two wet and two dry seasons. In a factorial study design, we selected several populations in canopy gaps and under a closed canopy both at flooded and non-flooded sites.
   3. Using periodic matrix models, we determined projected population growth rates during seasonal and annual time intervals and applied prospective and retrospective analyses to identify the life cycle components that contributed most to the differences in annual growth rates among the four combinations of habitat conditions.
   4. All populations increased in size during the wet and decreased during the dry season. In both years, projected annual growth rates of the non-flooded populations were less than 1 both in gaps and under a closed canopy. In contrast, over the 2-year study period growth rates of the flooded populations were close to 1 both in gaps and under a closed canopy.
   5. The life history of H. metallica was dominated by ramet survival and clonal growth, whereas seedling recruitment was very rare. In canopy gaps, growth and clonal expansion were rapid and reproduction was frequent, whereas under a closed canopy ramets grew little and rarely flowered. Population decline at non-flooded sites was due to higher ramet mortality during the dry season. However, the effects of flooding and canopy gaps interacted and affected life-history components differently in wet and dry seasons and in successive years.
   6. Synthesis. The intricate interacting effects of flooding and canopy gaps determine the population dynamics of the understorey herb H. metallica. The clonal life form and the plasticity of the ramets enable the populations to persist under variable light conditions, but may not be able to buffer the increasingly frequent periods of drought in Amazon forests.

AB To examine whether the Janzen-Connell hypothesis is valid in temperate forests, we investigated the density, growth, mortality, and agents of mortality of seedlings and the density, size, and age of saplings of Prunus grayana Maxim. at three distances (0-3, 6-10, and 16-26 m) from conspecific adults in a temperate forest in Japan. An inoculation experiment was also conducted to test the host range of a leaf pathogen. The probability of mortality was highest at 0-3 m during the first 2 years of growth. Mortality mainly resulted from distance-dependent attack by two types of pathogen that caused damping-off epidemics and spot symptoms on leaves. The leaf pathogen was identified as Phaeoisariopsis pruni-grayanae Sawada, which infected many more seedlings of Prunus grayana than of the two other tree species tested in an inoculation experiment. The vertical and diameter growth was lowest at 0-3 m and highest at 16-26 m in both seedlings and saplings. As a result, the greatest number of large and older saplings was observed at 16-26 m. Our results demonstrate that the Janzen-Connell mechanism operates in a beech-dominated forest in the temperate region of Japan.

AB In this study, we hypothesized that invasive species may allocate a higher fraction of leaf nitrogen (N) to photosynthesis than phylogenetically related native species. To test this hypothesis, we determined N allocation and other ecophysiological traits of three invasive species in comparison with their respective native congeners by measuring response curves of photosynthesis to intercellular CO2 concentration. The invasive species of Peperomia and Piper indeed allocated a higher fraction of leaf N to photosynthesis and were more efficient in photosynthetic N (N-P) partitioning than their native congeners. The two invasive species partitioned a higher fraction of N-P to carboxylation and showed a higher use efficiency of N-P, while their native congeners partitioned a higher fraction of N-P to light-harvesting components. The higher N allocation to photosynthesis and the higher N-P partitioning to carboxylation in the two invaders were associated with their higher specific leaf area. Nitrogen allocation and partitioning were the most important factors in explaining the differences in light-saturated photosynthetic rate and photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE) between the two invasive species and their native congeners. The differences in N allocation-related variables between the invasive and native species of Amaranthus could not be evaluated in this study due to the method. Except PNUE, resource capture- and use-related traits were not always higher in all three invasive species compared to their native congeners, indicating that different invasive species may have different syndrome of traits associated with its invasiveness.

AB Ants are important components of most soil invertebrate communities, and can affect the flow of energy, nutrients and water through many terrestrial ecosystems. The vast majority of ant species build nests in the mineral soil, but a small group of ants in temperate and boreal forests of Eurasia and North America build large parts of their nests above-ground using organic materials collected from the surrounding soil. Many studies have shown that ants nesting in mineral soil can affect water infiltration rates, soil organic matter (OM) content, and nutrient cycling, but much less is known on how mound-building ants influence soil physical and chemical properties. In this paper we summarize what is known on the soil impacts of organic mound-building ants in temperate and boreal forests, and how these ants could be affected by ecosystem disturbance and future climate change. Much of this information comes from studies on Formica rufa group ants in Europe, which showed that CO2 emissions and concentrations of C, N, and P are usually higher in ant mounds than in the surrounding forest soil. However, ant mounds are a minor component of total soil C and nutrient pools, but they do increase spatial heterogeneity of soil water and available nutrients. Mound-building ants can also impact tree growth, which could change the quantity and quality of OM added to soil. Forest management, fire, and projected climate change, especially in boreal forests, could affect mound-building ant population dynamics, and indirectly, soil properties.

AB Fragmentation combined with habitat loss can affect population persistence mainly by isolating habitat fragments. However, this isolation depends, in part, on the species' perception of the surrounding matrix compared to remnant characteristics. Coastal forests of the Maule region have been severely fragmented. Surprisingly, forest remnants embedded in a pine plantation matrix hold most of the avian species expected for this kind of forest. This pattern has been explained by the fact that the structure of pine plantations may not be too different from that of native forests, allowing plantations to act as a "soft barrier" to dispersal among fragments. With playback experiments, we evaluated the effect of the structure of Monterey pine plantations, expressed as stand age, and understory cover, on the willingness of three ground-dwelling forest species (Rhinocryptidae: Pteropotochos castaneus, Scytalopus fuscus, and Eugralla paradoxa) to move from native remnants into pine plantation matrix during the breeding season 2004-2005 in the coastal range of south-central Chile. The distance of intrusion into the matrix of all species was positively related to understory cover. Only the movement of P. castaneus was significantly related to stand age. These attributes and their spatial array may affect functional connectivity and therefore species dispersal and population persistence in this fragmented landscape. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

   RESPONSES
AB 1. Associational resistance occurs when one plant species gains protection from its consumers by association with a defended species. In semi-arid ecosystems of Chile, the perennial herb Convolvulus chilensis (Convolvulaceae) suffers heavy herbivory by small mammals when growing prostrate but plants seem to be protected when they are climbing onto cacti or thorny shrubs (nurse species).
   2. Field observations suggest that damaged main stems have a greater number of small lateral stems, which greatly enhance climbing success. In this field study we addressed whether C. chilensis shows associational resistance by climbing onto nurse species, and evaluated whether damage and also shade (a cue for neighbour presence) elicit architectural responses that enhance climbing probability.
   3. We documented associational resistance for C chilensis: climbing individuals growing associated with cacti and thorny shrubs suffered less herbivory (percentage of damaged stems: 35 vs. 98) and had greater reproductive output (number of reproductive structures at the end of the season: 150 vs. 0) than prostrate individuals growing in isolation. Experimental clipping of the main stem caused plants to produce a greater number of lateral stems both in sun (70% increase) and in shade (66% increase) treatments. Moreover, stem damage caused a 50% increase in the number of stems actually climbing on a support, but only in shade.
   4. Synthesis. We show for the first time that phenotypic responses to herbivory of the potentially protected species may enhance association with the defended nurse species, thereby promoting associational resistance. This finding adds a new perspective for mechanistic studies of positive interactions among plants, suggesting that behavioural responses of the protegee may mediate the magnitude of nurse effects.

AB We report on a systematic survey of the ant fauna occurring in hardwood forests in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. At 22-mixed hardwood sites, we collected leaf-litter ant species using Winkler samplers. At eight of those sites, we also collected ants using pitfall and Malaise traps. In total, we collected 53 ant species. As shown in other studies, ant species richness tended to decline with increasing elevation. Leaf-litter ant assemblages were also highly nested. Several common species were both locally abundant and had broad distributions, while many other species were rarely detected. Winkler samplers, pitfall traps, and Malaise traps yielded samples that differed in composition, but not richness, from one another. Taken together, our work begins to illuminate the factors that govern the diversity, distribution, abundance, and perhaps rarity of ants of forested ecosystems in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

AB 1. Understanding whether Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can be considered as a suitable tool for restoring the structure and function of populations and assemblages is urgently needed to achieve an effective policy of mitigation of human impact in coastal management. However, to date, the role played by MPAs in enhancing ecosystems resilience has been more advocated than unambiguously documented.
   2. This study was designed to test whether full protection in marine reserves facilitates recovery of benthos impacted by the date mussel Lithophaga lithophaga fishery, one of the most harmful human activities affecting subtidal rocky habitats in the Mediterranean Sea.
   3. The effects of this destructive fishery were reproduced at one fully protected location (P) and at two unprotected control locations (Cs) in the SW Mediterranean Sea. At each location, three plots (4 m(2)) of rocky surface at 4-6 m depth were disturbed experimentally, while another three plots served as reference. In each plot, the species composition and relative cover of the sessile benthic assemblages were sampled photographically on each of five occasions during a period of 20 months.
   4. Over and above variation in habitat features among locations, multivariate and univariate analyses revealed significant differences between P-vs.-Cs in patterns of assemblage recovery and showed that, at the fully protected location, recovery was faster than at the unprotected control locations.
   5. Our results suggest that MPAs have the potential to change the trajectories of recovery of disturbed assemblages by accelerating the processes of recolonization and call for further investigation to identify the specific mechanisms underlying increased resilience.

AB Natural communities are highly complex and dynamic over time, with populations structured by numerous abiotic and biotic forces acting through direct and indirect pathways. Multispecies Autoregressive (MAR) modeling can be used to partition effects of variables that are interrelated and temporally autocorrelated in time series from natural systems. Here we address two main questions in applying MAR models to community time series. First, what is the effect of observation scale on interpretation of community dynamics? We used a 10-year weekly planktonic time series from Lake Washington to construct multiple "biweekly" and "monthly" data sets, and compared resulting community interaction models. Direct abiotic effects and intraspecific autocorrelation were apparent using all data sets. Biotic interactions were more apparent using biweekly and monthly data, indicating that time lags longer than one week were necessary to detect numerical response to interspecific interactions. Second, we examined effects of dropping the winter months from our analyses to simulate the common practice of sampling only during the "growing season" in long-term ecological studies. We found that biotic interactions remained similarly characterized in models using only non-winter months, but that the importance of seasonal physical factors nearly disappeared in non-winter models. Exclusion of winter data in sampling designs may therefore allow us to characterize biotic interactions, although it may not help us understand populations' relationships to seasonal abiotic variables. The models supported many previous findings from experimental and qualitative investigations of Lake Washington community interactions, implying that MARs provided plausible characterizations of community dynamics, but some previously unconsidered relationships did emerge, such as the importance of cryptomonads and picoplankton for zooplankton growth. We conclude that explicit consideration of time lags in biotic response is necessary to understand relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors, and that sampling regime can therefore strongly influence our interpretations of community dynamics.

AB Interspecific and intraspecific competition in seedling banks may be important determinants of regeneration success in some groups of canopy trees, e.g. dipterocarps in south-east Asian tropical rain forests, and the outcomes of these competitive interactions may contribute to the maintenance of the high levels of plant diversity.
   We present the results of an experiment examining the effects of seedling bank diversity within canopy gaps on seedling growth, architecture and levels of insect herbivore defoliation over 18 months. Within each of six experimental canopy gaps, we planted two conspecific blocks of Shorea leprosula (Dipterocarpaceae) seedlings and two heterospecific blocks of S. leprosula seedlings amongst four other dipterocarp species with differing growth rates and palatability to herbivores.
   The growth allocation patterns of S. leprosula differed according to whether they were planted among conspecifics or heterospecifics. Although S. leprosula seedlings grew taller in conspecific stands, their above ground biomass did not differ between planting treatments, due to increased branching and leaf area in seedlings in the heterospecific stands.
   Shorea leprosula displayed the lowest levels of antiherbivore defences and sustained the greatest levels of defoliation of all species studied. Despite an increase of almost 60% in leaf damage in conspecific vs. heterospecific stands, neither biomass nor survival of S. leprosula seedlings differed between stands over the 18-month growth period.
   The important effects of neighbourhood composition on the growth and herbivory of S. leprosula seedlings, suggest that diversity of seedling banks can be an important determinant of regeneration success and, thus, forest dynamics. Neighbourhood composition may have similar impacts on competitive outcomes and biomass allocation patterns in other ecological communities.

AB In NW Patagonia, forestry with rapid growing species is an expanding practice, especially in the semi-arid steppe. To provide data for managing forests for biodiversity, we studied the impact of forestry on the native ant assemblages. We sampled ants using pitfall traps in a wide geographical area, including steppe sites and pine plantations, both dense (forest cover 87% in average) and sparse (forest cover 52% in average) designs. We measured and analyzed ant abundance, species richness and species composition as response variables. Through our results, we show that ants are highly sensitive to pine tree forests. Ant abundance within plantations is lower and species composition significantly impoverished. However, the more open plantations sustained ant assemblages which resemble those of the native steppe samples. This is probably because the open forests allow for native under-story vegetation to grow as in the natural steppe sites. We suggest that tree presence in an otherwise shrub and grass dominated area is responsible for the changes in the ant assemblages. We also note that the presence of native vegetation cover predicts ant assemblage composition in these arid zones. From an applied point of view, our findings suggest that a more open plantation design will be accompanied by higher ant abundances and species richness, which in turn may bring about consequences for sustainable forest management in the area.

AB In the tropical Atlantic Forest, 42 canopy gaps had their areas estimated using four different field methods of measurement: Runkle, Brokaw and Green [Runkle, J.R., 1981. Gap formation in some old-growth forests of the eastern United States. Ecology 62, 1041-1051; Brokaw, N.V.L., 1982. The definition of treefall gap and its effect on measures of forest dynamics.

Ecol. 12, 427-434] and a new method proposed in this work. It was found that within the same gap delimitation, average gap size varied from 56.0 up to 88.3 m(3) while total sum of gap area varied from 2351.3 to 3707.9 m(3) Differences among all methods and between pairs of method proved to be statistically significant. As a consequence, gap size-class distribution was also different between methods. When one method is held as a standard, deviation on average values of gap size ranged between 11.8 and 59.7% as deviations on single gap size can reach 172.8%. Implications on forest dynamics were expressed by the forest turnover rate that was 24% faster or 15% slower depending on the method adopted for gap measurement. Based on my results and on methods' evaluation, the use of a new method is proposed here for future research involving the measure of gap size in forest ecosystems. Finally, it is concluded that forest comparisons disregarding the influence of different methods of gap measurement should be reconsidered. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reproductive phenology, floral biology, degree of self-incompatibility, and floral visitors of Erythrina falcata were studied in an Argentinean population. Flowering occurs during the dry season from late August to late October. Flower lifetime is 5-6 d. Phylogenetic studies indicate that E falcata, together with E. Jusca and E. crista-galli, are included in a basal clade within Erythrina. Its phylogenetic position, floral morphology, and nectar characteristics suggest a hummingbird-passerine mixed pollination system. The flowers are nontubular, and the vexillum (the upper petal of the corolla) covers the other remaining floral parts until displaced by a visiting passerine (Icterus cayanensis) or a hummingbird (Amazilia chionogaster). Both birds act as pollen vectors. Bees were observed as occasional pollinators. Nectar production begins at anther dehiscence and coincides with maximum stigmatic receptivity. The base of the keel forms a secondary nectar reservoir. Controlled pollinations showed that this species is self-incompatible, although a fewfruits develop from selling. Pollen:ovule ratio (43,200:7) is as expected for a xenogamous plant. Only 1 percent of the flowers set seeds under natural conditions. Possible explanations for the low reproductive success are discussed.

AB This study addressed the effect predation on gastropods by shell-breaking crabs has on shell availability to hermit crabs. (1) Variable rates of predation on the gastropod Cerithium atratum were recorded within and among the crab species Menippe nodifrons, Panopeus occidentalis, Eriphia gonagra, and Callinectes danae. Predation rate was more dependent on crab size than on crab species, and all predators consumed the largest individuals of C. atratum available. Comparison of M. nodifrons and C. danae predation of the rocky shore gastropods Stramonita haemastoma, Morula nodulosa, and Tegula viridula revealed that only M. nodifrons consumed M. nodulosa, while both crabs preyed more heavily upon S. haemastoma than on T. viridula. M. nodifrons crushed larger individuals of Stramonita. (2) Prey subjected to M. nodifrons and C. danae presented different critical sizes (S. haemastoma > T viridula = M. nodulosa. (3) The investment in shell material varied among gastropod species (M. nodulosa > T viridula > S. haemastoma) and was inversely related to their consumption rate by M. nodifrons. (4) M. nodifrons generally crushed its prey, C. danae and E. gonagra used both peeling and crushing, and P. occidentalis generally peeled. Crushing was usually lethal, while peeling attempts resulted in higher prey survival. Predatory strategy was dependent on relative prey size: small shells were crushed, medium-sized were peeled, and large ones were non-destructively preyed upon through the aperture. (5) Most shells used by the hermit crab Pagurus criniticornis (68%) in nature presented damage very similar to that recorded for gastropods preyed upon experimentally, indicating that this kind of predation makes new shells available to hermit crabs. (6) M. nodifrons showed a clear preference for the gastropod C. atratum over the hermit crab P. criniticornis, suggesting differential predation pressures in nature. In conclusion, shell availability to hermit crabs was demonstrated to be dependent on predator species and size, gastropod architectural defenses, and on the relative predator-prey size, which determined the predatory strategy and the damage inflicted on the shells.

AB Question: Is tree regeneration in canopy gaps characterized by chance or predictable establishment.
   Location: Coastal scarp forests, Umzimvubu district, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.
   Methods: Estimation of richness of gap-filling species across canopy gaps of different size. Data are compared with regeneration under the canopy. Probability of self-replacement of gap forming species is calculated.
   Results: Forest area under natural gap phase was 7.8%, caused mostly by windthrow (54%). The abundance and average size of gaps (87.8 m(2)) suggests that species diversity may be maintained by gap dynamics. However, only four of 53 gap-filler species displayed gap size specialization and these were pioneer species. An additional 13 species were more common in larger gaps but there was no gradient in composition of gap-filler species across gap size (p = 0.61). Probabilities of self-replacement in a gap were low (< 0.3) and common canopy species were equally abundant in gaps and the understorey. Species composition in gaps showed no pattern of variation, i.e. was unpredictable. which suggests absence of a successional sequence within tree-fall gaps. There was also only a slight increase in species richness in gaps at intermediate levels of disturbance.
   Conclusions: Coastal scarp forest appears not to comprise tightly co-evolved, niche-differentiated tree species. Unpredictable species composition in gaps may be a chance effect of recruitment limitation of species from the species pool. Chance establishment slows competitive exclusion and may maintain tree diversity in these forests. These data suggest that current levels (3 gaps per ha) of selective tree harvesting may not cause a reduction in species richness in this forest.

AB Growth form gradually changes during ontogeny through juvenile, reproductive, and senescent phases in perennial herbs, but resulting effects on plant structure, functioning and role in the community are poorly characterized. Here, biomass distribution, leaf structure and nutrients were studied in relation to irradiance and age state in the temperate meadow perennial Leontodon hispidus in the field.
   Plant ontogeny modified plastic responses to irradiance with most plastic changes in leaf dry mass per area in reproductive and most plastic LAR alterations in young individuals. Due to age-dependent changes, light interception efficiency was maximised in young, and photosynthetic potential in reproductive specimens, while senescent plants had inferior light interception and use, but were probably more competitive for below-ground resources.
   Species age spectrum shifted to senescent phases, and the fractional biomass to below-ground in sites with higher species richness.
   These results collectively demonstrate a strong effect of ontogeny on dry matter partitioning, leaf architecture and functioning, and plastic adjustments in these traits and suggest that species competitive potentials change through the ontogeny.

AB The nature or structure of competition within communities has been a dynamic area of practical and theoretical research for a number of decades. Certain components of some communities have proved hard to incorporate within such studies; in marine benthic work this has included the sponges. In this study, intra- and inter-phyletic interactions involving sponges (7,817 in total) were studied on 125 rocks (ranging in surface area from 10 to 2,438 cm(2)) at a site experiencing low disturbance levels at Lough Hyne Marine Nature Reserve, Co. Cork, Ireland. The outcomes of sponge-sponge (intra-phyletic) interactions were significantly different in both outcome and structure to those involving sponges and representatives of other phyla. Typically sponge-sponge competition resulted in a much higher number of tied outcomes than did inter-phyletic encounters. Sponges over-grew, all groups of organisms with the exception of some cnidarians and ascidians. The morphology of any sponge species (thickness in most cases) was important in determining the outcome of intra-phyletic, but not inter-phyletic, interactions. Sponges which exhibited thick (>2 mm) crusts were, in the majority of interactions, superior competitors compared to the thin (<1 mm) crusts. However, the method used to rank species (i.e. wins:loss or wins:total ratio) made a significant difference to the ranking of sponge competitors. The transitivity of the sponge assemblage investigated was calculated using the index formulated by Tanaka and Nandakumar (1994) as 0.23, indicating the assemblage to be organised as a network rather than a hierarchical system. We suggest this network of principally tied outcomes (due to standoffs) may be maintained in part by chemical interaction. However, in the absence of disturbance, the network is more likely to be mediated through processes of growth and regression of tissues during summer and winter months respectively.

AB We examine how species richness and species-specific plant density (number of species and number of individuals per species, respectively) vary within community size frequency distributions and across latitude. Communities from Asia, Africa, Europe, and North, Central and South America were studied (60degrees4'N-41degrees4'S latitude) using the Gentry data base. Log-log linear stem size (diameter) frequency distributions were constructed for each community and the species richness and species-specific plant density within each size class were determined for each frequency distribution. Species richness in the smallest stem size class correlated with the Y-intercepts (beta-values) of the regression curves describing each log-log linear size distributions. Two extreme community types were identified (designated as type A and type B). Type A communities had steep size distributions (i.e. large beta-values), log-log linear species-richness size distributions, low species-specific plant density distributions, and a small size class (2-4 cm) containing the majority of all species but rarely conspecifics of the dominant tree species. Type B communities had shallow size distributions (i.e. small beta-values), more or less uniform (and low) size class species- richness and species-specific density distributions and size-dominant species resident in the smallest size class. Type A communities were absent in the higher latitudes but increased in number towards the equator, i.e. in the smallest size class, species richness increased (and species-specific density decreased) towards the tropics. Based on our survey of type A and type B communities (and their intermediates), species richness evinces size-dependent and latitudinal trends, i.e. species richness increased with decreasing body size and most species increasingly reside in the smallest plant size class towards the tropics. Across all latitudes, a trade-off exists between the number of species and the number of individuals per species residing in the smaller size classes.

AB Wood ants (Formica spp.) were hypothesised to affect the composition and greatly reduce the abundance of large-sized soil fauna by predation. This was tested in two ways. Firstly, a 4-year-long experimental study was carried out in a mixed forest. Five ant-free 1.3 m(2) 2 plots were created by fenced exclosures within an ant territory. Five nearby plots had fences with entrances for the ants. In addition, five non-fenced control plots were selected. Soil fauna (e.g. Coleoptera, Diptera larvae, Collembola and Araneae) was sampled during the summers of 1997-2000. The soil fauna was affected by the exclosures but there was no detectable effect of ants on the soil fauna. Secondly, soil fauna was studied within a large-scale natural experiment in which the long-term (30 years) effects of red wood ants could be assessed inside and outside ant territories. This long-term natural experiment revealed no significant effects of ants on the abundance or composition of soil fauna. The results from the two studies indicate that the effects of wood ants on soil fauna are fairly small. The hypothesis that wood ants are key-stone predators on soil fauna could, thus, not be supported.

AB We tested if fragmentation alters ant species (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) composition, through the similarity of species composition within the remnants with matrix habitat. We sampled 17 tropical forest remnants and adjoined grassland matrix. Species composition was altered by fragmentation, because although total species richness increased with remnant area, the proportion of generalist ant species (occurring both in the matrix and in the forest) decreased. Four mechanisms may explain the above patterns: (i) fragmentation changed conditions inside the remnants, favoring species formerly only present in forest gaps; (ii) isolation effects changed the pool of species able to colonize different remnants; (iii) fragmentation increased invasion by generalist species, through the increase in perimeter/area ratio and conditions more similar to matrix habitats; and (iv) area reduction is higher than perimeter reduction. Smaller remnants lose more species than larger ones and receive less species from the matrix than large remnants, which explains the patterns found.

AB The population dynamics of 8500 shade-tolerant tree seedlings of 13 tree species were followed for 10 years at rain forests in Lambir Hills National Park and Bako National Park, Malaysian Borneo. Since these dipterocarp forests have lower rates of canopy gap formation than do rain forests elsewhere, tree seedling biology was predicted to differ. Approximately 50% of seedlings present in 1986 were still alive in 1996. Seven out of thirteen had seedling populations composed predominantly of individuals that were at least 10 years old. These seedlings can undergo alternating periods of relatively rapid and slow growth. Many seedlings that grew rapidly in the first census interval survived through a period of suppression in the second census interval, and conversely many seedlings with a history of suppression had exceptionally high growth in the final census interval. Seedlings of South-East Asian forest tree species arc long-lived and appear to be adapted to long periods of suppression in the understorey.

AB When applied to the sea, the wilderness concept of preserving large areas from human effects throws light on marine conservation ethics, pragmatism, and practice. I compared problem.,; of land wilderness with those involving the sea, where social and technical preparedness for conservation lags behind that for the land. I describe marine applications related to wilderness and provide examples from various jurisdictions. Daunting marine attributes of scale, dynamism, and connectedness, as well as scientific and cultural uncertainty, weaken maritime application of the wilderness notion. Three main problems with this application are (1) protecting large enough areas, (2) defining desired marine ecosystem states with attendant roles for humans, and (3) addressing society's underdeveloped marine environmental awareness and ethics, The first relates to the practicality of establishing large preserved areas near populated compared with unpopulated areas. The second relates to accommodating coastal-community subsistence given the ethics and realities of coastal poverty, indigenous peoples' status, and rural lifestyles. The third relates to public, confusion over maritime governance, uncertainty over appropriate civility toward marine resources, and cultural expectations offireedom on the seas. These issues foster political indecision and strong opposition from some fishery and coastal-community sectors to conservation of marine areas. Perhaps the value-laden wilderness term still carries too much terrestrial preservationist baggage for sea areas that (ire viewed as commons by many. The wilderness ideal is but one point on a conservation continuum ranging from strict preservation to humans as part of nature. The laudable ideal of wilderness has a role in addressing the need for rapid progress in marine conservation, but we should be circumspect in applying the wilderness concept to the sea.

AB Grazing is an important determinant of the spatial and temporal patterns of distribution of intertidal organisms on rocky shores. This process is Likely to interact with other environmental factors at different scales in space and time. Understanding these interactions is important before generalizations about the ecological role of grazing can be advanced. In the present study. the ecological significance of grazing was evaluated by excluding limpets from mid-shore levels on rocky coasts in the northwest Mediterranean. Alternative models were evaluated leading to different predictions about the interactive effects of limpets, slope of the substratum and season. These models were distinguished on the basis of spatial and temporal consistency in these interactions. The null hypothesis of consistent effects of limpets was examined at relatively small (0.1 to 5 km) and large (100s of km) spatial scales, between seasons (summer vs winter), between dates within seasons, and in relation to slope of the substratum (horizontal vs vertical substrata). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated inconsistencies in the effects of limpets at different spatial and temporal scales. Interactions between grazing, slope of the substratum and season changed from shore to shore, and strong effects of limpets were observed only occasionally. This variability is discussed in relation to differences in productivity and intensity of recruitment of algae among shores.

AB Competition for food can influence the coexistence of species via habitat selection, and learned behavior can influence foraging decisions. I investigated whether learned behavior and competition act together to influence species interactions between three coexisting hummingbird species: black-chinned (Archilochus alexandri), blue-throated (Lampornis clemenciae), and magnificent (Eugenes fulgens) hummingbirds. I found that color cue use by individuals affects not only their foraging choices but also population-level responses to competition. I presented hummingbirds true types of habitats (rich and poor feeders). All birds shared a preference for the rich feeders, but shifted preference toward poor feeders in response to competition. I used color cues to manipulate the amount of information available to birds and examined the effects of two information states (complete or incomplete) on their foraging choices. I examined hummingbirds' preferences for the rich feeders when both competitor densities and information varied. To relate foraging choices to energetic intake, I also analyzed energy gained during a single foraging bout. Males of all species exhibited strong preferences for rich feeders when they foraged with complete information and low competitor densities. Without complete information, the two subordinate species (black-chinned and magnificent) shifted preference away from rich feeders in response to high densities elf the dominant species (blue-throated). Each subordinate species shifted in a unique way: black-chinned hummingbirds reduced foraging efficiency, while magnificent hummingbirds reduced foraging time. Birds foraging with complete information remained selective on rich feeders even at high competitor densities. Thus, learned information affected competitive interactions (for rich feeders) among these species.

AB The soil seed bank was sampled in forest, recent gaps and arable land at a site within the dry Afromontane forest belt in eastern Ethiopia. The regeneration in the gaps was also followed for three years. At least 132 species of flowering plants were identified in the 0-3 cm soil layer with total densities ranging between 9400 and 20740 seeds/m(2). The highest number of species was recorded from the forest while the highest seed density was found in the arable land. Herbs were represented by the largest numbers of species and seeds in the seed bank in all three sampling areas. In all cases, the seed bank was dominated by a few species, reflecting differences in seed longevity and movement of seeds in the soil. Contribution of woody species to the soil seed bank was 15% in the forest while it was less than 1% in gaps and arable land. Seed density and number of species decreased with increasing depth, although species differed in the depth distribution of their seeds. The gaps were colonized by dense vegetation within three years by herbaceous species originating from the soil seed bank and newly dispersed seeds as well as by woody species sprouting from stumps and/or from pre-existing seedlings. However, if clearing of forests is followed by permanent cultivation which is typically the case, almost all of the woody and a part of the herbaceous components of the forest soil seed bank diminish through time and are largely replaced by a new set of herbaceous species. Regeneration of woody species by sprouting is also prevented by the complete removal of stumps from the arable land. This implies that natural regeneration of dry Afromontane forest areas converted into permanent arable land will be very difficult if the adjacent parches of forests are completely removed.

AB West Africa's high canopy forests have largely been replaced by a mosaic of active and abandoned agricultural fields. Use of the regenerating habitats by local fauna has not been well documented. I investigated the relative value of young successional forests, aged 5-12 years, and high forest, to primates and ungulates at Tiwai in West Africa. Four primates, Cercopithecus campbelli, Cercopithecus petaurista, Cercocebus atys, and Pan troglodytes, selected regrowth habitats more often than expected, and three primates, Cercopithecus diana, Colobus polykomos, and Procolobus badius, selected high forest habitat. The Maxwell's duiker Cephalophus monticola used both habitats equally.
   The Cercopithecus spp. exhibited seasonal fluctuations in abundance in the two habitats, presumably in response to different fruit availabilities. The old forest supported a greater diversity and biomass of primates per unit area compared to regrowth habitats. The high forest was more valuable to the primate community, but young forests were also used by resident fauna, suggesting potential for management as wildlife habitat.

AB At Finca La Selva, in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica, the Long-tailed Hermit (Phaethornis superciliosus) has a long breeding season (December or January through August or September) during which flowers are abundant, followed by a severe but predictable season of flower scarcity in late October-November, during which most of the annual mortality normally occurs. In 1973, the third of a 4-yr population study of marked lek males, an unusual drought caused a severe flower shortage at the height of the breeding season. During the latter part of the breeding season lek activity of males was reduced, successful breeding by females was drastically curtailed, and masses of both sexes dropped to levels lower than those of the lean season. Interrupted molt, an indicator of energy stress normally seen only in a minority of breeding females, was observed in 25% of adult males, and 50% of females, in 1973. Survivorship of lek males through the breeding season dropped from 90% in normal years to almost-equal-to 60%, and the total lek population at the start of the 1974 breeding season was one-third lower than before the drought in 1973; the cohort of yearling males was most strongly affected. Recovery of numbers and age structure of the lek male population to pre-1973 levels required 3-4 yr. Jolly-Seber analyses showed close agreement with survivorship as determined by direct observation (possible because of the lek social system), and permitted estimation of other parameters of interest: populations of marked and unmarked males, probability of recapture of marked males, and recruitment. The average annual survivorship of male P. superciliosus (in normal years) is near the mean value reported for a series of tropical species. A simple model of the reproductive output of female P. superciliosus, assuming no sexual differences in survivorship, suggests that a female breeding only in the prime breeding season (roughly February-July, when over 80% of the fledglings are normally produced) will no more than replace herself in the population; breeding throughout 8-9 mo will permit her to increase her reproductive output by up to 10%, which agrees well with the 3+ yr required by the (male) population to recover from the drought. Possible implications of these findings for tropical bird demography and conservation are discussed.

AB The two Sumatran wild bananas, Musa acuminata subsp. halabanensis and M. salaccensis, belonging to the different sections Musa and Callimusa respectively, have contrasting flowering traits corresponding to their different pollination syndromes:  i.e., chiroptorophily and ornithophily, respectively.  The M. a. halabanensis flowers, on pendent inflorescences with dark purple bracts, produced jelly-like nectar of 22-25 percent sugar concentration primarily at night, and were pollinated by the nectarivorous pteropodid bats, Macroglossus sobrinus.  In contrast, the M. salaccensis flowers, on erect inflorescences with purplish pink bracts, produced dilute nectar of 18-21 percent sugar concentration primarily in the daytime, and were pollinated by the nectarivorous nectariniid birds, Arachnothera longirostris and Aethopyga siparaja.  The flowering span of each female flower was 24-40 hr, while that of the male flowers was < 12 hr.  Open flowers of both species contained significantly less outcrop of nectar than bagged flowers.  Fruit weight and seedset of open M. salaccensis flowers were significantly more than those of bagged flowers and were significantly less than those of hand-pollinated flowers.

AB Accelerating deforestation rates in Earth's tropical rainforests have dramatic impacts on local public health, agricultural productivity, and global climate change. We used satellite observations to quantify the local temperature changes in deforested patches of rainforests across the tropics and found local warming larger than that predicted from more than a century of climate change under a worst-case emissions scenario. We show that the most extreme warming is typically found in large patches of deforestation; the combined effects of deforestation and climate change on tropical temperatures present a uniquely difficult challenge to the long term public health, occupational safety, and economic security of tropical populations.

AB Persistent forest loss in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) is responsible for carbon emission, reduction of ecosystem services, and loss of biodiversity. Combining spatial data analysis with high spatial resolution data for forest cover and forest loss, we quantified the spatial and temporal patterns of forest dynamics in the BLA. We identified an alarming trend of increasing deforestation, with especially high rates in 2016 and 2017. Moreover, the creation of forest cover fragments is faster than ever due to decreasing size and dispersion of forest loss patches. From 2001 to 2017, the number of large forest loss patches decreased significantly, accompanied by a reduction in the size of these patches. Enforcement of field inspections and of initiatives to promote forest conservation will be required to stop this trend.

AB Today, climate change is assumed by many researchers and scholars as a certainty and is presented as the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced. It is commonly accepted that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause that is accelerating the process. Therefore, it is urgent to find solutions to mitigate climate change, mainly because the intense effects have already been felt, in many cases in the form of the occurrence of extremely violent weather events. Forests are undoubtedly one of the most effective and easiest ways to provide the function of carbon sinks. However, it is essential and convenient to analyze the permanence time of this carbon in forests, because this permanence time depends directly on the forest management model used. This article aims to analyze forest management models from the perspective of carbon residence time in temperate forests, dividing the models into three types, namely carbon conservation models, carbon storage models, and carbon substitution models, according to their ability to contribute to functioning as carbon sinks, thereby contributing to the mitigation of climate change.

AB The mortality rates of large trees are critical to determining carbon stocks in tropical forests, but the mechanisms of tropical tree mortality remain poorly understood. Lightning strikes thousands of tropical trees every day, but is commonly assumed to be a minor agent of tree mortality in most tropical forests. We use the first systematic quantification of lightning-caused mortality to show that lightning is a major cause of death for the largest trees in an old-growth lowland forest in Panama. A novel lightning strike location system together with field surveys of strike sites revealed that, on average, each strike directly kills 3.5 trees (> 10 cm diameter) and damages 11.4 more. Given lightning frequency data from the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network and historical total tree mortality rates for this site, we conclude that lightning accounts for 40.5% of the mortality of large trees (> 60 cm diameter) in the short term and probably contributes to an additional 9.0% of large tree deaths over the long term. Any changes in cloud-to-ground lightning frequency due to climatic change will alter tree mortality rates; projected 25-50% increases in lightning frequency would increase large tree mortality rates in this forest by 9-18%. The results of this study indicate that lightning plays a critical and previously underestimated role in tropical forest dynamics and carbon cycling.

AB Leaf-cutter ants are a prominent feature in Neotropical ecosystems, but a comprehensive assessment of their effects on ecosystem functions is lacking. We reviewed the literature and used our own recent findings to identify knowledge gaps and develop a framework to quantify the effects of leaf-cutter ants on ecosystem processes. Leaf-cutter ants disturb the soil structure during nest excavation changing soil aeration and temperature. They mix relatively nutrient-poor soil from deeper layers with the upper organic-rich layers increasing the heterogeneity of carbon and nutrients within nest soils. Leaf-cutter ants account for about 25% of all herbivory in Neotropical forest ecosystems, moving 10%-15% of leaves in their foraging range to their nests. Fungal symbionts transform the fresh, nutrient-rich vegetative material to produce hyphal nodules to feed the ants. Organic material from roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi enhances carbon and nutrient turnover in nest soils and creates biogeochemical hot spots. Breakdown of organic matter, microbial and ant respiration, and nest waste material decomposition result in increased CO2, CH4, and N2O production, but the build-up of gases and heat within the nest is mitigated by the tunnel network ventilation system. Nest ventilation dynamics are challenging to measure without bias, and improved sensor systems would likely solve this problem. Canopy gaps above leaf-cutter ant nests change the light, wind and temperature regimes, which affects ecosystem processes. Nests differ in density and size depending on colony age, forest type and disturbance level and change over time resulting in spatial and temporal changes of ecosystem processes. These characteristics remain a challenge to evaluate rapidly and non-destructively. Addressing the knowledge gaps identified in this synthesis will bring insights into physical and biological processes driving biogeochemical cycles at the nest and ecosystem scale and will improve our understanding of ecosystem biogeochemical heterogeneity and larger scale ecological phenomena. A plain language summary is available for this article.

AB Smallholder farmers might adopt different farming practices to cope with multiple stressors depending on their livelihood assets, and with varying environmental and economic outcomes. Ongoing global change is triggering stronger and different stressors that threaten conventional farming practices; however, this could be resolved if livelihood assets that drive decision making are actionable and thus can be modified. This study assessed the influence of farmers' livelihood assets, risk perception, and shocks on the choice of non-conventional farming practices for smallholder coffee farmers in San Martin, Peru. Using household survey data, we collected data on 162 coffee plantations along an elevation gradient. We operationalized the sustainable livelihoods framework for the adoption of shade and input coffee farming strategies and explored farmers' motives to change them. Despite associated high risks with pest and disease pressure, coffee price volatility and climate change, these risks did not explain the current shade and input farming strategies. While in the past five years, farmers adapted shade and input management in response to pest and disease and climate change pressures, these occurred in diverging directions: we found higher human and social assets associated with higher shade levels, and a trend for higher physical and financial assets associated with higher input use. These findings illustrate that two main factors affect decisions on farming practices related to shade and input management and they relate to different livelihood capitals. This suggests a potential for conflicting decision-making, push-and-pulling decisions in different directions. Further the disconnect between livelihood assets and perceptions suggests that perception of risk and shocks might not be sufficient to motivate decision making under changing conditions. Such insights in decision making typologies and drivers can inform the development of farming practices that enhance resilience and sustainability of smallholder coffee production in Peru and elsewhere in the tropics.<bold> </bold>

AB Given that land-use change is the main cause of global biodiversity decline, there is widespread interest in adopting land-use practices that maintain high levels of biodiversity, and in restoring degraded land that previously had high biodiversity value. In this study, we use ant taxonomic and functional diversity to examine the effects of different land uses (agriculture, pastoralism, silviculture and conservation) and restoration practices on Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) biodiversity. We also examine the extent to which ant diversity and composition can be explained by vegetation attributes that apply across the full land management spectrum. We surveyed vegetation attributes and ant communities in five replicate plots of each of 13 land-use and restoration treatments, including two types of native vegetation as reference sites: cerrado sensu stricto and cerradAo. Several land-use and restoration treatments had comparable plot richness to that of the native reference habitats. Ant species and functional composition varied systematically among land-use treatments following a gradient from open habitats such as agricultural fields to forested sites. Tree basal area and grass cover were the strongest predictors of ant species richness. Losses in ant diversity were higher in land-use systems that transform vegetation structure. Among productive systems, therefore, uncleared pastures and old pine plantations had similar species composition to that occurring in cerrado sensu stricto. Restoration techniques currently applied to sites that were previously Cerrado have focused on returning tree cover, and have failed to restore ant communities typical of savanna. To improve restoration outcomes for Cerrado biodiversity, greater attention needs to be paid to the re-establishment and maintenance of the grass layer, which requires frequent fire. At the broader scale, conservation planning in agricultural landscapes, should recognize the value of land-use mosaics and the risks of homogenization.

AB The concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) in plant tissues are commonly used as an indicator of total plant carbon (C) supply; but some evidence suggests the possibility for high NSC concentrations during periods of C limitation. Despite this uncertainty, NSC dynamics have not been investigated experimentally under long-term C limitation. We exposed saplings of 10 temperate tree species differing in shade tolerance to 6% of ambient sunlight for 3 yr to induce C limitation, and also defoliated one species, Carpinus betulus, in the third season. Growth and NSC concentrations were monitored to determine C allocation. Shade strongly reduced growth, but after an initial two-fold decrease, NSC concentrations of shaded saplings recovered to the level of unshaded saplings by the third season. NSC concentrations were generally more depleted under shade after leaf flush, and following herbivore attacks. Only under shade did artificial defoliation lead to mortality and depleted NSC concentrations in surviving individuals. We conclude that, irrespective of shade tolerance, C storage is maintained under prolonged shading, and thus high NSC concentrations can occur during C limitation. Yet, our results also suggest that decreased NSC concentrations are indicative of C limitation, and that additional leaf loss can lead to lethal C shortage in deep shade.

AB Forest fragmentation and deforestation are subjects of great concern in tropical regions, namely in South America and Africa, contributing to a rapid loss of tropical forest area and with serious implications for ecosystem functioning and biodiversity conservation. Despite the decrease in deforestation rates In recent years, the Brazilian Amazon, with the largest continuous region of tropical forest in the world, has suffered the greatest recorded losses, which have been contributing to continuous habitat fragmentation and a reduction in the territory occupied by Amerindian populations. In an attempt to preserve the remaining habitats and forests, Brazil has been adopting land conservation policies, including the implementation of protected areas. Protected areas (PAs) possess the potential to significantly reduce habitat fragmentation by conserving large, contiguous areas of land. In order to examine how effective PAs are at conserving forest area in the Brazilian Legal Amazon, patterns of deforestation are analyzed and compared, inside and outside the PM, through landscape metrics calculated using the Patch Analyst and V-LATE extensions of a Geographic Information System. Two different sources (the Hansen Global Forest Change Dataset and the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research's (INPE) PRODES project) of annual forest cover-loss data derived from satellite imagery at medium-to-high spatial and temporal resolutions are compared at two-yearly intervals across 2002-2016. Additionally, fragmentation levels associated with deforestation patterns are assessed through an index modeled using a set of uncorrelated landscape metrics, and the associated change factors and trend are discussed. Results show that there is greater fragmentation in some PAs located in Mato Grosso and Para States, especially those near the "arc of deforestation", and that Yanomami Indigenous Lands (YIL) are tending towards more fragmentation. Although some PM are in a critical condition, findings show they all actively contribute to improved conservation of the native ecosystem and, in conjunction with sustainable management policies, will continue to help reduce or avoid forest fragmentation and degradation processes.

AB Soil phosphorus (P) fractions are critical for understanding soil P dynamics and availability. This paper provides a global dataset of soil P fractions separated by the Hedley method. The dataset also includes key environmental factors associated with soil P dynamics and availability, including climate factors, vegetation, soil and parent material types, soil age, and soil physiochemical properties such as particle size, bulk density, pH in water, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and extractable iron and aluminium concentrations. This dataset includes measures of Hedley P fractions of 802 soil samples and was gathered through a literature survey of 99 published studies. Plant availability of each soil P fraction was noted. We anticipate that the global dataset will provide valuable information for studying soil P dynamics and availability, and it will be fused into earth system models to better predict how terrestrial ecosystems will respond to global environmental changes.

AB Despite expansive research on Amazonian deforestation and its drivers, the role of local politics is not well understood. Using a panel data set that combines municipal-level deforestation and election data from 2002 to 2012, I estimate the effect of an incumbent mayor running for re-election on deforestation rates in election periods. I find that deforestation rates increase 8-10% in election years when an incumbent mayor runs for re-election, an amount equivalent to four percent of the total forest lost since the 2004 elections. Electoral deforestation cycles do not appear to be driven by changes in agricultural policy implementation and activity, but are linked to corruption and campaign finance, suggesting that weak institutional constraints facilitate electoral manipulation of forest resources. This phenomenon is not likely limited to Amazonian forests; re-election incentives could very well lead to misallocation of other natural resources in alternate geographies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Phosphorus (P) is an essential but limited nutrient in highly weathered subtropical or tropical forest soils; however, increased P demands owing to elevated nitrogen (N) deposition might further exacerbate the P limitation in these regions. How soil P fractions respond to N enrichment and the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood completely. To address this issue, we conducted an experiment with 3 years of N addition to a Castanopsis carlesii natural forest in Fujian, China; the soil P fractions, microbial biomass, enzyme activities, and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) levels were determined. We found that N addition did not significantly alter the microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass N (MBN), but significantly decreased microbial biomass P (MBP); further, the ratios of MBC:MBP and MBN:MBP increased significantly after N application, indicating that N enrichment enhanced the P demands of plants and soil microorganisms. Moreover, neither resin-P nor NaHCO3-P (extracted by resin and NaHCO3, respectively) was decreased, whereas organic P extracted by NaOH (NaOH-Po) was decreased after N addition, implying that NaOH-Po is a potentially significant source of available P. In particular, appositive correlation between abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi and NaOH-Po and significant relationships between acid phosphomonoesterase activity (ACP) and labile P contents were noted, suggesting that ectomycorrhizal fungi can play a major role in the depletion of soil organic P, and these enzyme activities can mobilize the unavailable P to labile P in the investigated forest. Taken together, our results revealed a novel mechanism for the maintenance of soil labile P in a subtropical natural forest under chronic stress of N deposition.

AB Understanding the spatial distribution of tree species in subtropical evergreen-deciduous broadleaf karst forest is fundamental to studying species coexistence and karst species diversity. Here, complete spatial randomness and heterogeneous Poisson process models were used to analyze the spatial distribution patterns of 146 species with at least one individual per ha in a 25-ha plot in southwest China. We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and the torus-translation test (TTT) to explain the distributions of observed species. Our results show that an aggregated distribution was the dominant pattern in Mulun karst forests; the percentage and intensity of aggregated decreased with increasing spatial scale, abundance, mean diameter at breast height (DBH), and maximum DBH. Rare species were more aggregated than intermediately abundant and abundant species. However, functional traits (e.g., growth form and phenological guild) had no significant effects on the distributions of species. The CCA revealed that the four analyzed topographic variables (elevation, slope, aspect, and convexity) had significant influences on species distributions. The TTT showed that not all species have habitat preferences and that 68.5% (100 out of 146 species) show a strongly positive or negative association with at least one habitat. Most species were inclined to grow on slopes and hilltops.

AB Effects caused by human management and natural disturbances as well as by ecological mechanisms such as those described, for example, by the Janzen-Connell and the herd immunity hypotheses play an important role in maintaining species diversity. These processes are often accompanied by local size-hierarchy effects and as a likely consequence of them we hypothesised that large plants generally have a tendency to show high species mingling, where plants and their nearest neighbours are heterospecific. To carry out a first benchmark study in forests from different parts of Europe, Africa and North America, we selected spatial data from twelve forest ecosystems and analysed the mingling situation based on an index of spatial species mingling. Using stem diameter at breast height and stem diameter differentiation among the nearest neighbours as explanatory variables we then applied logistic regression to explain mingling probability. Overall we found significant support for the expectation that large trees and trees growing at low local densities often (75% of all analysed forest stands) have indeed a tendency towards high species mingling. This supports our expectation that the tendency of larger trees towards high species mingling generally is either a consequence of disturbances/forest management or of the aforementioned ecological processes, although a few forest stands also deviated from the expected pattern. We also found that size differentiation and species mingling are strongly related in local neighbourhoods. Thus the results of our study strongly support the view that local species richness promotes local size hierarchy irrespective of climate zone. This leads to situations where in local neighbourhoods with large size diversity there is also high mingling and vice versa. This allows conservation to focus on maintaining or improving one diversity aspect, e.g. size diversity, whilst obtaining the other, e.g. species mingling, as a byproduct.

AB Understanding the responses of individual plant species along different edaphic gradients is a key question in ecology, with implications to community assembly, functioning of forest ecosystems, niche theory and conservation planning. In tropical rain forests, responses to soil nutrients have been described only for a handful of species. Even abundant and conspicuous components of the forest, such as the palms (Arecaceae), remain largely unknown in this respect.
   We inventoried all palm species and analysed soil chemistry in 96 sites across western Amazonia to (i) assess the relative importance of some micronutrients vs. macronutrients as drivers of patterns in palm species composition, (ii) model the response shapes of 61 palm taxa and of canopy vs. understorey palms along gradients of selected soil nutrients, (iii) determine if the response shapes of conspecific palm varieties differ in relation to the most important observed soil nutrient and (iv) assess if the rank order of the most abundant canopy species changes along edaphic gradients.
   Patterns in palm species composition were best explained by Mehlich-III extractable exchangeable bases (Ca, K, Mg) and phosphorus (P), with the different palm species clearly separating along the soil cation concentration gradient. All 61 palm taxa exhibited statistical responses along soil nutrient gradients. Response shapes in relation to exchangeable bases varied among bimodal skewed (51% of species), unimodal skewed (47%) and monotonic (2%).
   There were no significant differences between canopy vs. understorey species in their mean response shapes to the exchangeable bases, but canopy species had significantly higher mean optimum value for soil P and greater mean niche width along the Ca, K, Mg, P and boron (B) gradients. Varieties of the same species of Bactris, Desmoncus and Geonoma generally had different response shapes and different optima for the exchangeable bases.
   Synthesis. Among the soil variables we studied, macronutrients (especially exchangeable bases and P) emerged as more important than micronutrients in predicting species abundances in palm communities of western Amazonian non-inundated forests. Non-Gaussian responses were predominant, conspecific palm varieties exhibited different response types, and the rank order of dominance of canopy palms varied along the gradients of exchangeable bases and P. Together, these findings advance niche theory about palms and may be used for generating better predictive models of palm species distributions and for experimental studies that search for the physiological mechanisms underlying inter- and infra-specific trade-offs along edaphic gradients.

AB Aims
   Growth rates of plants are driven by factors that influence the amount of resources captured and the efficiency of resource use. In trees, the amount of light captured and the efficiency of light use strongly depends on crown characteristics and leaf traits. Although theory predicts that both crown and leaf traits affect tree growth, few studies have yet to integrate these two types of traits to explain species-specific growth rates. Using 37 broad-leaved tree species of subtropical forests in SE China, we investigated how interspecific differences in wood volume growth rates were affected by crown and leaf traits. We tested the hypotheses that (i) larger crown dimensions promote growth rates, (ii) species-specific growth rates are positively related to leaf stomatal conductance, leaf water potential and leaf chemical components, and negatively related to leaf C/N and leaf toughness and (iii) the two sets of traits better explain growth rates in combination than either alone.
   Methods
   Our study was conducted in a large-scale forest Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning experiment in China (BEF-China), located in a mountainous region in Jiangxi Province. We related 17 functional traits (two crown dimension and three crown structure traits; six physiological and six morphological leaf traits) to the mean annual growth rate of wood volume of young trees of the studied species. Interrelationships between crown and leaf traits were analyzed using principal component analysis. Simple linear regression analysis was used to test the effect of each trait separately. We used multiple regression analysis to establish the relationship of growth rate to each set of traits (crown traits, physiological and morphological leaf traits) and to the combination of all types of traits. The coefficients of determination (R-adj(2)) of the best multiple regression models were compared to determine the relative explanatory power of crown and leaf traits and a combination of both.
   Important Findings
   The species-specific growth rates were not related to any of the single crown traits, but were related positively to leaf stomatal conductance and leaf water potential individually, and negatively to leaf toughness, with approximately 13% variance explained by each of the traits. Combinations of different crown traits did not significantly explain the species-specific growth rates, whereas combinations of either physiological or morphological leaf traits explained 24% and 31%, respectively. A combination of both crown and leaf traits explained 42% of variance in species-specific growth rates. We concluded that sets of traits related to carbon assimilation at the leaf-level and to overall amount of leaves exposed at the crown-level jointly explained species-specific growth rates better than either set of traits alone.

ID CONSERVATION VALUE; STEPPING-STONES; LANDSCAPE; ABUNDANCE
AB Small forest fragments may play a major role in fragmented areas, but there is scarce empirical data to test this hypothesis. To understand in which context birds can use small Atlantic Forest fragments, we tested the presence of 11 bird species in 30 small fragments (4-10 ha), in a range of matrices (eucalyptus pasture), and in different landscape configurations. The results showed that landscape composition is a good predictor for presence of birds in small fragments and their use can be further associated with matrix type. Considering the number of species, and the species Chiroxiphia caudata, we found a pattern in which models that consider the matrix composition are the most plausible. Relative importance of the variables indicates that matrix is the most important single variable among the selected species (five among eight). This suggests that small fragments are effective for increasing connectivity, mainly in landscapes with a higher percentage of permeable matrix.

AB Land-use changes are one of the major drivers of global change. In many developed countries socioeconomic changes have induced forest expansion during the last centuries, with still seldom explored implications for ecosystem services. We assessed the growth rate and the contribution of these "new forests" on C storage under the imprint of land-use history from Mediterranean to temperate forests in two biogeographical regions in the Iberian Peninsula, using data from 6422 plots of the Spanish National Forest Inventory (1986-2007) and the land-cover map of 1956 to distinguish among pre-existing and new forests (appeared after 1956). Almost a quarter of current forests were new forests and they represented 22% of the total C pool. New forests maintained similar C stocks than pre-existing ones (similar to 45 Mg ha(-1)), but they are growing at rates 25% faster. Considering the whole Spanish forested territory, the new forest growth rate would offset around 9% of the rate of total C emitted in Spain between 1986 and 2007. The effects of land-use history on forest growth and C stocks varied with environmental conditions (for example, growth of new forests in areas with less water availability was higher than in pre-existing ones), supporting the idea that agricultural legacies may prevail in the long term. In a time when European forests exhibit the first signs of carbon sink saturation, our study endows a relevant ecological role to new forests appearing in the second half of the twentieth century.

AB Soil organic phosphorus contributes to the nutrition of tropical trees, but is not accounted for in standard soil phosphorus tests. Plants and microbes can release organic anions to solubilize organic phosphorus from soil surfaces, and synthesize phosphatases to release inorganic phosphate from the solubilized compounds. We developed a procedure to estimate bioavailable organic phosphorus in tropical forest soils by simulating the secretion processes of organic acids and phosphatases. Five lowland tropical forest soils with contrasting properties (pH 4.4-6.1, total P 86-429 mg P kg(-1)) were extracted with 2 mM citric acid (i.e., 10 mu mol g(-1), approximating rhizosphere concentrations) adjusted to soil pH in a 4:1 solution to soil ratio for 1 h. Three phosphatase enzymes were then added to the soil extract to determine the forms of hydrolysable organic phosphorus. Total phosphorus extracted by the procedure ranged between 3.22 and 8.06 mg P kg(-1) (mean 5.55 +/- 0.42 mg P kg(-1)), of which on average three quarters was unreactive phosphorus (i.e., organic phosphorus plus inorganic polyphosphate). Of the enzyme-hydrolysable unreactive phosphorus, 28% was simple phosphomonoesters hydrolyzed by phosphomonoesterase from bovine intestinal mucosa, a further 18% was phosphodiesters hydrolyzed by a combination of nuclease from Penicillium citrinum and phosphomonoesterase, and the remaining 51% was hydrolyzed by a broad-spectrum phytase from wheat. We conclude that soil organic phosphorus can be solubilized and hydrolyzed by a combination of organic acids and phosphatase enzymes in lowland tropical forest soils, indicating that this pathway could make a significant contribution to biological phosphorus acquisition in tropical forests. Furthermore, we have developed a method that can be used to assess the bioavailability of this soil organic phosphorus. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Demand for tropical forest restoration has grown rapidly as the potential role of recovering secondary forests in sequestering carbon and enhancing biodiversity has been recognised. Active forest management is often prescribed to accelerate natural regeneration, but evidence for the efficacy of interventions is scarce for tropical forests. In this study we examine the hypothesis that the selective removal of abundant pioneers in the understory of recovering selectively logged forests can improve the composition of forest stands and accelerate succession. Four selective thinning treatments of increasing intensity were implemented in 8.75 ha compartments and replicated six times. Within each compartment, three monitoring plots were established and measured immediately after thinning and one year later to assess implementation of thinning treatments, growth and survival of stems, and changes in stand composition. Canopy openness was measured using hemispherical photography. Thinning treatments substantially reduced the abundance of pioneers, but there was only a slight increase in canopy openness (3.7-4.3%) relative to the control (1.8%) 8 months after implementation. Canopy openness increased dramatically across all treatments in the follow year due to the 2015-16 El Nino event and increased more in thinning treatments. Large (>10 cm dbh) and small (2-10 cm dbh) late-successional stems showed enhanced growth only in the low intensity thinning treatment, whereas the growth of small pioneer stems increased across the thinning intensity gradient. The cost of implementing thinning treatments was $US80 per ha or approximately 10% of the cost of planting treatments in the same forest. Our findings suggest that selective thinning of understory pioneer stems is a practical option for manipulating stand composition and potentially accelerating natural regeneration. Continued monitoring of the experiment should reveal the long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of treatments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are fundamental components of drylands worldwide, and are of great importance for the regulation of ecosystem functioning. However, little is known on the role of species identify of biocrust-forming lichens in mediating the response of nitrogen (N) cycling to concurring global environmental change. Here, we conducted a microcosm study to evaluate how the species identity of biocrust-forming lichens (Diploschistes thunbergianus, Psora crystallifera and Xanthoparmelia reptans) regulate key processes of N cycling in response to simulated changes in rainfall frequency and N addition. We explicitly considered both direct and indirect effects (i.e. driven via microbial diversity and abundance) of global changes on N availability and losses using structural equation models. Our results showed that species of biocrust-forming lichens differentially mediated effects of N amendment and altered rainfall frequencies on belowground nitrate availability and N2O flux rate. For instance, soils under P. crystallifera species showed the highest increase in nitrate content in response to N amendment under low rainfall frequency. Moreover, soils under D. thunbergianus showed the highest N2O flux under high rainfall frequency without N addition. Interestingly, soils under X. reptans showed lowest and highest resistance in nitrate availability and N2O flux, respectively, in response to N addition regardless of different rainfall frequencies. Strikingly, we only found an indirect impact of either rainfall frequency or N amendment on the nitrate availability (but not N2O flux) driven via the ammonia-oxidizing community under X reptans. Our results provide evidence that the species identity of biocrust-forming lichens modulates the response of N cycling to global change drivers. These findings have implications for predicting the potential consequence of altered rainfall patterns and environmental N inputs in dryland ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ultrasociality refers to the social organization of a few species, including humans and some social insects, having a complex division of labor, city-states, and an almost exclusive dependence on agriculture for subsistence. We argue that the driving forces in the evolution of these ultrasocial societies were economic. With the agricultural transition, species could directly produce their own food and this was such a competitive advantage that those species now dominate the planet. Once underway, this transition was propelled by the selection of within-species groups that could best capture the advantages of (1) actively managing the inputs to food production, (2) a more complex division of labor, and (3) increasing returns to larger scale and larger group size. Together these factors reoriented productive life and radically altered the structure of these societies. Once agriculture began, populations expanded as these economic drivers opened up new opportunities for the exploitation of resources and the active management of inputs to food production. With intensified group-level competition, larger populations and intensive resource exploitation became competitive advantages, and the "social conquest of Earth" was underway. Ultrasocial species came to dominate the earth's ecosystems. Ultrasociality also brought a loss of autonomy for individuals within the group. We argue that exploring the common causes and consequences of ultrasociality in humans and the social insects that adopted agriculture can provide fruitful insights into the evolution of complex human society.

AB Aim Using a standardized sampling protocol along a 600-km transect in northern Australia, we tested whether ant diversity within a single biome, tropical savanna, decreases with increasing latitude (as a surrogate of temperature) and decreasing rainfall, as is expected for biodiversity in general.
   Location Northern Australia.
   Methods Ants were sampled using pitfall traps on three occasions at 1-hasand, loam and clay sites at each of five locations along the Northern Australian Tropical Transect (NATT), from 12 degrees 50 ' S (1400 mm mean annual rainfall) to 17 degrees 21 ' S (650 mm).
   Results We recorded a total of 246 species from 37 genera. Mean observed species richness pooled across sampling periods was similar at sand (85.4) and loam (82.2) sites, but was less than half this at clay sites (40.0). Ant communities were also compositionally distinct on clay soils compared with sands and loams. Individual genera showed variable diversity patterns, ranging from a linear increase to a linear decrease in species richness along the NATT. However, total species richness was relatively uniform along the gradient. Patterns of ant species turnover were consistent with previously recognized biogeographical boundaries, with a primary disjunction between the arid and monsoonal zones in the south, and a secondary disjunction between the semi-arid and mesic zones in the north.
   Main conclusions Patterns of ant diversity in Australian savannas do not conform to global patterns of biodiversity declines with increasing latitude and decreasing rainfall. We believe this is due to a lack of significant temperature change across the latitudinal gradient, and, in particular, to the fauna's evolutionary history in association with aridification, which makes it unusually resilient to increasing aridity. The diversity of other important faunal groups such as termites and lizards is also exceptionally high in arid Australia and is likewise not closely linked to rainfall in Australian savannas. We predict that these taxa are far more sensitive to increasing aridity in savannas elsewhere in the world, and especially in the Neotropics, where savannas have an evolutionary association with humid rain forest rather than desert.

AB One of the key problems in ecology is our need to anticipate the set of locations in which a species will be found (hereafter species' distributions). A major source of uncertainty in these models is the role of interactions among species (hereafter biotic interactions). Unfortunately, it is difficult to directly study this problem at large spatial scales and we lack a clear understanding of when biotic interactions shape species' distributions. We show a simple, direct link between the ease of species' coexistence and the importance of competition for shaping species' distributions. We show that increasing the ease of species' coexistence reduces the influence of biotic interactions. Changing the spatial scale of the analysis can reduce the influence of species interactions, but only when it promotes regional coexistence. Using these ideas, we analyze the conditions under which biotic interactions alter species' distributions in a Lotka-Volterra model of competition along an environmental gradient and argue that coexistence theory, rather than scale alone, provides a guide to the influence of species interactions. Our results provide a guide to the facets of biotic interactions that are necessary to anticipate their effects on species distributions. As such, we expect our work will help the development of more realistic distribution models.

AB Tropical forest understory birds are declining globally for unknown reasons, indicating an urgent need to understand the causes. We review and synthesize studies investigating causes of these declines focusing on the Sarapiqui region of the Caribbean slope of Costa Rica. We discuss evidence for five potential causes of population declines motivated by current understanding of the effects of fragmentation, disturbance of remnant forests, climate change, and their possible interactions: (1) reduced forest area increases the probability of stochastic extirpation; (2) reduced connectivity among forest patches decreases population rescue opportunities; (3) degradation of preferred microhabitats due to, for example, abundant large mammals, jeopardizes specialized birds' foraging opportunities; (4) high nest predation rates reduce productivity below replacement levels; and (5) changes in macro- and microclimate increase energetic demands and reduce survival. Our review documents how tropical forest loss and degradation likely Impact understory birds through a variety of direct, indirect, and interrelated causes spanning multiple temporal and spatial scales and levels of biological organization. We propose that the processes affecting understory birds in the Sarapiqui region may be broadly representative of threats experienced by rainforest understory birds pantropically. Effective conservation will require consideration of such diverse and interacting factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Identifying the ecological and life-history traits that render species vulnerable to fragmentation is an important prerequisite for the development of effective conservation strategies to minimize future biodiversity losses. When determining how species traits influence vulnerability to fragmentation, however, several important confounding factors such as detectability and synergistic effects among traits are rarely considered. In this study, after controlling for these methodological shortcomings, we determined how species traits influenced fragmentation vulnerability using bird data collected from islands created by the inundation of the Thousand Island Lake, China. We obtained eight species traits from field surveys and from the literature: natural abundance, geographical range size, habitat specificity, body size, trophic level, mobility, fecundity, and nest type. After phylogenetic correction, these traits were used separately and in combination to assess their associations with the index of fragmentation vulnerability, the proportion of islands occupied. Inclusion of detectability in analysis resulted in considerable increases in overall island occupancy for all species in general and for cryptic species in particular. Accounting for detectability altered the rank of best models and thus influenced the identification of the relationships between species traits and fragmentation vulnerability. We found synergistic interactions between natural abundance and habitat specificity. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating detectability and synergistic effects among traits into future studies. From a conservation perspective, our results suggest that we should give priority conservation efforts to rare species with low natural abundance and high habitat specificity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Global environmental changes and human activity influence wildland fires worldwide, but the relative importance of the individual factors varies regionally and their interplay can be difficult to disentangle. Here we evaluate projected future changes in burned area at the European and sub-European scale, and we investigate uncertainties in the relative importance of the determining factors. We simulated future burned area with LPJ-GUESS-SIMFIRE, a patch-dynamic global vegetation model with a semiempirical fire model, and LPJmL-SPITFIRE, a dynamic global vegetation model with a process-based fire model. Applying a range of future projections that combine different scenarios for climate changes, enhanced CO2 concentrations, and population growth, we investigated the individual and combined effects of these drivers on the total area and regions affected by fire in the 21st century. The two models differed notably with respect to the dominating drivers and underlying processes. Fire-vegetation interactions and socioeconomic effects emerged as important uncertainties for future burned area in some European regions. Burned area of eastern Europe increased in both models, pointing at an emerging new fire-prone region that should gain further attention for future fire management.

AB Disentangling the relative effects of forest loss versus fragmentation on species distribution and abundance is crucial for adopting efficient biodiversity conservation actions, which could change with the nature of the landscape matrix.
   We tested the moderating effect of landscape matrix on insectivorous bats response to forest loss and fragmentation.
   We conducted acoustic surveys at forest patches surrounded by either an agricultural-dominated matrix or a pine-dominated matrix. We related bat activity to forest amount and the number of forest patches at multiple spatial scales, and compared their effects between landscape matrices.
   Bat activity was associated with both predictors, however their effects varied with the matrix type. In agricultural landscapes, as the amount of forest increased, the activity of Histiotus montanus, Lasiurus cinereus and Tadarida brasiliensis increased, while activity of Myotis chiloensis decreased. Similarly, as fragmentation increased, the activity of Lasiurus varius and M. chiloensis increased, while activity of H. montanus decreased. In production-forest landscapes, only H. montanus decreased its activity with increasing forest amount. In contrast, activity of L. cinereus, M. chiloensis and T. brasiliensis increased with increasing fragmentation. Forest amount was a stronger predictor for agricultural landscapes than for production-forest landscapes, suggesting that low contrast matrices can mitigate the effects of forest loss.
   Fragmented landscapes with native forest patches surrounded by a low contrast matrix may support a higher activity of insectivorous bats. Management efforts in fragmented landscapes should aim to decrease the patch-matrix contrast, which will mitigate the effects of forest loss on bats.

AB Diurnal human activity and domestic dogs in agro-forestry mosaics should theoretically modify the diurnal habitat use patterns of native carnivores, with these effects being scale-dependent. We combined intensive camera trapping data with Bayesian occurrence probability models to evaluate both diurnal and nocturnal patterns of space use by carnivores in a mosaic of land-use types in southern Chile. A total of eight carnivores species were recorded, including human-introduced dogs. During the day the most frequently detected species were the culpeo fox and the cougar. Conversely, during the night, the kodkod and chilla fox were the most detected species. The best supported models showed that native carnivores responded differently to landscape attributes and dogs depending on both the time of day as well as the spatial scale of landscape attributes. The positive effect of native forest cover at 250m and 500 m radius buffers was stronger during the night for the Darwin's fox and cougar. Road density at 250m scale negatively affected the diurnal occurrence of Darwin's fox, whereas at 500m scale roads had a stronger negative effect on the diurnal occurrence of Darwin's foxes and cougars. A positive effect of road density on dog occurrence was evidenced during both night and day. Patch size had a positive effect on cougar occurrence during night whereas it affected negatively the occurrence of culpeo foxes and skunks during day. Dog occurrence had a negative effect on Darwin's fox occurrence during day-time and night-time, whereas its negative effect on the occurrence of cougar was evidenced only during day-time. Carnivore occurrences were not influenced by the proximity to a conservation area. Our results provided support for the hypothesis that diurnal changes to carnivore occurrence were associated with human and dog activity. Landscape planning in our study area should be focused in reducing both the levels of diurnal human activity in native forest remnants and the dispersion rates of dogs into these habitats.

AB Translocation experiments, in which researchers displace animals and then monitor their movements to return home, are commonly used as tools to assess functional connectivity of fragmented landscapes. Such experiments are purported to have important advantages of being time efficient and of standardizing motivation to move across individuals. Yet, we lack tests of whether movement behavior of translocated birds reflects natural behavior of unmanipulated birds. We compared the routine movement behavior of a tropical hummingbird, the Green Hermit (Phaethornis guy), to that of experimentally translocated individuals. We tested for differences in site selection patterns during movement at two spatial scales (point and path levels). We also compared movement rates between treatments. Behaviors documented during translocation experiments reflected those observed during routine movements. At the point level, both translocated and non-translocated birds showed similar levels of preference for mature tropical forest. At the path level, step selection functions showed both translocated and non-translocated hummingbirds avoiding movement across non-forested matrix and selecting streams as movement corridors. Movement rates were generally higher during translocation experiments. However, the negative influence of forest cover on movement rates was proportionately similar in translocation and routine movement treatments. We report the first evidence showing that movement behavior of birds during translocation experiments is similar to their natural movement behavior. Therefore, translocation experiments may be reliable tools to address effects of landscape structure on animal movement. We observed consistent selection of landscape elements between translocated and non-translocated birds, indicating that both routine and translocation movement studies lead to similar conclusions regarding the effect of landscape structure and forest composition on functional connectivity. Our observation that hummingbirds avoid non-forest matrix and select riparian corridors also provides a potential mechanism for pollen limitation in fragmented tropical forest.

AB Studies of the effects of patch size and isolation on plant species density have yielded contrasting results. However, much of the available evidence comes from relatively recent anthropogenic forest fragments which have not reached equilibrium between extinction and immigration. This is a critical issue because the theory clearly states that only when equilibrium has been reached can the number of species be accurately predicted by habitat size and isolation. Therefore, species density could be better predicted by patch size and isolation in an ecosystem that has been fragmented for a very long time. We tested whether patch area, isolation and other spatial variables explain variation among forest patches in plant species density in an ecosystem where the forest has been naturally fragmented for long periods of time on a geological scale. Our main predictions were that plant species density will be positively correlated with patch size, and negatively correlated with isolation (distance to the nearest patch, connectivity, and distance to the continuous forest). We surveyed the vascular flora (except lianas and epiphytes) of 19 forest patches using five belt transects (50x4 m each) per patch (area sampled per patch = 0.1 ha). As predicted, plant species density was positively associated (logarithmically) with patch size and negatively associated (linearly) with patch isolation (distance to the nearest patch). Other spatial variables such as patch elevation and perimeter, did not explain among-patch variability in plant species density. The power of patch area and isolation as predictors of plant species density was moderate (together they explain 43% of the variation), however, a larger sample size may improve the explanatory power of these variables. Patch size and isolation may be suitable predictors of long-term plant species density in terrestrial ecosystems that are naturally and anthropogenically fragmented.

AB Theoretical studies have shown that coexistence between competitors can be favored in a spatially heterogeneous environment by a number of mechanisms, which ultimately allow the expression of persistent or transitory variation in species competitive abilities, colonization, or reproduction. Four distinctive paradigms to model metacommunities have been identified according to assumptions about the biology of the species and essential aspects of the environment. Missing from these are mechanisms of coexistence that can arise from the dispersal process itself without explicit spatial heterogeneity or biological trade-offs. These mechanisms have only recently received attention, but they may be common in marine communities and other systems in which dispersal is obligatory and modulated by the physical environment. We investigate coexistence in spatially homogeneous metacommunities where there is no partitioning of resources, no competition colonization trade-off, and no possibility of source sink dynamics. Coexistence is shown to be possible through three distinct mechanisms related to the dispersal process itself. Firstly, in a neutral scenario, inclusion of temporal variability in the connectivity matrix, emulating an intrinsic attribute of ocean character and other turbulent environments, can promote the invasion of an equally matched competitor and, in a hierarchical competition scenario, the persistence of an otherwise unviable, inferior competitor (the dispersal variability mechanism). Secondly, a sufficiently large difference in the shape of the time-independent dispersal kernels of the two species, which may result from differences in larval-release timing, buoyancy, or behavior, can produce stable coexistence in the center of their shared range (the dispersal-shape mechanism). Thirdly, asymmetry in the dispersal process due to biased advection renders the metapopulation model reactive,, such that small variations in the upstream abundances can be sufficient for the subordinate species to stably persist (the dispersal-bias mechanism). These results demonstrate that a subordinate species may persist by occupying a dispersal niche that differs sufficiently from that of the dominant species. Further theoretical research is necessary to develop simple empirical tests for these and other dispersal-based coexistence mechanisms.

AB Treefall gaps play an important role in tropical forest dynamics and in determining above-ground biomass (AGB). However, our understanding of gap disturbance regimes is largely based either on surveys of forest plots that are small relative to spatial variation in gap disturbance, or on satellite imagery, which cannot accurately detect small gaps. We used high-resolution light detection and ranging data from a 1500 ha forest in Panama to: (i) determine how gap disturbance parameters are influenced by study area size, and the criteria used to define gaps; and (ii) to evaluate how accurately previous ground-based canopy height sampling can determine the size and location of gaps. We found that plot-scale disturbance parameters frequently differed significantly from those measured at the landscape-level, and that canopy height thresholds used to define gaps strongly influenced the gap-size distribution, an important metric influencing AGB. Furthermore, simulated ground surveys of canopy height frequently misrepresented the true location of gaps, which may affect conclusions about how relatively small canopy gaps affect successional processes and contribute to the maintenance of diversity. Across site comparisons need to consider how gap definition, scale and spatial resolution affect characterizations of gap disturbance, and its inferred importance for carbon storage and community composition.

AB Background: Plant succession and community assembly following different land-use histories in the Amazon Basin are poorly understood.
   Aims: Changes in woody vegetation were monitored across chronosequences of abandoned pastures and abandoned clearcuts in order to compare their successional patterns.
   Methods: In chronosequences, initially 5-19 years old in abandoned clearcuts and 2-11 years old in abandoned pastures, trees (>= 3 cm dbh) were tagged and recruitment and mortality recorded annually for 12 years.
   Results: Stem densities exhibited no significant trend during the first 25 years of succession regardless of land-use history. Basal area in abandoned clearcuts increased rapidly in the first decade, outpacing accumulation in abandoned pastures, although basal area on the two pathways converged at 25 years post-abandonment. Transects in abandoned pastures were much more variable in stem density and basal area than those in abandoned clearcuts, reflecting cohort growth and thinning by the dominant genus Vismia in the pastures. Species density, initially similar in the young stands, increased at a much faster rate in abandoned clearcuts than in abandoned pastures, resulting in a large divergence after 25 years.
   Conclusions: Succession following deforestation in the Amazon exhibits alternative pathways that correspond to prior land use - abandoned clearcuts of primary forest or clearcuts converted to pastures through prescribed burns and later abandoned. The most important divergence in the two successions was the extremely slow accumulation of species over 25 years in abandoned pastures.

AB Facilitation is an important ecological mechanism with potential applications to forest restoration. We hypothesized that different facilitation treatments, distance from the forest edge and time since initiation of the experiment would affect forest restoration on abandoned pastures. Seed and seedling abundance, species richness and composition were recorded monthly during two years under isolated trees, bird perches and in open pasture. Seed arrival and seedling establishment were measured at 10 m and 300 m from the forest edge. We sampled a total of 131,826 seeds from 115 species and 487 seedlings from 46 species. Isolated trees and bird perches increased re-establishment of forest species; however, species richness was higher under isolated trees. Overall, abundance and richness of seeds and seedlings differed between sampling years, but was unaffected by distance from the forest edge. On the other hand, species composition of seeds and seedlings differed among facilitation treatments, distance from the forest edge and between years. Seedling establishment success rate was larger in large-seeded species than medium-and small-seeded species. Our results suggest that isolated trees enhance forest re-establishment, while bird perches provide a complementary effort to restore tree abundance in abandoned pastures. However, the importance of seed arrival facilitation shifts toward establishment facilitation over time. Arriving species may vary depending on the distance from the forest edge and disperser attractors. Efforts to restore tropical forests on abandoned pastures should take into account a combination of both restoration strategies, effects of time and proximity to forest edge to maximize regeneration.

AB The Brazilian Amazon is a globally important ecosystem that is undergoing rapid development and land-use change. Roads are a key spatial determinant of land-use conversion and strongly influence the rates and patterns of habitat loss and represent a key component of models that attempt to predict the spatio-temporal patterns of Amazonian land-use change and the consequences of such changes. However, the spatio-temporal patterns of road network development are poorly understood and seldom quantified. Here, we used manually digitised satellite imagery at multiple temporal and spatial scales across the Brazilian Amazon to quantify and model the rate at which road networks are proliferating. We found that the road network grew by almost 17,000 km per year between 2004 and 2007. There was large spatial variation in road network density, with some municipalities having road densities as high as 0.5 km/km(2), and road network growth rates were highest in municipalities with an intermediate road network density. Simulations indicated that road network development within municipalities follows a logistic growth pattern through time, with most of the development occurring within a 39-year time period. This time period is similar to those of other boom and bust development dynamics observed in the Brazilian Amazon. Understanding the temporal patterns of road development will aid the development of better predictive land-use change models for the Amazon, given the key importance of roads as a predictor of deforestation in many existing models.

AB This study was carried out to characterize species composition and phytosociology of a native forest located at Caracarai, Roraima, Brazil. All trees with breast diameter (DBH) above 10 cm in nine 1-ha-permanent plots (100 x 100 m each) were inventoried. We observed 4,724 individuals (525 trees per hectare) distributed in 42 families, 111 genera and 165 species. The families with greater number of individuals were Fabaceae (1883), Lecythidaceae (609) and Sapotaceae (434), comprising 52% of the total. The higher densities of individuals were observed in the pioneer (219 trees ha(-1)), followed by secondary (193 trees ha(-1)) and climax species (113 trees ha(-1)). However, species of secondary group had the highest species richness (95), followed by the climax (44) and the pioneer (26). The Shannon diversity index (H' = 3.27) and the value of Pielou equability (J = 0.64) were lower than those obtained in other floristic inventories in the Amazon, because of the high occurrence of Pentaclethra macroloba. The importance values (VI) were higher for Pentaclethra macroloba (52.1), Eschweilera bracteosa (23.7) and Pouteria caimito (8.1). The importance values of these three species alone accounted for 28% of the total VI across species. Most of the individuals (71.3% = 374 trees ha(-1)) were recorded in the middle stratum (12.4 m <= height < 26.5 m) of forest. The forest community can be considered well-structured, mature and diverse, and so it is in good state of conservation.

ID TROPICAL DEFORESTATION; INSTITUTIONS
AB The status of forest conditions before and after intervention of the forestry projects in community forest in three districts of Nepal is examined. Benefits are observed from the adoption of adaptive collaborative management and collective learning and action research in three sampled districts. The adoption of regular silvicultural treatments has increased the availability of forest products to local users. Moreover, improved forest condition and smallholder livelihoods have improved, as has environmental sustainability. However, the community forestry program has several limitations and shortcomings. Elite capture, social disparity, inequitable benefit-sharing and exclusion of poor and marginalized groups from the community forestry program are notable challenges to be solved in coming years. Special attention is needed to make community forestry inclusive with equitable benefit-sharing and a pro-poor focus.

AB We integrate information on functional diversity (FD) patterns from estuarine intertidal benthic communities from different habitats and along a temporal disturbance gradient, to understand the drivers of species coexistence patterns. Species and traits' biomass levels seemed to be first determined by habitat filtering, selecting those traits better adapted to the biologically challenging estuarine environment. Within that subset of traits and within each habitat, biotic interactions were probably high, as evidenced by high alpha-diversity and community weighted mean differences. The former patterns hold for the disturbance/recovery scenario considered. However, as the estuary recovered, biomass became more distributed among different trait categories, consistent with increases in FD when the seagrass started to increase. Policy towards the restoration of seagrass bed and other biogenic structures, and improving the connectivity within adjacent systems were confirmed and suggested, as this would imply higher FD and potentially higher resilience to disturbance within the estuarine intertidal system.

AB Darwin's frogs (Rhinoderma darwinii and R. rufum) are two species of mouth-brooding frogs from Chile and Argentina. Here, we present evidence on the extent of declines, current distribution and conservation status of Rhinoderma spp.; including information on abundance, habitat and threats to extant Darwin's frog populations. All known archived Rhinoderma specimens were examined in museums in North America, Europe and South America. Extensive surveys were carried out throughout the historical ranges of R. rufum and R. darwinii from 2008 to 2012. Literature review and location data of 2,244 archived specimens were used to develop historical distribution maps for Rhinoderma spp. Based on records of sightings, optimal linear estimation was used to estimate whether R. rufum can be considered extinct. No extant R. rufum was found and our modelling inferred that this species became extinct in 1982 (95% CI, 1980-2000). Rhinoderma darwinii was found in 36 sites. All populations were within native forest and abundance was highest in Chiloe Island, when compared with Coast, Andes and South populations. Estimated population size and density (five populations) averaged 33.2 frogs/population (range, 10.2-56.3) and 14.9 frogs/100 m(2) (range, 5.3-74.1), respectively. Our results provide further evidence that R. rufum is extinct and indicate that R. darwinii has declined to a much greater degree than previously recognised. Although this species can still be found across a large part of its historical range, remaining populations are small and severely fragmented. Conservation efforts for R. darwinii should be stepped up and the species re-classified as Endangered.

AB Aim Edaphic heterogeneity may be an important driver of population differentiation in the Amazon but remains to be investigated in trees. We compared the phylogeographic structure across the geographic distribution of two Protium (Burseraceae) species with different degrees of edaphic specialization: Protium alvarezianum, an edaphic specialist of white-sand habitat islands; and Protium subserratum, an edaphic generalist found in white sand as well as in more widespread soil types. We predicted that in the edaphic specialist, geographic distance would structure populations more strongly than in the edaphic generalist, and that soil type would not structure populations in the edaphic generalist unless habitat acts as a barrier promoting population differentiation. Location Tropical rain forests of the Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon, Guyana and French Guiana. Methods We sequenced 12091211bp of non-coding nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal transcribed spacer and external transcribed spacer) and a neutral low-copy nuclear gene (phytochrome C) from P. subserratum (n=65, 10 populations) and P. alvarezianum (n=19, three populations). We conducted a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, constructed maximum parsimony haplotype networks and assessed population differentiation among groups (soil type or geographic locality) using analysis of molecular variance and spatial analysis of molecular variance. Results The edaphic specialist exhibited considerable genetic differentiation among geographically distant populations. The edaphic generalist showed significant genetic differentiation between the Guianan and Amazon Basin populations. Within Peru, soil type and not geographic distance explained most of the variation among populations. Non-white-sand populations in Peru exhibited lower haplotype/nucleotide diversity than white-sand populations, were each other's close relatives, and formed an unresolved clade derived from within the white-sand populations. Main conclusions Geographic distance is a stronger driver of population differentiation in the edaphic specialist than in the generalist. However, this difference did not appear to be related to edaphic generalism per se as adjacent populations from both soil types in the edaphic generalist did not share many haplotypes. Populations of the edaphic generalist in white-sand habitats exhibited high haplotype diversity and shared haplotypes with distant white-sand habitat islands, indicating that they have either efficient long-distance dispersal and/or larger ancestral effective population sizes and thus retain ancestral polymorphisms. These results highlight the importance of edaphic heterogeneity in promoting population differentiation in tropical trees.

AB Tropical rain forests are known for their high biological diversity, but the effects of plant diversity on important ecosystem processes in this biome remain unclear. Interspecies differences in both the demand for nutrients and in foliar and litter nutrient concentrations could drive variations in both the pool sizes and fluxes of important belowground resources, yet our understanding of the effects and importance of aboveground heterogeneity on belowground biogeochemistry is poor, especially in the species-rich forests of the wet tropics. To investigate the effects of individual tree species on below-ground biogeochemical processes, we used both field and laboratory studies to examine how carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycles vary under nine different canopy tree species - including three legume and six non-legume species - that vary in foliar nutrient concentrations in a wet tropical forest in southwestern Costa Rica. We found significant differences in belowground C, N and P cycling under different canopy tree species: total C, N and P pools in standing litter varied by species, as did total soil and microbial C and N pools. Rates of soil extracellular acid phosphatase activity also varied significantly among species and functional groups, with higher rates of phosphatase activity under legumes. In addition, across all tree species, phosphatase activity was significantly positively correlated with litter N/P ratios, suggesting a tight coupling between relative N and P inputs and resource allocation to P acquisition. Overall, our results suggest the importance of aboveground plant community composition in promoting belowground biogeochemical heterogeneity at relatively small spatial scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In agricultural landscapes in central Europe, species richness of the herbaceous plant community may be compromised by processes associated with forest fragmentation, habitat loss, and management practices. We examined variability in species richness and composition of the herbaceous layer in 229 plots located in 23 forest fragments (0.1 to 255 ha), in a representative upland agricultural landscape in central Bohemia, in relation to the most important site environmental factors, edge effects, and site history. The influence of environmental factors on the composition of vegetation in the herb layer was evaluated using generalized additive models, which enabled us to analyze highly non-linear and non-monotonic relationships. Total species richness and number of red-listed and ancient forest species were significantly influenced by type of forest vegetation, light quality, soil pH, slope aspect, and distance from the forest edge. Implications of the significant explanatory variables corresponded well to previous findings, with the exception of distance from the forest edge, for which we found a positive relationship with species richness for distances up to 200 m toward the forest interior. Plant species with low colonization ability occupied plots with increasing frequency from edge to forest interior, while fast-colonizing species showed the opposite trend. Apart from the edge effect, forest continuity should be considered for its important contribution to the richness of ancient forest and red-listed species, whereas the effect of forest fragment size appeared to be generally weak. These results do not negate the importance of large forest fragments for the maintenance of herb layer species richness, but specifically emphasize the essential contribution of the core habitats of these forests. In summary, we showed that the negative effects of habitat fragmentation on the richness of ancient forest and red-listed species and on herb layer species in total can be largely attributed to either the edge effect itself or to aggregate effects of forest edge and forest continuity.

AB Mortality factors that act sequentially through the demographic transitions from seed to sapling may have critical effects on recruitment success. Understanding how habitat heterogeneity influences the causal factors that limit propagule establishment in natural populations is central to assess these demographic bottlenecks and their consequences. Bamboos often influence forest structure and dynamics and are a major factor in generating landscape complexity and habitat heterogeneity in tropical forests. To understand how patch heterogeneity influences plant recruitment we studied critical establishment stages during early recruitment of Euterpe edulis, Sloanea guianensis and Virola bicuhyba in bamboo and non-bamboo stands in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We combined observational studies of seed rain and seedling emergence with seed addition experiments to evaluate the transition probabilities among regeneration stages within bamboo and non-bamboo stands. The relative importance of each mortality factor was evaluated by determining how the loss of propagules affected stage-specific recruitment success. Our results revealed that the seed addition treatment significantly increased seedling survivorship for all three species. E. edulis seedling survival probability increased in the addition treatment in the two stand types. However, for S. guianensis and V. bicuhyba this effect depended strongly on artificially protecting the seeds, as both species experienced increased seed and seedling losses due to post-dispersal seed predators and herbivores. Propagules of all three species had a greater probability of reaching subsequent recruitment stages when protected. The recruitment of large-seeded V. bicuhyba and E. edulis appears to be much more limited by post-dispersal factors than by dispersal limitation, whereas the small-seeded S. guianensis showed an even stronger effect of post-dispersal factors causing recruitment collapse in some situations. We demonstrated that E. edulis, S. guianensis and V. bicuhyba are especially susceptible to predation during early compared with later establishment stages and this early stage mortality can be more crucial than stand differences as determinants of successful regeneration. Among-species differences in the relative importance of dispersal vs. establishment limitation are mediated by variability in species responses to patch heterogeneity. Thus, bamboo effects on the early recruitment of non-bamboo species are patchy and species-specific, with successional bamboo patches exerting a far-reaching influence on the heterogeneity of plant species composition and abundance.

AB Community management of forests for timber extraction has been widely implemented in Mexico. In this article, we investigate the relationship between property rights, community forestry, and deforestation over time. We conduct an econometric analysis of land use change at the municipality level in eight Mexican states that incorporates several variables commonly used in deforestation models plus variables on common property and community forestry. Our results show that both key explanatory variables, common property and community forestry, are related to lower deforestation. Coniferous forests, which have more marketable timber, show a stronger association, indicating that common property management may work by increasing the market value of the standing forest, thus building local consensus for timber management by distributing returns. The measured effects of common property and community forestry on deforestation rates are both statistically significant and large enough to confirm community forestry's usefulness as an environmental policy tool.

AB Historical climate changes and orogenesis are two important factors that have shaped intraspecific biodiversity patterns worldwide. Although southern South America has experienced such complex events, there is a paucity of studies examining the effects on intraspecific diversification in this part of the world. Liolaemus pictus is the southernmost distributed lizard in the Chilean temperate forest, whose genetic structure has likely been influenced by Pleistocene glaciations. We conducted a phylogeographic study of L. pictus in Chile and Argentina based on one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes recovering two strongly divergent groups, Northern and Southern clades. The first group is distributed from the northernmost limit of the species to the Araucania region while the second group is distributed throughout the Andes and the Chiloe archipelago in Southern Chile. Our results suggest that L. pictus originated 751 Kya, with divergence between the two clades occurring in the late Pleistocene. Demographic reconstructions for the Northern and Southern clades indicate a decrease in effective population sizes likely associated with Pleistocene glaciations. Surprisingly, patterns of genetic variation, clades age and historical gene flow in populations distributed within the limits of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are not explained by recent colonization. We propose an "intra-Andean multiple refuge" hypothesis, along with the classical refuge hypothesis previously proposed for the biota of the Chilean Coastal range and Eastern Andean Cordillera. Our hypothesis is supported by niche modelling analysis suggesting the persistence of fragments of suitable habitat for the species within the limits of the LGM ice shield. This type of refuge hypothesis is proposed for the first time for an ectothermic species.

AB In organisms using a wide variety of refuges, both the cost and benefits to the users might be refuge-specific. Under these circumstances, users using mechanisms (e.g., behavioral preference) that allow them to find and colonize refuges in which net benefits are maximized are expected to be selected by the environment. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that resource generalists display strong preferences for resources that provide the greatest reproductive benefits using Calyptraeotheres garthi, a crab that inhabits the limpets Crepidula cachimilla and Bostrycapulus odites in the south-western Atlantic. In the field, female crabs inhabiting C. cachimilla featured larger average body size, and subsequently, larger average fecundity and brood weight than those inhabiting B. odites. Thus, C. cachimilla is a higher quality host for C. garthi compared to B. odites. In contrast to expectations, host selection experiments revealed that female crabs were attracted to the host species from which they were collected and not to the host species that provided the greatest reproductive benefits (C. cachimilla). Host chemical and/or visual cues imprinted in crabs early during ontogeny (soon after colonization of their first host), rather than genetic differences, may explain the source-host fidelity of C. garthi. In the two hosts, females of C. garthi lead a solitary lifestyle and appear to inhabit the same host individual for long periods of time as indicated by the close relationship between female crab and host body size. The frequency of male-female pairs within host individuals was lower than expected by chance alone. Also, males were, on average, smaller than females and did not appear to inhabit the same host individual for long periods of time. The above suggests that males might be using a pure-search mating strategy, continuously roaming among host individuals in search of receptive females. The details of the mating system of C. garthi need to be further investigated. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A historical agreement was reached in Bali under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, encouraging countries to initiate actions to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD). In this context, we use a Panama-based example to show the impacts of the current levels of uncertainty in forest carbon density estimates on GHG baseline estimation and estimations of emission reductions. Using five aboveground tree carbon stock estimates for Moist Tropical forest in a simulation study, we found a difference in terms of annual CO2 emissions of more than 100% between the lowest and the highest estimates. We analyze the economic significance to show that when comparing the income generated for the different forest carbon density estimates to the cost of 10% reduced deforestation, the break-even point differs from US$6.74 to US$16.58 per ton of CO2e between the highest and the lowest estimate. We argue that for a country such as Panama, improving the quality of forest carbon stock estimates would make economic sense since the highest forest carbon density estimates were developed nationally while the lowest estimate is the global default value. REDD could result in a huge incentive for forest protection and improved forest management, in consequence, we highlight that progress on the incorporation of uncertainty analysis and on the mitigation of the main sources of error in forest carbon density estimates merit further methodological guidance.

AB The Juma Sustainable Development Reserve, located in Brazil's state of Amazonas, was the first protected area in Brazil to be benefited by a Reducing Emissions from a Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) project. However, the carbon benefits of REDD projects may be compromised by leakage, or displacement of deforestation to areas outside of the reserve. Through environmental modeling techniques it is possible to simulate scenarios that represent changes in land use and land cover and thus assess the possible trajectories and magnitude of deforestation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Juma reserve in reducing deforestation and to estimate projected carbon emission by 2050. The simulated scenarios were: (1) baseline scenario, without the creation of the Juma reserve; (2) scenario with leakage (SL) where the creation of the reserve would cause a spatial shift in deforestation, and (3) scenario with reduced leakage (SRL), where the amount of deforestation resulting from leakage is reduced. Considering the study area as a whole (Juma reserve +120-km buffer zone), there would be a 16.0% (14,695 km(2)) reduction in forest cover by 2050 in the baseline scenario, 15.9% (14,647 km(2)) in the SL and 15.4% (14,219 km(2)) in the SRL, as compared to what was present in 2008. The loss of forest cover within the limits of the Juma reserve by 2050 would be 18.9% (1052 km(2)) in the baseline scenario and 7.1% (395 km(2)) in the SL and SRL. From the simulated scenarios, the carbon stock in the total study area was estimated to be reduced from 1.63 Pg C (Pg = 10(15) g = 1 billion tons) in 2008 to 1.37 Pg C in 2050 in the baseline scenario and in the SL and to 1.38 Pg C in the SRL. In the area of the Juma reserve, the carbon stock would be reduced from 0.10 Pg C in 2008 to 0.08 Pg C in 2050 (baseline) or 0.09 Pg C (SL and SRL). The Juma reserve was effective in reducing carbon emission by 2050, but the reduction would be substantially less than that calculated in the Juma REDD project. Leakage must be accounted for in REDD projects because the deforestation resulting from this effect could generate "hot air" (carbon credit with no additionality). Over longer time horizons the benefits of reserves are greater and leakage losses are recovered. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mobile species may actively seek refuge from stressful conditions in biogenic habitats on rocky shores. In Hong Kong, the upper intertidal zone is extremely stressful, especially in summer when organisms are emersed for long periods in hot desiccating conditions. As a result, many species migrate downshore between winter and summer to reduce these stressful conditions. The littorinids Echinolittorina malaccana and E. vidua, for example, are found on open rock surfaces high on the shore in winter but the majority migrate downshore in summer to the same tidal height as a common barnacle, Tetraclita japonica. In the laboratory, where environmental conditions could be controlled to approximate those occurring on the shore, we tested whether the downshore migration allowed littorinids to select barnacles as biogenic habitats to reduce stress and if this behaviour varied between seasons. In summer, littorinids demonstrated a strong active preference for the barnacles, which was not observed in the cool winter conditions, when animals were found on open rock surfaces even when barnacles were present. Littorinids, therefore, only actively select biogenic habitats during the summer in Hong Kong when they migrate downshore, suggesting that such habitats may play an important, temporal, role in mitigating environmental stress on tropical shores.

AB An accurate estimate of the impact of edge effects is essential for the conservation management of threatened species in isolated habitat fragments. In a seminal paper, Laurance and Yensen (1991) developed the first generalized predictive model estimating the amount of edge-affected area and remaining unmodified core area in isolated fragments. Despite their conclusion that the core-area model should be applicable to all fragments, regardless of size or shape, the model has never been validated beyond the limited range of parameters under which the model was constructed. Here, we conduct a sensitivity test of the core-area model accounting for ecologically-realistic variation in fragment Shape Index (SI), and collinearity among shape, area and depth of edge influence (DEI). Using well-resolved GIS data for the South Island of New Zealand, we find substantial core-area model underestimates for large fragments (>10,000 ha) with high SI values (>10.0), particularly at high DEI (>100 m). To overcome this we reformulate the core-area model with a more accurate shape-specific exponent function, and test our new model against Laurance and Yensen's core-area model and a null geometric model using an independently-derived GIS dataset for the North Island, New Zealand. Our new model provides a significantly better fit to the data. We conclude that past predictive applications of the core-area model have underestimated true core area, and we recommend our simple re-formulated model for estimating the degree of population and community responses to habitat fragmentation under ecologically-realistic scenarios of high patch shape complexity and large spatial extent of edge influence.

AB Drought is known to be a major bottleneck for woody-community recruitment. The species-specific resistance to drought and factors involved in its variation are of special interest to forecast community fate. We performed an experiment under natural field conditions from winter 2006 to end summer 2008 to investigate the structural responses of woody saplings to nine combinations of light (three habitats differing in plant cover: forest, shrubland, and open) and water (three climate scenarios: drier, current and wetter summers). Our working hypothesis is that plant strategies to cope with drought are determined by habitat characteristics and/or variation of plant traits, and that these different strategies may determine community composition and dynamics. Eight woody species with different life forms and successional stages (trees, mid-successional shrubs, and pioneer shrubs) were selected for the comparison, including therefore species representative of the entire woody community. We explored drought resistance at the population level (D-S), the relations of the different morphological traits to D-S, and the potential importance for plants of inter-specific trade-offs. D-S ranged from 0% to 99% for the different species, depending on the habitat. Some structural traits were found to be related to D-S: positively with total biomass and leaf mass ratio (LMR) and negatively with leaf area-root mass ratio (LARMR). Contrary to previous studies, the present work revealed no evidence of trade-offs, such as survival in forest vs. growth in open, or growth in forest vs. growth in open. Accordingly, some species with low D-S values (Acer opalus and Pinus sylvestris) would be threatened under the future climate conditions, while species having structural characteristics to increase their resistance under expected dry years in coming decades (i.e., high LMR and total biomass or low LARMR, such as Quercus ilex and the shrub Cytisus scoparius) might enhance their recruitment probabilities. Thus, species-specific plant traits, and their effect on D-S, may filter future community assemblages. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Canopy tree populations in mesic savannas are often bimodal with few saplings but many smaller individuals of indeterminate age that repeatedly suffer topkill and regenerate from underground tissues. Little is known about growth rates or mechanisms that allow subadult trees to reach the canopy. The wooded savannas of northern Australia have high frequencies of dry-season fires. In a 32 400-m2 field experiment, 2405 juveniles (<150-cm height) and saplings (150499 cm) of the eucalypt canopy species were individually marked and measured the year prior to fires set in three different seasons and again at the end of the growing season (without fires) a year later. Trees in unburnt plots served as controls. All fire treatments were repeated in plots dominated by the most common understorey, a native annual grass (sorghum) and in plots dominated by perennial native species; these produce different fuels for fires and competitive regimes for young trees. After early dry-season fires, height growth of larger juveniles and all saplings was significantly enhanced, especially in sorghum. After late dry- or wet-season fires, juvenile trees grew well, but all of the small saplings (150- to 299-cm height) were reduced to juveniles and did not recover pre-fire heights but, instead, produced many new basal (coppice) stems. Late, dry-season fires reduced more than 80% of large saplings (300499 cm) to juvenile size in sorghum, whereas in non-sorghum, 60% of the trees grew to poles (500999 cm). The results demonstrate that juvenile and sapling growth responses to fire and the probability of subadult trees reaching the canopy are related to fireunderstorey interactions, and suggest that the mechanisms include morphological and carbohydrate storage dynamics which vary with tree size and life history stage. The key to successful management of a sustainable woody canopy lies in the understorey.

AB Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is a set of techniques aimed to maintain forest structure and functions of the harvested forest as similar as possible to pre-logging status, while reducing adverse impacts from logging activity on the remaining forest. We analysed the mid-term effects of RIL on the regeneration of the long-lived pioneers (LLP) Bagassa guianensis and Jacaranda copaia: the partially shade tolerant (PST) Hymenaea courbaril, Dipteryx odorata, and Carapa guianensis and the total shade tolerant species (TST) Symphonia globulifera and Manilkara huberi. This study was carried out in an intensive study plot in the 600,000-ha Tapajos National Forest, Eastern Amazon - Brazil (03 degrees 02'S and 54 degrees 56'W). Three transects split in 10 x 10 m plots, adding up to 2.37 ha were sampled in an area where RIL was applied, and compared with a same size sampling in an unlogged area. The regeneration of individuals <= 20 cm in dbh was inventoried and measured before logging in 2003 and three times after logging (2004, 2006, and 2009). RIL modified the forest structure creating more gap-phase plots, with the consequences of such disturbance still remaining after 6 years. Densities of B. guianensis, J. copaia, and S. globulifera increased, while C guianensis diminished. The positive effect on the density of LLP species was, however, ephemeral and disappeared 2 years after logging. RIL had a positive effect on the height growth rate of S. globulifera and on the dbh growth rate of C. guianensis. Plants growing in the gap-phase plots had higher height growth rates (ANOVA, F-2;2980 = 33.3, p < 0.001) than plants growing in other phases, but the same difference was not observed for dbh growth rates (ANOVA, F-1;364 = 0.9, p = 0.33). Crown position had positive effects on height and dbh growth rates: the higher the crown position, the faster the plant grows in height (ANOVA, F-3;2979 = 148.4, p < 0.001) and dbh (ANOVA, F-3;362 = 26.1, p < 0.001). The application of RIL following the Brazilian regulations, may be considered a silvicultural technique for increasing density and growth rates of commercial species, but additional silvicultural interventions, as liberation for example, might be required for maintaining the ecological outcomes of RIL in the long run.

AB Aim British estuarine ecosystems support large populations of protected migratory waders. Understanding how wader communities vary spatially and how they may be changing temporally can greatly improve the understanding of these dynamic ecosystems. Here, we explore the variation in functional diversity (using a range of morphological and ecological traits) in order to identify the processes shaping wader communities on British estuaries and how these processes may be changing.
   Location England, Wales and Scotland.
   Methods We use national survey data (Wetland Bird Survey) from 1980/1981 to 2006/2007 winter to calculate functional diversity (FD) - an index that measures trait dispersion - in wader communities on 100 estuaries. We test for evidence of non-random patterns of diversity and explore the relative importance of two key processes, environmental filtering and competition, in shaping these communities.
   Results The observed FD was significantly and positively associated with species richness and to a lesser extent estuary area, followed by longitude. An increase in observed FD was observed since 1980, supported by a small but significant slope. In the majority of cases, changes in FD were mirrored by changes in species richness. Observed FD was on average lower than expected by chance, as indicated by a negative value of observed minus expected FD. However, this difference became less negative over time, with observed minus expected FD values increasing slightly, but significantly, over the study period.
   Main conclusions Wader FD varies across British estuaries, and the relative influence of the processes by which communities are structured appears to be changing through time. We discuss the potential drivers underlying these patterns and the importance of identifying such drivers for the protection of wader communities.

AB Hunting is one of the greatest conservation challenges facing tropical wildlife. Wildlife in Indian tropical forests are vulnerable to hunting, although data on hunting impacts from the region are limited. We use a meta-analysis of 143 hunting studies from India to identify the species and geographic regions most at risk, and to assess their legal protection. We found evidence of hunting in 114 mammal species, with larger-bodied mammals being particularly vulnerable. Although 75% of all studies focused on mammals, few actually quantified hunting impacts. Further, among studies of all terrestrial vertebrates where hunting was mentioned, only 6% focused exclusively on hunting. With further research, we expect that the suite of species known to be exploited by hunters will increase. We conclude that the Eastern Himalaya and Indo-Myanmar biodiversity-hotspot complex is particularly vulnerable to hunting. Quantitative studies of hunting impacts are urgently needed across India, especially in this biodiversity-hotspot complex. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Habitat loss reduces species diversity, but the effect of habitat fragmentation on number of species is less clear because fragmentation generally accompanies loss of habitat. We compared four methods that aim to decouple the effects of fragmentation from the effects of habitat loss. Two methods are based on species-area relations, one on Fisher's alpha index of diversity, and one on plots of cumulative number of species detected against cumulative area sampled. We used these methods to analyze the species diversity of spiders in 2, 3.2 x 4 km agricultural landscapes in Southern Judea Lowlands, Israel. Spider diversity increased as fragmentation increased with all four methods, probably not because of the additive within-patch processes, such as edge effect and heterogeneity. The positive relation between fragmentation and species diversity might reflect that most species can disperse through the fields during the wheat-growing season. We suggest that if a given area was designated for the conservation of spiders in Southern Judea Lowlands, Israel, a set of several small patches may maximize species diversity over time.

AB Treefall gaps play important roles in both forest dynamics and species diversity, but variability across the full range of gap sizes has not been reported at a regional scale due to the lack of a consistent methodology for their detection. Here we demonstrate the sensitivity of Landsat data for detecting gaps at the subpixel level in the Manaus region, Central Amazon. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) on treefall gaps was used to map their occurrence across a 3.4 x 10(4) km(2) landscape using the annual change in non-photosynthetic vegetation (Delta NPV) as the change metric. Thirty randomly selected pixels with a spectral signature of a treefall event (i.e. high Delta NPV) were surveyed in the field. The most frequent single-pixel gap size detected using Landsat was similar to 360 m(2), and the severity of the disturbance (Delta NPV) exhibited a significant (r(2) = 0.32, p = 0.001) correlation with the number of dead trees (>10 cm diameter at breast height), enabling quantification of the number of downed trees in each gap. To place the importance of these single-pixel disturbances into a broader context, the cumulative disturbance of these gaps was equivalent to 40% of the calculated deforestation across the Manaus region in 2008. Most detected single-pixel gaps consisted of six to eight downed trees covering an estimated area of 250-900 m(2). These results highlight the quantitative importance of small blowdowns that have been overlooked in previous satellite remote sensing studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Millennial-scale biogeographic changes are well understood in many parts of the world, but little is known about long-term vegetation dynamics in subtropical regions. Here we investigate shifts in C-3/C-4 plant abundance occurred in central Argentina during the past few millennia
   We determined present day soil organic matter delta C-13 signatures of grasslands, shrublands and woodlands, containing different mixtures of C-3 and C-4 plants. We measured past changes in the relative cover of C-3/C-4 plants by comparing delta C-13 values in soil profiles with present day delta C-13 signatures. We analyzed C-14 activity in soil depths that showed major changes in vegetation.
   Present day relative cover of C-3/C-4 plants determines whole ecosystem delta C-13 signatures integrated as litter and superficial soil organic matter (R-2 = 0.78; p < 0.01). Deeper soils show a consistent shift in delta C-13, indicating a continuous replacement of C-4 by C-3 plants since 3,870 (+/- 210) YBP. During this period, the relative abundance of C-3 plants increased 32% (average across sites) with significant changes being observed in all studied ecosystems.
   Our results show that C-4 species were more abundant in the past, but C-3 species became dominant during the late Holocene. We identified increases in the relative C-3/C-4 cover in grasslands, shrublands and woodlands, suggesting a physiological basis for changes in vegetation. The replacement of C-4 by C-3 plants coincided with changes in climate towards colder and wetter conditions and could represent a climatically driven shift in the C-4 species optimum range.

AB Along the coast of central Chile, geographic trends of diversity have been inferred from literature compilations and museum collections based on species range limits for some taxonomic groups. However, spatially-intensive field-based assessments of macrobenthic species richness are largely missing. Over the course of a multiyear study (1998-2005), we characterized latitudinal patterns of rocky intertidal diversity at 18 sites along the coast of central Chile (29-36 degrees S). At each site, the number of sessile and mobile macrobenthic species was quantified in 0.25 m(2) quadrats. Two estimators of local (alpha) diversity were used: observed local species richness, calculated from the asymptote of a species-rarefaction curve, and the Chao2 index, which takes into account the effect of rare species on estimates of local richness. We identified a total of 71 species belonging to 66 genera for a total of 86 taxa. The most diverse groups were herbivorous mollusks (27 taxa) and macroalgae (43 taxa). Diversity showed a complex spatial pattern with areas of high species richness interspersed with areas of low richness. In accordance with previous work, we found no trend in the number of herbivorous mollusks and an inverse and significant latitudinal gradient in the number of algal species. Our results highlight the need for taxonomically diverse assessments of biodiversity of the dominant taxa that conform intertidal communities.

TI Phylogeography of the Patagonian otter Lontra provocax: adaptive

AB Background: A number of studies have described the extension of ice cover in western Patagonia during the Last Glacial Maximum, providing evidence of a complete cover of terrestrial habitat from 41 degrees S to 56 degrees S and two main refugia, one in south-eastern Tierra del Fuego and the other north of the Chilo, Island. However, recent evidence of high genetic diversity in Patagonian river species suggests the existence of aquatic refugia in this region. Here, we further test this hypothesis based on phylogeographic inferences from a semi-aquatic species that is a top predator of river and marine fauna, the huillin or Southern river otter (Lontra provocax).
   Results: We examined mtDNA sequences of the control region, ND5 and Cytochrome-b ( 2151 bp in total) in 75 samples of L. provocax from 21 locations in river and marine habitats. Phylogenetic analysis illustrates two main divergent clades for L. provocax in continental freshwater habitat. A highly diverse clade was represented by haplotypes from the marine habitat of the Southern Fjords and Channels (SFC) region (43 degrees 38' to 53 degrees 08'S), whereas only one of these haplotypes was paraphyletic and associated with northern river haplotypes.
   Conclusions: Our data support the hypothesis of the persistence of L. provocax in western Patagonia, south of the ice sheet limit, during last glacial maximum (41 degrees S latitude). This limit also corresponds to a strong environmental change, which might have spurred L. provocax differentiation between the two environments.

AB Plague is a vector-borne, highly virulent zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Yersima pesos It persists in nature through transmission between its hosts (wild rodents) and vectors (fleas). During epizootics, the disease expands and spills over to other host species such as humans living in or close to affected areas Here, we investigate the effect of large-scale climate variability on the dynamics of human plague in the western United States using a 56-year time series of plague reports (1950-2005). We found that El Nino Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation in combination affect the dynamics of human plague over the western United States. The underlying mechanism could involve changes in precipitation and temperatures that impact both hosts and vectors It is suggested that snow also may play a key role, possibly through its effects on summer soil moisture, which is known to be instrumental for flea survival and development and sustained growth of vegetation for rodents

AB Much of our understanding of the response of savanna systems to fire disturbance relies on observations derived from manipulative fire plot studies. Equivocal findings from both recent Australian and African savanna fire plot assessments have significant implications for informing conservation management and reliable estimation of biomass stocks and dynamics. Influential northern Australian replicated fire plot studies include the 24-year plot-scale Munmarlary and the five-year catchment-scale Kapalga, mesic savanna (>1000 mm/yr of rainfall) experiments in present-day Kakadu National Park. At Munmarlary, under low-to-moderate-intensity fire treatments, woody vegetation dominated by mature eucalypts was found to be structurally stable. At Kapalga, substantial declines in woody biomass were observed under more intense fire treatments, and modeling assessments implicate early-season fires as having adverse effects on longer-term tree recruitment. Given these contrasting perspectives, here we take advantage of a landscape-scale fire response monitoring program established on three major northern Australian conservation reserves (Kakadu, Litchfield, and Nitmiluk National Parks). Using statistical modeling we assess the decadal effects of ambient fire regime parameters (fire frequency, severity, seasonality, time since fire) on 32 vegetation structure components and abundance of 21 tree and 16 grass species from 122 monitoring plots. Over the study period the mean annual frequency of burning of plots was 0.53, comprising mostly early-dry-season, low-severity fires. Structural and species responses were variable but often substantial, notably resulting in stem recruitment and declines in juveniles, but only weakly explained by fire regime and habitat variables. Modeling of these observations under three realistic scenarios (increased fire severity under projected worsening climate change; modest and significant reductions in fire frequency to meet conservation criteria) indicates that all scenarios have positive and negative structural implications. Effecting significant regional fire regime change (e. g., reduction in frequency and size of severe fires) is demonstrably feasible, but it incurs risks and potentially some undesirable structural consequences. Given recent Australian and African experience, the generality and application of landscape-scale implications derived from manipulative fire assessments (including variable grazing and browsing regimes) in savanna require more critical assessment.

AB Wood specific gravity is the single best descriptor of wood functional properties and tree life-history traits, and it is the most important variable in estimating carbon stocks in forests. Tropical pioneer trees produce wood of increasing specific gravity across the trunk radius as they grow in stature. Here, we tested whether radial increases in wood specific gravity were dependent on a tree's diameter or its age by comparing trees of different diameters within cohorts. We cored trunks of four pioneer species in naturally regenerating, even-aged stands in the lowland, wet forests of Costa Rica. For each core, specific gravity was determined for 1-cm radial wood segments, pith to bark. Increases across the radius were evident in all four species studied, and in four different stands for one species. For any given species in a given stand, the rate of radial increase in specific gravity as a function of radial distance from the pith was greater in smaller diameter trees. As the trees in a stand represent a colonizing cohort, these results strongly suggest that the radial increases in specific gravity in lowland pioneers are associated with tree age, not with tree diameter. Furthermore, the specific gravity of the outermost wood was not associated with tree radius, further negating size dependence. One consequence of these results is that species-specific biomass estimates for trees in secondary forests are likely to be confounded by age, as diameter alone may be a poor indicator of specific gravity in individual trees for pioneers of tropical wet forests.

AB Many studies have evaluated the effect of forest fragmentation on dung beetle assemblage structure. However, few have analyzed how forest fragmentation affects the processes carried out by these insects in tropical forests where their food sources consist mainly of dung produced by native herbivore mammals. With the conversion of forests to pastures, cattle dung has become an exotic alternative and abundant food for dung beetles. This study compares dung removal rates of native (monkey) and exotic (cow) dung in different-sized fragments of tropical rain forests, during the dry and rainy seasons at the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve. Dung removal rates were affected by season, dung type, and the interaction between resource type and season. During the dry season, the removal rates of monkey dung were somewhat similar than during the rainy season, whereas the removal rates of cow dung were much higher during the rainy season. Dung beetle biomass and species richness were almost three times greater in monkey dung than in cow dung. Monkey dung attracted species belonging to the dweller, roller, and tunneler guilds; cow dung attracted mostly tunnelers. Therefore, the use of exotic dung may result in a biased misconception of the rates of dung removal in tropical forest and an underestimation of dung beetle diversity. This study highlights the importance of working with natural tropical forest resources when attempting to identify realistic tendencies concerning processes in natural habitats and those modified by fragmentation and by other human activities.

AB One important hypothesis to explain tree-species coexistence in tropical forests suggests that increased attack by natural enemies near conspecific trees gives locally rare species a competitive advantage. Host ranges of natural enemies generally encompass several closely related plant taxa suggesting that seedlings should also do poorly around adults of closely related species. We investigated the effects of adult Parashorea malaanonan on seedling survival in a Bornean rain forest. Survival of P. malaanonan seedlings was highest at intermediate distances from parent trees while heterospecific seedlings were unaffected by distance. Leaf herbivores did not drive this relationship. Survival of seedlings was lowest for P. malaanonan, and increased with phylogenetic dissimilarity from this species, suggesting that survival of close relatives of common species is reduced. This study suggests that distance dependence contributes to species coexistence and highlights the need for further investigation into the role of shared plant enemies in community dynamics.

AB There is circumstantial evidence that grasslands on the Bunya Mountains were once maintained by Aboriginal burning, and with lack of fire under European management are being colonised by trees. To assess the efficacy of burning for maintaining grasslands, 119 fires were lit between 1996 and 2006. The total area of unburnt grasslands decreased by 27%, while grasslands burnt at least once decreased by 1%. The density of invading trees was recorded from fixed plots on 23 grasslands burnt between one and six times. Cassinia was virtually eliminated and the density of the Rainforest species guild slowly but continually declined. Acacia irrorata exhibited a humped response, with initial increases resulting from vegetative resprouting and gradual decline with persistent burning. Phyllodinous Acacia and Woodland trees were the least fire sensitive guilds, having stable or increased density with repeated burning. Multi-factor regression modelling detected no significant relationships between changes in woody plant density and the interval between fires, fire intensity, the initial density of large trees, an index of soil moisture, or the cumulative number of fires for any species guild. The survivorship of both Cassinia and Rainforest guilds was significantly lower with summer burning than winter burning, but a seasonal effect of burning was not evident for other guilds. The findings suggest that regardless of fire conditions, frequent burning will reduce the number of adult trees, maintain resprouts in an immature state, facilitate further fire and reduce the rate of grassland loss. Woodland species are especially resilient to fire, and burning to maintain grassy ecosystems will be most successful where the main colonisers are rainforest species and burning is conducted in summer. The findings suggest that the montane grasslands of the Bunya Mountains were maintained by anthropogenic burning and active fire management will prolong their existence.

AB The modification of large areas of tropical forest to agricultural uses has consequences for the movement of inorganic nitrogen (N) from land to water. Various biogeochemical pathways in soils and riparian zones can influence the movement and retention of N within watersheds and affect the quantity exported in streams. We used the concentrations of NO3- and NH4+ in different hydrological flowpaths leading from upland soils to streams to investigate inorganic N transformations in adjacent watersheds containing tropical forest and established cattle pasture in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon Basin. High NO3- concentrations in forest soil solution relative to groundwater indicated a large removal of N mostly as NO3- in flowpaths leading from soil to groundwater. Forest ground water NO3- concentrations were lower than in other Amazon sites where riparian zones have been implicated as important N sinks. Based on water budgets for these watersheds, we estimated that 7.3-10.3 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) was removed from flowpaths between 20 and 100 cm, and 7.1-10.2 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) was removed below 100 cm and the top of the groundwater. N removal from vertical flowpaths in forest exceeded previously measured N2O emissions of 3.0 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) and estimated emissions of NO of 1.4 kg N ha(-1) y(-1). Potential fates for this large amount of nitrate removal in forest soils include plant uptake, denitrification, and abiotic N retention. Conversion to pasture shifted the system from dominance by processes producing and consuming NO3- to one dominated by NH4+, presumably the product of lower rates of net N mineralization and net nitrification in pasture compared with forest. In pasture, no hydrological flowpaths contained substantial amounts of NO3- and estimated N removal from soil vertical flowpaths was 0.2 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) below the depth of 100 cm. This contrasts with the extent to which agricultural sources dominate N inputs to groundwater and stream water in many temperate regions. This could change, however, if pasture agriculture in the tropics shifts toward intensive crop cultivation.

AB This article examines the expansion of cattle ranching from 1850 to 1950 into lowland forests of Colombia. Although most attention to ranching as a source of deforestation in Latin America has focused on the second half of the 20th century, in Colombia it has a much longer history. The article also examines the role of introduced African grasses in the process of pasture development. While it discusses their ability to suppress, secondary-forest regeneration, it underscores their contribution to productivity gains to help explain their wide diffusion. Lastly, the article suggests that paying greater attention to the costs and labor of pasture formation can serve as a springboard to reexamine a number of common stereotypes about ranching: that the logic of livestock was not about producing beef; that cattle were primarily a means to control territory; and that ranching 'profits' stemmed from extra-economic sources. Although there is some truth to these explanations, the dominance of cattle throughout the countryside cannot be explained without taking the economic and productive logic of ranching into account. This, in turn, should also help push LIS to better understand the nature of landed power and the dynamics of agrarian change in Colombia. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The matrix is an important element of landscape mosaics that influences wildlife indirectly through its influence on habitat, and directly, if they live in or move through it. Therefore, to quantify and manage habitat quality for wildlife in modified landscapes, it is necessary to consider the characteristics of both patch and matrix elements of the whole landscape mosaic. To isolate matrix effects from the often simultaneous and confounding influence of patch and landscape characteristics, we identified nineteen 500 m radius landscapes in southeast Queensland, Australia with similar remnant forest patch attributes, habitat loss, and fragmentation, but exhibiting a marked gradient from rural through high-density suburban development of the matrix, quantified by a weighted road-length metric. We measured habitat disturbance, structure, and floristics in patch core, patch edge and matrix landscape elements to characterise how landscape habitat quality changes for small mammals. Correlation analyses identified that with increased matrix development intensity, human disturbance of core sites increased, predators and exotic plant species richness in matrix sites increased, and structural complexity (e.g. logs and stumps) in the matrix decreased. Ordination analyses showed landscape elements were most similar in habitat structure and floristics at low to moderate levels of matrix development, suggesting enhanced landscape habitat quality. Matrix development intensity was not, however, the greatest source of overall variation of habitat throughout landscapes. Many variables, such as landholder behaviour, complicate the relationship. For enhanced conservation outcomes the matrix needs to be managed to control disturbances and strategically plan for matrix habitat retention and restoration.

AB Tropical forests are one of the richest sources of bio-diversity and are well known for their ecosystem services. There is a pressing need to monitor the rate and extent of changes in forest cover of countries like India for efficient planning and management leading to sustainable development. Imaging spectroscopy is one of the newer techniques adopted for species-level discrimination. Of the available sensors, spaceborne ones are cost-effective and are more appropriate for monitoring in countries like India. The present study aims at classifying tropical trees using Hyperion (EO-1) and SAM (Spectral Angle Mapper) algorithm. The study was conducted in the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS), Narmada District, Gujarat, India. Hyperion data were obtained during October 2006 when the vegetation was lush green. Field survey was done coinciding with data acquisition time. The tree species identified for discrimination were Tectona grandis L., Dendrocalamus strictus Nees., Mangifera indica L., Madhuca indica J. F. Gmel. and Ficus glomerata Roxb. Hyperion data were preprocessed. End-member spectra for each species were selected and used as library spectra for the classification. SAM was performed for the entire spectrum, VIS-NIR region (1-90 bands), SWIR-I region (103-136 bands), SWIR-II region (159-195 bands), 1-10 MNF and 1-15 MNF bands. Overall accuracy assessment (OAA), kappa coefficient and user's and producer's accuracy were calculated. SAM classification with 196 bands (full-spectra) of Hyperion data gave 51% OAA for the five tropical trees selected. The obtained OAA was appropriate looking at the pattern of vegetal cover and also of the sensor used. Partition analysis of the spectrum indicated superiority of VIS-NIR region for classification. SWIR-I and II did not fare well because of the biophysical state of vegetal cover. SAM showed the highest accuracy (59.57%) for spectra of 1-10 MNF bands. Higher accuracy using MNF band combination indicated the potential of MNF transformation to increase classification accuracy of tropical trees by reducing data dimensionality. Our study indicates that homogeneity in the vegetal cover is a critical aspect for classification in the tropical areas. We conclude that SAM is an appropriate method for classifying Hyperion data of the tropics. With the reported densities for Tectona and Dendrocalamus, Hyperion is found to be an appropriate sensor for monitoring.

AB Although the global decline in coral reef health is likely to have profound effects on reef associated fishes, these effects are poorly understood. While declining coral cover can reduce the abundance of reef fishes through direct effects on recruitment and/or mortality, recent evidence suggests that individuals may survive in disturbed habitats, but may experience sublethal reductions in their condition. This study examined the response of 2 coral associated damselfishes (Pomacentridae), Chrysiptera parasema and Dascyllus melanurus, to varying levels of live coral cover. Growth, persistence, and the condition of individuals were quantified on replicate coral colonies in 3 coral treatments: 100% live coral (control), 50% live coral (partial) and 0% live coral (dead). The growth rates of both species were directly related to the percentage live coral cover, with individuals associated with dead corals exhibiting the slowest growth, and highest growth on control corals. Such differences in individual growth between treatments were apparent after 29 d. There was no significant difference in the numbers of fishes persisting or the physiological condition of individuals between different treatments on this time-scale. Slower growth in disturbed habitats will delay the onset of maturity, reduce lifetime fecundity and increase individual's vulnerability to gape-limited predation. Hence, immediate effects on recruitment and survival may underestimate the longer-term impacts of declining coral on the structure and diversity of coral-associated reef fish communities.

AB This paper examines invasion of grasslands on Cape York Peninsula, Australia, by Melaleuca viridiflora and other woody species, and the role of storm-burning (lighting fires after the first wet season rains) in their maintenance. Trends in disturbance features, fuel characteristics, ground layer composition, and woody plants dynamics under combinations of withholding fire and storm-burning over a 3-year period were measured on 19 plots in three landscape settings. Population dynamics of M. viridiflora are described in detail and 20-year population projections based on transition matrices under different fire regimes generated. Numerous M. viridiflora suckers occurred within the grass layer, increasing each year regardless of fire regime, and were rapidly recruited to the canopy in the absence of fire. Storm-burning had little impact on fuel, ground layer or woody plant composition, but maintained open vegetation structure by substantially reducing recruitment of M. viridiflora suckers to the sapling layer, and by reducing the above-grass-layer abundance of several other invasive woody species. Population projections indicated that withholding fire for 20 years could cause a sevenfold increase of M. viridiflora density on Ti-tree flats, and that annual to triennial storm-burning should be effective at maintaining a stable open vegetation structure. These findings argue against vegetation thickening being an inevitable consequence of climate change. We conclude that a fire regime that includes regular storm-burning can be effective for maintaining grasslands and grassy woodlands being invaded by M. viridiflora.

AB An understanding of growth and photosynthetic potential of subtropical rainforest species to variations in light environment can be useful for determining the sequence of species introductions in rainforest restoration projects and mixed species plantations. We examined the growth and physiology of six Australian subtropical rainforest tree species in a greenhouse consisting of three artificial light environments (10%, 30%, and 60% full sunlight). Morphological responses followed the typical sun-shade dichotomy, with early and late secondary species (Elaeocarpus grandis, Flindersia brayleyana, Flindersia schottiana, and Gmelina leichhardtii) displaying higher relative growth rate (RGR) compared to mature stage species (Cryptocarya erythroxyion and Heritiera trifoliolatum). Growth and photosynthetic performance of most species reached a maximum in 30-60% full sunlight. Physiological responses provided limited evidence of a distinct dichotomy between early and late successional species. E. grandis and F brayleyana, provided a clear representation of early successional species, with marked increase in Am in high light and an ability to down regulate photosynthetic machinery in low light conditions. The remaining species (F. schottiana, G. leichhardtii, and H. trifoliolatum) were better represented as failing along a shade-tolerant continuum, with limited ability to adjust physiologically to an increase or decrease in light, maintaining similar A(max) across all light environments. Results show that most species belong to a shade-tolerant constituency, with an ability to grow and persist across a wide range of light environments. The species offer a wide range of potential planting scenarios and silvicultural options, with ample potential to achieve rapid canopy closure and rainforest restoration goals. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB The tree community (dbh > 5 cm) of a fragment of tropical montane semi-deciduous forest in South-east Brazil was repeatedly surveyed over a 19-year period in order to assess spatial and temporal patterns of dynamics. The surveys took place in 1987, 1992, 1996, 2001, and 2006 in a grid of 126 20 x 20 m permanent plots covering almost the entire fragment (5.8 ha). Overall patterns indicated that a self-thinning process has taken place in the fragment since 1992. Community dynamics varied in space and time, with most dynamics highly spatially clustered. With exception of mortality rates, there were no changes in the spatial patterns of community dynamics through time. No relation between edges and dynamics variables was found. Most species with increasing density and basal area were shade-bearers, while most decreasing species were canopy light demanders and pioneers.

   ENCLOSURES
AB The few remaining Afromontane forest fragments in northern Ethiopia and the surrounding degraded, semiarid matrix form a habitat mosaic of varying suitability for forest birds. To evaluate the effect of recent land rehabilitation efforts on bird community composition and diversity, we studied bird species distributions in ten small forest fragments (0.40-20.95 ha), five grazing exclosures (10-year-old forest restoration areas without wood extraction and grazing livestock) and three grazed matrix sites during the rainy season (July-October 2004) using 277 one-hour species counts. Based on the distribution pattern of 146 bird species, sites were assigned to one of three bird communities (birds of moist forest, dry forest or degraded savanna), each occupying a well-defined position along an environmental gradient reflecting decreasing vegetation structure and density. All three communities were representative of the avifauna of Afrotropical Highland open forest and woodland with a high proportion of invasive and competitive generalist species (31%). Apart from these, exclosures shared more species with forest fragments (20%) than did the grazed matrix (5%), indicating local ecosystem recovery. By increasing habitat heterogeneity, exclosures have the potential to enhance landscape connectivity for forest birds and are, therefore, an effective instrument for conserving species in a fragmented landscape. However, 52 bird species (36%) occurred exclusively within forest patches and many forest birds that use exclosures are unlikely to maintain viable populations when forest fragments disappear, particularly as forest fragments may be a critical resource during the hot dry season. This highlights the high conservation value of small isolated forest fragments for less tolerant, forest-limited and/or biome-restricted species.

AB Aim Local communities are subject to spatiotemporal contingencies of landscape processes; community assembly is thus often considered to be unpredictable and idiosyncratic. However, evolved trade-offs of species' life histories may set distinct constraints on the assembly of species communities. In plants, the recruitment and invasion success of species into communities depend primarily on the number of propagules available and on their generative or vegetative character. Life-history trade-offs prevent individual plants from producing large numbers of both generative and vegetative propagules, but it is not clear whether this constrains their availability at the landscape scale. We thus tested whether: (1) the observed relationship between generative and vegetative propagules deviates from the null expectation stating that species contributing the bulk of generative propagules to the propagule rain should also contribute the bulk of vegetative propagules; and (2) whether vegetative and generative propagule pressures are negatively correlated once species abundance in the regional pool is accounted for.
   Location A large riparian landscape in the Netherlands.
   Methods Analyses were based on an extensive trapping of floating propagules (214,049 propagules of 47 species), and a rough proxy of species abundance across the entire pool. We used both species and phylogenetically independent contrasts as data points, and accounted for variation in size of generative propagules.
   Results Both hypotheses were confirmed. Numbers of generative and vegetative propagules trapped per species were significantly negatively correlated (r = -0.33; t(45) = -2.61, P = 0.006) and thus strongly deviated from the null expectation. This was confirmed by analyses accounting for variation in species abundance across the species pool, and in the size of generative propagules.
   Main conclusions The results indicate that plant recruitment and community assembly across streams may be influenced by the way individual plants allocate their resources between competing life-history functions. Life-history evolution across angiosperms might thus have constrained the present-day assembly of local communities.

AB This chapter re-visits the facts and Figures of previous chapters, augmenting the discussion with other relevant literature. It reviews trends in regional deforestation, human population growth, and demands for forest (tree) products; and provides an overview of common tree-based landuse and management systems and their potential contribution to expand the regional forest base and generate forest products and services. Emphasis is placed on the contribution of smallholder tree-based (agroforestry) systems, given their additional function of supporting rural livelihoods of the potential of smallholder agroforestry systems to contribute to sustainable forest management and rural livelihoods are identified and discussed. Enabling conditions, institutional and policy support, and market oriented strategies are all discussed as means to strengthen the development and productivity of smallholder agroforestry systems. Discussions on those topics are well supported with citations and lessons learned emphasizing the experience from the Philippines. The main message of the chapter is twofold: (1) a paradigm shift in the forest sector is required to recognize the contribution and importance of smallholder systems to achieve sustainable forest management objectives; and (2) there is a need to adopt more holistic and sustainable strategies to support and strengthen institutions and smallholder system development, including linkages with the market.

AB The neutral theory of S. P. Hubbell postulates a two-scale hierarchical framework consisting of a metacommunity following the speciation - drift equilibrium characterized by the "biodiversity number'' theta, and local communities following the migration - drift equilibrium characterized by the "migration rate'' m ( or the "fundamental dispersal number'' I). While Etienne's sampling formula allows simultaneous estimation of h and m from a single sample of a local community, its applicability to a network of ( rather small) samples is questionable. We de. ne here an alternative two-stage approach estimating h from an adequate subset of the individuals sampled in the field ( using Ewens' sampling formula) and m from community samples ( using Etienne's sampling formula). We compare its results with the simultaneous estimation of theta and m ( one-stage estimation), for simulated neutral samples and for 50 1-ha plots of evergreen forest in South India. The one-stage approach exhibits problems of bias and of poor differentiability between high-theta, low-m and low-theta, high-m solution domains. Conversely, the two-stage approach yielded reasonable estimates and is to be preferred when several small, scattered plots are available instead of a single large one.

AB 1. The nature and resources supplied by different components of habitats influence species, creating variability from place to place within a habitat.
   2. Experiments were done to investigate the effects of altering components of habitats on the variability of assemblages of numerous species of intertidal gastropods.
   3. Artificial habitats with three levels of structure, combining different types of turf (i.e. different densities and height of fronds) were sampled 8 weeks after deployment in the intertidal. They were rapidly colonized by up to 66 species of gastropods.
   4. Independently of the types of turf combined to form different habitats, there were differences in assemblages where there was more than one type of component present. Multivariate dissimilarities among units making up each habitat were also greater where there were more than one type of unit, but there was no such difference in the variance of numbers of species per unit.
   5. Altering the relative abundances of different types of components made little change to the assemblages, nor their multivariate variability among units of habitat and the variance in number of species per unit in each habitat.
   6. Differences in assemblages due to the different structure of habitat are complex to interpret and simple characterizations of structure of habitat are inadequate. Comparing different habitats requires appropriate experimentation to ensure that variability within habitats is also investigated.

AB Selective logging of tropical forests damages residual trees and creates canopy openings throughout the stand. In the Amazon, reduced-impact logging results in significantly less damage than conventional unplanned logging; yet either logging method leads to substantial fragmentation of the forest canopy. increased mortality rates of trees damaged in logging have been documented. In this paper, we investigate the effect of logging disturbance on treefall rates.
   Using repeat inventories of canopy trees (>= 35 cm dbh) in six large (>= 50-ha) forest stands at two sites in the eastern Amazon, we measured mortality rates in three treatment classes: unlogged, conventionally logged (CL) and logged using reduced-impact methods (RIL). At least 3000 trees were mapped and inventoried per stand prior to timber harvests. In the second inventory, 3 years after harvests in the logged stands, all trees were located and scored as living, standing dead, uprooted or broken.
   We found significantly higher overall mortality rates for trees in logged forest (both CL and RIL stands) than in adjacent unlogged forest. This effect was largely due to higher rates of treefall (i.e., stems uprooted or broken from natural causes). Moreover, significantly higher treefall rates were recorded for trees in logged forest that were not damaged in the logging than for trees in unlogged stands. Treefall rates were nearly twice as high in conventionally logged forest as in forest logged using reduced-impact methods. We found indirect support for the hypothesis that increased treefall rates in logged forest are related to increased canopy opening and fragmentation through analysis of the locations of fallen trees in relation to canopy disturbance.

AB Red wood ants (Formica rufa group) are important elements in boreal forest ecosystems, where they occur in high abundance and build large and long-lasting, above-ground mounds of organic material. However, little is known on their role in the carbon (C) cycling in boreal forests. We measured temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux from three different-sized wood ant mounds and the surrounding forest floor from May 2004 to April 2005 in Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] dominated forests in eastern Finland. Additionally, mound and forest floor temperatures were measured continuously and CO2 effluxes at 2-4-week-intervals. During the ants' active season (May-September), measurements were conducted in the morning, afternoon, evening and at night, while fluxes were measured once a day during the ants' inactive season. CO2 emissions from the mounds were up to nearly eight times higher than those from the surrounding forest floor during the active season of the ants, but no statistically significant differences were observed during the period from October to February. Both mound and forest floor CO2 fluxes were highly correlated to mound or forest floor temperature. Based on our measurements, we are able to estimate the annual CO2 efflux from ant mounds and the surrounding forest floor, based on nonlinear regression analyses using CO2 flux as dependant and mound or forest floor temperatures as independent variables. Although red wood ant mounds were found to be "hot spots" for CO2 efflux, that increase the spatial heterogeneity of C emissions within a forest ecosystem, their annual emissions were only 0.30% of that from the forest floor. Thus, our results indicate that red wood ant mounds do not directly contribute significantly to the overall C budget of the boreal forest ecosystem studied. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Growth, biomass allocation and nutrient economy of eight clones of poplar (Populus balsamifera L., P. trichocarpa Hook.) and hybrid poplar (P. trichocarpa Hook. x P. deltoides Bartr.) of north-American origin were studied in a full-factorial pot experiment in Sweden, using the approach of classical growth analysis. The clones were compared in terms of relative growth rate (RGR), biomass production, biomass allocation, nitrogen accumulation and productivity, and ability to withdraw nitrogen from senescing leaves (leaf nitrogen proficiency). The clones differed significantly among treatments by means of several variables, and for some of them also clone x treatment interaction effects were significant. The components of RGR, i.e., leaf area ratio (LAR) and unit leaf rate (ULR), shifted in their importance to explain differences between treatments and genotypes. The results are discussed in the context of growth characteristics particularly important for the selection of clones for multi-purpose poplar plantations grown under the cool-temperate, high-latitude climatic conditions typical for large parts of Sweden.

AB The response of beetle and ant assemblages to fire (2-5 y old) and the dependence of that response on habitat type were analyzed. Using pitfall traps, beetles (Coleoptera) and ants (Formicidae) were sampled in replicated forest, scrub, and steppe areas including paired unburnt and burnt plots. A total of 176 species of beetles (8245 individuals) and 22 species of ants (115,056 individuals) were captured. Most beetle families (65%) were captured in the forest, while most ant species were most frequently captured in the steppe (45%). Beetle abundance was the same in unburnt and burnt plots in the three habitats, but ant abundance was higher in burnt than in unburnt plots. Fire usually decreased species richness of both taxa, but the strength of this effect depended on the habitat type. Coleoptera richness was lower in burnt than in unburnt plots in the forest and steppe but was the same in unburnt and burnt scrub plots. Ant richness was lower in burnt forest and scrub plots and was similar between burnt and unburnt steppe plots. For both taxa, species composition of the forest assemblages was different between unburnt and burnt forest plots (difference almost significant for ants) but not between unburnt and burnt steppe plots. Beetle species composition in the scrub was different between unburnt and burnt plots, but ant species composition was the same. Our results support the idea that the consequences of fire on native beetle and ant assemblages depend on the habitat type but also on the taxonomic group under analysis. Beetles and ants showed differences in their habitat preference and in the way that they use the habitats (e.g., preference for vegetated or bare soil patches) along the environmental gradient. These differences explain why beetles were in general more severely affected than ants, and why fire differentially affected both taxa in the scrub (habitat of intermediate complexity). A good knowledge of the habitat utilization by different groups at the local scale and a regional perspective (e.g., habitat preference along an environmental gradient) are necessary to fully understand the effect of disturbances on native arthropod assemblages.

AB The Scotia Arc links Patagonia to the Antarctic Peninsula. This island chain has changed considerably since Antarctica's geographic and thermal isolation from other land and water masses. Now its rates of air, land and fresh-water climate change are among the highest measured. This review examines work on the shallow water benthos of this region in the context of climate change. In summer, primary productivity is as intense as anywhere, whilst in winter the water reaches unprecedented clarity. Suspension feeders may eat for just a few months but others feed all year. Growth and reproduction are up to 50x slower than non-polar rates. Life here is in the slow lane. There is intense summer disturbance from ice-scour and wave action. This has erased shore zonation and created it below the surface. In contrast to summer disturbance, the winter is among the calmest and most thermally stable environments, when the area is overlain by fast ice. Whilst few animal phyla or species are represented on land, phyletic richness-and in some groups species richness-rivals that of tropical regions. Data showing clines in benthic richness at several taxonomic levels across the Patagonia-South Georgia-Signy Is.-Adelaide Is. chain and 50 years of ice-sheet retreat are presented.

AB Sea anemones (Phylum Cnidaria; Class Anthozoa, Order Actiniaria) exhibit a diversity of developmental patterns that include cloning by fission. Because natural histories of clonal and aclonal sea anemones are quite different, the gain and loss of fission is an important feature of actiniarian lineages. We have used mitochondrial DNA and nuclear intron DNA phylogenies; to investigate the evolution of longitudinal fission In sixteen species in the genus Anthopleura, and reconstructed an aclonal ancestor that has given rise at least four times to clonal descendents. For A. elegantissima from the northeastern Pacific Ocean, a transition to clonality by fission was associated with an up-shore habitat shift, supporting prior hypotheses that clonal growth is an adaptation to the upper shore. Fission in Actiniaria likely precedes its advent in Anthopleura, and its repeated loss and gain is perplexing. Field studies of the acontiate sea anemone Aiptasia californica provided insight to the mechanisms that regulate fission: subtidal Aiptasia responded to experimentally destabilized substrata by increasing rates of pedal laceration. We put forth a general hypothesis for actiniarian fission in which sustained tissue stretch (a consequence of substratum instability or intrinsic behavior) induces tissue degradation, which in turn induces regeneration. The gain and loss of fission in Anthopleura lineages may only require the gain and loss of some form of stretching behavior. In this view, tissue stretch initiates a cascade of developmental events without requiring complex gene regulatory linkages.

AB Seed banks play a crucial role in arid plant communities because they confer stability and long-term persistence. However, seed banks have high temporal and spatial variability, with dramatic changes in density and composition. The aim of this study was to test whether seasonal change affected seed bank community structure and spatial pattern. Moreover, we wanted to know if the effect driven by environmental factors on the seed bank was constant year round. We sampled the seed bank at 188 points along seven parallel transects through a gypsum system in central Spain. Soil samples were taken twice (September and April) in contiguous plots. In each plot we measured environmental parameters, including micro- and macroslope, vegetation band, shrub cover, lichen crust cover and landform. A nearly threefold decrease in seed bank density occurred between September (16,230 seeds m(-2)) and April (5960 seeds m(-2)). Seasonal changes in density varied widely among species; however, a seed bank was present for most species at both sampling dates. For several well-studied species (Lepidium subulatum and Helianthemum squamatum), seed losses were within the range of losses by emergence reported in the literature. In both seasons, seed bank composition was controlled mainly by community band and microslope. Sampling season had a significant, but minor effect on seed bank composition. Moreover, a high spatial correlation existed in terms of seed density and richness through the two studied seasons. These results show that the seed bank keeps a constant structure even under substantial variation in density.

AB Understanding the maintenance of the large diversity of tree species in a tropical rain forest has become something of a holy grail. Among the many factors thought to be involved is disturbance. One hypothesis is that repeated disturbance sets the process of competition anew, thus that competitive exclusion never occurs. In the context of a forest massive damage from storms is potentially the source of the damage that could preserve species diversity. After damage from a storm the canopy of the forest begins with a rapid growth, known as the building phase. Soon a very dense canopy is formed, called the "thinning canopy" which dictates the subsequent dynamic process of competition, where those individuals located near the top of the canopy will have a competitive advantage over those in the subcanopy. We here report on the first 14 years of the development and dynamics of the thinning canopy after the catastrophic hurricane damage occasioned by the landfall of Hurricane Joan in October 1988 in the general area of Bluefields, Nicaragua. The overall pattern of growth is clear, where larger trees have been growing and smaller ones more-or-less stagnant, for the past 8 years. The upper canopy was somewhere on the order of 11-18 m in 1996 and is somewhere between about 15 and 22 m in 2003. The dynamic pattern reflects the basic story of growth into the thinning canopy followed by intense competition where some individuals overtop others, thus creating a platykurtic distribution with a skewed bias towards smaller individuals, because of the few individuals overtopping the others. Mortality rates were between 7 and 33 stems per thousand per year, and were concentrated in individuals located beneath the canopy. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The reproductive biology of Zeyheria montana was studied through field observations of flower visitors and floral events, controlled manual pollinations, and observations of pollen tube growth and ovule penetration by fluorescence microscopy. Analysis of secretory areas of the nectar chamber was made by flower dissections and histology of serial sections. The flower lasted 6-8 days, but pollen exposure and stigma receptivity occurred only up to the end of the first and second days, respectively. Pollination was effected by several species of hummingbirds, especially Colibri serrirostris. The flowers present a rudimentary, non-functional disc, and secretion of nectar is performed by corolla-borne glandular trichomes. Only hand cross-pollinated and natural-pollinated flowers set fruits. Artificially self-pollinated and non-pollinated flowers dried off after anthesis without presenting any swelling of the ovary. Almost all the ovules in selfed and crossed pistils were penetrated 96 h after pollination. However, a delay in ovule penetration in self-pollinated pistils was verified, which indicates the occurrence of late-acting self-incompatibility.

AB The choice of scale (both grain and extent) of a research project can directly affect the results of the project itself, and the comparability of those results to similar research. This paper reviews 149 self-described landscape studies published between 1987 and 2001. From each paper, data for several variables were gathered that we proposed may influence the choice of scale. These variables included the taxa the research considered, the characteristics of the landscape of interest, the species response variables measured, the type of methodology employed by the study, the habitat type(s) surveyed, and the technique(s) used to create habitat maps. Our results demonstrated that only 61% of the papers identified both the grain and extent at which the research was conducted. Taxonomic group, landscape characteristics, and study type all appeared to influence both the choice of grain and extent for the study. Wide variation (standard deviation) in grain and extent among studies suggests that researchers either used some factor not considered here to select scale, or made decisions of the scale on pragmatic grounds, rather than on the appropriateness of the scale to the variables. Finally, 24 of the 149 studies reviewed researched the same combination of categories of the six variables that we considered, yet only for one combination was the grain and extent used within the same order of magnitude. This review highlights the need for more structured choice of scale in landscape studies, and in particular the need for more standardized size of grain and extent for greater comparability among studies.

AB The shell selection and utilization patterns of three sympatric hermit crab populations (Clibanarius antillensis, C. sclopetarius, and C vittatus) and shell availability were studied in a tropical intertidal low energy area. Shell availability (except for C antillensis) was low and the hermit crabs showed overlap in size (mainly C. sclopetarius and C. vittatus). The influence of shell availability and selection on shell use was dependent on crab species. Clibanarius antillensis used mainly shells of Cerithium atratum, the most available shell species, while Clibanarius sclopetarius and C vittatus occupied shells with lower availability in the studied area such as Chicoreus senegalensis, Stramonita haemastoma, Leucozonia nassa and Cymatium parthenopeum. The three species selected different gastropod shells with only Clibanarius antillensis using almost exclusively its preferred shell species in nature. The relationship between shield length and the weight of the used shell was not dependent on crab species or shell species, indicating that the size (not species) of the shells defines what size (not species) of crabs will occupy them.

AB The diet of common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) from U.S. Pacific Coast waters was investigated by means of frequency of occurrence, gravimetric arid numerical methods, arid calculating the geometric index of importance (GII) of prey taxa taken from stomachs collected by fishery observers from the California-based drift gill net fishery. Sampling was done from 16 August 1998 to 24 January 1999, a time when the California Current was undergoing rapid change from El Nino to La Nina conditions. Of the 165 stomachs examined, 107 contained food representing a total of 20 taxa, revealing a broader trophic spectrum than previously reported for this species. Of the identifiable items, northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) vs,as the most important in the diet (GII = 48.2), followed by Pacific hake (Merluccius productus; GII = 31.2), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus; GII = 24.8), and Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax. GII = 9.2). Of the invertebrates, squid (Teuthoidea, including Loligo opalescens; GII = 6.3), and pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes; GII = 6.6), vs-ere also important, especially numerically. For sharks collected north of 34degreesN latitude, hake was the most important identifiable species in the diet: northern anchovy was most important in the south, but was not identified in stomachs collected north of Point Conception.

AB 1. Relative growth rate (RGR), proportional dry-mass content of leaf and stem tissues, and biomass-allocation pattern were assessed under controlled conditions for 22 populations of Dactylis glomerata s,l, from contrasting latitudes and altitudes in Europe, Israel and Kazakstan, Furthermore, width and thickness of leaves were measured in garden-grown mature plants.
   2, All these parameters varied significantly among the populations. RGR correlated negatively with dry-mass content of leaves and stems, but not with biomass-allocation parameters, leaf thickness or leaf width. We argue that the close association of RGR with variation in dry-mass content among species and genetically distinct populations is a result of the larger volume of tissue, and correspondingly larger leaf area and longer root system, that a plant with a low tissue density can build per unit dry mass.
   3, Leaf tissue dry-mass content decreased and RGR increased with increasing latitude and elevation of the originating site, indicating that a high growth rate may be an advantage in habitats with a short growing season. This contrasts with earlier findings of a negative correlation between inherent RGR and altitude.

AB It is essential to investigate both the spatio-temporal pattern of seed dispersal and the subsequent fate of offspring to evaluate the effect of dispersal on plant fitness. This paper examines the effectiveness of seed dispersal in terms of three selective advantages (i.e. avoidance of high mortality around the parent plant, finding 'safe sites', and directional dispersal) by synthesizing the results of studies on seed dispersal, post-dispersal mortality of seeds, and seedling survivorship of several tree species in an old-growth temperate forest community, the Ogawa Forest Reserve (OFR), Japan. Some species in the OFR apparently avoid high offspring mortality around parents in much the same way as other species have been found to do in other forests. Finding 'safe sites' and directional dispersal could also be important elements of seed dispersal; however, the importance of 'safe sites' in this context and their spatio-temporal distribution have not been sufficiently characterized to discuss their relative significance for recruitment. A trade-off among seed size, dormancy and dispersal has been suggested, but should be tested by long-term investigations on spatio-temporal patterns of both seed dispersal and 'safe site' distributions.

AB To address the question of hermit crab clustering, 11 clumps composed of Clibanarius laevimanus were studied in the mangal of Mida Creek, Kenya in 1988. Hermit size and sex were analyzed, as well as the type, dimensions, and status of their shells. Empty gastropod shells constituted a limiting factor on the population studied; the architectural traits which seemed to be favored by the hermits were those associated with a defence against crab predators (high weight and narrow apertures). Differences in either the availability of adequate shells or in the services provided by the housing in question explained the observed diversity in both the type and the mass of shells occupied among the examined population categories. Furthermore, each clump showed homogeneity with respect to the dimensions of the hermits participating in it, and immature and adult specimens were partitioned among three cluster types. It is suggested that clustering might be classified as a social phenomenon, because hermits are attracted by similarly sized conspecifics, interact through an elaborate communication system, and because most benefit from a chain process in shell exchange.

AB The feeding niches of 10 spider species that are polyphagous insectivores were compared by computing coefficients of niche breadth and niche overlap. The study is based on predation evidence from an insecticide-free cotton plantation in east Texas. All overlap values were < 1.00 (range, 0.08-0.94), which indicates that each spider species has its own feeding niche in the cotton agroecosystem. Diet breadth, that is inversely related to feeding specialization, was computed for each species. The highest value was approximately five times higher than the minimum, which indicates considerable differences between species in feeding specialization. Diet breadth values indicate that large web weavers exhibited a less specialized feeding behaviour (relatively broad feeding niche) compared with small web weavers (narrow feeding niche). Prey specialists in this study concentrated on either aphids or fire ants as a primary food source. The nonweb-building spider Oxyopes salticus Hentz, which actively searches the cotton plant for prey (up to almost-equal-to 6 mm maximum length), showed the highest diet breadth value (broad feeding niche) under the conditions of this experiment. This abundant species, which is considered a highly beneficial biocontrol agent of smaller cotton pests, shows high flexibility in its foraging patterns.

AB Hermit crabs may acquire shells by trading with other crabs or at predation events that make new shells available. Predation events are located chemically through odors associated with the death of gastropods and the death of conspecifics. Crabs respond identically to either source of cues. Here we report that hermit crabs, Clibanarius vittatus from the field respond in one of three distinct ways to chemicals from gastropod flesh and from conspecific hemolymph: (1) crabs do not respond (23%), (2) crabs flee (40%), and (3) crabs investigate neighboring shells (37%). Changing the size of the shell can cause crabs to change behavior. Altering shell size by clipping down shells resulted in high (approx. 80%) response by investigation. Crabs given a free choice of unoccupied shells fled (86%) in response to chemical stimulation. In a series of experiments small crabs were tested for chemically-stimulated behavior and then given access to excess empty shells. Chemically-stimulated behavior was assessed after 24 hours. the majority of crabs fled upon stimulation. Shells occupied by crabs were then ordered from largest to smallest and crabs moved up or down one to the shells. Crabs tested after being moved into new shells routinely fled upon chemical stimulation. After approximately 30 minutes, reproducible behaviors related to the new shell were expressed. Most crabs moved to the next smaller shell investigated. Most crabs moved to one shell larger fled. Most crabs moved to two shells larger withdrew upon chemical stimulation. Hermit crab behavioral responses to chemical cues include escape, investigation, and withdrawal and are dependent upon the relative size of shell inhabited.

AB Erigeron glabellus and Aster sibiricus have similar flowers, share pollinators, but bloom sequentially in interior Alaska.  Both species depend on insect pollination for seed set:  the Erigeron is self-incompatible, and the Aster is apparently self-compatible but allogamous.  To test the hypothesis that sequential blooming is maintained by natural selection generated by reproductive interference, we manipulated the flowering time of Erigeron, forcing it to bloom simultaneously with Aster, and measured female fecundity in both species.  We found no evidence of reduced female fecundity in either species caused by the presence of the sympatric "competitor" or by artificial pollination with the heterospecific pollen prior to conspecific pollination.  Two-species mixtures of simultaneously blooming Aster and Erigeron experienced significant interspecific visitation, which may, under natural conditions, cause loss of pollen to alien stigmas and depressed male fecundity, at least in Erigeron.  We found no evidence that sequential blooming in Erigeron and Aster is maintained by depressed female fecundity through pollinator sharing.  If sequential blooming is maintained by natural selection, it seems more likely to be the result of selection generated by depressed male fitness through pollen loss to alien stigmas.

AB The concept of a root economics space (RES) is increasingly adopted to explore root trait variation and belowground resource-acquisition strategies. Much progress has been made on interactions of root morphology and mycorrhizal symbioses. However, root exudation, with a significant carbon (C) cost (c. 5-21% of total photosynthetically fixed C) to enhance resource acquisition, remains a missing link in this RES. Here, we argue that incorporating root exudation into the structure of RES is key to a holistic understanding of soil nutrient acquisition. We highlight the different functional roles of root exudates in soil phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) acquisition. Thereafter, we synthesize emerging evidence that illustrates how root exudation interacts with root morphology and mycorrhizal symbioses at the level of species and individual plant and argue contrasting patterns in species evolved in P-impoverished vs N-limited environments. Finally, we propose a new conceptual framework, integrating three groups of root functional traits to better capture the complexity of belowground resource-acquisition strategies. Such a deeper understanding of the integrated and dynamic interactions of root morphology, root exudation, and mycorrhizal symbioses will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying species coexistence and how to explore belowground interactions for sustainable managed systems.

AB There is growing realization that intraspecific variation in seed dispersal can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. However, we do not have a good understanding of the drivers or causes of intraspecific variation in dispersal, how strong an effect these drivers have, and how widespread they are across dispersal modes. As a first step to developing a better understanding, we present a broad, but not exhaustive, review of what is known about the drivers of intraspecific variation in seed dispersal, and what remains uncertain. We start by decomposing 'drivers of intraspecific variation in seed dispersal' into intrinsic drivers (i.e. variation in traits of individual plants) and extrinsic drivers (i.e. variation in ecological context). For intrinsic traits, we further decompose intraspecific variation into variation among individuals and variation of trait values within individuals. We then review our understanding of the major intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of intraspecific variation in seed dispersal, with an emphasis on variation among individuals. Crop size is the best-supported and best-understood intrinsic driver of variation across dispersal modes; overall, more seeds are dispersed as more seeds are produced, even in cases where per seed dispersal rates decline. Fruit/seed size is the second most widely studied intrinsic driver, and is also relevant to a broad range of seed dispersal modes. Remaining intrinsic drivers are poorly understood, and range from effects that are probably widespread, such as plant height, to drivers that are most likely sporadic, such as fruit or seed colour polymorphism. Primary extrinsic drivers of variation in seed dispersal include local environmental conditions and habitat structure. Finally, we present a selection of outstanding questions as a starting point to advance our understanding of individual variation in seed dispersal.

AB The globally expanding colonization of grasslands by shrubs increases soil organic carbon and nitrogen, but the effects of shrubs on phosphorus (P) cycling have been rarely studied. We compared P contents in roots and soil fractions, phosphatase activity in the 1 m profile, and in situ net P mineralization between shrubby Potentilla fruticosa patches and grassy interspaces in grazed shrubby meadows at three representative sites on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The P uptake of P. fruticosa exceeded 1 m soil depth, whereas grasses acquired P mainly within the upper 0.6 m. The P contents in shoots, aboveground litter and roots under P. fruticosa were greater than those under grasses. Litter P stock under the shrubs was 4-8 times higher than that under grasses and the root P stock doubled compared to that in grass areas. P. fruticosa generally increased the organic P (OP) content in the topsoil but decreased inorganic P (IP) in the subsoil. Phosphorus availability increased in the topsoil but decreased in the subsoil under the shrubs compared to grasses. Microbial biomass P (MBP), the activities of acid and alkaline phosphatases, and OP lability were all greater in the 1 m soil under P. fruticosa than grasses, leading to faster P mineralization and the P turnover under the shrubs. In the 1 m soil, P. fruticosa increased MBP and OP stocks but decreased IP and available P stocks. The larger and deeply distributed root system of P. fruticosa improved its P uptake ability especially from the subsoil. The subsequent greater organic matter input through litter fall and root turnover under P. fruticosa fed a larger microbial biomass that synthesized more microbial-derived OP in the topsoil. We concluded that shrubs increase the biological (plant and microbial) P transformation in the soil, the P uplift in the profile, and P cycling in shrubby grassland ecosystems. Such mechanisms structuring spatial heterogeneity of P content, transformation, turnover and fluxes are common in shrubby grasslands worldwide.

AB As for all living organisms, the nutritional needs of ants change over time in response to varying environmental conditions and demands for growth, health, and reproduction. Solitary individuals regulate their nutritional intake to maintain an appropriate balance of nutrients by selectively choosing the quality and quantity of food that meet their nutritional requirements. For social organisms, such as ants, food collection for the entire colony relies on a few individuals whose nutritional requirements may be very different from those of other members of their colony. Recent studies have used an integrative framework, the "geometric framework", to better understand how living organisms regulate macronutrient intake to defend a specific nutrient "intake target". In this review, we first reveal how the geometric framework has been used to deepen our understanding of ant communal nutrition. Second, we describe how this framework might be used to also understand the nutritional strategies used by ants facing infection challenges. Lastly, we conclude with a brief discussion of the promising techniques that could be used in the future to improve our understanding of communal nutrition in ants.

AB During the development of green criminology, little attention has been paid to how Indigenous/Native Peoples (INP) are victimized by green crime and how they employ environmental activism to resist externally imposed ecological destruction. In the past decade, news services and environmental interest groups have reported on the killing of INP environmental activists who have resisted ecological destruction across the world. Here, we begin to develop a green criminological view of INP victimization and resistance to ecological destruction within the context of the global capitalist treadmill of production, while drawing upon concepts of colonization, imperialism, genocide and ecocide. Our analysis suggests that in the contemporary capitalist world system, expansion of the treadmill of production's ecological withdrawal process (i.e. the withdrawal of raw materials used in production) not only accelerates ecological disorganization in developing/underdeveloped nations, but may be harmful in nations where INP are dependent on access to nature for survival.

AB Tree mortality is a key driver of forest community composition and carbon dynamics. Strong winds associated with severe convective storms are dominant natural drivers of tree mortality in the Amazon. Why forests vary with respect to their vulnerability to wind events and how the predicted increase in storm events might affect forest ecosystems within the Amazon are not well understood. We found that windthrows are common in the Amazon region extending from northwest ( Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, and west Brazil) to central Brazil, with the highest occurrence of windthrows in the northwest Amazon. More frequent winds, produced by more frequent severe convective systems, in combination with well-known processes that limit the anchoring of trees in the soil, help to explain the higher vulnerability of the northwest Amazon forests to winds. Projected increases in the frequency and intensity of convective storms in the Amazon have the potential to increase wind-related tree mortality. A forest demographic model calibrated for the northwestern and the central Amazon showed that northwestern forests are more resilient to increased wind-related tree mortality than forests in the central Amazon. Our study emphasizes the importance of including wind-related tree mortality in model simulations for reliable predictions of the future of tropical forests and their effects on the Earth' system.

AB The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity has been put forth to explain species coexistence in forests worldwide, but its assumption of species equivalence has been met with much debate. Theoretical advancements have reconciled the opposing concepts of neutral and niche theories as two ends of a continuum, improving our understanding of global patterns in diversity and community assembly. However, the relative importance of niche and neutral processes remains understudied in temperate forests. To determine the balance of niche and neutral processes in climatically limited subalpine temperate forests, we established the Utah Forest Dynamics Plot, a 13.64 - ha plot comprising 27,845 stems >= 1 cm diameter at breast height (1.37 m) representing 17 species at 3100 m elevation on the Colorado Plateau. We examined the fit of niche - and neutral - based models to the species abundance distribution (SAD), and tested three underlying assumptions of neutral theory. The neutral model was a poor fit to the SAD, but we did not find the alternative model to provide a better fit. Using spatial analyses, we tested the neutral assumptions of functional equivalence, ecological equivalence, and habitat generality. Half of species analyzed were characterized by non - neutral recruitment processes, and the two most abundant species exhibited asymmetric competitive and facilitative interactions with each other. The assumption of habitat generality was strongly contradicted, with all common species having habitat preferences. We conclude niche - based processes play the dominant role in structuring subalpine forest communities, and we suggest possible explanations for variation in the relative importance of niche vs. neutral processes along ecological gradients.

AB Deforestation and forest degradation are widespread in Indonesia and pose serious threats to biodiversity and other ecosystem services. The Indonesian government is implementing several Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) initiatives to help support the conservation of tropical forests, but the eastern part of Indonesia has yet to be included in this effort. Tropical forests growing on limestone are a prominent feature of that region, but little is known about their ecology and management, and only limited research has been conducted on biomass and the associated carbon storage capacity of these secondary forests. Here, we estimate the aboveground tree biomass (AGB) in an old secondary forest on limestone in Seram, the Moluccas, East Indonesia. We destructively sampled all aboveground vegetation in 0.04 ha forest and developed a local allometric model (n = 25; diameter-range of 10.4-41.7 cm). We tested and compared the performance of our locally developed model with existing local models and a recent pantropical model (Chave et al., 2014) at our site. Total AGB in the 1-ha forest plot was estimated at 177 Mg ha(-1), of which 141 Mg ha(-1) (80%) was allocated in trees >= 10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh), 33 Mg ha(-1) (19%) in trees <10 cm dbh and 2 Mg ha(-1) (1%) in lianas and non-woody vegetation. Both our locally developed and the pantropical model estimated the biomass of harvested trees accurately (local model: bias = 0.1%, CV = 15.5%; pantropical model: bias = -7.7%, CV = 17.7%), while other local models had much lower performance (bias = -57.1 to -7.3%, CV = 59.2 to 75.8%). At plot-level, the AGB estimate of the pantropical model approached the estimate of our local model, while other local models considerably underestimated actual AGB. Together, our findings confirm that trees <10 cm dbh can store a large fraction of total AGB in secondary forests, and highlight the robustness of generic models. These results provide further guidance for accurate assessments of forest carbon stocks in Indonesia and more generally for REDD+ initiatives. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim in this study was detect changes in landscape-fragmentation patterns resulting from the expansion of agriculture in the Cerrado region (Brazilian Savanna) during the period 1988-2011. The study area covers 7,559,783.69 ha and is restricted to the limits of the Urucuia Group (Upper Cretaceous), a geological unit formed by sedimentary rocks of continental deposits where there has been intense agricultural expansion due to favorable conditions for the use of mechanized farming. The temporal analysis considered land-use/land-cover data from Landsat TM image classification for the years 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2011. Fragmentation quantification was performed from the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and traditional landscape metrics analysis. The calculation of MSPA attributes considered 10 edge widths, between 30 and 300 m. Traditional landscape metrics were obtained from Path Analyst and V-Late software. Change detection in MSPA classes was obtained through cross-tabulation. Cerrado deforestation in the study area increased from 795,502.61 ha in 1988 to 2804,679.75 ha in 2011. The spatial pattern of Cerrado deforestation and fragmentation has a spatial concentration in the western region of the study area that gradually progresses toward the east. Our results emphasize the fragmentation process with a reduction in the following fragmentation indicators over the past two decades: area, number of patches, core, and edge. In addition, the indicators increased in: complexity, size variation, and coreless fragments. Change detection enabled the description of spatial evolution of fragmentation indicators. The results can help define strategies for landscape planning and decision making for conservation priorities.

AB Aggressive interactions among closely related species are common, and can play an important role as a selective pressure shaping species traits and assemblages. The nature of this selective pressure depends on whether the outcomes of aggressive contests are asymmetric between species (i.e., one species is consistently dominant), yet few studies have estimated the prevalence of asymmetric versus symmetric outcomes to aggressive contests. Here we use previously published data involving 26,212 interactions between 270 species pairs of birds from 26 taxonomic families to address the question: How often are aggressive interactions among closely related bird species asymmetric? We define asymmetry using (i) the proportion of contests won by one species, and (ii) statistical tests for asymmetric outcomes of aggressive contests. We calculate these asymmetries using data summed across different sites for each species pair, and compare results to asymmetries calculated using, data separated by location. We find that 80% of species pairs had aggressive outcomes where one species won 80% or more of aggressive contests. We also find that the majority of aggressive interactions among closely related species show statistically significant asymmetries, and above a sample size of 52 interactions, all outcomes are asymmetric following binomial tests. Species pairs with dominance data from multiple sites showed the same dominance relationship across locations in 93% of the species pairs. Overall, our results suggest that the outcome of aggressive interactions among closely related species are usually consistent and asymmetric, and should thus favor ecological and evolutionary strategies specific to the position of a species within a dominance hierarchy.

AB Natural regeneration offers a cheaper alternative to active reforestation and has the potential to become the predominant way of restoring degraded tropical landscapes at large-scale. We conducted a meta-analysis for tropical regions and quantified the relationships between both ecological and socioeconomic factors and biodiversity responses in naturally regenerating areas. Biogeographic realms, past disturbance, and the human development index (HDI) were used as explanatory variables for biodiversity responses. In addition, we present a case study of large-scale natural regeneration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and identify areas where different forms of restoration would be most suitable. Using our dataset for tropical regions, we showed that natural regeneration was predominantly reported within: the Neotropical realm; areas that were intensively disturbed; and countries with medium HDI. We also found that biodiversity in regenerating forests was more similar to the values found in old growth forests in: countries with either low, high, or very high HDI; less biodiverse realms; and areas of less intensive past disturbance. Our case study from Brazil showed that the level of forest gain resulting from environmental legislation, in particular the Brazilian Forest Code, has been reduced, but remains substantial. Complementary market incentives and financial mechanisms to promote large-scale natural regeneration in human-modified agricultural landscapes are also needed. Our analysis provides insights into the factors that promote or limit the recovery of biodiversity in naturally regenerating areas, and aids to identify areas with higher potential for natural regeneration.

AB Little is known about sustainable forest management and tree growth in the Amazon forest. Reliable growth data from trees are very important in the context of forest management. Tree-characteristics such as architecture and competition are associated with diameter growth. Previous studies analyzing tree growth have indicated that these variables can describe these effects for temperate and boreal forests. However, the role of these effects for the growth of tropical trees needs to be enhanced for forest management practices. Here, we reconstructed the periodic annual basal area increment (BAI(i) cm(2) yr(-1)) of four long-lived timber species from the Amazon forest of Brazil: (i) Cedrela odorata, (ii) Amburana cearensis, (iii) Copaifera pauper and (iv) Swietenia macrophylla to investigate the growth development. The study focuses on (i) drivers important for individual tree growth, (ii) calibration of an individual tree basal area increment model for each of the four species, and (iii) assessing the practical implementation of our findings for enhancing sustainable forest management of these four tree species in the Amazon rainforest. The results exhibit a significant relationship between increasing basal area increment versus increasing crown length and decreasing competition expressed by Hegyi's index. Trees sampled in densities greater than 25 m(2) ha(-1) had their BAI% significantly reduced. For Cedrela an additional negative impact on basal area increment from liana load is evident. Our findings reinforce the importance of release trees to obtain better crown exposure. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding how biotic communities respond to landscape spatial structure is critically important for conservation management as natural habitats become increasingly fragmented. However, empirical studies of the effects of spatial structure on plant species richness have found inconsistent results, suggesting that more comprehensive approaches are needed. We asked how landscape structure affects total plant species richness and the richness of a guild of specialized plants in a multivariate context. We sampled herbaceous plant communities at 56 dolomite glades (insular, fire-adapted grasslands) across the Missouri Ozarks, USA, and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the relative importance of landscape structure, soil resource availability, and fire history for plant communities. We found that landscape spatial structure, defined as the area-weighted proximity of glade habitat surrounding study sites (proximity index), had a significant effect on total plant species richness, but only after we controlled for environmental covariates. Richness of specialist species, but not generalists, was positively related to landscape spatial structure. Our results highlight that local environmental filters must be considered to understand the influence of landscape structure on communities and that unique species guilds may respond differently to landscape structure than the community as a whole. These findings suggest that both local environment and landscape context should be considered when developing management strategies for species of conservation concern in fragmented habitats.

AB Avian diversity in fragmented Amazonian landscapes depends on a balance between extinction and colonization in cleared and disturbed areas. Regenerating forest facilitates bird dispersal within degraded Amazonian landscapes and may tip the balance in favor of persistence in habitat patches. Determining the response of Amazonian birds to fragmentation may be hindered because many species use adjacent second growth matrices thereby limiting the applicability of island biogeography to predict species loss; alternatively, a countryside biogeographic framework to evaluate the value of regenerating forest may be more appropriate. Here, we used point-count and capture data to compare Amazonian bird communities among continuous forest, 100 ha forest fragments with adjacent second growth, young and older second growth plots, and 100 ha forested islands bounded by water, to test the applicability of island biogeography on the mainland and to assess the ecological value of a regenerating matrix. Among foraging guilds, understory insectivores and flocking species were nearly absent on true islands. Fragments surrounded by young second growth were species rich, suggesting that a developing matrix may mitigate extinction associated with fragmentation. Our findings reinforce that true islands are often extinction-driven systems with distinct, depauperate communities. In contrast, succession of bird communities in second growth facilitates recolonization of forest fragments, permitting fragments as small as 100 ha to support bird communities similar to continuous forest.

AB Litterfall plays an important role in nutrient cycling and maintenance of soil fertility in terrestrial ecosystems. Annual and seasonal variation in litterfall have been investigated in various habitats, however, seasonality in nutrient supply is less well documented. We studied litterfall over two years and seasonal litter nutrient input over one year across a tropical disturbance gradient from mature forest to monoculture tea plantation. Total litter production in the mature forests and regenerating forests was not significantly different. However, tea plantations had significantly lower litter production. Total litterfall in forest habitats showed a clear seasonal pattern with a peak during the dry season (Mar.-May), as has been reported for other tropical seasonal forests. Contrary to expectations, there was no significant difference in litter nutrient concentrations across the disturbance gradient, although there was a substantial change in plant species composition. Litter nutrient concentrations also did not vary significantly across seasons, again contrary to our expectations. Thus, nutrient input was driven solely by the seasonal litterfall pattern. Our results suggest that at a landscape scale turnover in species composition linked to anthropogenic disturbance may not always lead to changes in litter quality, presumably because a similar spectra of leaf types may exist across communities. Seasonal litterfall patterns, which have been more commonly studied, may prove a reasonable proxy for nutrient input in forests. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates the dendroclimatic potential of tree species in a tropical dry forest in southern Ecuador. From 10 selected tree species, Bursera graveolens and Maclura tinctoria exhibited distinct annual and cross-datable tree-rings. It was possible to synchronize individual tree-ring series and to establish two tree-ring chronologies of 203 and 87 years length, respectively. The characteristic ENSO frequency band is reflected in wavelet power spectra of both chronologies. Both species show a strong correlation between ring width and precipitation of the wet season (January-May). Strong El Nino events (1972, 1983 and 1998) lead to strong growth responses in the tree-ring chronologies, whereas 'normal' ENSO events do not trigger long-lasting growth responses. The first ring-width based wet-season precipitation reconstruction for the past 103 years was developed. Statistical and spatial correlation analysis verified the skills of the reconstructed precipitation which captures a great part of the Rainfall Index over the land area of Ecuador and the equatorial Pacific. Furthermore, teleconnections with central Pacific precipitation and SST patterns were found. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Global urbanisation is rapidly expanding and most of the world's humans now live in cities. Most ecological studies have, however, focused on protected areas. To address this issue, we tested predictions from studies of protected areas in urban ecosystems. Because most cities are heterogeneous habitat mosaics which include habitats with varying levels of chronic environmental stress, we focused on predictions from studies of less modified ecosystems about community-wide responses to variation in chronic stress. We sampled ants across Manhattan's urban habitat mosaic, at sites with varying levels of chronic environmental stress. Many predictions derived from less modified ecosystems were supported by our findings: despite being the most intensively sampled habitat, high stress urban medians had less variability in ant composition -both within and among sites - than either urban parks or urban forests, the lowest stress habitat - urban forests-had significantly more accumulated species and a higher number of unique species than higher stress habitats, and urban parks, which have intermediate levels of chronic environmental stress, also had intermediate levels of variation in among-site species composition, accumulated species richness, and the incidence of unique species. The most common species also differed across Manhattan's urban habitat mosaic. Nevertheless, the prediction that exotic species would occur more frequently in higher stress habitats was not supported; exotic species were equally common across all habitats. These findings suggest that fine-scale heterogeneity in the chronic stress of urban habitats may be an underappreciated, but important structuring force for urban animal communities.

AB Flooded rice fields are not only a global food source but also a major biogenic source of atmospheric methane. Using metatranscriptomics, we comparatively explored structural and functional succession of paddy soil microbiomes in the oxic surface layer and anoxic bulk soil. Cyanobacteria, Fungi, Xanthomonadales, Myxococcales, and Methylococcales were the most abundant and metabolically active groups in the oxic zone, while Clostridia, Actinobacteria, Geobacter, Anaeromyxobacter, Anaerolineae, and methanogenic archaea dominated the anoxic zone. The protein synthesis potential of these groups was about 75% and 50% of the entire community capacity, respectively. Their structure-function relationships in microbiome succession were revealed by classifying the protein-coding transcripts into core, non-core, and taxon-specific transcripts based on homologous gene distribution. The differential expression of core transcripts between the two microbiomes indicated that structural succession is primarily governed by the cellular ability to adapt to the given oxygen condition, involving oxidative stress, nitrogen/phosphorus metabolism, and fermentation. By contrast, the non-core transcripts were expressed from genes involved in the metabolism of various carbon sources. Among those, taxon-specific transcripts revealed highly specialized roles of the dominant groups in community-wide functioning. For instance, taxon-specific transcripts involved in photosynthesis and methane oxidation were a characteristic of the oxic zone, while those related to methane production and aromatic compound degradation were specific to the anoxic zone. Degradation of organic matters, antibiotics resistance, and secondary metabolite production were detected to be expressed in both the oxic and anoxic zones, but by different taxonomic groups. Cross-feeding of methanol between members of the Methylococcales and Xanthomonadales was suggested by the observation that in the oxic zone, they both exclusively expressed homologous genes encoding methanol dehydrogenase. Our metatranscriptomic analysis suggests that paddy soil microbiomes act as complex, functionally coordinated assemblages whose taxonomic composition is governed by the prevailing habitat factors and their hierarchical importance for community succession.

AB We have little knowledge of how climatic variation (and by proxy, habitat variation) influences the phylogenetic structure of tropical communities. Here, we quantified the phylogenetic structure of mammal communities in Africa to investigate how community structure varies with respect to climate and species richness variation across the continent. In addition, we investigated how phylogenetic patterns vary across carnivores, primates, and ungulates. We predicted that climate would differentially affect the structure of communities from different clades due to between-clade biological variation. We examined 203 communities using two metrics, the net relatedness (NRI) and nearest taxon (NTI) indices. We used simultaneous autoregressive models to predict community phylogenetic structure from climate variables and species richness. We found that most individual communities exhibited a phylogenetic structure consistent with a null model, but both climate and species richness significantly predicted variation in community phylogenetic metrics. Using NTI, species rich communities were composed of more distantly related taxa for all mammal communities, as well as for communities of carnivorans or ungulates. Temperature seasonality predicted the phylogenetic structure of mammal, carnivoran, and ungulate communities, and annual rainfall predicted primate community structure. Additional climate variables related to temperature and rainfall also predicted the phylogenetic structure of ungulate communities. We suggest that both past interspecific competition and habitat filtering have shaped variation in tropical mammal communities. The significant effect of climatic factors on community structure has important implications for the diversity of mammal communities given current models of future climate change.

AB Key message Analyses of tree-ring anatomical features showed to be more sensitive to specific intra-seasonal environmental factors than tree-ring width in Tectona grandis and Pinus caribaea growing in a subtropical region.
   Abstract Earlywood vessels (EWV) and intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) in tree rings are influenced by intra-seasonal environmental factors, as have mostly been studied in temperate climate areas. However, it is not clear whether such anatomical traits can also be used as climate proxies in tropical regions. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to analyse the relationship between the anatomical features of two tropical species growing in Piracicaba, State of Sao Paulo, Southeast Brazil-EWV in Tectona grandis and IADFs in Pinus caribaea- and the climate. Wood cores were extracted by increment borer and processed using the classical methodology of dendrochronology. Chronologies of the mean vessel cross-sectional area of the first row of each tree ring (FRV) and the entire earlywood (EWV) in T. grandis, and of IADF in earlywood (IADF-E) and latewood (IADF-L) in P. caribaea were developed for the period 1988-2011 and 1982-2011, respectively. Our results showed a significant correlation of EWV and FRV with mean accumulated precipitation during the summer season (DJF) and with mean temperature in December. The IADF-Es in P. caribaea were related to the precipitation of DJF as well as the temperature of April, whereas IADF-Ls were linked to precipitation in fall (MAM). In general, the tree-ring anatomical variables were more influenced by intra-seasonal environmental factors than tree-ring width in both species, indicating their great potential for dendroecological studies in subtropical regions.

AB AimMacArthur and Wilson's theory of island biogeography proposes that the rate at which species colonize an island depends on the island's isolation (distance effect), whereas the local extinction rate depends on its area (area effect). Alternative hypotheses recognize that area can affect the colonization rate (target effect) and that isolation can affect the extinction rate (rescue effect) and, moreover, that these relationships may dominate. We quantify these relationships and associated turnover rates and incidence using long-term counts of breeding bird communities on islands in an inundated lake.
   LocationThousand Island Lake, China.
   MethodsWe assessed the occupancy and behaviour of breeding birds on 37 islands from 2007 to 2012. We estimated the effects of area, isolation and other biogeographical parameters on the frequencies of colonization and extinction events using multivariate logistic regression. We then extended these results to derived properties such as species turnover rates and incidence.
   ResultsExtinction rates decreased and colonization rates increased on larger islands. Isolation had no significant effect on colonization or extinction rates. Islands had high species turnover overall, and turnover rates followed the same pattern as extinction rates with different areas and isolations. Pool turnover, which controls for the number of species in the pool, was higher on large islands. Species richness also increased with area. Our study of bird communities supported area and target effects, but not distance and rescue effects.
   Main conclusionsIsland area was a better predictor of colonization and extinction than isolation, probably because of the relatively small scale (c. 580km(2)) and homogeneous vegetation structure of our research system, and the strong dispersal ability of birds. We conclude that the differences between our observations and theoretical predictions, or results from other studies that measured colonization and extinction directly, are consistent with the particular biogeography of these islands.

AB Aims
   Environmental heterogeneity is a primary mechanism explaining species coexistence and extant patterns of diversity. Despite strong theoretical support and ample observational evidence, few experimental studies in plant communities have been able to demonstrate a causal link between environmental heterogeneity and plant diversity. This lack of experimental evidence suggests that either fine-scale heterogeneity has weak effects on plant diversity or previous experiments have been unable to effectively manipulate heterogeneity. Here, we utilize a unique soil manipulation to test whether fine-scale soil heterogeneity will increase plant richness through species sorting among experimental patch types.
   Methods
   This experiment was conducted in the tallgrass prairie region of south-central Kansas, USA. We utilized the inherent variation found in the vertical soil profile, which varied in both biotic and abiotic characteristics, and redistributed these strata into either homogeneous or heterogeneous spatial arrangements in 2.4 x 2.4 m plots. After the soil manipulation, 34 native prairie species were sown into all plots. We conducted annual censuses at peak biomass to quantify species composition and plant density by species within the experimental communities.
   Important Findings
   After 2 years, species richness was significantly higher in heterogeneous relative to homogeneous plots and this pattern was independent of total plant density. In the heterogeneous plots, 13 species had higher establishment in a specific patch type representing one of the three soil strata. Conversely, no species had greater establishment in the mixed stratum, which comprised the homogeneous plots, relative to the heterogeneous strata. These species sorting patterns suggest that fine-scale heterogeneity creates opportunities for plant establishment due to niche differences, which translates into increased plant diversity at the plot scale. Species richness was more strongly related to plant density among patches comprising homogenous plots-where fine-scale heterogeneity was minimized, but weak in heterogeneous plots. This pattern is consistent with the idea that richness-density relationships dominate when neutral processes are important but are weak when niche processes operate. Unlike many previous attempts, our results provide clear, experimental evidence that fine-scale soil heterogeneity increases species richness through species sorting during community assembly.

AB The spatial placement of recruits around adult conspecifics represents the accumulated outcome of several pattern-forming processes and mechanisms such as primary and secondary seed dispersal, habitat associations or Janzen-Connell effects. Studying the adult-recruit relationship should therefore allow the derivation of specific hypotheses on the processes shaping population and community dynamics. We analysed adult-recruit associations for 65 tree species taken from six censuses of the 50 ha neotropical forest plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. We used point pattern analysis to test, at a range of neighbourhood scales, for spatial independence between recruits and adults, to assess the strength and type of departure from independence, and its relationship with species properties. Positive associations expected to prevail due to dispersal limitation occurred only in 16% of all cases; instead a majority of species showed spatial independence (approximate to 73%). Independence described the placement of recruits around conspecific adults in good approximation, although we found weak and noisy signals of species properties related to seed dispersal. We hypothesize that spatial mechanisms with strong stochastic components such as animal seed dispersal overpower the pattern-forming effects of dispersal limitation, density dependence and habitat association, or that some of the pattern-forming processes cancel out each other.

AB 1. We examine theoretical and empirical results to determine the importance of microbe-microbe interactions in the evolution of defensive traits.
   2. Theoretical models show that the evolution of parasitism and the maintenance of mutualisms in multispecies interactions will depend on interactions with the host as well as with the defensive symbionts.
   3. At the community level, selection for defensive traits will vary greatly with ecological context and such spatial or temporal variation itself may stabilize defensive mutualisms.
   4. Studies of fungal endophytes within plant hosts demonstrate that endophytes acting as defensive mutualists may derive fitness benefits from the parasite as well as the host and suggest that interactions between co-occurring symbionts within hosts may lead to the evolution of virulence.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have increasingly been implemented to protect and restore ecosystems worldwide. The effectiveness of conservation investments in PES may differ under alternative policy scenarios and may not be sustainable because of uncertainties in human responses to policies and dynamic human-nature interactions. To assess the impacts of these interactions on the effectiveness of PES programs, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model: human and natural interactions under policies (HANIP). We used HANIP to study the effectiveness of China's Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and alternative policy scenarios in a coupled human-nature system, China's Wolong Nature Reserve, where indigenous people's use of fuelwood affects forests. We estimated the effects of the current NFCP, which provides a cash payment, and an alternative payment scenario that provides an electricity payment by comparing forest dynamics under these policies to forest dynamics under a scenario in which no payment is provided. In 2007, there were 337 km(2) of forests in the study area of 515 km(2). Under the baseline projection in which no payment is provided, the forest area is expected to be 234 km(2) in 2030. Under the current NFCP, there are likely to be 379 km(2) of forests in 2030, or an increase of 145 km(2) of forests to the baseline projection. If the cash payment is replaced with an electricity payment, there are likely to be 435 km(2) of forests in 2030, or an increase of 201 km(2) of forests to the baseline projection. However, the effectiveness of the NFCP may be threatened by the behavior of newly formed households if they are not included in the payment scheme. In addition, the effects of socio-demographic factors on forests will also differ under different policy scenarios. Human and natural interactions under policies (HANIP) and its modeling framework may also be used to assess the effectiveness of many other PES programs around the world.

AB Background: Patterns in tropical forest nitrogen cycling are poorly understood. In particular, the extent to which leguminous trees in these forests fix nitrogen is unclear.
   Aims: We aimed to determine factors that explain variation in foliar delta N-15 (delta N-15(F)) for Amazon forest trees, and to evaluate the extent to which putatively N-2-fixing Fabaceae acquire nitrogen from the atmosphere.
   Methods: Upper-canopy delta N-15(F) values were determined for 1255 trees sampled across 65 Amazon forest plots. Along with plot inventory data, differences in delta N-15(F) between nodule-forming Fabaceae and other trees were used to estimate the extent of N-2 fixation.
   Results: delta N-15(F) ranged from -12.1% to + 9.3%. Most of this variation was attributable to site-specific conditions, with extractable soil phosphorus and dry-season precipitation having strong influences, suggesting a restricted availability of nitrogen on both young and old soils and/or at low precipitation. Fabaceae constituted fewer than 10% of the sampled trees, and only 36% were expressed fixers. We estimated an average Amazon forest symbiotic fixation rate of 3 kg N ha(-1) year(-1).
   Conclusion: Plant delta N-15 indicate that low levels of nitrogen availability are only likely to influence Amazon forest function on immature or old weathered soils and/or where dry-season precipitation is low. Most Fabaceae species that are capable of nodulating do not fix nitrogen in Amazonia.

AB Landscape heterogeneity affects the spatial distribution of species. This makes it an important consideration for conservation planning, particularly when designing sustainable production landscapes. We determine whether conserving landscape elements within a transformed landscape is adequate for conserving dung beetle biodiversity. Dung beetles are excellent indicators for landscape biodiversity studies as they are ecologically sensitive. Here we measure dung beetle alpha-diversity, as well as beta-diversity within landscape elements and across different landscape elements. In doing so, we assess the value of landscape elements, as well as variation within landscape elements, in determining the spatial distribution of dung beetles across a production landscape. The study was conducted in the commercial timber production area of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa. In this system, the different landscape elements are a mosaic of natural indigenous forests, grasslands and alien pine plantation blocks. Our results show that the only response for dung beetle alpha-diversity was higher species richness in grasslands and pine blocks compared to natural forests. The highest beta-diversity for a landscape element was the grassland, for elevational category was low elevational areas and grassland type was the Midlands Mistbelt Grassland. The compositional diversity (beta-diversity between elements) was significantly different for all pairwise variations between landscape elements, the elevational categories and grassland types. Natural forests embedded in the two different grassland types had greater differences in compositional diversity than those embedded in natural (grassland) or transformed (pine blocks) matrices. This highlights the need to conserve a range of similar remnant patches of natural vegetation regionally, in addition to conserving broad landscape elements (i.e. grasslands or natural forests) as conservation targets. Furthermore, our results are encouraging for the potential benefits from the ecosystem service provided by dung beetles across the whole landscape, even in the transformed elements.

AB Poplar coppice plantations for biomass production can be conducted under either short rotation coppice (SRC) or short rotation forestry (SRF) systems, depending on planting density and rotation length. It is likely that differences in planting density affect tree physiology through competition for resource acquisition, including light, water and nutrients. In this paper, we hypothesized that the effects of planting density on growth and water-use efficiency (assessed through bulk leaf carbon isotope discrimination, Delta C-13) in poplar depend on site characteristics in terms of soil fertility and water availability. To test this hypothesis, 56 Populus deltoides x P. nigra genotypes were planted under both SRC and SRF and replicated at two sites differing for pedoclimatic conditions. At the most favorable site for growth, trees grown at the higher density (SRC) displayed higher stem height, lower stem circumference, higher specific leaf area, higher mass-based leaf nitrogen contents and higher Delta C-13, indicating that increased tree density mainly accentuated competition for light. Under less favorable conditions, trees grown under SRC still displayed lower stem circumference, higher specific leaf area and higher mass-based leaf nitrogen contents. However, stem height remained unaffected by increasing planting density while Delta C-13 was lower, likely because of increased competition for water availability. Genotypic rankings across planting densities were overall conserved while they were significantly modified across sites, suggesting that rankings for genotypic performances were much less affected by planting density than by site. Realized growth measured after 2 years (height and circumference) was weakly correlated with Delta C-13, but a negative relationship between Delta C-13 and growing season leaf increment rate was observed in most cases. The absence of trade-off between growth and water-use efficiency combined with the large genotypic variations observed for these traits confirms the potential for selecting genotypes with high water-use efficiency without counter-selecting on biomass production in P. deltoides x P. nigra.

AB Across the planet, high-intensity farming has transformed native vegetation into monocultures, decreasing biodiversity on a landscape scale. Yet landscape-scale changes to biodiversity and community structure often emerge from processes operating at local scales. One common process that can explain changes in biodiversity and community structure is the creation of abrupt habitat edges, which, in turn, generate edge effects. Such effects, while incredibly common, can be highly variable across space and time; however, we currently lack a general analytical framework that can adequately capture such spatio-temporal variability. We extend previous approaches for estimating edge effects to a non-linear mixed modeling framework that captures such spatio-temporal heterogeneity and apply it to understand how agricultural land-uses alter wildlife communities. We trapped small mammals along a conservation-agriculture land-use interface extending 375 m into sugarcane plantations and conservation land-uses at three sites during dry and wet seasons in Swaziland, Africa. Sugarcane plantations had significant reductions in species richness and heterogeneity, and showed an increase in community similarity, suggesting a more homogenized small mammal community. Furthermore, our modeling framework identified strong variation in edge effects on communities across sites and seasons. Using small mammals as an indicator, intensive agricultural practices appear to create high-density communities of generalist species while isolating interior species in less than 225 m. These results illustrate how agricultural land-use can reduce diversity across the landscape and that effects can be masked or magnified, depending on local conditions. Taken together, our results emphasize the need to create or retain natural habitat features in agricultural mosaics.

AB Herbivory and plant defence differ markedly among seedlings and juvenile and mature plants in most species. While ontogenetic patterns of chemical resistance have been the focus of much research, comparatively little is known about how tolerance to damage changes across ontogeny. Due to dramatic shifts in plant size, resource acquisition, stored reserves and growth, it was predicted that tolerance and related underlying mechanisms would differ among ontogenetic stages.
   Ontogenetic patterns in the mechanisms of tolerance were investigated in Plantago lanceolata and P. major (Plantaginaceae) using the genetic sib-ship approach. Pot-grown plants were subjected to 50 defoliation at the seedling, juvenile and mature stages and either harvested in the short-term to look at plasticity in growth and photosynthesis in response to damage or allowed to grow through seed maturation to measure phenology, shoot compensation and reproductive fitness.
   Tolerance to defoliation was high in P. lanceolata, but low in P. major, and did not vary among ontogenetic stages in either species. Mechanisms underlying tolerance did vary across ontogeny. In P. lanceolata, tolerance was significantly related to flowering (juveniles) and pre-damage shoot biomass (mature plants). In P. major, tolerance was significantly related to pre-damage root biomass (seedlings) and induction of non-photochemical quenching, a photosynthetic parameter (juveniles).
   Biomass partitioning was very plastic in response to damage and showed associations with tolerance in both species, indicating a strong role in plant defence. In contrast, photosynthesis and phenology showed weaker responses to damage and were related to tolerance only in certain ontogenetic stages. This study highlights the pivotal role of ontogeny in plant defence and herbivory. Additional studies in more species are needed to determine how seedlings tolerate herbivory in general and whether mechanisms vary across ontogeny in consistent patterns.

AB We have calculated the economic value of forest hydrological services for Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Plant in Vietnam, which is a major power supplier for the capital Hanoi. Our valuation is based on measurements over a six-year period from 2001 to 2006 in 240 permanent sample plots in different vegetation types distributed throughout the watershed. We have synthesized the information with GIS, and carried out simulations with derived empirical models for different land use, electricity price and payment proportion scenarios. Our findings indicate that the economic value of forest hydrological services for electricity production ranges from 26.3 million USD to 85.5 million USD per year; and that the longevity of the hydroelectric plant can be prolonged by about 35-80 years, depending on the state of forest cover in the watershed.

AB Scarabaeinae specimens were collected with the use of pitfall traps baited with human excrement, rotten meat and rotting banana, between May 2009 and April 2010, in three forest fragments in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil: 'Morro do Elefante' (MOEL), 'Morro do Cerrito' (MOCE) and 'Campus da Universidade Federal de Santa Maria' (UFSM). A total of 19,699 individuals belonging to 33 species were collected. Canthidium aff. trinodosum Boheman, 1858, Canthon latipes Blanchard, 1845, Dichotomius assifer (Eschscholtz 1822), Eurysternus caribaeus (Herbst 1789), Canthidium sp. and Canthon lividus Blanchard, 1845, were the most abundant species. MOEL showed the greatest richness, MOCE the greatest abundance, while UFSM showed the lowest values of richness and abundance. The greatest similarity (qualitative and quantitative) was found between MOEL and MOCE, while the lowest occurred between MOCE and UFSM. Only 51% of the species were common to all three fragments. The richness and abundance of Scarabaeinae were positively correlated with the air temperature. The richness of the fragment decreased according to the smaller size and the greater degree of disturbance of vegetation structure.

AB Habitat loss is considered the single greatest driver of species extinctions and amelioration of this threat through habitat restoration is increasingly important in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Success of restoration depends largely on the ability of species of a diversity of functional types to recolonize a restored site. We used a restoration chronosequence to investigate the success of revegetation efforts (direct-seeding and tube stock methods) in returning species and trophic functions of trophically diverse ant assemblages to land formerly used for livestock grazing in south-eastern Australia. We examined assemblages based on: (i) species composition; (ii) trophic position and diversity, measured using stable isotopes of nitrogen; and (iii) species richness of trophic guilds based on 15N isotopes (15N guilds') and prior knowledge of diet (traditional trophic groups'). Responses for 15N trophic guilds were more distinct than for those based on traditional trophic groups. Assemblage trophic position (mean species 15N enrichment) decreased and trophic diversity (variance among species in 15N enrichment) increased along the chronosequence from pastures to remnants. These patterns resulted from an increase in the richness of species with low 15N enrichment (i.e. more herbivorous' species) along the chronosequence, which was also reflected in increases in the species richness of sugar feeders. Recovery of direct-seeded sites lagged behind tube stock sites of the same age, suggesting a role for habitat structure. Species composition followed a trajectory suggestive of partial recovery, with revegetated sites supporting assemblages intermediate to pastures and remnants, but distinct from both. Synthesis and applications. Tree planting promotes recovery of species composition and trophic function. Planting method affects the speed of functional recovery, although minimally. Species on the herbivorous end of the spectrum of omnivory were slower to recover than more predaceous species and may require deliberate restoration of features associated with mature trees. Trophic guilds based on objective measures of diet respond more clearly to restoration than do those based on subjective observations and offer a more insightful method.

AB Population changes and shifts in geographic range boundaries induced by climate change have been documented for many insect species. On the basis of such studies, ecological forecasting models predict that, in the absence of dispersal and resource barriers, many species will exhibit large shifts in abundance and geographic range in response to warming. However, species are composed of individual populations, which may be subject to different selection pressures and therefore may be differentially responsive to environmental change. Asystematic responses across populations and species to warming will alter ecological communities differently across space. Common garden experiments can provide a more mechanistic understanding of the causes of compositional and spatial variation in responses to warming. Such experiments are useful for determining if geographically separated populations and co-occurring species respond differently to warming, and they provide the opportunity to compare effects of warming on fitness (survivorship and reproduction). We exposed colonies of two common ant species in the eastern United States, Aphaenogaster rudis and Temnothorax curvispinosus, collected along a latitudinal gradient from Massachusetts to North Carolina, to growth chamber treatments that simulated current and projected temperatures in central Massachusetts and central North Carolina within the next century. Regardless of source location, colonies of A. rudis, a keystone seed disperser, experienced high mortality and low brood production in the warmest temperature treatment. Colonies of T. curvispinosus from cooler locations experienced increased mortality in the warmest rearing temperatures, but colonies from the warmest locales did not. Our results suggest that populations of some common species may exhibit uniform declines in response to warming across their geographic ranges, whereas other species will respond differently to warming in different parts of their geographic ranges. Our results suggest that differential responses of populations and species must be incorporated into projections of range shifts in a changing climate.

AB There is limited evidence regarding the adaptive value of plant functional traits in contrasting light environments. It has been suggested that changes in these traits in response to light availability can increase herbivore susceptibility. We tested the adaptive value of plant functional traits linked with carbon gain in contrasting light environments and also evaluated whether herbivores can modify selection on these traits in each light environment. In a temperate rainforest, we examined phenotypic selection on functional traits in seedlings of the pioneer tree Aristotelia chilensis growing in sun (canopy gap) and shade (forest understory) and subjected to either natural herbivory or herbivore exclusion. We found differential selection on functional traits depending on light environment. In sun, there was positive directional selection on photosynthetic rate and relative growth rate (RGR), indicating that selection favors competitive ability in a high-resource environment. Seedlings with high specific leaf area (SLA) and intermediate RGR were selected in shade, suggesting that light capture and conservative resource use are favored in the understory. Herbivores reduced the strength of positive directional selection acting on SLA in shade. We provide the first demonstration that natural herbivory rates can change the strength of selection on plant ecophysiological traits, that is, attributes whose main function is resource uptake. Research addressing the evolution of shade tolerance should incorporate the selective role of herbivores.

AB We evaluate the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) community as measured by spores in different coffee production systems (at the depth of 0-15 cm). In addition, we analyze the similarities between the AMF communities in coffee production systems and those that occur in a tropical montane cloud forest patch in order to evaluate the capacity of coffee production systems to preserve the native AMF community. We carried out four samplings in five coffee production systems representative of a vegetation structure gradient, and in a forest. From 120 soil samples, 33 morphospecies were detected. In all the sites, the dominant morphospecies were and sp. 3. We found no significant difference in AMF spore richness between sites. Diversity was similar in most of the coffee production systems. Significant differences were only detected in spore abundance; during the dry season the forest, shaded traditional rustic system and shaded simple system presented the highest spore abundance. With the exception of one species exclusive to the forest, the coffee production systems all share the same AMF species as the forest. The coffee production systems with the greatest similarity to cloud forest were the shaded traditional rustic system and the shaded simple system. It is suggested that control of weeds and fertilization could be important factors influencing the composition and abundance of AMF spores in coffee production systems.

AB To evaluate the role of thinning intensity in increasing hardwood diversity in managed coniferous forests, we investigated the effects of environmental changes caused by thinning on the seedling demography (i.e. seedling emergence, survival, and growth) of hardwood species for 5 years after thinning in 67% thinned (Intensive), 33% thinned (Weak), and unthinned treatments (Control) in a Cryptomeria japonica plantation in northern Japan. Intensive thinning strongly increased light and soil temperature but reduced litter accumulation, thus facilitating seed germination, seedling emergence, and seedling survival of primarily early- and mid-successional species compared to late-successional species. As a result, more early- and mid-successional species were observed in Intensive compared to Weak and Control, whereas the number of late-successional species did not differ among thinning intensities. Thus, the number of species was greatest in Intensive but lowest in Control throughout the 5 years. However, Shannon's diversity index (H') did not strongly differ among thinning intensities, largely due to the predominance of the mid-successional species Cornus controversa, particularly in Intensive. In Control and Weak, both seedling survival and height were often greater for advance regeneration than for seedlings newly emerged in the year following thinning, whereas neither variable differed between advance regeneration and seedlings newly emerged in Intensive, mainly due to selective predation of advance regeneration by mammalian herbivores. These results suggest that the future composition of hardwoods can be roughly predicted by the composition of advance regeneration in Weak but by the composition of both advance regeneration and seedlings newly emerged in Intensive. When comparing large individuals (height >1.5 m), the number of species was greatest in Intensive in 2008, 5 years post-thinning, primarily due to rapid vertical growth regardless of successional status. These results suggest that within a C. japonica plantation, a canopy-level mixed conifer-hardwood forest would be more probable and occur more rapidly in Intensive compared to Weak. In Weak, enhanced species diversity would likely be restricted to the understorey layer because of the slower growth rate and lower survival rate of hardwood seedlings caused by the more rapid deterioration of favourable environmental conditions.

   MECHANISMS
AB In tropical forests, resource-based niches and density-dependent mortality are mutually compatible mechanisms that can act simultaneously to limit seedling populations. Differences in the strengths of these mechanisms will determine their roles in maintaining species coexistence. In the first assessment of these mechanisms in a Congo Basin forest, we quantified their relative strengths and tested the extent to which density-dependent mortality is driven by the distance-dependent behavior of seed and seedling predators predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. We conducted a large-scale seed addition experiment for five randomly selected tropical tree species, caging a subset of seed addition quadrats against vertebrate predators. We then developed models to assess the mechanisms that determine seedling emergence (three months after seed addition) and survival (two years after seed addition). As predicted, both niche differentiation and density-dependent mortality limited seedling recruitment, but predation had the strongest effects on seedling emergence and survival. Seedling species responded differently to naturally occurring environmental variation among sites, including variation in light levels and soil characteristics, supporting predictions of niche-based theories of tropical tree species coexistence. The addition of higher densities of seeds into quadrats initially led to greater seedling emergence, but survival to two years decreased with seed density. Seed and seedling predation reduced recruitment below levels maintained by density-dependent mortality, an indication that predators largely determine the population size of tree seedlings. Seedling recruitment was unrelated to the distance to or density of conspecific adult trees, suggesting that recruitment patterns are generated by generalist vertebrate herbivores rather than the specialized predators predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. If the role of seed and seedling predation in limiting seedling recruitment is a general phenomenon, then the relative abundances of tree species might largely depend on species-specific adaptations to avoid, survive, and recover from damage induced by vertebrate herbivores. Likewise, population declines of herbivorous vertebrate species (many of which are large and hunted) may trigger shifts in species composition of tropical forests.

AB Secondary forests are expanding in defaunated fragmented tropical landscapes, but their resilience potential remains poorly understood. In this study we used a chronosequence of advancing (19-62-yr old) Atlantic forest regeneration following slash-and-burn agriculture to infer successional shifts in seed rain in terms of seed density, species richness, taxonomic and functional composition, and local spatial distribution. After monitoring seed rain during 12 months in 60 1-m(2) seed traps, we recorded over 400,000 seeds belonging to 180 morphospecies. From early to late-successional stage, seed rain decreased in density, increased in per capita species richness, gradually changed in species composition, and became less aggregated spatially. Regardless the age of forest stand, vertebrate-dispersed seeds accounted for 67-75% of all species recorded. Large-seeded species typical of old-growth forests, on the other hand, accounted for only 5-8% of the species recorded in the seed rain, a proportion around five times smaller than that reported for the old-growth forests of the same study site (31%). Our results suggest that the secondary forests considered, which are embedded in one of the largest (3500 ha) and best preserved remnant of the severely fragmented Atlantic forest of Northeast Brazil, may fail attaining older successional stages due to the reduced availability of large-seeded late-successional species. This regeneration constraint may be even stronger in smaller, more isolated forest remnants of the region, potentially reducing their ability to provide ecosystem services.

AB Primary tropical forests provide crucial environmental services, including carbon storage and hydrological regulation. Options for promoting forest conservation include payments for environmental services (PES) programmes that provide financial incentives to local actors, in exchange for reduced forest clearance. The success of voluntary PES (defined in terms of avoided primary forest conversion) is contingent upon behavioural changes in enrolled actors. As both the degree of enrolment and likelihood of sustained behavioural change depend upon how PES compensation structures interact with existing actor economies, local heterogeneity in livelihood strategies may play a strong role in the ultimate success of PES programmes, particularly when compensation is not differentiated with respect to opportunity costs. We examined the influence of livelihood heterogeneity on the potential success of a deforestation-reduction PES with an undifferentiated reward structure. We collected socioeconomic and demographic data at the household and community levels across two large Amazonian extractive reserves where a spatially extensive PES programme (Bolsa Floresta) operates. We show that demographic and socioeconomic status varies widely across households and communities, and found that both households and communities that are most and least likely to convert primary forest receive similar financial incentives. Those households most engaged in manioc agriculture (the primary driver of local primary forest conversion) both benefitted from the highest annual incomes and incurred the greatest opportunity costs. We show that avoided primary forest conversion could be greatly increased with differentiated payment structures adjusted for local differences in opportunity costs and livelihood strategies, and present two metrics that could help to achieve that goal.

In particular, we tested whether the distribution of mammalian mesopredators is related to fragment size and distance to habitat edge, and whether the contribution of these factors is additive or interactive. To assess fine-scale utilization of forest edges, we established transects of four scent stations at different distances from forest edges into the interior (0, 25, 50, 100 m) in 146 forest fragments of variable patch size (3.2-5099.6 ha) from May to June, 2008-2009. This large sample size allowed us to perform detailed analyses separately for all detected species. Our findings confirm that mammalian mesopredators strongly prefer habitat edges and small forest fragments. The probability of occurrence tended to decrease with increasing distance from the edge for all seven carnivore species detected. The carnivores' occurrence was also negatively correlated with forest fragment area. All detected species tended to prefer small fragments, with the exception of the Eurasian badger (showing the reverse but non-significant pattern) and the red fox (no effect of fragment size). In addition, the non-significant interaction between fragment size and distance to edge suggests that both of these factors contribute independently and additively to mesopredator-mediated effects on biota in a fragmented landscape.

AB The coexistence of four cryptic species of Rhabditis (Pellioditis) marina (Nematoda: Rhabditidae) at small geographical scale challenges ecological competition theory and was therefore studied in the laboratory at two different salinities, where their performance in combined cultures was compared with that in monospecies cultures. We found that three of the four cryptic species were able to coexist, but that interspecific interactions (competition and facilitation) were common. Salinity had an effect on these interactions, with a shift from contest to scramble competition. This shift may result from an increased population development of two of the four species at the lower salinity in the monospecific cultures. This experiment demonstrates that abiotic conditions may play an important role in achieving coexistence between cryptic species and can alter the interspecific interactions between them.

AB Land use is a pervasive influence on most terrestrial ecosystems. Humans are converting natural ecosystems and appropriating an increasingly large portion of the net primary productivity of the Earth's ecosystems, leaving a rapidly expanding footprint on the environment and threatening the functioning of ecosystems and the ecological services they provide. Understanding the impacts of human activities on the environment from a local to a global scale requires an adequate representation of human modified landscapes and an explanation of the relationships between socioeconomic and biophysical factors. A first step towards this objective is the development of a quantitative measure of the spatial footprint of humans on landscapes, which can then be used as an analytical and monitoring tool for global change, biodiversity and ecosystem studies. Existing approaches have been based mainly on geographic proxies of human influence such as population density, land transformation, accessibility and infrastructure. In this paper, we developed a more comprehensive and spatially-explicit footprint index based on three dimensions: land use intensity, intervention time, and biophysical vulnerability, which we then applied to Colombia as a case study. We found the inclusion of the vulnerability index provided an effective means to address regional variability in biophysical responses to land use impacts. Accounting for the duration of human intervention provided new insights into the relative capacity of ecosystems to recover or be restored. From this knowledge, more appropriate land use policies can be developed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ants are ubiquitous members of most forest communities, where they disperse seeds, prey on other species, and influence the flow of nutrients. Their effects are often described as substantial, but few studies to date have simultaneously examined how the presence of ants affects both above and belowground processes. In this study, we experimentally reduced ant abundance in a suite of deciduous forest plots in northern Georgia, USA to assess the effects of ants on the spatial distribution of a common understory plant species, Hexastlylis arifolia, the structure of soil mesofaunal communities, and soil nitrogen dynamics. Over the course of several years, the removal of ants led to significant spatial aggregation of H. arifolia seedlings near the parent plant, most likely due to the absence of the keystone seed dispersal species, Aphaenogaster rudis. Seedling emergence was higher in ant removal plots, but seedling aggregation did not affect first or second year seedling mortality. Ammonium concentrations were 103 higher in ant removal plots relative to control plots where ants were present in the first year of the study, but this increase disappeared in the second and third years of the study. The effects of ant removal on the soil mesofauna were mixed: removal of ants apparently did not affect the abundance of Collembola, but the abundance of oribatid mites was significantly higher in ant removal plots by year two of the study. Taken together, these results provide some of the first experimental evidence of the diverse direct and indirect effects of ants on both above and belowground processes in forest ecosystems and demonstrate the potential consequences of losing an important seed dispersing ant species for the plants they disperse.

AB Interpopulation variation in key functional traits of Pinus pinaster Ait. is well recognized. However, the relative importance of drought tolerance to explain this regional variation in the species remains elusive.
   Here, we raise the question whether water availability constitutes a likely driver of regional variation in biomass allocation, growth and morphological traits of ten populations that cover the distribution range of P. pinaster. We carried out an experiment where seedlings of five families per population were submitted to two contrasting watering treatments.
   The effects of water availability and population were significant for relative diameter and height growth rate, biomass allocation and number of lateral stems and dwarf shoots. Total dry mass significantly differed between watering treatments but it did not among populations. Populations could be clustered into four main groups. Root mass fraction explained most of the variation and significantly correlated to altitude but not to aridity.
   The geographical pattern of genetic variation found in morphology and biomass allocation did not translate into population differences in drought tolerance or phenotypic plasticity to water availability, indicating that water availability is not a likely driver of the regional variation observed in the studied traits of P. pinaster at the seedling stage.

AB In some areas of the tropics forests are recovering on abandoned cattle pastures. These secondary forests may be important habitats for conserving biodiversity, but we know little about their species composition over the long term. We studied herpetofaunal community changes in a 40 years chronosequence of forest succession on abandoned pastures in Puerto Rico. Twelve submontane sites (100-250 mast) represented four forest recovery stages: pasture, young (1-5 years after abandonment), intermediate (10-20 years), and advanced (40 years). Among these stages we analyzed the relationship of forest structure, microclimate, and herpetofaunal community structure. During succession total forest height increased, new strata of vegetation appeared in the understory, and the forest gained heterogeneity and complexity. Microclimate changed with changes in the physiognomy and structure of the vegetation. Microclimatic shifts were more dramatic in forest <20 years since abandonment. During 1 year we observed 7991 individuals of thirteen reptilian species (60% of observations) and six anuran species. Herpetofaunal richness was similar among stages, but the total abundance increased through succession. Relative abundance of anurans and reptiles was similar between stages, but species dominance changed with succession. Forest >20 years old resembles mature forest in some structural characteristics important to herpetofauna and can provide habitat for forest herpetofauna in disturbed areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In northern Australian savannas, canopy tree species often have juvenile tree banks that are composed mainly of small individuals of indeterminate age that have resprouted repeatedly after fire. Little is known about their demography. We report the initial responses (mortality, topkill and resprouting type) of 3133 marked juvenile eucalypts to set fires of different seasons (early dry season, late dry season, wet season, unburnt) in a 32400 m(2) field experiment. Fire treatments were repeated in plots dominated by a native annual grass (sorghum) that becomes senescent before the early dry season and provides the main fuel of savanna fires, and in others with little or no sorghum, but instead other native grasses and forbs that remain green well into the dry season. Most juvenile eucalypts <150 cm high were topkilled but resprouted from underground tissues regardless of fire season or understorey (86-100% vs <5% in unburnt plots). Few saplings 200-500 cm high died or were topkilled, but impacts of fire were harsher in sorghum than in non-sorghum vegetation. The response of eucalypts 150-199 cm high was intermediate, suggesting a 'tactical' transition from suppressed persistence to growth toward maturity. Counter-intuitively, genet death of juvenile trees was >22% in the low-intensity early dry season fire in plots with little or no annual sorghum, compared with <2% in all other fire/understorey combinations. We suggest results are related to fire behaviour, seasonal carbohydrate storage dynamics and competition with ground-layer plants.

AB Growth and secondary metabolites responses to light environment can be useful measurements to determine favourable habitat conditions for the cultivation and conservation of medicinal plants. We analyzed the growth, photosynthesis and root reserpine concentrations in seedlings of Rauvolfia vomitoria Aftel and Rauvolfia verticillatae (Lour.) Baill, two important medicinal plants yielding anti-hypertension alkaloids, at four different light levels (20%, 52%, 75% and 100% of full sunlight) in a shade house. Across all light intensities, seedlings of R. vomitoria grew faster with higher relative growth rate (RCR) than R. verticillatae, attributed to its higher photosynthetic capacities (light-saturated photosynthetic rate, A(max)) and leaf area ratio (LAR). Typical shade-sun morphological responses to increasing light levels included decreased specific leaf area and LAR, whereas RGR and A(max) was highest at median light levels for both species. R. vomitoria allocated higher leaf mass fraction and fine-root mass fraction, similar coarse root mass fraction, but lower stem biomass fraction than R. verticillatae. For fine roots, R. vomitoria had greater specific root length and small diameter than R. verticillatae, indicating its higher resource (water and nutrition) capture abilities. Both species had higher nitrogen concentration and lower reserpine concentration in fine roots than those of coarse roots. Neither reserpine concentration nor nitrogen was affected by light intensities. The reserpine concentration in coarse roots of R. vomitoria increased, whereas that of R. verticillatae decreased with increasing irradiance. Although not significantly, reserpine concentrations in coarse roots were positively correlated with A(max) and RGR for both species across all light intensities. Shade or photosynthesis inhibition apparently did not increase alkaloid synthesis, which contrasted with the carbon/nutrient balance theory of plant defense. These results suggested that R vomitoria and R. verticillatae could attain high biomass and yield of reserpine in high-light habitats (with max. in 75% sunlight), and intermediate-light habitats (with max. in 25-52% sunlight), respectively.

AB Drought perturbation driven by the El NiA +/- o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a principal stochastic variable determining the dynamics of lowland rain forest in S.E. Asia. Mortality, recruitment and stem growth rates at Danum in Sabah (Malaysian Borneo) were recorded in two 4-ha plots (trees a parts per thousand yen 10 cm gbh) for two periods, 1986-1996 and 1996-2001. Mortality and growth were also recorded in a sample of subplots for small trees (10 to < 50 cm gbh) in two sub-periods, 1996-1999 and 1999-2001. Dynamics variables were employed to build indices of drought response for each of the 34 most abundant plot-level species (22 at the subplot level), these being interval-weighted percentage changes between periods and sub-periods. A significant yet complex effect of the strong 1997/1998 drought at the forest community level was shown by randomization procedures followed by multiple hypothesis testing. Despite a general resistance of the forest to drought, large and significant differences in short-term responses were apparent for several species. Using a diagrammatic form of stability analysis, different species showed immediate or lagged effects, high or low degrees of resilience or even oscillatory dynamics. In the context of the local topographic gradient, species' responses define the newly termed perturbation response niche. The largest responses, particularly for recruitment and growth, were among the small trees, many of which are members of understorey taxa. The results bring with them a novel approach to understanding community dynamics: the kaleidoscopic complexity of idiosyncratic responses to stochastic perturbations suggests that plurality, rather than neutrality, of responses may be essential to understanding these tropical forests. The basis to the various responses lies with the mechanisms of tree-soil water relations which are physiologically predictable: the timing and intensity of the next drought, however, is not. To date, environmental stochasticity has been insufficiently incorporated into models of tropical forest dynamics, a step that might considerably improve the reality of theories about these globally important ecosystems.

AB Human-induced forest edges are common in many forest landscapes throughout the world. Forest management requires an understanding of their ecological consequences. This study addressed the responses of three ecological groups (non-forest species, secondary forest species and primary forest species) in edge soil seed banks and edge understory vegetation, and explored the relationship between the invasion of non-forest species in edge understory vegetation and the accumulation of their seeds in edge soil seed banks. The soil seed banks and understory vegetation were sampled along transects established at the edges of a continuous subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest tract (Lithocarpus xylocarpus forest) bordering anthropogenic grasslands and three tropical seasonal rain forest fragments (Shorea wantianshuea forest) bordering fallows. Species composition in both soil seed banks and understory vegetation showed great difference among edge sites. In soil seed banks, the dominance (relative abundance and relative richness) of each ecological group did not change significantly along the edge to interior gradient. In understory vegetation, the invasion of non-forest species concentrated on the first several meters along the edge to interior gradient. The dominance of secondary forest species decreased with distance from the edge, while the dominance of primary forest species increased with distance from the edge. In forest edge zones, the invasion of a majority of non-forest species in understory vegetation lags behind the accumulation of their seeds in soil seed banks. Forest edges do not act as a good barrier for the penetration of non-forest species seeds. The lack of non-forest species in understory vegetation must then be due to conditions that are not appropriate for their establishment. Therefore, to prevent germination and survival of non-forest species further into the forest, management should focus on maintaining interior forest conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Changes in the composition of local communities through time (i.e. species turnover) is a common phenomenon in insular biology. However, the mechanisms promoting variation in species turnover, both among islands and among species, are poorly understood. In an effort to better understand the causes of variation in species turnover, we evaluated the colonization and extinction dynamics of plant populations on 18 small islands off the west coast of Canada. In 1997, we quantified total population sizes of 10 woody angiosperm species. A decade later, we resampled islands to test whether: 1) species turnover occurred, 2) colonization events were offset by extinction events, 2) variation in extinction rates among islands was associated with population sizes, average plant heights, island area, island isolation or each island's exposure to ocean-born disturbances, and 3) variation in extinction rates among species was associated with plant life history traits. Results showed that extinction events outnumbered colonization events, suggesting that the metacommunity is in 'disequilibrium'. Variation in extinction rates among islands was unrelated to island area and isolation. However, extinction rates increased with exposure to ocean-born disturbances and decreased with both initial population sizes and average plant heights. Species with thicker, tougher leaves (i.e. high leaf mass per area) were less prone to extinction than species with thinner, more papery leaves. Overall results indicate that species turnover is common and that it is generated primarily by extinction. Variation in extinction rates appears to result from an interaction between among-island effects (exposure, population size and plant stature) and among-species effects (leaf toughness), suggesting that ocean-born disturbances play a key role in determining metacommunity structure.

AB American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) was once a principal component of the eastern deciduous forest until it became functionally extinct as a result of the invasive fungus Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr. Restoration efforts are underway by means of a blight-resistant American-Chinese chestnut hybrid, and detailed silvicultural information, such as the shade tolerance of American chestnut and optimum site selection for restoration, is critical for planting success. In the present study, the physiological and morphological leaf characteristics of pure American chestnut seedlings, saplings, and mature trees were investigated in one of the few remaining stands of oak-chestnut vegetation (West Salem, WI) to determine shade tolerance. Seedlings, saplings, and mature trees had high maximum rates of photosynthesis, similar to shade intolerant species, and low light compensation points (LCPs), quantum efficiency, leaf mass per area (LMA), and percent nitrogen content, reminiscent of shade tolerant species. Dark respiration rates of seedlings and saplings were low, but increased in mature trees. LMA was found to significantly increase with height in the canopy, indicating a high level of light-induced plasticity. The results of this study suggest that American chestnut should be classified as intermediate in shade tolerance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although sustainable forest management (SFM) has been widely adopted as a policy and management goal, high rates of forest loss and degradation are still occurring in many areas. Human activities such as logging, livestock husbandry, crop cultivation, infrastructural development, and use of fire are causing widespread loss of biodiversity, restricting progress toward SFM. In such situations, there is an urgent need for tools that can provide an integrated assessment of human impacts on forest biodiversity and that can support decision making related to forest use. This paper summarizes the experience gained by an international collaborative research effort spanning more than a decade, focusing on the tropical montane forests of Mexico and the temperate rain forests of southern South America, both of which are global conservation priorities. The lessons learned from this research are identified, specifically in relation to developing an integrated modeling framework for achieving SFM. Experience has highlighted a number of challenges that need to be overcome in such areas, including the lack of information regarding ecological processes and species characteristics and a lack of forest inventory data, which hinders model parameterization. Quantitative models are poorly developed for some ecological phenomena, such as edge effects and genetic diversity, limiting model integration. Establishment of participatory approaches to forest management is difficult, as a supportive institutional and policy environment is often lacking. However, experience to date suggests that the modeling toolkit approach suggested by Sturvetant et al. (2008) could be of value in such areas. Suggestions are made regarding desirable elements of such a toolkit to support participatory-research approaches in domains characterized by high uncertainty, including Bayesian Belief Networks, spatial multi-criteria analysis, and scenario planning.

AB Dispersal limitation can retard natural establishment of desirable species on restoration sites, especially where landscapes are fragmented, but dispersal limitation is assumed to become less critical with time as early colonists become reproductively mature. Distribution patterns of recruiting trees in a 20-year-old passively restored bottomland in northeast Louisiana suggested persistent dispersal limitation in some bottomland hardwood species and influence of dense shrub patches on colonization. To test these hypotheses, we measured seed rain as a function of distance to seed source and association with shrub cover. Seed rain of the wind-dispersed Fraxinus pennsylvanica was highest near the forest edge, except where mature recruits occurred. Although shrub presence did not influence dispersal of E pennsylvanica, its negative influence on probability of occurrence in the sapling layer suggests that shrub cover may limit its regeneration. The bird-dispersed Crataegus viridis and Hex decidua were found in the seed rain and as reproductive individuals within the field; neither had a positive relationship with shrub presence. Dispersal of heavy-seeded Quercus spp. and Carya aquatica was limited to within 20 m of the forest edge. These results imply that dispersal limitation is diminishing in wind- and bird-dispersed species with maturation of in-field recruits and that shrub patches may influence these patterns. Heavy-seeded species, however, remain restricted to field edges that directly abut a seed source. If canopy closure by wind- and bird-dispersed species precedes dispersal of heavy-seeded species into the field, establishment of Quercus and Carya spp. may remain low for the foreseeable future.

AB We investigated biomass allocation and root architecture of eight tropical species with different successional status, as classified from the literature, along a size gradient up to 5 m. We focused on belowground development, which has received less attention than aboveground traits. A discriminant analysis based upon a combination of allocational and architectural traits clearly distinguished functional types and classified species according to successional status at a 100% success rate. For a given plant diameter, the pioneer species presented similar root biomass compared to the non-pioneer ones but higher cumulative root length and a higher number of root apices. A detailed study on the root system of a sub-sample of three species showed that the most late-successional species (Tabebuia rosea) had longer root internodes and a higher proportion of root biomass allocated to the taproot compared to the other two species (Hura crepitans and Luehea seemannii). Most pioneer species showed a higher leaf area ratio due to a higher specific leaf area (SLA). We conclude that the functional differences between pioneer and non-pioneer tree species found in natural forests were maintained in open-grown plantation conditions.

AB The demographic dynamics of three populations of Dioon edule Lindl. (Zamiaceae) were studied in a fragmented landscape using projection matrix modelling. Compared with other plant species, D. edule behaves like a tree life-form species. Density and spatial distribution patterns varied among populations according to models for animal-dispersed tree species. In all scenarios, lambda was most sensitive to changes in abundance of adult plants. The elasticity reproductive component (F) for the three populations was zero and stasis values (L) were higher, this being a function of the permanence of non-reproductive individuals. It was detected that disturbance influences the population dynamics of D. edule as a function of adult plant persistence. This observation suggests that the conservation of adult plants is critical for D. edule and perhaps for all cycads species. Adult plant decapitation should be halted at the 'Monte Oscuro' population, subjected to sustainable management since 1990, if higher seed production is needed in rural nurseries.

AB This study characterizes the flowering and fruiting phenology of the 13 most common pioneer tree species in early successional forests of the Central Amazon. For each species, 30 individuals, 10 each in three secondary forests, were monitored monthly for four years at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, north of Manaus. Five species showed nearly continuous flowering and fruiting throughout the study, indicating that resources were available to pollinators and dispersers on a regular basis. The other eight species showed stronger seasonality in reproduction, seven of them annually, and one supra-annually. Overall, flowering was concentrated in the transition from the dry to the rainy season and fruiting was concentrated in the rainy season. There was no relationship between reproductive phenology and tree pollinator type or dispersal mode. Reproductive phenology was remarkably consistent year to year. The pioneer community showed a variety of phenological patterns but as a whole tended to be characterized by annual flowering and fruiting, either continuously or seasonally, thereby fitting generalizations of pioneer species relative to mature forest species.

AB Spatial and temporal variation in seedling dynamics was assessed using records of community-wide seedling demography collected with identical monitoring methods at four tropical lowland forests in Panama, Malaysia, Ecuador and French Guiana for periods of between 3 and 10 y. At each site, the fates of between 8617 and 391 777 seedlings were followed through annual censuses of the 370-1.008 1-m(2) seedling plots. Within-site spatial and inter-annual variation in density, recruitment, growth and mortality was compared with among-site variability using Bayesian hierarchical modelling to determine the generality of each site's patterns and potential for meaningful comparisons among sites. The Malaysian forest, which experiences community-wide masting, was the most variable in both seedling density and recruitment. However, density varied year-to-year at all sites (CV(among years at site) = 8-43%), driven largely by high variability in recruitment rates (CV = 40-117%). At all sites, recruitment was more variable than mortality (CV = 5-64%) or growth (CV = 12-51%). Increases in mortality rates lagged I y behind large recruitment events. Within-site spatial variation and inter-annual differences were greater than differences among site averages in all rates, emphasizing the value of long-term comparative studies when generalizing how spatial and temporal variation drive patterns of recruitment in tropical forests.

AB Examining edge effects is imperative to developing effective conservation and management strategies in fragmented landscapes as they are a key component of how landscape change influences habitat quality. Although medium- to large-bodied mammals are recognised as key components of tropical forests, their responses to forest edges remain poorly documented. Here, we describe how five species of medium- to large-bodied terrestrial neotropical mammals respond to forest-pasture edges along 17 forest patches (ranging in size from 5-4714 ha) and two continuous areas of Amazonian forest in Alta Floresta, Brazil. Tracks from two rodent (Dasyprocta agouti and Agouti paca) and three ungulate species (Tayassu tajacu, Mazama gouazoubira and Tapirus terrestris) were recorded over 4900 sand track station nights during a 4-month study period. When species occurrences were compared between patch size classes we found a significant interaction between patch size and distance from the nearest forest edge only for ungulates. We discuss the cost-effectiveness of monitoring protocols for large terrestrial mammals in tropical forests based on sand track stations, and how edge effects and patch size can modulate species abundance and distribution.

AB The spatial behaviour of 10 Southern river otters Lontra provocax was analysed using radio-tracking data collected in the Queule River, Southern Chile. The estimated otter density was 0.25 individuals km(-1). Females with cubs and adult otters displaying mating behaviours were the only social group recorded. Studied otters were solitary and observed behaviour patterns suggest an intrasexual territoriality. No home range overlap among males existed while an average of 33% and 87% home range overlapped among females and between sexes, respectively In the situation of core areas, only one case of overlapping between an adult male and an adult female was observed. Average home range and core area lengths were 11.3 km and 0.9 km, respectively. Otters used rivers more frequently than expected, whereas they avoided small streams. Low intensity livestock farming, without canalization of watercourses and riparian vegetation extraction practices, seems compatible with the presence of Southern river otter populations since the spatial behaviour of the studied otters was not affected under these circumstances. Based on the present official reserve sizes and distribution within the country, and also the increase of variant anthropogenic land uses outside these areas that result with consequent habitat loss and deterioration, we strongly recommend considering the importance of spatial dimension in quantity and quality habitats in further conservation planning for the Southern river otter using an integrated catchment management.

AB Protected areas are crucial for Amazonian nature conservation. Many Amazonian reserves have been selected systematically to achieve biodiversity representativeness. We review the role natural-scientific understanding has played in reserve selection, and evaluate the theoretical potential of the existing reserves to cover a complete sample of the species diversity of the Amazonian rainforest biome. In total, 108 reserves ( 604,832 km(2)) are treated as strictly protected and Amazonian; 87 of these can be seen as systematically selected to sample species diversity ( 75.3% of total area). Because direct knowledge on all species distributions is unavailable, surrogates have been used to select reserves: direct information on some species distributions ( 15 reserves, 14.8% of total area); species distribution patterns predicted on the basis of conceptual models, mainly the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis, ( 5/ 10.3%); environmental units ( 46/ 27.3%); or a combination of distribution patterns and environmental units ( 21/ 22.9%). None of these surrogates are reliable: direct information on species distributions is inadequate; the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis is highly controversial; and environmental classiWcations do not capture all relevant ecological variation, and their relevance for species distribution patterns is undocumented. Hence, Amazonian reserves cannot be safely assumed to capture all Amazonian species. To improve the situation, transparency and an active dialogue with the scientific community should be integral to conservation planning. We suggest that the best currently available approach for sampling Amazonian species diversity in reserve selection is to simultaneously inventory indicator plant species and climatic and geological conditions, and to combine Weld studies with remote sensing.

AB Forests make up large ecosystems and can play an important role in mitigating the emissions of CO2, the most important greenhouse gas. However, they are sources of atmospheric carbon when they are disturbed by human or natural causes. Storage of carbon through expansion and adaptive management of forest ecosystems can assist in reducing carbon concentrations in atmosphere. This study proposes a methodology to produce spatially explicit estimates of the carbon storages (aboveground plus belowground) depending on land use/cover changes in two different forest ecosystems during various periods. Carbon storages for each forest ecosystem were projected according to inventory data, and carbon storages were mapped in a geographic information system (GIS). Results showed that total carbon stored in above and belowground of both forest ecosystems increased from one period to other because of especially increase of productive forest areas and decline of degraded forest areas as well as protection of spruce forests subject to insect attacks.

AB There is concern about the reliability of surrogate measures to represent biodiversity and the use of such measures in the design of marine reserve systems. Currently, surrogate measures are most often based on broad-scale (100-1000s of km) bioregional frameworks that define general categories (sandy beach, rocky shore) for intertidal systems. These broad-scale categories are inadequate when making decisions about conservation priorities at the local level (10-100s of m). In this study, 'shoreline types', derived using physical properties of the shoreline, were used as a surrogate for intertidal biodiversity to assist with the identification of sites to be included in a representative system of marine reserves. The use of local-scale shoreline types increased the likelihood that sites identified for conservation achieved representation goals for the mosaic of habitats and microhabitats, and therefore the associated biodiversity present on rocky shores, than that provided by the existing marine reserve protection. These results indicate that using broad-scale surrogate measures (rocky shore, sandy beach) for biodiversity (habitats, microhabitats and species) are likely to result in poor representation of fine-scale habitats and microhabitats, and therefore intertidal assemblages in marine reserves. When additional fine-scale data were added to reserve selection the summed irreplace ability of 24% (for spatial extent of habitats), and 29% (for presence/absence of microhabitats) of rocky shore sites increased above 0, where a value close to 1 means a site is necessary, for inclusion in a reserve system, to meet conservation targets. The use of finer-scale physical data to support marine reserve design is more likely to result in the selection of reserves that achieve representation at habitat and microhabitat levels, increasing the likelihood that conservation goals will be achieved.

AB By 2010, we will have detailed knowledge about the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana from a Linnean-like effort by an international research community to identify nearly all of the genes in the species and to classify the products that these genes encode according to a primary function in a generic plant cell. To know the wild species, however, we will require knowledge of which genes provide the raw material for phenotypic variation and natural selection, and consequently affect the adaptability of individual plants and local populations across their geographic range, and ultimately survival of the species. Natural variation in innate immunity will be at the forefront of this exciting research frontier as a model for the molecular ecology of plant-microbe interactions.

AB Adaptive values of plasticity in Iris pumila leaf traits (morphological: SLA, specific leaf area; anatomical: SD, stomatal density; LT, leaf thickness; VBN, vascular bundle number; SW, sclerenchyma width; CW, cuticle width, and physiological: ChlT, total chlorophyll concentration; ChlA/B, chlorophyll a/b ratio) were tested at three irradiance levels in a growth-room. Siblings from 28 full-sib families from an open dune site and a woodland understory responded similarly to variation in light availability: SLA gradually increased, while anatomical and physiological traits decreased with light reduction. In the Dune population, standardized linear selection gradients were significant for SLA and ChlT at high light, VBN along the entire light gradient, SW at high- and low-, and ChlA/B at low-irradiance. In the Woods population, the significant standardized linear selection gradients were observed for SLA and LT at low- and VBN at both high- and low-irradiance. A significant nonlinear selection gradient was recorded for SD and LT at medium irradiance. Comparisons of the plastic responses to each light quantity with the phenotypes favored by selection in that environments revealed that only an increased SLA value at low light in the Woods population was ecologically significant (adaptive). In the Dune population, SD and VBN entailed plasticity costs at low irradiance, while a cost of homeostasis was recognized for ChlT and ChlA/B at medium light, SD and CW at high- and low-, and SLA at high- and medium-light level. In the shaded population, CW and ChlA/B incurred plasticity costs at high irradiance, while for ChlT plasticity costs appeared under medium- and low-light conditions. In all leaf traits, genetic variation for plasticity was statistically undetectable. Genetic correlations between these traits were mostly insignificant, implying that they possess a capability for relatively independent evolution by natural selection across different light environments.

AB This paper examines the pattern of introduced herbivore and predator distribution in the Tanami Desert and tests a series of propositions put forward by Stafford Smith and Morton [1990. A framework for the ecology of arid Australia. Journal of Arid Environments 18, 255-278]. regarding the functioning of arid Australian environments. These authors proposed that introduced herbivore and predator species would be largely restricted to and reliant on productive refugia. We collected occurrence data on introduced and naturalized predators and herbivores at 227 plots stratified by substrate and fire age class across a study area of 700 x 400 km. We also collected data from 16 repetitively sampled transects stratified by substrate and latitude over a 4 year period. Each of the predator species was associated with different landscape parameters and the proposition that predator diversity and abundance would be greatest in the productive habitats was not supported. There was support for the proposition that introduced feral herbivores would be concentrated in the productive habitats. Overall, the parameters reflecting the climatic gradient were the most important determinants of introduced species distribution in the Tanami Desert. Substrate-related variables or episodic variables such as fire age were of secondary importance at the scale considered. Furthermore, the, variables that reflected episodic rainfall or periods of rainfall deviance did not form a significant component of the minimum adequate models for any of the species.

AB There are few hypotheses to explain local understory diversity patterns. There is a consensus that climate and soil fertility affect understory density and diversity at large scales, but few studies addressed the mechanisms controlling density and diversity locally. Here, I examine patterns of abundance and diversity of three understory herb groups along gradients of soil nutrients and topography at the mesoscale (64 km(2)) in a wet tropical forest, and possible factors causing them. Herb richness, diversity, density, and cover were measured in fifty-nine 250 x 2 m plots systematically distributed over Reserva Ducke, Manaus. Herb groups responded differently to environmental gradients. Whereas density and cover of pteridophytes increased with altitude and slope, Marantaceae density and cover decreased. Density of sedges increased with altitude, but did not vary with slope. Density and cover of Marantaceae and sedges but not pteridophytes increased with the soil cation content. Pteridophyte richness increased with slope whereas Marantaceae richness decreased, richness of both groups increased with cation content. Diversity increased with altitude for Marantaceae and decreased for pteridophytes. Some of these patterns agree with what is expected from herbs, such as the greater abundance of Marantaceae and sedges in flat and low altitude plots, where water availability is higher and probably also light, and the greater richness of Marantaceae and pteridophytes in higher nutrient plots. The unexpected results of higher abundance and richness of pteridophytes in slopes, instead of in bottomlands, suggest that biotic or litter-mediated controls may be important to set these patterns.

AB Ants significantly change the soil environment within the nest. The aim of this study is to contribute to ecology and thus the importance of two ant species Lasius niger and Lasius flavus in a post-mining landscape near the town of Sokolov in northwest Bohemia where both species are common. Chemical (total C, N, and available P) and microbiological parameters (respiration, cellulose decomposition and direct counts of bacteria) were investigated in both ant species in two different habitats: a tertiary clay heap after brown coal mining with a weakly developed organic layer and semi natural meadows with well developed organic horizons. Total C and N in the L. flavus mound was lower than in the surrounding soil in both stands, the same was true for. total N in L. niger on the heaps. L. niger nests in both sites were significantly enriched by available P. A litter bag test with cellulose indicated lower decomposition in the ant nest in comparison with the surrounding soil. Respiration seems to be limited by lower soil moisture in the nest. However, microbial respiration, even in suitable moisture conditions, did not differ between the nest and soil (on heaps) or nest respiration was significantly lower (in L. flavus nests in the meadow). In meadow soil both species had a lower bacteria count than the surrounding soil, but the L. niger nest on the heap had higher bacterial numbers. Both species significantly alter soil conditions, although the effect on selected parameters is variable. Moreover, the result with lower nest moisture and lower decomposition rate in ant mounds indicates that soil moisture should be the next important factor limiting soil processes inside ant mounds.

AB We examined tree diameter growth in 20 plots subjected to various disturbance intensities (natural, low. moderate and intensive logging) in a bid to understand the general tree growth responses in relation to habitat characteristics in subtropical rainforests of north-eastern NSW, Australia. Species-specific regeneration strategy, maximum size and level of shade tolerance were used to classify species into five groups: emergent and shade tolerant main canopy (group 1), shade tolerant mid canopy (2), shade tolerant understoreys (3), moderate shade tolerant (4) and shade intolerant (5) tree species. Data series for trees >= 10 cm diameter at 1.3 m above the ground level (dbh) providing observations spanning over 36 years were used in multilevel regression analyses. The results showed that spatial and temporal effects in tree growth at the stand level are a combination of the differences between species functional-group compositions and environmental gradients. High growth responses were observed in the shade intolerant species while increasing level of shade tolerance and decreasing maximum size decreased trees growth rates. Tree growth increased with altitude on a large scale across regions, and with disturbance intensity on a small scale at the plot (stand) level. Increase in northness (south through flat to north facing sites) increased growth in species group 1 for trees < 67 cm dbh, but beyond this dbh threshold the opposite was true. These showed that saplings of species group I may require increased illumination to reach the forest canopy, but once in the canopy, low soil water availability may be limiting to tree growth in the north facing sites. Decrease in northness was associated with increased growth in species group 2 indicating that reduced illumination and improved soil moisture in the south facing sites were conducive for maximum growth in this species group. Maximum growth potential in species groups 4 and 5 increased with decrease in eastness, suggesting that the increased afternoon solar radiation and temperature were conducive for high growth rates in these species. Although topographic gradient may determine the spatial and temporal variations in tree growth where growth appeared to increase from the crest down the slope into the creek/gully, its effects on soil fertility and water availability, and interactions between these and other factors may make it difficult to discern clear growth patterns.

AB Clear-fell harvesting has large aesthetic impacts and significantly alters ecosystem attributes at multiple spatial scales. Known abiotic changes include increased microclimatic variability, changes in regional water balance, and modified hydrological patterns that influence erosion processes. Biotic changes include increased species richness immediately post-clear-felling due to shifts in species composition resulting from changes in individual species abundance and colonization by disturbance-adapted or open-habitat species. Given the large ecological changes caused by clear-fell harvesting and the negative public perception of clear-felling. it is surprising that few studies have investigated whether reducing clear-fell harvest area may be a viable strategy to mitigate ecological change within individual clearcuts. Clear-fell size studies conducted to date rarely exceed a maximum harvest area of 10 ha, and biotic communities measured exhibit mixed responses with respect to species richness and other biodiversity attributes with increasing clear-fell size. Some postharvest ecological responses are nonlinear with respect to harvest area and suggest possible threshold sizes beyond which clear-fell impacts increase disproportionately to their size. Conceptual models of potential ecological thresholds in clear-fell harvest impacts are discussed, as is the need for rigorous empirical testing to ensure a solid foundation exists for forest harvesting guidelines.

AB Tree growth efficiency, or volume growth increment per unit leaf area, was calculated in multiaged mixed-conifer stands in the Sierra Nevada, California. Five conifer species with a range of tolerance to shade were sampled over a wide range of canopy positions and ages to detect species-specific patterns of growth efficiency (GE). All species showed non-linear, sigmoidal trends of volume increment with increasing leaf area. This pattern indicates slow increase in GE in shaded understory conditions and a peak in GE at intermediate tree size in mid-canopy positions. Larger trees showed lower GE than intermediate size trees. Species with lower shade tolerance had greater GE than species with greater tolerance. To test the effect of local light environment on tree volume growth, we used a light model to calculate the growing season average of absorbed light for individual trees. Models of volume increment as a function of weighted leaf area showed increased GE for small trees, indicating that the slow increase in volume increment in smaller understory trees was an effect of limited light conditions. Patterns of growth efficiency in multiaged mixed-species stands can be used to predict growth patterns of sub-canopy trees and judge relative shade tolerance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Secondary forests now play a vital role in the conservation of tree species diversity in Southeast Asia because of the continuing fragmentation and decreasing extent of undisturbed forests in this region. To be able to determine the structural and compositional integrity of secondary forests, a ground based rapid assessment method was developed. For this purpose species from the genera Macaranga and Mallotus (Euphorbiaccae) were classified into early and late successional species based on morphological characters that were found to correlate with the light establishment preferences of these species. These characters were wood density (found to be significantly negatively correlated with light establishment preference), seed size (also significantly negatively correlated with light establishment preference), and leaf shape (the leaf length/width ratio was significantly negatively correlated with light establishment preference). Based on this species classification, number of pioneers and non-pioneers could be determined in 71 plots of 0.3 ha. covering 11 common forest disturbance types in Southeast Asia. Three main patterns were detected with this methodology: (1) pioneer and non-pioneer densities were significantly correlated with the forest disturbance level: (2) pioneer densities decreased with time since disturbance; (3) pioneer densities increased with repeated disturbance. A sample size test indicated that forest disturbance in general, and the differences between the major disturbance types could be significantly determined with a minimum of five plots of 0.3 ha.

AB Canopy invertebrates may reflect changes in tree structure and microhabitat that are brought about by human activities. We used the canopy fogging method to collect ants from tree crowns in primary forest, secondary forest, and pasture in a Neotropical cloud forest landscape. The total number of species collected was similar in primary forest (21) and pasture (20) habitats, but lower in secondary forest (9). Lower diversity in secondary forest was caused by lower species density (no. of species per sample). Rarefaction curves based on number of species occurrences suggest similar community species richness among the three habitats. This Study has implications for conservation of tropical montane habitats in two ways. First, arboreal ant species density is reduced if secondary forest replaces primary forest, which increases the chance of extinction among rare species. Second, pasture trees may serve as repositories of primary forest ant communities due to similar tree structure.

AB Primates are primary seed dispersers for many tropical tree species. Different species of primates vary considerably in ranging and feeding behaviour, seed processing, and in seed defecation patterns. Here we compare the role of two arboreal primate species, howlers (Alouatta palliata), and white-faced monkeys (Cebus capucinus) as seed dispersers in a tropical dry forest in Costa Rica. We found that Cebus produce smaller defecations, spend shorter times feeding per tree, have longer seed dispersal distances, and produce a more scattered pattern of seed deposition in the forest than Alouatta. In addition, Cebus moved more frequently between trees, and consumed fruits of more species than Alouatta. We examined the consequences of the contrasting defecation patterns produced by Cebus and Alouatta on the early seed fate of Acacia collinsii. We found that quantity, but not the identity (Cebus vs. Alouatta) of faecal material affected post-dispersal activity. Seeds in scattered faeces, sufficiently apart from each other (the common defecation pattern of white-faced monkeys), had higher short-term survival than seeds in clumped patterns of faeces (the pattern associated with Alouatta).

AB Tree stems contract and expand as stem water is depleted and replaced. Band-dendrometer studies suggest that such daily changes are small (<0.2 mm diameter), and they are ignored in most growth measurements. However, several studies using other approaches note larger changes (even >1 cm diameter), suggesting that significant biases are possible. An exploratory study examined the pattern and magnitude of daily stem changes and whether commercial band-dendrometers were able to reveal them. A method involving multiple precision measurements on eight trees in a Bornean hill dipterocarp forest revealed daily shrinkage and expansion of girth of around I mm. Fluctuations were greater in bright weather. Band-dendrometers detected these changes but revealed less than a tenth of their magnitude. An analytical model for dendrometer error is presented that predicts how measurement biases can be reduced. Tropical trees can fluctuate appreciably in stem diameter over the day. These reversible changes are of sufficient magnitude to merit concern in growth studies. Influential biases seem especially likely when measurement intervals are short and involve systematic differences in timing and weather. Further study is required to gauge the more general influence of these measurement problems.

AB During 1990-1992, a survey of the golden lion tamarin, Leontopithecus rosalia, was carried out throughout its known distribution area. Forest remnants were identified by visual interpretation of Landsat-TM satellite images. Localities occupied by L. rosalia were first identified by interviews with local people. All forests more than 20 ha in size, and for which two or more interviews suggested the presence of the species, were surveyed using "play-back" recordings of lion tamarin long calls. The total wild population of L. rosalia, including that of the Pogo das Antas Biological Reserve, was estimated to be 562 individuals in 109 groups. The lion tamarins were generally found in four major areas of forest (six or more groups per forest, not including Pogo das Antas), with a further 12 groups isolated in small forest patches. Currently the species' distribution is restricted to just four municipalities in the state of Rio de Janeiro: Silva Jardim, Cabo Frio, Saquarema, and Araruama. Although they are typically confined to lowland forest of <300 m altitude, L. rosalia was recorded at an altitude of 550 m in one locality. Average group size varied from 3.6 to 5.7 individuals, and densities from 0.39 groups/km(2) to 2.35 groups/km(2) (2.17 individuals/km(2) to 8.53 individuals/km(2)). Six of the isolated groups found during the survey were successfully translocated to a forest of 2,400 ha. There is now also a significant population of reintroduced lion tamarins. Overall, however, the possibilities for further expansion of the wild population are severely limited.

AB Edge effects on tropical faunas may differ between highland and lowland sites and may therefore require different conservation strategies. In northwestern Ecuador, we examined the frog fauna on both sides of a boundary between wet Andean forest and agricultural lands, asking the following questions: ( 1 ) What is the nature of the response of frogs to edge? ( 2 ) Does the response change with land use? ( 3 ) What conservation measures are suggested by the first two questions? We set up 12 study plots along 16 km of convoluted boundary in one watershed. Each plot contained an agricultural parcel bordering a rectangle extending into the forest. In the dry season of 1996, following local tradition each agricultural parcel was cleared of second-growth vegetation and then burned, planted, cultivated, and ( in six cases ) harvested 1 year later. Half the parcels were planted in pasture grasses; the others were planted with corn and beans. We randomly assigned each treatment to two sites within each of three blocks. At each site, parallel to the boundary we set up eight all transects, four on the forest side of the boundary and four on the agricultural side. We censused frogs in plots with visual-encounter surveys along all transects in four different seasons from just after planting to just before crop harvest. Regardless of land use or survey date, frog-capture frequencies changed abruptly at the forest-agriculture boundary and then remained constant regardless of distance into the forest or into the cultivated parcels. Forest transects provided 95% of the 2111 captures; all but 5 captures were of Eleutherodactylus spp. ( Leptodactylidae). Eleutherodactylus leoni dominated the forest frog fauna but was rare throughout agricultural parcels. The second most common species, E. w-nigrum , displayed the opposite pattern. The stepwise nature of these responses differs from results of studies in tropical lowlands and suggests that edge effects that might penetrate from highland agriculture into cloud forest may be of far less conservation concern than the absolute loss of habitat as the agricultural boundary creeps upslope. This suggestion should be viewed with caution because the scope of our study included only one watershed, two idiosyncratic land-use treatments, and a unique vertebrate taxon.

AB The Recent members of the genus Nodilittorina in the eastern Pacific Ocean are revised. Hitherto eight to 10 species have been recognized, but this total is now increased to 18, of which three are named as new. The majority of the taxa fall into three species complexes: six in the N. porcata group, two in the N. modesta group, and six in the N. aspera group. Within each of these complexes, species identification from shells alone is difficult, as a result of remarkable intraspecific variation. Since all species of the genus have pelagic eggs and planktotrophic development, it is suggested that this variation may be partly of ecophenotypic origin. Discrimination is confirmed by species-specific characters of the penis and supported by some features of the spermatozoa and pallial oviducts. Radular characters are more constant throughout the genus. The four additional species are N. araucana, N. peruviana, N. galapagiensis, and N. fernandezensis. Anatomical features, radulae, and a range of shells are figured for each species. Geographical distributions are mapped in detail (from 777 samples examined) and cases of sympatric occurrence provide strong support for the discrimination of members of the three species complexes.
   There is insufficient morphological differentiation among the species to permit formal phylogenetic analysis. Some of them show similarities with congeners in the western Atlantic, but there are no obvious sister-species pairs. A species endemic to the oceanic islands off Chile, N. fernandezensis, shows a clear relationship with a largely temperate Southern Hemisphere group, the subgenus Austrolittorina (here redefined).
   Of particular interest tire the distributions of the 15 Nodilittorina species within the Tropical Eastern Pacific Region (TEP; hitherto referred to as the "Panamic Province" in the molluscan literature). These strongly support the classification of the region into four provinces, Cortez, Mexican, Panamic (with a southern Ecuadorean element), and Galapagos, as previously suggested for fishes, which (like Nodilittorina species) are dependent upon shallow-water rocky substrates. The boundaries between these provinces correspond with habitat gaps, of either open water (Galapagos) or inhospitable coastline of sand, mud, and mangroves (Sinaloan, Central American and Colombian Gaps). The implications for processes of dispersal and speciation, and also for future systematic studies of the rocky-shore fauna, are discussed.

AB We compared five methods for measuring light availability in the tropical forest understorey: the LAI-2000 PCA, an empirical LAI-metre, a densiometre, photosensitive diazo paper metres, and hemispherical photographs. Measurements were made along three 250 m transects and adjacent to 95 seedlings on four logged or virgin plots of a French Guianese forest. Correlation analysis showed that more mobile and less expensive methods, such as the LAI metre and diazo paper metres, can provide similar information to more cumbersome or expensive equipment such as the LAI-2000 metre or hemispherical photographs. All instruments except the densiometre detected differences among seedlings from different post-logging microsites. Few significant correlations were found between light measures and the number of trees or their basal area within 10 m, which may reflect an increase in the density of smaller stems and lianas during post-logging succession.

AB It has been postulated that the plasticity to shading of spacing organs in plants of different growth habit is more likely related to the analogy of organs than to their homology. Accordingly, vertical spacers (internodes in erect species, petioles in prostrate species) should be more plastic than horizontal spacers (petioles in erect species, internodes in prostrate species). This hypothesis was tested in the climbing plant Convolvulus arvensis. Given their facultative erect or prostrate habit, depending on support availability, climbing plants may be model species to test the relationship between growth habit and spacer plasticity in the absence of the confounding factors that are typical of interspecific comparisons. The phenotypic correlations among traits were also addressed. Three shading treatments (100%, 20%, and 5% of sunlight) and two support conditions (with and without a stake on which plants could twine) provided the experimental setting. Traits evaluated included internode length, petiole length, stem thickness, and biomass as well as area, shape, and specific area of leaves. The hypothesis was not supported. Internodes were more plastic than petioles in supported ("erect") as well as in nonsupported ("prostrate") plants, thereby supporting homology, and not analogy, of organs as a factor in explaining plasticity patterns. Most traits were significantly correlated both in supported and nonsupported plants. Internode and petiole length showed a highly significant positive correlation. This is discussed, and trait correlations are considered as possible constraints on the expected pattern of differential spacer plasticity to shading.

AB Periwinkle shells (Littorina littorea) that have been drilled by moon snails are abundant at Nahant, MA, and yet hermit crabs ( Pagurus longicarpus) are rarely found living in them. In the laboratory, hermit crabs will occupy drilled shells only if no other options are provided to them; they will, in fact, choose intact shells that are too small for them over drilled shells of appropriate size. This paper documents the selective forces that might account for this marked avoidance of drilled shells by hermit crabs. We show that drilled shells increase the vulnerability of the hermit crabs to decapod predators (e,g,, the green crab, Carcinus maenas), in part by allowing predators to enlarge the drill hole and also by reducing the force needed for predators to crack the shells open. Living in drilled shells also made the hermit crabs in our study more vulnerable to eviction by conspecifics and more vulnerable to low-salinity stress. Thus, moon snail predation on periwinkles, rather than supplying the Nahant hermit crab population with suitable empty snail shells, actually serves to destroy a potential resource for the hermit crabs and apparently to heighten competition among hermit crabs for intact shells.

AB Germination and seedling survival of native tree species were studied in nursery (June-November 1998) and forest stands with varying dominance by pines in the central highlands of Chiapas (Mexico; June 1998 - November 1999). Species used are regarded as typical of mid- and late-successional habitats: Cornus disciflora Sesse & Mocito ex DC., Cornus excelsa H.B.K., Drimys granadensis L.f. var. mexicana (DC.) A.C. Smith, Liquidambar styraciflua L., Persea americana L., Quercus laurina H. & B., and Ternstroemia lineata (DC.) ssp. chalicophyla (Loesener) Bartholomew. Nursery treatments included presence and composition of litter collected from replicated plots of three forest types: old-growth forest, mixed pine-oak forest, and pine-dominated forest. Germination and seedling emergence of P. americana in the nursery were complete for all factor combinations. Cornus disciflora and L. styraciflua showed highest germination (p 0.05) when sown in soil from old-growth forest and covered with litter of oak-broad-leaved species. In the field, differences (p 0.05) among forest types (degree of pine dominance) were observed for C. disciflora (lowest germination in pinelands, 17%), D. granadensis (highest survival in old-growth forest, 23%), and Q. laurina (higher survival in pinelands, 54%). Natural recruitment and survival of seedlings were higher in old-growth forests. We conclude that oak litter may favor germination and early establishment of the studied species. However, the reintroduction of some of the studied species (C. excelsa, Q. laurina, and T. lineata) may be attempted with direct sowing on the forest floor of severely disturbed and species-poor pinelands.

AB 1 Although seed banks may often affect the colonization, succession and structure of surface plant communities, few studies have investigated the demographic relationship between seeds in the soil and above-ground plant populations over space and time. We examined this relationship in the perennial mustard Lesquerella fendleri between 1991 and 1994 within a New Mexico desert ecosystem characterized by open patches of soil (intershrub areas) interspersed with dominant creosote (Larrea tridentata) shrubs (subshrub areas).
   2 For the first 2 years of the study, Lesquerella soil seed, surface plant and seed production densities were greater in subshrub vs. intershrub areas. Within the subshrub areas, there were more Lesquerella soil seeds and surface plants in the northern and central microsites, compared with the southern and perimeter microsites, respectively. The mean density of the subshrub seed bank did not increase following large inputs of new seeds (2400 seeds m(-2)) in the summer of 1992. In contrast, virtually all of the relatively modest Lesquerella intershrub seed production at this time (169 seeds m(-2)) appeared to survive, so that for the remainder of the study most soil seeds were found in the intershrub sites. This spatial reversal of seed bank densities preceded a similar switch in the relative densities of the Lesquerella sub- and intershrub surface plant populations in the last 2 years of the study.
   3 This study supports the hypothesis that desert seed bank patchiness contributes to surface plant patchiness, but does not support the idea that seed banks are comprised primarily of seeds produced during favourable reproductive periods. Because there was a closer spatial match between Lesquerella soil seeds and surface plants than between soil seeds and seed production, the above-ground population may be limited to sites favourable for soil seed persistence.

AB The spatial distribution of Eurya japonica, an evergreen understorey species, was studied on a 4-ha permanent plot in an old-growth, temperate, evergreen broad-leaved forest in southwestern Japan. The pattern of spatial dispersion varied with size class, the environmental heterogeneity produced by tree-fall gaps and microtopography and the scale of observation. Seedlings (0.05 to < 0.5 m high) had the most clumped distributions, followed by saplings (0.5 to 1.3 m high) and adults (greater than or equal to 1.3 m). individuals were more clumped at the smallest grid size, 1.56 m x 1.56 m, and became less clumped as grid size increased for all size classes. On grids of less than 6.25 m x 6.25 m, no spatial correlations were found between seedlings and lar er size classes; positive spatial correlations were found between saplings and adults at this scale. Abundant seedlings appeared in tree-fall gaps formed by uprooted trees, but seedlings were frequent on ridge tops and upper slopes. Saplings and adults also occurred on upper slopes, but their spatial distribution had little relation to current tree-fall gaps. The spatial distribution of E. japonica individuals was largely attributed to the distribution of tree-fall gaps and the differential responses to microtopographic variation by individuals at different size classes.

AB With the sakis (Pithecia) and the bearded sakis (Chiropotes), the uakaris (Cacajao) constitute the cebid subfamily, Pitheciinae. The most recent revision recognized six Cacajao subspecies in two species, confined to the Amazon basin. Before 1970 most field information derived from 19th century travellers. Studies still lag behind those of other cebid genera. This paper summarises the known ecology of Cacajao, and identifies future research and conservation priorities. The relevance of Pleistocene refugia and metachromism in analysing its biogeography is discussed. Range size remains obscure but, with the exception of C. c. calvus, may be extensive, as all other subspecies appear to migrate in the dry season from flooded riverine forest to terra firme. Observed group size ranges from 5 to 50, indicating the operation of a fission-fusion society. Social organization appears to be multi-male and non-hierarchical. This accords with the minimal sexual dimorphism. The highly developed canines function primarily as fruit openers, Cacajao is a dietary specialist on hard-shelled fruit. and appears unique among Amazonian cebids in its dependence (at least seasonally) on riverine forests. Hunting may be a problem locally, but local taboos sometimes offer protection. They appear vulnerable to habitat disturbance. On the Rio Negro, the range of C. melanocephalus appears to have greatly diminished. To ensure protection of viable populations, the inferred dietary dependence on seasonal migration may require accommodation. Research priorities include the status, habitat preference, diet and social ecology of all taxa except C. c. calvus. A more complete knowledge of the biogeography of the genus would be valuable.

AB The diet of Thick-billed Murres collected near six colonies in the eastern Canadian Arctic comprised invertebrates (84% of 23 462 items) and fish (16%). Adult diets differed significantly among colonies, both within the Low Arctic (Hudson Strait), between Low and High Arctic (Lancaster Sound - Baffin Bay). and between Low-Arctic colonies and a colony close to the High/Low Arctic boundary (Davis Strait). Murres from the High Arctic took more invertebrates, fewer fish, and a smaller number of species overall than those from the Low Arctic. Diets were more diverse in the Low Arctic than in the High Arctic, in keeping with the greater number of prey taxa available at lower latitudes. Similarity indices show that diets at High-Arctic colonies were more similar to one another than was true for other colonies. Differences among Low-Arctic colonies suggest variation in the relative abundance of different nekton components within Hudson Strait.

AB The shells of living queen scallops, Chlamys opercularis (L.), are often completely colonised with epifauna. In this study, the distribution of the major epifaunal groups across the surfaces of left (upper) and right (lower) valves is examined using samples from two commercial queen scallop beds off the Isle of Man. The composition of the epifauna differs across and between the valves and also varies with the age of the scallop. Younger C. opercularis are commonly encrusted by sponges, but on older shells other epifauna colonise the surfaces. The encrusting bryozoan assemblage found on living C. opercularis is not as abundant or speciose as on some other substrata such as stones and dead shell. This may be a result of intense competition from other phyla. The distribution of different bryozoan species between the surfaces is examined. Most species are more abundant on the lower valves.

AB Metacommunity ecology combines local (e.g., environmental filtering and biotic interactions) and regional (e.g., dispersal and heterogeneity) processes to understand patterns of species abundance, occurrence, composition, and diversity across scales of space and time. As such, it has a great potential to generalize and synthesize our understanding of many ecological problems. Here, we give an overview of how a metacommunity perspective can provide useful insights for conservation biology, which aims to understand and mitigate the effects of anthropogenic drivers that decrease population sizes, increase extinction probabilities, and threaten biodiversity. We review four general metacommunity processes-environmental filtering, biotic interactions, dispersal, and ecological drift-and discuss how key anthropogenic drivers (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, and nonnative species) can alter these processes. We next describe how the patterns of interest in metacommunities (abundance, occupancy, and diversity) map onto issues at the heart of conservation biology, and describe cases where conservation biology benefits by taking a scale-explicit metacommunity perspective. We conclude with some ways forward for including metacommunity perspectives into ideas of ecosystem functioning and services, as well as approaches to habitat management, preservation, and restoration.

AB The use of fire by cattle ranchers is a major source of conflict between conservationists and local communities in tropical savannas. We evaluate the role of traditional pastoral management in wildfire prevention in two protected areas within the Brazilian savanna. Fine-grain field data from transect walks and interviews were combined with geospatial data at landscape scale to compare fire regimes in community-managed areas with those in government-managed areas. Local pastoral management creates seasonal mosaic patterns of burnings performed for productive activities and for deliberate landscape management, i.e. to protect fire-sensitive vegetation and avoid wildfires. Whereas government-managed areas were affected by large biennial late dry season wildfires, community-managed areas with a regular fire regime suffered less damage. These systems are under threat and poorly understood by researchers and environmental managers. In order to improve fire management in tropical savannas, greater understanding of pastoral management practices and their spatiotemporal dimensions is required.

AB The Amazon rain forest experiences the combined pressures from human-made deforestation and progressing climate change, causing severe and potentially disruptive perturbations of the ecosystem's integrity and stability. To intensify research on critical aspects of Amazonian biosphere-atmosphere exchange, the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) has been established in the central Amazon Basin. Here we present a multi-year analysis of backward trajectories to derive an effective footprint region of the observatory, which spans large parts of the particularly vulnerable eastern basin. Further, we characterize geospatial properties of the footprint regions, such as climatic conditions, distribution of ecoregions, land cover categories, deforestation dynamics, agricultural expansion, fire regimes, infrastructural development, protected areas, and future deforestation scenarios. This study is meant to be a resource and reference work, helping to embed the ATTO observations into the larger context of human-caused transformations of Amazonia. We conclude that the chances to observe an unperturbed rain forest-atmosphere exchange at the ATTO site will likely decrease in the future, whereas the atmospheric signals from human-made and climate-change-related forest perturbations will increase in frequency and intensity.

AB Global change influences biogeochemical cycles within and between environmental compartments (i.e., the cryosphere, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and the atmosphere). A major effect of global change on carbon cycling is altered exposure of natural organic matter (NOM) to solar radiation, particularly solar UV radiation. In terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, NOM is degraded by UV and visible radiation, resulting in the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide, as well as a range of products that can be more easily degraded by microbes (photofacilitation). On land, droughts and land-use change can reduce plant cover causing an increase in exposure of plant litter to solar radiation. The altered transport of soil organic matter from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems also can enhance exposure of NOM to solar radiation. An increase in emission of CO2 from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems due to the effects of global warming, such as droughts and thawing of permafrost soils, fuels a positive feedback on global warming. This is also the case for greenhouse gases other than CO2, including methane and nitrous oxide, that are emitted from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These trace gases also have indirect or direct impacts on stratospheric ozone concentrations. The interactive effects of UV radiation and climate change greatly alter the fate of synthetic and biological contaminants. Contaminants are degraded or inactivated by direct and indirect photochemical reactions. The balance between direct and indirect photodegradation or photoinactivation of contaminants is likely to change with future changes in stratospheric ozone, and with changes in runoff of coloured dissolved organic matter due to climate and land-use changes.

AB Forest fragmentation and defaunation are considered the main drivers of biodiversity loss, yet the synergistic effects of landscape changes and biotic interactions on assemblage structure have been poorly investigated. Here, we use an extensive dataset of 283 assemblages and 105 species of small mammals to understand how defaunation of medium and large mammals and forest fragmentation change the community composition and diversity of rodents and marsupials in tropical forests of South America. We used structured equation models to investigate the relationship between small mammal species, functional and phylogenetic diversity with forest size, forest cover and the occurrence of medium and large mammals. The best-fit model showed that defaunation reduced functional diversity, and that species diversity of small mammals increased with forest patch size. Forest cover did not affect functional and phylogenetic diversity. Our results indicate that occurrence of medium and large sized mammals (probably acting as predators, or competitors of small mammals) and forest patch size help to retain species and functional diversity in small mammal communities. Further, the number of species in a small mammal community was critical to the maintenance of phylogenetic diversity, and may have a pronounced influence on the ecological functions played by small mammals. Identifying how phylogenetic and functional diversity change in function of human pressures allows us to better understand the contribution of extant lineages to ecosystem functioning in tropical forests.

AB We estimate the early effects of the pilot project to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) in the Brazilian Amazon. This project offers a mix of interventions, including conditional payments, to reduce deforestation by smallholders who depend on swidden agriculture and extensive cattle ranching. We collected original data from 181 individual farmers. We use difference-in-difference (DID) and DID-matching approaches and find evidence that supports our identification strategy. We estimate that an average of 4 ha of forest were saved on each participating farm in 2014, and that this conservation came at the expense of pastures rather than croplands. This amounts to a decrease in the deforestation rate of about 50%. We find no evidence of within-community spillovers.

AB The fate of tropical forests under climate change is unclear as a result, in part, of the uncertainty in projected changes in precipitation and in the ability of vegetation models to capture the effects of drought-induced mortality on aboveground biomass (AGB).
   We evaluated the ability of a terrestrial biosphere model with demography and hydrodynamics (Ecosystem Demography, ED2-hydro) to simulate AGB and mortality of four tropical tree plant functional types (PFTs) that operate along light- and water-use axes. Model predictions were compared with observations of canopy trees at Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. We then assessed the implications of eight hypothetical precipitation scenarios, including increased annual precipitation, reduced inter-annual variation, El Nino-related droughts and drier wet or dry seasons, on AGB and functional diversity of the model forest.
   When forced with observed meteorology, ED2-hydro predictions capture multiple BCI benchmarks. ED2-hydro predicts that AGB will be sustained under lower rainfall via shifts in the functional composition of the forest, except under the drier dry-season scenario.
   These results support the hypothesis that inter-annual variation in mean and seasonal precipitation promotes the coexistence of functionally diverse PFTs because of the relative differences in mortality rates. If the hydroclimate becomes chronically drier or wetter, functional evenness related to drought tolerance may decline.

AB Variation in seed availability shapes plant communities, and is strongly affected by seed predation. In some plant species, temporal variation in seed production is especially high and synchronized over large areas, which is called 'mast seeding'. One selective advantage of this phenomenon is predator satiation which posits that masting helps plants escape seed predation through starvation of predators in lean years, and satiation in mast years. However, even though seed predation can be predicted to have a strong spatial component and depend on plant densities, whether the effectiveness of predator satiation in masting plants changes according to the Janzen-Connell effect has been barely investigated. We studied, over an 8-year period, the seed production, the spatiotemporal patters of weevil seed predation, and the abundance of adult weevils in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) population that consists of trees interspersed at patches covering a continuum of conspecific density. Isolated oaks effectively satiate predators, but this is trumped by increasing conspecific plant density. Lack of predator satiation in trees growing in dense patches was caused by re-distribution of insects among plants that likely attenuated them against food shortage in lean years, and changed the type of weevil functional response from type II in isolated trees to type III in trees growing in dense patches. This study provides the first empirical evaluation of the notion that masting and predator satiation should be more important in populations that start to dominate their communities, and is consistent with the observation that masting is less frequent and less intense in diverse forests.

AB Successfully implemented payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs can provide both conservation of nature and financial support to rural communities. In this paper, we explore how PES programs can be designed so as to maximize the amount of additional ecosystem services provided for a given budget. We also provide a brief summary of the use of auction mechanisms in real world PES programs. To explore the potential additionality of different PES program designs we use a conceptual agent based simulation model where payments are either fixed, or set through a uniform or discriminatory auction. The program can also be designed to target payments to land-owners based on their provision of ecosystem services. Theoretically, auctions should be the most effective design, especially if payments are differentiated and targeted by ecosystem service provision. However, what we find is that the context in which the PES program is implemented baseline compliance with program standards among the participants, correlation between opportunity costs and ecosystem services in the landscape, heterogeneity in costs and budget size has a determining impact on the relative effectiveness of the different payment designs, with fixed payments schemes being much more effective than auctions in certain settings. Our findings suggest that context should be taken into serious consideration when a PES program design is chosen.

AB Forest dynamic models predict the current and future states of ecosystems and are a nexus between physiological processes and empirical data, forest plot inventories and remote-sensing information. The problem of biodiversity representation in these models has long been an impediment to a detailed understanding of ecosystem processes. This challenge is amplified in species-rich and high-carbon tropical forests. Here we describe an individual-based and spatially explicit forest growth simulator, TROLL, that integrates recent advances in plant physiology. Processes (carbon assimilation, allocation, reproduction, and mortality) are linked to species-specific functional traits, and the model was parameterized for an Amazonian tropical rainforest. We simulated a forest regeneration experiment from bare soil, and we validated it against observations at our sites. Simulated forest regeneration compared well with observations for stem densities, gross primary productivity, aboveground biomass, and floristic composition. After 500years of regrowth, the simulated forest displayed structural characteristics similar to observations (e.g., leaf area index and trunk diameter distribution). We then assessed the model's sensitivity to a number of key model parameters: light extinction coefficient and carbon quantum yield, and to a lesser extent mortality rate, and carbon allocation, all influenced ecosystem features. To illustrate the potential of the approach, we tested whether variation in species richness and composition influenced ecosystem properties. Overall, species richness had a positive effect on ecosystem processes, but this effect was controlled by the identity of species rather by richness per se. Also, functional trait community means had a stronger effect than functional diversity on ecosystem processes. TROLL should be applicable to many tropical forests sites, and data requirement is tailored to ongoing trait collection efforts. Such a model should foster the dialogue between ecology and the vegetation modeling community, help improve the predictive power of models, and eventually better inform policy choices.

AB Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) have become the flagship of conservation organizations in recent years. However, PES schemes are as much criticized as they are acclaimed in the literature. Researchers have pointed that many PES schemes, particularly water-related ones, are based on unreliable assumptions and lack strong causal links between land use and ecosystem services. Evidence of outcomes is hardly demonstrated. This uncertainty in PES schemes arises not only from practical difficulties, but from the complexity of the human-environment systems (HES), and the limits of current knowledge about HES. Many scientists and practitioners have proposed that more research is needed to improve the scientific basis of PES. Here we argue that this research should be complemented with a deeper understanding of the uncertainties involved in PES, an explicit treatment of these in the whole process of PES negotiation, design and monitoring, and dear uncertainty communication among the actors involved. Neglecting uncertainties could lead to unfounded expectations and poor assessments of PES outcomes. If recognizing and accounting for uncertainties are to threaten the success of PES, then uncertainty can be seen as an opportunity to open up the dialogue to alternative ways of achieving the desired conservation goals.

AB Conservation relies heavily on protected areas (PAs) maintaining their key biodiversity features to meet global biodiversity conservation goals. However, PAs have had variable success, with many failing to fully maintain their biodiversity features. The current literature concerning what drives variability in PA performance is rapidly expanding but unclear, sometimes contradictory, and spread across multiple disciplines. A clear understanding of the drivers of successful biodiversity conservation in PAs is necessary to make them fully effective. Here, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the current state of knowledge concerning the drivers of biological outcomes within PAs, focusing on those that can be addressed at local scales. We evaluate evidence in support of potential drivers to identify those that enable more successful outcomes and those that impede success and provide a synthetic review. Interactions are discussed where they are known, and we highlight gaps in understanding. We find that elements of PA design, management, and local and national governance challenges, species and system ecology, and sociopolitical context can all influence outcomes. Adjusting PA management to focus on actions and policies that influence the key drivers identified here could improve global biodiversity outcomes.

AB We conducted a meta-analysis of the effects of fire on the abundance and alpha diversity of ants based upon data published over the past 70 years. Overall, fire reduced ant diversity by 18 %, but had no effect on ant abundance. However, there was significant variation in the effect of fire on ant diversity amongst different vegetation types. Fire significantly decreased ant diversity in forests-especially in tropical forests-whereas in deserts, grasslands, and savannas it did not. Similarly, fire had a strong negative mean effect on ant diversity in sites where it is uncommon, but did not significantly affect diversity where it is a recurrent phenomenon. There is evidence that, in forests, wildfires have a stronger negative effect on ant diversity than does prescribed burning. In addition, we found marginally significant differences in the effect of fire on the abundance and diversity of forest ants among studies that sampled ants at different times post-fire, or that sampled ants from different soil strata. In contrast, fire did not significantly affect the abundance or diversity of savanna ants, and this was true even after we took into account the geographic location of the study, the ant community sampled, the time since fire, and the fire regime. Overall, the results of our study indicate that habitat type is an important predictor of ant community responses to fire. However, even within a given habitat, reported effects were quite variable among the studies reviewed, evidencing the idiosyncratic nature of fire effects on ants.

AB Both ecological and evolutionary mechanisms have been proposed to describe how natural communities become assembled at both regional and biogeographical scales. Yet, these theories have largely been developed in isolation. Here, we unite these separate views and develop an integrated eco-evolutionary framework of community assembly. We use a simulation approach to explore the factors determining the interplay between ecological and evolutionary mechanisms systematically across spatial scales. Our results suggest that the same set of ecological and evolutionary processes can determine community assembly at both regional and biogeographical scales. We find that the importance of evolution and community monopolization effects, defined as the eco-evolutionary dynamics that occur when local adaptation of early established immigrants is fast enough to prevent the later immigration of better pre-adapted species, are not restricted to adaptive radiations on remote islands. They occur at dispersal rates of up to ten individuals per generation, typical for many species at the scale of regional metacommunities. Dispersal capacity largely determines whether ecological species sorting or evolutionary monopolization structure metacommunity diversity and distribution patterns. However, other factors related to the spatial scale at which community assembly processes are acting, such as metacommunity size and the proportion of empty patches, also affect the relative importance of ecology versus evolution. We show that evolution often determines community assembly, and this conclusion is robust to a wide range of assumptions about spatial scale, mode of reproduction, and environmental structure. Moreover, we found that community monopolization effects occur even though species fully pre-adapted to each habitat are abundant in the metacommunity, a scenario expected a priori to prevent any meaningful effect of evolution. Our results strongly support the idea that the same eco-evolutionary processes underlie community assembly at regional and biogeographical scales.

AB Biomass allocation can exert a great influence on plant resource acquisition and nutrient use. However, the role of biomass allocation strategies in shaping plant community composition under nutrient limitations remains poorly addressed. We hypothesized that species-specific allocation strategies can affect plant adaptation to nutrient limitations, resulting in species turnover and changes in community-level biomass allocations across nutrient gradients. In this study, we measured species abundance and the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in leaves and soil nutrients in an arid-hot grassland. We quantified species-specific allocation parameters for stems vs leaves based on allometric scaling relationships. Species-specific stem vs leaf allocation parameters were weighted with species abundances to calculate the community-weighted means driven by species turnover. We found that the community-weighted means of biomass allocation parameters were significantly related to the soil nutrient gradient as well as to leaf stoichiometry, indicating that species-specific allocation strategies can affect plant adaptation to nutrient limitations in the studied grassland. Species that allocate less to stems than leaves tend to dominate nutrient-limited environments. The results support the hypothesis that species-specific allocations affect plant adaptation to nutrient limitations. The allocation trade-off between stems and leaves has the potential to greatly affect plant distribution across nutrient gradients.

AB Desertification, one of the most severe types of land degradation in the world, is of great importance because it is occurring, to some degree, on approximately 40% of the global land area and is affecting more than 1 billion people. In this study, we used a space-for-time method to quantify the impact of five different desertification regimes (potential (PD), light (LD), moderate (MD), severe (SD), and very severe (VSD)) on a desert steppe ecosystem in northern China to examine the relationship between the productivity of the vegetation and soil properties and to determine the mechanism underlying the effects of desertification on productivity. Our results showed that the effects of desertification on TP (total phosphorus) and AP (available phosphorus) were not significant, and desertification decreased productivity in the desert steppe as a result of direct changes to soil physical properties, which can directly affect soil chemical properties. Therefore, intensive grassland management to improve soil quality may result in the long-term preservation of ecosystem functions and services.

AB QuestionsWhat are the prevailing types of intraspecific spatial distributions and interspecific association patterns at species and life stage levels of trees in a tropical rain forest? Which ecological processes could structure these patterns? Possible processes include dispersal limitation, self-thinning, facilitation and competition between species and life stages.
   LocationA tropical broad-leaved forest in north-central Vietnam.
   MethodsWe used univariate and bivariate pair-correlation functions to investigate the spatial distribution and association patterns of 18 abundant tree species. To disentangle first- and second-order effects, we used a scale separation approach with the heterogeneous Poisson process as null model.
   Results(1) Sixteen of 18 species had aggregated patterns at various scales and regardless of their abundance. (2) Significant and aggregated patterns were found in 64% of all specific life stages. (3) At scales up to 15m, 12.4% species pairs showed significant associations, among that 71% were spatial attractions, 5% were spatial repulsions and 24% were non-essential interactions. (4) In different life stage associations, attractions (81%) predominated over repulsions (19%) at small scales of up to 15m.
   ConclusionsOur findings provide evidence that dispersal limitation may regulate the spatial patterns of tree species. Moreover, positive spatial associations between tree species and life stages suggest the presence of species herd protection and/or facilitation in this forest stand, while the persistence of intraspecific aggregation through life stages suggests a very late onset or even absence of self-thinning. Habitat heterogeneity plays an important role for species distribution patterns, and the spatial segregation occurs at a scale around 15m in this forest.

AB Hypogean habitats offer unique opportunities for ecological studies because they are characterized by low abundance and diversity of organisms, they receive low energy inputs, they are relatively stable from a climatic point of view, and they are quite easily modeled. However, given the harsh conditions of the working environment and difficulty of access, very few studies have investigated in detail the ecology of subterranean species directly in the field. In this study, we describe the ecological niche of the subterranean spider Troglohyphantes vignai (Araneae, Linyphiidae). We monitored the population of T. vignai in a disused graphite mine in the Western Italian Alps over 1year, and recorded the main biotic and abiotic parameters characterizing each sampling plot (i.e., temperature, humidity, prey availability, illuminance, and structural complexity). The ecological niche of T. vignai was modeled through polynomial generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and illustrated graphically by means of three-dimensional plots and GIS techniques. The environmental range in which the probability of presence of T. vignai was higher was consistent with a trade-off between climatic stability and food availability. Neither temporal nor spatial variation of the niche of T. vignai was detected through the year. The methodology used here may be easily adapted to other hypogean sites, paving the way to a novel understanding of niche partitioning in subterranean ecosystems.

AB Aim We used chelonian distribution data to (1) predict suitable areas of the occurrence for freshwater turtle species using species distribution models and (2) evaluate whether these species are protected by the current network of protected areas (PAs).
   Location The Brazilian Amazon.
   Methods We generated predictions of suitable areas for chelonian occurrence based on BIOCLIM, SVM, GLM and maximum entropy modelling procedures. We used maximum entropy to run the gap analysis and compared the effectiveness of three kinds of protected areas with different levels of protection: (1) integral protection areas (IPA) only; (2) integral protection areas + sustainable use areas (IPA+ SUA); and (3) integral protection areas + sustainable use areas + indigenous lands (IPA + SUA + IL).
   Results We identified only one full gap species, Mesoclemmys nasuta, whose distribution is not included in any PAs. Other chelonian species have at least a portion of their distribution included in PAs. Some protected species and partial gap species occur in areas with high rates of deforestation. Considering PAs with the highest level of protection (IPA), only Rhinoclemmys punctularia and Kinosternon scorpioides achieve their conservation targets. In the IPA + SUA scenario, conservation targets of some species with small range sizes are not achieved. When all PA types were considered (IPA + SUA + IL), only two species fail to achieve their conservation targets, Acanthochelys macrocephala and M. nasuta.
   Main conclusions Despite the large number of PAs in the Brazilian Amazon, IPAs alone are not sufficient for capturing suitable areas for freshwater turtles. The inclusion of SUA and IL is crucial for achieving coverage targets for most species. However, chelonians may be overharvested in SUAs and ILs, due to their importance as a food resource. Areas that have high turtle richness next to existing PAs and the needs of traditional cultures should be considered in management planning for freshwater turtles.

AB The lemurs of Madagascar are among the most threatened mammalian taxa in the world, with habitat loss due to shifting cultivation and timber harvest heavily contributing to their precarious state. Deforestation often leads to fragmentation, resulting in mixed-habitat matrices throughout a landscape where disturbed areas are prone to invasion by exotic plants. Our study site, the Mandena littoral forest (southeast Madagascar), is a matrix of littoral forest, littoral swamp, and Melaleuca swamp habitats. Here, Melaleuca quinquenervia has invaded the wetland ecosystem, creating a mono-dominant habitat that currently provides the only potential habitat corridor between forest fragments. We sought to understand the role of this invasive Melaleuca swamp on the behavioral ecology of a threatened, small-bodied folivore, the southern bamboo lemur (Hapalemur meridionalis). We collected botanical and behavioral data on four groups of H. meridionalis between January and December 2013. Our results confirm Melaleuca swamp as an important part of their home range: while lemurs seasonally limited activities to certain habitats, all groups were capable of utilizing this invasive habitat for feeding and resting. Furthermore, the fact that Hapalemur use an invasive plant species as a dispersal corridor increases our knowledge of their ecological flexibility, and may be useful in the conservation management of remaining threatened populations.

AB Efforts to curb elephant poaching have focused on reducing demand, confiscating ivory and boosting security patrols in elephant range. Where land is under multiple uses and ownership, determining the local poaching dynamics is important for identifying successful conservation models. Using 2,403 verified elephant, Loxodonta africana, mortality records collected from 2002 to 2012 and the results of aerial total counts of elephants conducted in 2002, 2008 and 2012 for the Laikipia-Samburu ecosystem of northern Kenya, we sought to determine the influence of land ownership and use on diurnal elephant distribution and on poaching levels. We show that the annual proportions of illegally killed (i.e., poached) elephants increased over the 11 years of the study, peaking at 70% of all recorded deaths in 2012. The type of land use was more strongly related to levels of poaching than was the type of ownership. Private ranches, comprising only 13% of land area, hosted almost half of the elephant population and had significantly lower levels of poaching than other land use types except for the officially designated national reserves (covering only 1.6% of elephant range in the ecosystem). Communal grazing lands hosted significantly fewer elephants than expected, but community areas set aside for wildlife demonstrated significantly higher numbers of elephants and lower illegal killing levels relative to non-designated community lands. While private lands had lower illegal killing levels than community conservancies, the success of the latter relative to other community-held lands shows the importance of this model of land use for conservation. This work highlights the relationship between illegal killing and various land ownership and use models, which can help focus anti-poaching activities.

AB The policy implications for success in the next-stage Grain-for-Green Project (GFGP) in China are analyzed from the perspectives of farmers' willingness. The ecological protection belt of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area was chosen as the case study area, where 1207 valid questionnaire surveys based on participatory rural appraisal were collected in 2012. Our study found that farmers with lower levels of education, older age, and higher livelihood dependency on farmland were more prone to reclamation if the compensation ended. Females and non-migrants were more reluctant to participate in the next GFGP than others. Nevertheless, traditional farming was no longer a preferred livelihood by all respondents. The majority of respondents (74.4 %) wished to be liberated from the low-income farmland work through the next GFGP, and half of them (50.6 %) hoped to get non-cash compensation. The Willingness to Accept (WTA) values of the next GFGP showed significant social heterogeneity and regional difference, with an average of annual RMBAyen16,665 ha(-1), about 4.5 times the local compensation standard in 2000. By revealing some limitations of the uniform nationwide compensation standard system and the single payment form in adapting to evolving socioeconomic conditions, our study highlighted the importance of developing a region-based compensation standard system, integrating the next GFGP into regional sustainable development organically by more comprehensive alternative policy, and bonding a vertical partnership between the local community and the nation. Our study revealed some key elements for success in the future design of restoration projects in China.

AB Forest recovery is occurring in Panama and several other tropical countries following decades of deforestation. Theory on such 'forest transitions' describes urbanization and agricultural modernization as underling factors. Tropical country governments may seek to harness these factors to promote a tropical forest transition within the REDD+ scheme. Yet tropical forest transitions remain poorly described due to limited data and inappropriate modeling. To determine the nature of a tropical forest transition I derive canonical correlations of (a) socio-agrarian transformation observed via respondent-level census records and (b) forest-cover change observed via satellite imagery, for 82% of Panamanian counties over 1980-1990-2000-2008. The Panamanian forest transition centered on multi-decadal in situ shifts in employment from agriculture to off-farm activity, particularly by women. Agricultural modernization and decline were coincident but of lesser importance. Urbanization entailed increasingly connected small urban centers in otherwise rural landscapes. Net forest gains per decade were similar to 1.52% of the area of influence of the socio-agrarian transformations, which concentrate in economically and agriculturally favored regions. Governments may conceivably nurture forest transitions already underway via economic policies, but they cannot coordinate them. Even so, inefficiencies may be prohibitively high, and challenges significant. A history of failure of similar 'social engineering' endeavors urges caution in this respect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Australian rainforests have been fragmented due to past climatic changes and more recently landscape change as a result of clearing for agriculture and urban spread. The subtropical rainforests of South Eastern Queensland are significantly more fragmented than the tropical World Heritage listed northern rainforests and are subject to much greater human population pressures. The Australian rainforest flora is relatively taxonomically rich at the family level, but less so at the species level. Current methods to assess biodiversity based on species numbers fail to adequately capture this richness at higher taxonomic levels. We developed a DNA barcode library for the SE Queensland rainforest flora to support a methodology for biodiversity assessment that incorporates both taxonomic diversity and phylogenetic relationships. We placed our SE Queensland phylogeny based on a three marker DNA barcode within a larger international rainforest barcode library and used this to calculate phylogenetic diversity (PD). We compared phylo-diversity measures, species composition and richness and ecosystem diversity of the SE Queensland rainforest estate to identify which bio subregions contain the greatest rainforest biodiversity, subregion relationships and their level of protection. We identified areas of highest conservation priority. Diversity was not correlated with rainforest area in SE Queensland subregions but PD was correlated with both the percent of the subregion occupied by rainforest and the diversity of regional ecosystems (RE) present. The patterns of species diversity and phylogenetic diversity suggest a strong influence of historical biogeography. Some subregions contain significantly more PD than expected by chance, consistent with the concept of refugia, while others were significantly phylogenetically clustered, consistent with recent range expansions.

AB Both the length of the growing season and the intensity of herbivory often vary along climatic gradients, which may result in divergent selection on plant phenology, and on resistance and tolerance to herbivory. In Sweden, the length of the growing season and the number of insect herbivore species feeding on the perennial herb Lythrum salicaria decrease from south to north. Previous common-garden experiments have shown that northern L.salicaria populations develop aboveground shoots earlier in the summer and finish growth before southern populations do. We tested the hypotheses that resistance and tolerance to damage vary with latitude in L.salicaria and are positively related to the intensity of herbivory in natural populations. We quantified resistance and tolerance of populations sampled along a latitudinal gradient by scoring damage from natural herbivores and fitness in a common-garden experiment in the field and by documenting oviposition and feeding preference by specialist leaf beetles in a glasshouse experiment. Plant resistance decreased with latitude of origin, whereas plant tolerance increased. Oviposition and feeding preference in the glasshouse and leaf damage in the common-garden experiment were negatively related to damage in the source populations. The latitudinal variation in resistance was thus consistent with reduced selection from herbivores towards the northern range margin of L. salicaria. Variation in tolerance may be related to differences in the timing of damage in relation to the seasonal pattern of plant growth, as northern genotypes have developed further than southern have when herbivores emerge in early summer.

AB The Mexican Forest Code establishes structural reference values to differentiate between secondary and old-growth forests and requires a management plan when secondary forests become old-growth and potentially harvestable forests. The implications of this regulation for forest management, restoration, and conservation were assessed in the context of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, which is located in the Yucatan Peninsula. The basal area and stem density thresholds currently used by the legislation to differentiate old-growth from secondary forests are 4 m(2)/ha and 15 trees/ha (trees with a diameter at breast height of >25 cm); however, our research indicates that these values should be increased to 20 m(2)/ha and 100 trees/ha, respectively. Given that a management plan is required when secondary forests become old-growth forests, many landowners avoid forest-stand development by engaging slash-and-burn agriculture or cattle grazing. We present evidence that deforestation and land degradation may prevent the natural regeneration of late-successional tree species of high ecological and economic importance. Moreover, we discuss the results of this study in the light of an ongoing debate in the Yucatan Peninsula between policy makers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), landowners and researchers, regarding the modification of this regulation to redefine the concept of acahual (secondary forest) and to facilitate forest management and restoration with valuable timber tree species.

AB Covariance among plant defense traits is predicted to occur both within and among plant species, potentially leading to characteristic defense syndromes. I examined patterns of variation in prickle density, latex exudation, and tolerance in order to assess whether traits varied between populations, across plant ontogeny, and as phenotypic plasticity in response to water and light limitation and physical damage using the endemic Hawaiian prickly poppy, Argemone glauca, as a model system. Plants produced copious latex, had extremely variable prickle densities, and were generally tolerant of 50 % defoliation. However, expression patterns differed among defense traits. Prickle density was consistent across ontogeny and was not induced by either water limitation or mechanical damage, but was significantly induced under high light conditions. In contrast, latex exudation increased significantly across ontogeny and was reduced by water limitation, but had no response to mechanical damage or light. Prickles, latex, and tolerance differed considerably between populations, suggesting different evolutionary histories for these populations. These disparate patterns indicate that latex and prickles are unlinked within A. glauca, potentially as a result of differences in their function, and providing little evidence that they jointly function as a defense syndrome. Moreover, this study provides the first description patterns of variation for multiple defense traits in an island endemic, and high levels of prickles, latex, and tolerance suggest that A. glauca is well defended against herbivores. Future research in the field will provide additional insights into the functional ecology of these traits in A. glauca.

AB This article contributes to the limited empirical evidence on the determinants of farmers participation decision in agricultural land (land use-modifying) payments for ecosystem services (PES) in developing countries. It examines how farmer and farm characteristics, programme factors, and the institutional context of its implementation determine farmers' decisions to participate in the Equitable Payments for Watershed Services (EPWS) programme in Morogoro, Tanzania, to shed light on participation in land use-modifying PES programmes more widely. The EPWS programme in the Kibungo Jun ward of Morogoro promotes the adoption of sustainable land management practices such as agro-forestry, reforestation and terracing to improve quality and quantity of water for downstream users. We used a multi-method approach to make use of both qualitative and quantitative data. We found that farm size, information, participation of farmers in the programme design and the needed degree of change in land management determined the adoption of sustainable land management practices. To foster the participation of small farmers, attention needs to be paid to the availability and access to information, participation of farmers in the design of programmes, local compatibility of practices, and support for initial costs of adoption.

   TRADE-OFFS; PLANT SIZE; OHALO-II; DOMESTICATION; ORIGINS; MASS
AB The reasons why some plant species were selected as crops and others were abandoned during the Neolithic emergence of agriculture are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that the traits of Fertile Crescent crop progenitors were advantageous in the fertile, disturbed habitats surrounding early settlements and in cultivated fields. We screened functional traits related to competition and disturbance in a group of grass species that were increasingly exploited by early plant gatherers, and that were later domesticated (crop progenitors); and in a set of grass species for which there is archaeological evidence of gathering, but which were never domesticated (wild species). We hypothesised that crop progenitors would have greater seed mass, growth rate, height and yield than wild species, as these traits are indicative of greater competitive ability, and that crop progenitors would be more resilient to defoliation. Our results show that crop progenitors have larger seed mass than wild species, germinate faster and have greater seedling size. Increased seed size is weakly but positively correlated with a higher growth rate, which is primarily driven by greater biomass assimilation per unit leaf area. Crop progenitors also tend to have a taller stature, greater grain yield and higher resilience to defoliation. Collectively, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that adaptations to competition and disturbance gave crop progenitors a selective advantage in the areas surrounding early human settlements and in cultivated environments, leading to their adoption as crops through processes of unconscious selection.

AB In Chile, mediterranean climate conditions only occur in the Central Zone (ChMZ). Despite its small area, this mediterranean climate region (med-region) has been recognised as a hotspot for biodiversity. However, in contrast to the rivers of other med-regions, the rivers in the ChMZ have been studied infrequently, and knowledge of their freshwater biodiversity is scarce and fragmented. We gathered information on the freshwater biodiversity of ChMZ, and present a review of the current knowledge of the principal floral and faunal groups. Existing knowledge indicates that the ChMZ has high levels of endemism, with many primitive species being of Gondwanan origin. Although detailed information is available on most floral groups, most faunal groups remain poorly known. In addition, numerous rivers in the ChMZ remain completely unexplored. Taxonomic specialists are scarce, and the information available on freshwater biodiversity has resulted from studies with objectives that did not directly address biodiversity issues. Research funding in this med-region has a strong applied character and is not focused on the knowledge of natural systems and their biodiversity. Species conservation policies are urgently required in this highly diverse med-region, which is also the most severely impacted and most populated region of the country.

AB Understanding the regional dynamics of plant communities is crucial for predicting the response of plant diversity to habitat fragmentation. However, for fragmented landscapes the importance of regional processes, such as seed dispersal among isolated habitat patches, has been controversially debated. Due to the stochasticity and rarity of among-patch dispersal and colonization events, we still lack a quantitative understanding of the consequences of these processes at the landscape-scale. In this study, we used extensive field data from a fragmented, semi-arid landscape in Israel to parameterize a multi-species incidence-function model. This model simulates species occupancy pattern based on patch areas and habitat configuration and explicitly considers the locations and the shapes of habitat patches for the derivation of patch connectivity. We implemented an approximate Bayesian computation approach for parameter inference and uncertainty assessment. We tested which of the three types of regional dynamics - the metacommunity, the mainland-island, or the island communities type - best represents the community dynamics in the study area and applied the simulation model to estimate the extinction debt in the investigated landscape. We found that the regional dynamics in the patch-matrix study landscape is best represented as a system of highly isolated island' communities with low rates of propagule exchange among habitat patches and consequently low colonization rates in local communities. Accordingly, the extinction rates in the local communities are the main drivers of community dynamics. Our findings indicate that the landscape carries a significant extinction debt and in model projections 33-60% of all species went extinct within 1000 yr. Our study demonstrates that the combination of dynamic simulation models with field data provides a promising approach for understanding regional community dynamics and for projecting community responses to habitat fragmentation. The approach bears the potential for efficient tests of conservation activities aimed at mitigating future losses of biodiversity.

AB Understanding the relative contributions of internal dynamics versus external factors in the process of community assembly is important for establishing guidelines for conservation and restoration of native vegetation. The role of internal dynamics and external factors in the process of community assembly at the local scale is a poorly understood issue in ecology, especially in highly variable environments. We analyse an 82-year spatiotemporal record of vegetation recovering from a history of overgrazing within a semi-arid environment to investigate the relative contribution of internal and external factors on community assembly. Community composition and spatial structure were used as indicators of change over time in four sites within a vegetation reserve, which were subjected to the same environmental constraints, climate and grazing history. The four sites follow remarkably different, asynchronous trajectories characterized by periods of stability interrupted by episodic change. The high variability between sites suggests that initial communities are internally reinforced through random chance events, directing them on different pathways of assembly and self-organization; hence external factors may play a less significant role in long-term community assembly at the local scale than previously believed. These results have important implications for rangeland restoration and conservation in many of the world's semi-arid regions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Both plant traits and plant-pollinator interactions are thought to influence plant mating systems. For hummingbird-pollinated plants, foraging strategy (territorial or traplining) is also expected to influence plant mating. We hypothesize that the traplining behavior of hermits promotes outcrossing, whereas the behavior of non-hermits favours self-incompatibility. Thus, selection is expected to maintain self-incompatibility in plants pollinated by non-hermits. We explore the incidence of self-incompatibility in Neotropical hummingbird-pollinated plants and its association with hummingbird behavior and plant traits. We conducted a literature review (56 species) and performed hand-pollination experiments in 27 hummingbird-pollinated plants in an Atlantic rainforest. We found that self-incompatibility (measured as < 0.3 for the Index of Self-incompatibility [ISI]) occurred in only 33 % of the Neotropical hummingbird-pollinated plants. The interaction of hummingbird and habit type affected ISI, as did phylogenetic relationships. Specifically, herbs pollinated by non-hermits had higher ISI than woody plants pollinated by non-hermits, and herbs pollinated by both hermits and non-hermits. For the Atlantic rainforest plant guild, 30 % of the species were self-incompatible. ISI was higher in herbs than in woody species and increased with plant aggregation but was not dependent on foraging behavior, plant density, or floral display. Although hummingbirds differ in their foraging strategies, these behavioral differences seem to have only a minor influence on the incidence of self-incompatibility. Phylogenetic relatedness seems to be the strongest determinant of mating system in Neotropical hummingbird-pollinated plants.

AB Herbivory can reduce plant fitness, and its effects can be increased by competition. Though numerous studies have examined the joint effects of herbivores and competitors on plant performance, these interactive effects are seldom considered in the context of plant invasions. Here, we examined variation in plant performance within a competitive environment in response to both specialist and generalist herbivores using Chinese tallow as a model species. We combined tallow plants from native and invasive populations to form all possible pairwise combinations, and designated invasive populations as stronger neighbours and native populations as weaker neighbours. We found that when no herbivory was imposed, invasive populations always had higher total biomass than natives, regardless of their neighbours, which is consistent with our assumption of increased competitive ability. Defoliation by either generalist or specialist herbivores suppressed plant growth but the effects of specialists were generally stronger for invasive populations. Invasive populations had their lowest biomass when fed upon by specialists while simultaneously competing with stronger neighbours. The root/shoot ratios of invasive populations were lower than those of native populations under almost all conditions, and invasive plants were taller than native plants overall, especially when herbivores were present, suggesting that invasive populations may adopt an "aboveground first" strategy to cope with herbivory and competition. These results suggest that release from herbivores, especially specialists, improves an invader's performance and helps to increase its competitive ability. Therefore, increasing interspecific competition intensity by planting a stronger neighbour while simultaneously releasing a specialist herbivore may be an especially effective method of managing invasive plants.

AB Even large fragments of tropical forest lose bird species over time. The speed of disappearance and permanence of these losses depend on a variety of factors, but the pattern of species loss appears more universal. We still do not understand the degree to which different mechanisms lead to population declines and local extinction in fragmented tropical landscapes. We review data currently available to evaluate three of the leading hypotheses, which include altered community dynamics producing mesopredator release and indirect effects of elevated herbivore populations; sensitivity of forest birds to altered microclimatic conditions in fragments, and the constraint of poor dispersal ability that reduces connectivity in fragmented landscapes. We find that all three mechanisms require additional study and suggest steps to be taken in future studies.

AB In the Neotropics increased rates of land use and land cover change (LULCC) and a strong deforestation trend in the second half of the twentieth century have caused environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. This study analysed patterns and processes of LULCC and deforestation for the GrijalvaUsumacinta watershed, one of the hydrologically and biologically most important watersheds in southern Mexico in face of the discussion about beginning forest transitions in the Neotropics. Maps of land use and land cover for 1992, 2002 and 2007 derived from satellite and aerial imagery were analysed to test the hypothesis of changing trends on a regional scale. Change rates and probabilities were calculated for two time periods and dominant LULCC processes were identified. LULCC is complex and cannot be explained by the predominant linear deforestation narrative alone. A crucial finding was an unusually high rate of forest degradation for all primary forest types, being 1.7 times the area of forest deforestation; and that deforestation processes occur mainly in secondary forests. Agricultural activities fostered by public policies are the principal drivers for LULCC, among which pastures have the highest impact on deforestation. Deforestation and LULCC rates and probabilities have stagnated, and natural reforestation has increased. Although these trends are essential for the onset of forest transition, deforestation and degradation outweigh by far vegetation regrowth.

AB Submarine caves are considered as a top priority for conservation, but the effects of common pressures are poorly known for these habitats. Here, we examined the effect of recreational human visitation on a selection of submarine caves in a Mediterranean Marine Protected Area (40A degrees 35'40aEuro(3)N; 8A degrees 11'39aEuro(3)E) where diving activities are regulated. Sampling was conducted in visited and not visited caves to assess whether diving activities have a significant effect on cave habitats, what are the components of biodiversity most affected by this disturbance, and its potential effects on spatial heterogeneity of benthic assemblages. Results clearly showed that human visitation could significantly affect spatial patterns of benthic assemblages. Organisms with erect growth forms were significantly more abundant and homogeneously distributed where diving activities are forbidden. An increase in the small-scale heterogeneity of assemblages and a decrease in their three-dimensional structure could be the ultimate consequences of human visitation. The interaction between specific stressors and the patterns of distribution of species and assemblages can drive their spatial heterogeneity also in unique habitats like marine caves, representing an early warning for the development of appropriate management measures.

TI Seed survival on experimental dishes in a central European old-growth

AB Predation of tree seeds can be a major factor structuring plant communities. We present a three year study on tree seed survival on experimental dishes in an old-growth forest in central Europe in Austria. We addressed species specific, spatial and temporal aspects of post-dispersal seed predation. Seeds of Norway spruce Picea abies, European beech Fagus sylvatica, and silver fir Abies alba were exposed on dishes in different types of exclosures which allowed access only to specific guilds of seed predators. Removal experiments were carried out in two old-growth forests and a managed forest (macro-sites), including micro-sites with and without cover of ground vegetation. We conducted the experiment in three consecutive years with a mast year of beech and spruce before the first year of the study. The seed removal experiments were combined with live trapping of small mammals being potential seed predators. Our experiments showed a distinctly different impact of different predator guilds on seed survival on the dishes with highest removal rates of seeds from dishes accessible for small mammals. We observed differing preferences of small mammals for the different tree species. Seed survival in different macro- and micro-habitats were highly variable with lower seed survival in old growth forests. In contrast to our assumption, and in contrast to the satiation hypothesis which assumes higher seed survival in and directly after mast years, seed survival was lower in the year following the mast year of beech when a population peak of small mammals occurred and higher in intermast periods when subsequently small mammal population crashed. This suggests a higher importance of sporadic masting shortly after mast years in intermast periods for establishment of forest trees provided that pollination efficiency is high enough in such years. Combined with the high seed mortality observed after the mast year, this corroborates the important role of seed predation for forest dynamics. An altered synchrony or asynchrony of masting of different tree species and changed masting frequencies through climate change may thus lead to strong and non-linear effects on forest dynamics.

AB 1 Boundaries between woodlots and agricultural habitats are numerous in temperate agricultural landscapes and influence ecological processes in both woodlots and agricultural habitats.
   2 We aimed to determine how far the species assemblage of ground beetles in woodlot and open habitats was influenced by the presence of the woodlot-field boundary.
   3 We studied the distribution of ground beetles on both sides of the boundaries of four woodlots along transects of pitfall traps (n = 140). The depth of edge influence (i.e. the distance from the boundary at which the presence of the boundary has no more significant influence) on the species assemblage of ground beetles in each woodlot and in each agricultural habitat was determined with nonlinear canonical analysis of principal coordinates, an ordination method that is followed by nonlinear regression of the principal coordinates on distance from the boundary.
   4 The depth of edge influence on the species assemblages of ground beetles was asymmetrical relative to the boundary: it was generally higher and had higher variability in open habitats (14.4 +/- 12.3 m) than in woodlots (4.9 +/- 2.3 m). Species assemblages of ground beetles in edges were a mix between both adjacent species assemblages. Edge effects in woodlots were deeper in the woodlots exhibiting a deeper penetration of open habitat species. Symmetrically, edge effects in open habitat were deeper in the open habitats with a deeper diffusion of forest species into the open habitat.
   5 Forest ground beetles were not threatened by edge effects. Rather, edge effects are likely to benefit agriculture, mostly through the dispersal of predatory forest species into agricultural fields.

AB Sloths are arboreal mammals strictly dependent upon forested habitats. The southern part of the state of Bahia in northeastern Brazil harbors important forest remnants and the highest genetic diversity known for the maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus), an endangered species endemic to the Atlantic forest. Large extents of cacao agroforests (cabrucas) connected to forest patches mitigate the effects of fragmentation in this region. We radio-tracked three maned sloths during 40 months in a cabruca at the vicinity of Una Biological Reserve, southern Bahia, and estimated their home range using two commonly employed estimators (minimum convex polygon (MCP) and kernel). Overall cabrucas comprised a significant portion of the home range of the three study animals (MCP: 7-100%) and at least a third of the areas of more intensive use (kernel: 27-99%). The tagged sloths used cabrucas more than expected according to the availability of this habitat in their home range and in the surrounding landscape. In addition to the tagged individuals, maned sloths were observed five times in the study area, twice in cabrucas. Eleven tree species present in cabrucas,me used as food sources by maned sloths. Results indicate that biologically rich cacao agroforests immersed in a landscape still largely composed of native forests, as is the case here, can provide habitat for the maned sloth. This finding spells good news for the conservation of this species, as southern Bahia is one of the most important strongholds for the maned sloth. However, further actions are necessary to protect the species from local extinction, including active management of protected areas, forest fragments, cabrucas and pastures in an integrated, landscape-level manner.

AB In this study we use allometric models combined with tree ring analysis to estimate carbon stocks and sequestration in the aboveground coarse wood biomass (AGWB) of wetland forests in the Pantanal, located in central South America. In four 1-ha plots in stands characterized by the pioneer tree species Vochysia divergens Pohl (Vochysiaceae) forest inventories (trees >= 10 cm diameter at breast height, D) have been performed and converted to estimates of AGWB by two allometric models using three independent parameters (D, tree height H and wood density rho). We perform a propagation of measurement errors to estimate uncertainties in the estimates of AGWB. Carbon stocks of AGWB vary from 7.8 +/- 1.5 to 97.2 +/- 14.4 MgC ha(-1) between the four stands. From models relating tree ages determined by dendrochronological techniques to C-stocks in AGWB we derived estimates for C-sequestration which differs from 0.50 +/- 0.03 to 3.34 +/- 0.31 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1). Maps based on geostatistic techniques indicate the heterogeneous spatial distribution of tree ages and C-stocks of the four studied stands. This distribution is the result of forest dynamics due to the colonizing and retreating of V. divergens and other species associated with pluriannual wet and dry episodes in the Pantanal, respectively. Such information is essential for the management of the cultural landscape of the Pantanal wetlands.

AB Negative density-dependent demographic processes operating at post-dispersal seed, seedling, and juvenile stages are the dominant explanation for the coexistence of high numbers of tree species in tropical forests. At adult stages, the effect of pollinators and pre-dispersal fruit predators are often dependent on the density or abundance of flowers and fruit in the canopy, but each have opposite effects on individual realized reproduction. We studied the effect of density on total and mature fruit set and pre-dispersal predation rates within individual tree canopies in a common canopy tree species, Jacaranda copaia in a 50-ha forest census plot in central Panama. We sampled all reproductive sized trees in the plot (n = 188) across three years and estimated fruit set and predation rates. Population-wide pre-dispersal seed predation averaged between 6-37% across years. Using linear mixed effects models, we found that increased density and fecundity of conspecific neighbours increased focal tree fruit set, but also the rate of pre-dispersal predation. An interaction between individual and neighbourhood fruit production predicted lower predation rates at high individual and neighbourhood fecundities, which suggests predator satiation at high fruit abundance levels. However, the rate at which fruit set increased with conspecific neighbour fruit production was greater than the rate at which fruit were lost to predation, resulting in an overall positive effect of neighbour density on mature fruit production in focal trees. Our results run counter to the expectation of a uniformly negative effect of density across all life stages in tropical trees and suggest further exploration of the role of spatial clumping, pollen dispersal limitation, and predation at pre-dispersal adult stages in maintenance of species diversity in plant communities.

AB Recent studies suggest that species with similar functional traits will have similar effects on ecosystems, but evidence for redundancy of species impacts is limited. Here we use a long-term experiment to gain insight into functional relationships within a desert rodent community. Experimental removal of kangaroo rats, Dipodomys spp., coupled with the recent, serendipitous colonization of a single species of large pocket mouse Chaetodipus baileyi yielded treatments that differed in the diversity of large granivorous rodents present. We evaluated functional overlap of C. baileyi and the other resident large granivores (i.e. the kangaroo rats) by comparing total energy use of granivorous rodents and total abundance and species richness of small granivores across treatments before and after the arrival of C. baileyi. We found that C. baileyi almost completely compensated for the changes in these key ecosystem-level properties caused by kangaroo rat removal, but it differentially impacted the population dynamics of individual small granivorous rodent species. Thus, its effects were largely complementary, rather than redundant, to those of the missing kangaroo rats. Although short-term or single-measure analyses may suggest redundancy, our results support the longstanding dictum that niches of coexisting species are often similar but rarely, if ever, identical.

AB The fragmented island realm of Oceania includes a relatively small proportion of the world's tropical forests, but those forests support unusual richness of narrowly endemic species. In common with tropical forests across most of the world, tropical forests in Oceania are declining due to factors associated with increasing human population size, economic drivers and more intensive exploitation. In parts of Oceania, forests are being cleared at unsustainable rates, and replaced with far simpler ecosystems of timber or food crops. To a small degree, the present-day biodiversity of tropical forests in some parts of Oceania may be predisposed to such disturbance, given a history of natural disturbance (particularly through cyclones), and of smaller-scale slash-and-burn agriculture or landscape-scale burning. But, in most places, the current intensity, scale and/or rate of modification far surpass their precedents, and biodiversity is consequently diminishing. Tropical forests in Australia may be an exception to this trend, with now reasonably effective protection. However, more so than for tropical forests in most other continents, the major biodiversity conservation challenges for tropical forests in Oceania are extrinsic. Introduced plants, animals and diseases have collapsed ecological communities through much of Oceania, homogenising the biota from a series of highly distinctive and localised species assemblages to a more impoverished set of ubiquitous disturbance-tolerant exotic species. In many islands, this simplification has occurred regardless of the extent of native forest remaining, such that retention and reservation of primary forest is an insufficient conservation action. The fate of biodiversity in Oceania is also likely to be much affected by climate change, an unbalanced consequence given the region's relatively small contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. Future hope for biodiversity conservation in tropical forests of Oceania lies in the renewed application of some traditional management constraints, the appropriate delivery of international support (such as may be available through carbon markets), improved quarantine processes, and through some protection naturally offered by the remote scattering of the islands that comprise Oceania.

AB The southern Yucatan has been identified as a deforestation hot spot. Land-change studies document the extent of forest loss at a regional scale, and case studies provide insights into the drivers of deforestation at the household level. Those studies have paid minimal attention to sub-regional analysis, especially to discrete land-management units above the household level. This analysis of upland forest change addresses the range of variation in deforestation among 96 ejidos (communal lands) and the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, the two dominant land-tenure and land-management units in the region. Satellite imagery, census, and land-tenure data are used to establish the extent and location of deforestation patterns, and multivariate techniques are employed to identify biophysical and socioeconomic variables that explain such patterns. Results show that, for the 1984-1993 period, deforestation in the southern Yucatan was not as prevalent as implied by its hot spot designation. Three clusters of deforestation are identified. A logistic regression analysis establishes that size of forest holdings, population growth, and location in the precipitation gradient correlate with ejidos that experienced higher deforestation rates than the rest of the land-tenure units. For the 1993-2000 period, conservation programs and changes in the economic context of this "hollow frontier" contributed to reduce deforestation rates and extent. This analysis illustrates the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of much tropical forest change and caution that it should bring to simple formulations of modeling this change and prescribing policies to control it.

AB In Southern Africa the last ten years have seen a rather dramatic shift in donor and state interest and funding from 'community conservation' to 'transfrontier conservation'. The new trend broadens the aim of conservation development interventions to also include interstate cooperation. The article critically analyzes this development within a wider shift in neoliberal politics. It is argued that this broader shift helped create the right 'enabling environment' for the transfrontier conservation discourse to be presented as an all-embracing and unifying ideological 'model of meaning'. Moreover, underlying neoliberalism's contemporary political conduct is a strong reassertion and the actual neoliberalisation of the state. It is this move that has truly enabled the 'transfrontier' to revive the telos of conservation in Southern Africa.

AB We analyzed indices of gap dynamics, i.e. gap formation and gap closure rates as well as turnover rates, in a montane conifer forest in the temperate zone and asked: (1) Are the characteristics of gap dynamics comparable with those of other temperate forests? (2) Do gap dynamics exhibit temporal trends, and (3) if so, are they related to recent climate change? We also addressed methodological issues concerning the differences observed at differing temporal and spatial scales of the used datasets. Thus, we asked further how the indices of gap dynamics are influenced (4) by differences in the length of observation periods and (5) by differences in gap size categories included in the study?
   The study area was located in the near-natural Picea abies forests in the core zone of the Harz National Park on the north-eastern slopes of Mt. Brocken, Germany. From this area, aerial photographs from the last 60 yrs (1945, 1991, 2000, 2003) were analyzed by GIS techniques. Total gap area, number of gaps, gap size and area-based turnover rate, rotation time, gap formation and gap closure rate were calculated and correlated with climate variables.
   The total gap area varied between 10.9 ha and 19.0 ha for the study area of 225.2 ha between the different years. Similarly, the median of the gap size was 155.6 m(2) and 87.0 m(2) in 1945 and 2003, respectively. A rotation time of 228 yrs was calculated for the study area. Area-based turnover rates and gap formation rates increased with time, while mean gap size decreased. The most frequently recorded gaps were those in the category <100 m(2). In particular, small gaps at the level of single trees (<= 40 m(2)) became more frequent in the last decade and showed a higher gap formation rate than larger gaps. Temperature was significantly related to both turnover and gap closure rates.
   In conclusion, for the near-natural spruce stands at Mt. Brocken indices of gap dynamics were of a magnitude comparable to those described from other forest types in the temperate zone. However, the indices of gap dynamics increased with time, which coincided with increasing temperatures over the last few decades. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The golden-headed lion tamarin Leontopithecus chrysomelas occurs in the Atlantic forest of southern Bahia, Brazil, where shade-cocoa agroforestry (known as cabruca) predominates. The economic decline of the cocoa industry has caused many landowners to convert cabruca into cattle pasture or diversify their plantations with other crops. These and prior anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat fragmentation are threatening lion tamarin persistence. For some lion tamarin groups, cabruca comprises a large part of their home range. Considering these factors, the maintenance of the biological diversity in cabruca favorable to golden-headed lion tamarins is of considerable interest to their long-term survival. Here we identify plant species that provide food and sleeping sites for the lion tamarins and examine their occurrence in cabruca plantations, in order to investigate alternatives for conservation management practices that benefit both lion tamarins and cabruca. We determined the total number of trees and the frequency of individuals and species used for food and sleeping sites by lion tamarins in Una Biological Reserve, Bahia, from 1998 to 2006. We used this information to compare the richness and frequency of use across habitats (cabruca, mature and secondary) and to create a ranking index considering various components of a tree species' utility to the lion tamarins. Lion tamarins used 155 tree species, 93 for food and 93 for sleeping sites. Fifty-five species were ranked as 'Extremely Valuable,' eight as 'Valuable' and 92 as 'Of Interest.' Of 48 families, Myrtaceae and Sapotaceae were used the most. Cabruca contained fewer individual trees used by lion tamarins, but the highest frequency of use per tree compared with other habitats, indicating the large influence of single trees in these plantations. Using the key tree species identified in our study in the management of cabruca would be of considerable benefit to the long-term survival of lion tamarins.

AB We implemented a replicated before-after-control-impact (BACI) experiment to quantify vertebrate response in native forest patches to a major change in the surrounding exotic Radiata Pine (Pinus radiata) plantation. We contrasted vertebrate occupancy of patches of native eucalypt forest where the surrounding stands of exotic Radiata Pine (Pinus radiata) were clearfelled (termed "treatment patches") with matched "control patches" where surrounding pine stands remained unlogged. Different species of arboreal marsupials varied in their response to our experimental treatments. The Common Ringtail Possum was unaffected by cutting of the surrounding pine stands, whereas all sightings of the Mountain Brushtail Possum were in control patches. For birds, species richness was significantly reduced by 4-9 species in treatment patches. Birds with cup and dome nests were those negatively affected by the cutting of the surrounding pine stands. They may be susceptible to altered microclimatic conditions or increasing levels of nest predation when the surrounding pine matrix is clearfelled. Our study emphasized how the biota inhabiting retained patches of native forest within plantation landscapes can be changed when stands of surrounding Radiata Pine are clearfelled. In the case of birds, more species will be maintained within eucalypt patches if logging is scheduled so that not all the surrounding pine plantation is clearfelled at once.

AB Despite their potential to provide mechanistic explanations of rates of seed dispersal and seed fate, the functional and numerical responses of seed predators have never been explicitly examined within this context. Therefore, we investigated the numerical response of a small-mammal seed predator, Heteromys desmarestianus, to disturbance-induced changes in food availability and evaluated the degree to which removal and fate of seeds of eight tree species in a lowland tropical forest in Belize were related to the functional response of H. desmarestianus to varying seed densities. Mark-recapture trapping was used to estimate abundance of H. desmarestianus in six 0.5-ha grids from July 2000 to September 2002. Fruit availability and seed fate were estimated in each grid, and two experiments nested within the grids were used to determine (1) the form of the functional response for nine levels of fruit density (2-32 fruits/m(2)), (2) the removal rate and handling times, and (3) the total proportion of fruits removed. The total proportion of fruits removed was determined primarily by the numerical response of H. desmarestianus to fruit availability, while removal rates and the proportion of seeds eaten or cached were related primarily to the form of the functional response. However, the numerical and functional responses interacted; H. desmarestianus showed strong spatial and temporal numerical responses to total fruit availability, and their density relative to fruit availability resulted in variation in the form of the functional response. Types I, II, and III functional responses were observed, as were density-independent responses, and these responses varied both among and within fruit species. The highest proportions of fruits were eaten when the Type III functional response was detected, which was when fruit availability was high relative to H. desmarestianus population density. Numerous idiosyncratic influences on seed fate have been documented, but our results indicate that shifts in the numerical and functional responses of seed predators to seasonal and interannual variation in seed availability potentially provide a general mechanistic explanation for patterns of removal and fate for vertebrate-dispersed seeds.

AB We tested the hypothesis that microhabitat variables, abundance of terrestrial rodents, and microhabitat selection patterns of terrestrial rodents vary between the cool-dry and warm-wet season in the Atlantic forest of Brazil. We selected variables associated with ecological factors potentially important to terrestrial rodents (physical structure of litter and woody debris, and arthropod availability) and established 25 small, independent sampling units covering 36 ha of a homogenous, mature Atlantic forest patch. Litter humidity and height, amount of small woody debris, arthropod availability, and terrestrial rodent abundance increased, whereas the quantity of large woody debris decreased in the warm-wet season. Greater spatial segregation among terrestrial rodents also was observed in this season, especially between morphologically similar species. The distribution of 3 of the 4 most common terrestrial rodents was influenced by microhabitat variables in at least I of the seasons, and these species also differed in their pattern of microhabitat selection between seasons. In general, the amount of small woody debris and litter humidity were more important for the microscale distribution of terrestrial rodents in the cool-dry season, whereas in the mild warm-wet season species distributions were associated with food availability or were not clearly influenced by the measured variables. The patterns of microhabitat selection by 3 common terrestrial rodents, which were associated with features that characterize old-growth forest, may be responsible for their vulnerability to forest fragmentation.

AB Dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) are conspicuous components in most terrestrial ecosystems, performing important ecological functions and services. Being sensitive to several types of disturbance, they have been successfully used as indicators of habitat change. Dung beetle communities in tropical rainforests have been well studied, but considerably less information is available for tropical dry forests. In this study I sampled dung beetles in two undisturbed habitats, deciduous forest and semideciduous forest, and two disturbed habitats, secondary forest and open area habitat, in the Chamela-Cuixmala region of western Mexico. Dung beetle species with high indicator value for each habitat were identified. Beetle abundance, observed species richness and estimated species richness were similar in the three forest habitats, but significantly lower in the open area habitat. A more detailed analysis of species-specific abundances in the three forest habitats revealed some differences. Transects of one of the undisturbed habitats, the deciduous forest, were more similar to the non-adjacent transects of disturbed secondary forest, than to the adjacent undisturbed semideciduous forest transects. Unlike studies in other tropical sites that have found a decrease in equitability in Scarabaeinae assemblages between undisturbed forest and disturbed habitat (particularly open habitats), in the Chamela-Cuixmala region all four habitats showed similar low equitability in community structure, with two or three very dominant species.

AB Habitat fragmentation is a severe threat to tropical biotas, but its long-term effects are poorly understood. We evaluated longer-term changes in the abundance of larger (> 1 kg) mammals in fragmented and intact rainforest and in riparian "corridors" in tropical Queensland, with data from 190 spotlighting surveys conducted in 1986-1987 and 2000-2007. In 1986-1987 when most fragments were already 20-50 years old, mammal assemblages differed markedly between fragmented and intact forest. Most vulnerable were lemuroid ringtail possums (Hemibelideus lemuroides), followed by Lumboltz's tree-kangaroos (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) and Herbert River ringtail possums (Pseudocheirus herbertensis). Further changes were evident 20 years later. Mammal species richness feel significantly in fragments, and the abundances of 4 species, coppery brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula johnstoni), green ringtail possums (Pseudochirops archeri) red-legged pademelons (Thylogale stigmatica), and tree-kangaroos, declined significantly. The most surprising finding was that the lemuroid ringtail, a strict rainforest specialist, apparently recolonized one fragment, despite a 99.98% decrease in abundance in fragments and corridors. A combination of factors, including long-term fragmentation effects, shifts in the surrounding matrix vegetation, and recurring cyclone disturbance, appear to underlie these dynamic changes in mammal assemblages.

AB The scattered and dwindling Polylepis woodlands of the high Andean global hotspot have been identified as being of particular importance to biodiversity conservation, and yet little is known of the make-up of their faunal communities, how these vary across landscapes, and how well species might tolerate matrix/edge habitats. We examined the bird communities and vegetation characteristics of Polylepis woodlands and the surrounding matrix habitats at three sites in the Cordillera Vilcanota, southern Peru (3,400-4,500 m). The vegetation structure of woodlands varied significantly across the three sites but all were dominated by two Polylepis tree species, with mossy ground cover. Matrix habitats were treeless and dominated by ground-level puna grass-steppe or boulder scree vegetation. Bird species richness and diversity, encounter rates and the number of globally-threatened and restricted-range bird species were consistently higher in the Polylepis forests, than in matrix habitat. We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to identify habitat gradients across the landscape, and to classify bird species according to their association with Polylepis, the matrix or Polylepis-matrix interface. There were few matrix-restricted bird species, but around half the bird community, including fourteen threatened or restricted-range species, were Polylepis-dependant. Many of these species had very narrow niches. The Polylepis-matrix interface was dominated by species traditionally considered invasive ecological generalists. Our study illustrates the overriding importance of Polylepis interior habitats, indicating that conservation strategies for high Andean birds must focus on patch size maintenance/enlargement, enhancement of within-patch habitat quality, and efforts to safeguard connectivity of suitable habitat across what is essentially an inhospitable puna/scree matrix.

AB Forests fragmentation reduces the density of natural plant populations forming patches of the remaining individuals. one of the biotic interactions that can be affected by forest fragmentation and is poorly studied is seed predation. We determined the effects of forest frag- mentation on seed and fruit predation in Ceiba aesculifolia by comparing trees in continuous forest with trees in fragmented forest. We compared the following variables: (a) frequency of fruit predation by Collie's squirrel (Sciurus colliaei) in each habitat; (b) frequency of the cotton-staining bug seed predator (Dysdercus, Orden Hemiptera) in each habitat; (c) the effect of seed predation on germination frequency and time; and (d) the effect of different life stages of Dysdercus on seed viability. in continuous habitat, 100% of the trees presented fruits with squirrel predation while only 34% of trees in fragmented habitats presented fruit predation. In continuous forest 27% of the trees contained fruits with the seed predator Dysdercus, while only 2% of the trees in fragmented forest presented Dysdercus. The initial weight of damaged seeds was greater than seeds that were not damaged indicating that seed predators select heavier seeds to feed upon. Frequency of seed germination was affected by different life stages; pre-adults decreased germination significantly more than nymphs and adults. Seed predation significantly increased the time it took for germination to occur. Our study shows that forest fragmentation significantly affects predation patterns of squirrels and cotton-staining bugs. Reduction of natural seed predators in forest fragments may have long-term consequences on forest structure and diversity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diurnal raptors may be highly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances. We evaluated the diversity and abundance of diurnal raptors at an Atlantic Forest-cerrado transition zone in relation to two habitat types (forest fragments and open habitats) and to urbanization, comparing natural open and forested habitats with corresponding habitats within a large urban area. We sampled 80 points, 20 in each of four habitats (semi-natural and urban forests, semi-natural and urban open areas), during 12 months. Diurnal raptors recorded (21 species) included only three out of 10 species with some level of threat in the region. Forested habitats had more species (17) than open habitats (12). Urban areas had only 14 (67%) species, whereas semi-natural areas had all 21 species. Diurnal raptors were as abundant in urban areas as in semi-natural areas in spite of a loss in species richness in urban areas. A re-analysis without Caracara plancus showed that urban areas had a lower mean number of individuals per point than semi-natural areas. Overall species richness usually fluctuated from 14 to 16 species, being slightly higher between January and May than in other months. Overall abundance of diurnal raptors was much higher during summer than during winter. Local extinction may have already occurred for some species of diurnal raptors in the region and will probably shortly include several others. At least C. plancus, a habitat generalist, requires further studies and eventually management actions, since it is able to reach high population numbers in urbanized areas. Furthermore, highly sensitive species that were not recorded require further investigation regarding their conservation status.

AB Phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental variation occurs at all levels of organization and across temporal scales within plants. However, the magnitude and functional significance of plasticity is largely unexplored in perennial species. We measured the plasticity of leaf- and shoot-level physiological, morphological and developmental traits in nursery-grown Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh. individuals subjected to different nutrient and water availabilities. We also examined the extent to which nutrient and water availability influenced the relationships between these traits and productivity. Populus deltoides responded to changes in resource availability with high plasticity in shoot-level traits and moderate plasticity in leaf-level traits. Although shoot-level traits generally correlated strongly with productivity across fertilization and irrigation treatments, few leaf-level traits correlated with productivity, and the relationships depended on the resource examined. In fertilized plants, leaf nitrogen concentration was negatively correlated with productivity, suggesting that growth, rather than enhanced leaf quality, is an important response to fertilization in this species. With the exception of photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency, traits associated with resource conservation (leaf senescence rate, water-use efficiency and leaf mass per area) were uncorrelated with short-term productivity in nutrient- and water-stressed plants. Our results suggest that plasticity in shoot-level growth traits has a greater impact on plant productivity than does plasticity in leaf-level traits and that the relationships between traits and productivity are highly resource dependent.

AB Plant-animal interactions, and in particular the processes of seed predation and dispersal, are crucial for tree regeneration and forest dynamics. A novel and striking case of interaction between a dung beetle (Thorectes lusitanicus) and two Quercus species (Q. suber and Q. canariensis) in forests of southern Spain is presented here.
   During the autumn, T. lusitanicus beetles (endemic to the southern Iberian Peninsula) bury and feed on single-seeded fruits (acorns) of Quercus, with important ecological implications.
   Field experiments found differences in the removal rate of acorns by T. lusitanicus, depending on the type of microsite within the forest, the species of oak, the exclosure of large herbivores, and the forest site.
   Acorn consumption by T lusitanicus was studied under laboratory conditions, confirming for the first time that this dung beetle is a legitimate seed predator.
   In addition, some buried acorns can be abandoned partially predated or even intact, and emerge as seedlings; thus, T. lusitanicus also has a potential role as secondary seed disperser.

AB Although ants perform many critical functions in forested ecosystems, little is known about how they respond to timber harvesting, especially in temperate systems. We examined ground-foraging ant communities and 11 forest characteristics in temperate conifer forests of southwestern Oregon, USA that ranged in age from 5 to 427 years. Seven forest characteristics were related to stand age and were summarized using principal components analysis (PCA). In this case study, species richness was nearly three times higher in young clearcuts compared to closed-canopy and old stands, and worker number was highest in young stands, lowest in closed-canopy stands, and intermediate in old stands. Using stepwise multiple regression, we found that both species richness and worker number were significantly related to PCA axis 1, which represented the environmental changes that accompany stand development, and canopy variability. Though species richness was high in recently logged stands, our study suggests that, in this system, the ant community does not resemble those found in mature forests until over 100 years following disturbance. Because ants modify their environment and perform ecosystem functions like seed dispersal, the alteration of ant communities may cascade through other parts of ecosystems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Although fire is an annual occurrence in savanna systems and is widely used as a tool in conservation management, the effects of fire on biodiversity remain poorly understood. This study investigated the response of ant assemblages, a key component of invertebrate diversity, to burning in two dominant savanna ecosystems (spinifex uplands and sandplain) in the Australian semi-arid tropics. A total of 180 pitfall traps were established in each habitat and each sampling period (wet and dry season). We collected a total of 89 046 ants from 18 genera, representing 126 species. The response of ant assemblages to fire varied with habitat type. We relate this response to habitat-specific fire induced differences in microhabitat structure and the vertical distribution of biomass. There were large differences in assemblage composition in the spinifex habitat, where vegetation composition and structure varied considerably between burnt and unburnt sites. In contrast, assemblages were largely resilient to single fire events in the sandplain, where vegetation change following fire was less pronounced. This study highlights the need for conservation managers to be aware of how different habitats respond to fire and what the consequences of different management actions might be.

AB Tropical forest ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon balance. Depending on age and land use, they can act as carbon sources, sinks, or be in approximate balance, but it is uncertain if global environmental changes are forcing these ecosystems outside their natural range of variation. We asked the question of whether or not the net carbon flux of a tropical primary forest, which should be in balance over the long term, is within the expected range of natural variation. A simple Bayesian hypothesis testing method was used to address this question for primary forests in the Porce region of Colombia. Net ecosystem production (NEP) was measured in this forest in a set of 33 permanent plots from 2000 to 2002 in 2, 1-year intervals. Our estimate of NEP ranged between -4.03 and 2.22 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for the two intervals. This range was compared with a priori defined range of natural variation estimated from the ecosystem model STANDCARB, which estimated spatial and temporal variation due to gap dynamics. The prior range of variation was estimated between -1.5 and 1.5 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). The observed data on NEP did not provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that these forests are in C balance. We concluded that the ecosystem is likely behaving within its range of natural variation, but measurement uncertainties were a major limitation to finding evidence to reject the null hypothesis. A literature review of C flux studies in the tropics revealed that about half of the observations could be explained by gap dynamics alone, while significant C sinks have only been observed during La Nina years, with contrasting results in other tropical forests. In conclusion, observational data of carbon fluxes do not appear to provide direct evidence for a significant carbon sink in some sites in the tropics.

AB Gastropod shells are limited resources for most hermit crab species, acting as primary factors in various aspects of their biology. To investigate the efficacy of different behavioral tactics adopted for their acquisition (locomotion, attendance at shell-supplying sites, interactions with conspecifics in aggregation) we conducted observations and experiments at a salt marsh in New England (USA). Locomotion, fast and meandering, significantly increased the chances of encountering empty shells and conspecifics. However, shell exchanges were rare. Simulated gastropod predation sites quickly attracted a larger number of hermit crabs than the other shell-supplying sites tested (live and dead conspecifics, live snails) and induced the rapid occupancy of all the empty shells offered, usually by the first crabs arriving at the site. Aggregations seemed not to function as shell exchange markets, as previously suggested for several other species. In the short run, exploitation seems to be more efficient for the acquisition of new shells by Pagurus longicarpus. In the long run, it is the density of nondestructive gastropod predators that regulates the availability of new shells of good quality in the pool available to this hermit crab species.

AB The effects of El Nino (EN) and La Nina (LN) events upon marine organisms inhabiting the Eastern Pacific coast have been widely studied in recent years, concentrating primarily on changes in species composition and on population size. In this study, using somatic growth rates as metabolic response variables, we evaluated the mortality rates of coastal fishes inhabiting a central Chilean upwelling marine ecosystem in the South Pacific between 1990 and 2003. Four coastal fish species belonging to different trophic levels (one herbivore, one omnivore, and two carnivores) were analyzed. In all species, the estimated cohort somatic growth rates were low for those recruited during EN and high for those recruited during LN events. Annual cohort mortality rates were highest during EN events and lower during LN and transitional years. We propose that productivity (as a bottom-up driver) acts as a primary exogenous factor upon annual cohort mortality rates. We also propose that a plausible mechanism underlying this process is the negative effect the low somatic growth rates may have on fish ecological attributes such as their competitive abilities, condition factors, and predation risks, which ultimately may affect their fitness.

AB We examined the postdispersal fate of large seeds (>= 5 mm) dispersed by chimpanzees in all afromontane forest to evaluate aspects of the effetiveness of seed dispersal by chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes. We assessed the influence of six microhabitat characteristics oil seed persistence and germination in seeds dispersed in chimpanzee feces and "wadgcs." A total of 257 fecal samples and 56 wadges were located over a 4-mo period by tracking a semi-habituated chimpanzee community on day follows. Forty-nine (19.1%) of the fecal samples contained large seeds from five different tree species. The majority of fecal samples with seeds contained seeds front the mature forest tree Olea capensis (Oleaceae) (83.7%). Forty-two wadges (75%) contained seeds from the mature forest tree Syzygium guineense (Myrtaceae). Seeds were monitored at their deposition site for removal and germination up to 49 d Following deposition. We collected data oil the microhabitat surrounding each fecal and wadge sample. Multivariate analyses indicated that while fecal and wadge samples were nor clustered into particular microhabitats, there was little overlap in the microhabitats in which wadges and fecal samples were deposited. Significantly more seeds persisted over 49 d in wadges (67.9%) than in feces (30.3%). Elevation was the only microhabitat variable determined to have a significant influence oil seed persistence, whereas slope was determined to have a significant influence oil germination.

AB Species from productive and unproductive habitats differ inherently in their relative growth rate (RGR) and a wide range of correlated quantitative traits. We investigated the genetic basis of this trait complex, and specifically assessed whether it is under the control of just one or a few genes that can act as 'master switches` by simultaneously affecting a range of traits in the complex. To address this problem, we crossed two Hordeum spontaneum lines originating from two habitats that differ in productivity. The F-3 offspring, in which parental alleles are present in different combinations due to recombination and segregation, was analysed for RGR and its underlying components ( leaf area ratio, unit leaf rate, photosynthesis, respiration), as well as a number of other physiological and morphological parameters. For this intra-specific comparison, we found a complex of positively and negatively correlated traits, which was quite similar to what is generally observed across species. A quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis showed three major and one minor QTL for RGR. Most other variables of the growth-trait complex showed fewer QTLs that were typically scattered over various locations on the genome. Thus, at least in H. spontaneum, we found no evidence for regulation of the trait complex by one or two master switches.

AB Question: How do tree seedlings differ in their responses to drought and fire under contrasting light conditions in a tropical seasonal forest? Location: Mae Klong Watershed Research Station, 100-900 m a.s.l, Kanchanaburi Province, western Thailand. Method: Seedlings of six trees, Dipterocarpus alatus, D. turbinatus, Shorea siamensis, Pterocarpus macrocarpus,Xylia xylocarpa var. kerrii and Sterculia macrophylla, were planted in a gap and under the closed canopy. For each light condition, we applied (1) continuous watering during the dry season (W); (2) ground fire during the dry season (F); (3) no watering/no fire (intact, 1). Seedling survival and growth were followed. Results: Survival and growth rate were greater in the gap than under the closed canopy for all species, most dramatically for S. siamensis and P. macrocarpus. Dipterocarpus alatus and D. turbinatus had relatively high survival under the closed canopy, and watering during the dry season resulted in significantly higher survival rates for these two species. Watering during the dry season resulted in higher growth rates for five species. All seedlings of D. alatus and D. turbinatus failed to re-sprout and died after fire. The survival rates during the dry season and after the fire treatment were higher for the seedlings grown in the canopy gap than in the shade for S. siamensis, P. macrocarpus, X. xylocarpa var. kerrii and S. macrophylla. The seedlings of these species in the canopy gap had higher allocation to below-ground parts than those under the closed canopy, which may support the ability to sprout after fire. Conclusions: The light conditions during, the rainy season greatly affect seedling survival and resistance to fire during the subsequent dry season. Our results suggest differentiation among species in terms of seedling adaptations to shade, drought and fire.

AB Understory habitat heterogeneity is believed to be a factor promoting maintenance of species diversity in forest communities. The influence of over storey species identity on resource availability and variation in composition of advanced regeneration was studied in a temperate rain forest in southern Chile. The forest overstorey was dominated by the broadleaved evergreens Laureliopsis philippiana, Aextoxicon punctatum, Eucryphia cordifolia and Nothofagus dombeyi. Availabilities of diffuse light, nitrogen, phosphorous and calcium were measured under these four over storey species, as was nutrient content of leaf litter. Advanced regeneration was sampled in plots beneath each over storey species, and results analyzed by ordination. There were significant differences in light transmission, nutritional content of leaf litter and availability of N-NO3 and P beneath the four species. Nevertheless, all nutrients showed low availability due to low mineralization and high immobilization. Ordination results indicate that the composition of advanced regeneration under N. dombeyi and L. philippiana differed from the composition of regeneration under A. punctatum or E. cordifolia. The ordination suggested that light level explained a large proportion of compositional variation. We propose that species regenerating in the understory differed more in shade tolerance than in nutritional requirements, light being the most limiting resource in the understorey.

AB This study responds to the demand for recultivation of degraded land areas in Central Amazonia and the desire to add long-lived trees for high-quality timber production to polyculture plantation systems. Carapa guianensis Aubl. from two monocultures (ages 4 and 17 years) and a primary forest were studied. The growth dynamics of the 4-year-old trees revealed 11 to 15 increments marked by tangentially oriented vessel rows. By the 5(th) year, parenchyma bands indicate mature wood. Monthly labelling by pin-markers revealed short dormancy periods during the dry season. The early formation of mature wood is shown by the pattern of percentage composition of vessels, fibres, and parenchyma. Fibre length reaches its plateau of 1.45-1.59 mm at about four years. Fibre lengths and average density (0.63 g/cm(3)) of plantation-grown trees correspond to those of primary forest trees. According to this study, Carapa guianensis can be recommended for plantations in order to produce high-quality timber with a decorative heartwood.

AB Littorina unifasciata is a small littorinid snail found at mid- to high-shore levels on rocky shores in Australia. Much has been published on patterns of distribution and abundance of L. unifasciata on different shores, at different heights on the shore and in different microhabitats, but there is little information on patterns of aggregation of this species. Nevertheless, this species tends to form very distinct clusters when emersed during low tide. This study is a quantification of aggregation by L. unifasciata on different shores, levels on the shore and in different microhabitats. The use of patches of habitat of different size during low tide and high tide is also examined. Aggregation was variable from time to time and place to place and individual snails did not show a consistent tendency to aggregate on different occasions. Snails were less aggregated when they spread out to feed during high tide than when emersed during low tide, but this was only found at very small spatial scales because snails do not move far to feed. Therefore, the cues that operate to cause the snails to aggregate in same patches and not others appear to be operating at the scale of centimetres, rather than metres. This suggests that many of the traditional explanations for patterns of aggregation in intertidal animals, such as those having to do with desiccation or temperature, may not be important in this species. This phenomenon may be more widespread among intertidal animals than is currently recognised, but it will be necessary to examine patterns and test models about ecological processes at small spatial scales within shores, in addition to among shores, before this can be determined.

AB This study identifies the factors that influence the reproductive output (number of viable seeds dispersed) of Pistacia terebinthus (Anacardiaceae), examines the magnitude and variability of their effects, and considers how plant traits affect the relative importance of each factor in reducing reproductive potential. Pre-dispersal reproductive losses were measured in a total of 28 individuals from anthesis to seed dispersal. Post-dispersal seed predation was estimated as well by placing seeds in different locations and checking them periodically.
   A total of eight factors were found to reduce plant reproductive potential during the pre-dispersal phase. Ordered according to the importance of their effects these factors were: abortion of flowers and latent ovaries, abortion of seeds, fruit dryness (mainly caused by hemipterans that suck the fruit pulp), parthenocarpy (production of empty seeds), consumption of viable fruits by non-legitimate seed dispersers, fruit damage by psyllids, seed damage by chalcidoid wasps, and fruit damage by fungi.
   There was much inter-individual variability in the effects of all those factors. That variation, however, was in most cases independent of the plant traits examined (plant size, fecundity, distance to males, flowering synchrony, peak dare of fruit ripening). The most relevant associations were found between plant fecundity and (1) proportion of wasp-damaged seeds (larger fruit crops experienced greater seed predation by these insects) and (2) proportion of fruits removed by non-legitimate seed dispersers (smaller fruit crops with greater proportions of viable seeds had higher bird predation rates). Also, plants that had most fruits ripen in early September had more viable seeds removed by non-legitimate dispersers than those that had most fruits ripen in late September.
   A key factor analysis showed that factors intrinsic to the plant, such as flower and ovary abortion and seed inviability, accounted for low among-plant variation in total reproductive losses, even though their relative contribution to such losses was great. Extrinsic factors such as fruit or seed damage by animals accounted for a low reproductive loss but for great among-plant variation in the number of viable seeds dispersed, and appeared to act as selective agents on plant fecundity.
   Post-dispersal seed predators (mainly field mice, chaffinches, and ants) removed a significant proportion of the seeds placed in different locations where birds can drop them, indicating that seedling recruitment in a given site is largely determined by the abundance of these animals at that site.

AB Shell selection and utilization in two sympatric species of hermit crabs from the Natal coast, namely Clibanarius virescens (Krauss, 1843) and Calcinus laevimanus (Randall, 1840) were investigated. Shells of 23 gastropod species were occupied by C. virescens while 13 species were utilized by C. laevimanus. Shells of 11 gastropod species were inhabited by both crabs but, of these only two shell species were used in significant numbers.
   The results showed a close correlation between the morphometric data of the crabs and the utilized shells. Clibanarius virescens preferred high spired shells whilst C. laevimanus showed preference for shells with low spires. As C. laevimanus possesses a large cheliped it was restricted in the choice of shells in the natural habitat as it had to select shells with large apertures. Differential shell utilization has been advanced as the most important factor permitting coexistence of the two species.
   Clibanarius virescens inhabited a succession of shell species as the crabs grew in hard carapace or shield length whereas C. laevimanus showed preference mainly for two shell species namely Nerita albicilla Linnaeus, 1758 (carapace length less than 5 mm) and Turbo coronatus Gmelin, 1791 (carapace length more than 5 mm). Calcinus laevimanus may not be at a disadvantage by occupying Nerita shells as the large cheliped may be effectively used in sealing the aperture of the shell, and thereby minimizing water loss.
   Females of both species occupying lighter shells with large internal volumes were found to produce larger clutches as compared to females of similar carapace lengths occupying the heavier shell species.

AB Social insects, i.e. ants, bees, wasps and termites, are key components of ecological communities, and are important ecosystem services (ESs) providers. Here, we review the literature in order to (i) analyse the particular traits of social insects that make them good suppliers of ESs; (ii) compile and assess management strategies that improve the services provided by social insects; and (iii) detect gaps in our knowledge about the services that social insects provide. Social insects provide at least 10 ESs; however, many of them are poorly understood or valued. Relevant traits of social insects include high biomass and numerical abundance, a diversity of mutualistic associations, the ability to build important biogenic structures, versatile production of chemical defences, the simultaneous delivery of several ESs, the presence of castes and division of labour, efficient communication and cooperation, the capacity to store food, and a long lifespan. All these characteristics enhance social insects as ES providers, highlighting their potential, constancy and efficiency as suppliers of these services. In turn, many of these traits make social insects stress tolerant and easy to manage, so increasing the ESs they provide. We emphasise the need for a conservation approach to the management of the services, as well as the potential use of social insects to help restore habitats degraded by human activities. In addition, we stress the need to evaluate both services and disservices in an integrated way, because some species of social insects are among the most problematic invasive species and native pests. Finally, we propose two areas of research that will lead to a greater and more efficient use of social insects as ES providers, and to a greater appreciation of them by producers and decision-makers.

AB Biodiversity in Latin America is at risk today due to habitat loss, land conversion to agriculture and urbanization. To grow their economies the developing countries of Latin America have begun to invest heavily in new road construction. An assessment of research on the impacts of roads on wildlife in Latin America will help define science-based conservation strategies aimed at mitigating road expansion. The aim of this review was to qualitatively and quantitatively assess scientific research papers addressing road impacts on vertebrate species in Latin America. We searched for scientific papers published as early as 1990 to 2017. We reviewed a total of 197 papers. Published research showed an increasing trend in the last decade with a strong geographic bias with a majority of papers from Brazil. Mammals were the most studied taxa followed by birds, reptiles and amphibians. The majority of studies focused on road mortality and at the individual species level. Studies documented an increase in deforestation rates, in land conversion to agriculture, illegal activities (hunting, logging) and the establishment of human settlements. The effects of roads on species richness and populations abundance varied among taxa with no apparent pattern within taxa. Forest-dependent species tended to avoid crossing roads. Amphibians had the highest median road-kill rate, followed by reptiles, mammals and birds. Our results suggest that there is an urgent need for more research, particularly in Central America and to employ predictive tools for difficult-to-sample or understudied species and critical conservation areas. We recommend a two-speed approach to guide future research: one focusing on quantifying individual species responses towards roads and their implications on population viability; a second consisting of regional or continental-scale analyses and modelling of road risks to species and populations to inform road planning immediately.

AB In transformed landscapes, many populations of grassland specialist plant and animal species live outside the few protected areas and are often preserved on 'small natural features' (SNFs) such as road verges, field margins and rocky outcrops. In the steppe and forest steppe zones of Eurasia ancient burial mounds (kurgans) are widespread SNFs providing refuge for grassland species. Based on a large-scale botanical and zoological survey of 138 kurgans in Hungary, we compared the management regimes, the presence of threatening factors and the conservation potential of kurgans embedded in non-protected transformed landscapes and in protected areas. We found that kurgans extend the borders of the protected areas by maintaining populations of grassland specialist plants and arthropods (ants, orthopterans, true bugs and rove beetles) even in transformed landscapes. We revealed that the lack of proper management, the presence of anthropogenic disturbances and encroachment of woody species are the most considerable threats to the long-term maintenance of biodiversity on kurgans located outside the protected areas. For their effective conservation a new approach is needed, which can cope with the small area and dispersed localities of the kurgans and can integrate them into the network of other SNFs on a landscape-level. As the ecological importance of kurgans is disproportionate to their size conservation actions focusing on their protection offers a greater rate of return of the efforts than can be expected in case of larger continuous sites.

AB Biomass removal by herbivores usually incurs a fitness cost for the attacked plants, with the total cost per unit lost tissue depending on the value of the removed tissue (i.e., how costly it is to be replaced by regrowth). Optimal defense theory, first outlined in the 1960s and 1970s, predicted that these fitness costs result in an arms race between plants and herbivores, in which selection favors resistance strategies that either repel herbivores through morphological and chemical resistance traits in order to reduce their consumption, or result in enemy escape through rapid growth or by timing the growth or flowering to the periods when herbivores are absent. Such resistance against herbivores would most likely evolve when herbivores are abundant, cause extensive damage, and consume valuable plant tissues. The purpose of this Special Feature is to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the phenomenon of overcompensation, specifically, where the finding has brought us and where it is leading us 30 yr later. We first provide a short overview of how the phenomenon of overcompensation has led to broader studies on plant tolerance to herbivory, summarize key findings, and then discuss some promising new directions in light of six featured research papers.

AB Central and South America tropical dry forest (TDF) is a water-limited biome with a high number of endemic species and numerous ecosystem services which has experienced a boom in research in the last decade. Although the number of case studies across these seasonal, water-limited, tropical forests has increased, there has not been a comprehensive review to assess the physiological variability of this biome across the continent and assess how these forests respond to climatic variables. Additionally, understanding forest change and resilience under climatic variability, currently and in the future, is essential for assessing the future extent and health of forests in the future. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to provide a literature review on the variability of TDF diversity and structure across a latitudinal gradient and to assess how these components respond to differences in climatic variables across this geographic area. We first assess the current state of understanding of the structure, biomass, phenological cycles, and successional stages across the latitudinal gradient. We subsequently review the response of these five areas to differences in precipitation, temperature, and extreme weather events, such as droughts and hurricanes. We find that there is a range of adaptability to precipitation, with many areas exhibiting drought tolerance except under the most extreme circumstances, while being susceptible to damage from increased extreme precipitation events. Finally, we use this climatic response to provide a commentary on the projected resilience of TDFs under climatic changes, finding a likelihood of resilience under drying scenarios, although model projections do not agree on the magnitude or direction of precipitation change. This review of quantitative studies will provide more concrete details on the current diversity that encompasses the TDF, the natural climatic ranges under which this ecosystem can survive and thrive, and can help inform future forest management practices under climate change scenarios.

AB The agricultural conversion of natural habitats is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide. In the similar to 2 million km(2) Brazilian cerrado biome, a global biodiversity hotspot, vast areas have been converted into croplands and cattle pastures. Because the cerrado biome is overwhelmingly contained within private lands, Brazil's environmental legislation should serve as a decisive instrument in protecting these natural ecosystems. We assessed the role of Legal Reserves (LRs), legally defined as the minimum proportion of private landholdings set aside to protect natural vegetation, in the conservation of the cerrado biome. We assume that the property-scale allocation of LRs is primarily based on economic decision-making, creating a bias against cerrado protection. We therefore assessed the area ratio between forest vegetation (FV) and grassland vegetation (GV) areas across LRs within 48,762 landholdings, 9 formal protected areas (PAs) and 34 Indigenous Lands (ILs) within the cerrado (sensu lato) of the 903,357-km(2) state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. We show that there are 7.26 ha of forest lands for each hectare of native grasslands within private RLs of the cerrado biome within Mato Grosso, a ratio almost three-fold larger than that found in formal PAs and ILs. ILs protect in absolute values (hectares) six-fold more native grassland vegetation than PAs. We discuss the policy relevance of this severe land-use bias in maintaining the heterogeneity of cerrado habitats for biodiversity conservation within private properties, which account for 90% of the entire cerrado biome.

AB Landscape fire is a key but poorly understood component of the global carbon cycle. Predicting biomass consumption by fire at large spatial scales is essential to understanding carbon dynamics and hence how fire management can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase ecosystem carbon storage. An Australia-wide field-based survey (at 113 locations) across large-scale macroecological gradients (climate, productivity and fire regimes) enabled estimation of how biomass combustion by surface fire directly affects continental-scale carbon budgets. In terms of biomass consumption, we found clear trade-offs between the frequency and severity of surface fires. In temperate southern Australia, characterised by less frequent and more severe fires, biomass consumed per fire was typically very high. In contrast, surface fires in the tropical savannas of northern Australia were very frequent but less severe, with much lower consumption of biomass per fire (about a quarter of that in the far south). When biomass consumption was expressed on an annual basis, biomass consumed was far greater in the tropical savannas (>20 times that of the far south). This trade-off is also apparent in the ratio of annual carbon consumption to net primary production (NPP). Across Australia's naturally vegetated land area, annual carbon consumption by surface fire is equivalent to about 11% of NPP, with a sharp contrast between temperate southern Australia (6%) and tropical northern Australia (46%). Our results emphasise that fire management to reduce greenhouse gas emissions should focus on fire prone tropical savanna landscapes, where the vast bulk of biomass consumption occurs globally. In these landscapes, grass biomass is a key driver of frequency, intensity and combustion completeness of surface fires, and management actions that increase grass biomass are likely to lead to increases in greenhouse gas emissions from savanna fires.

AB Spatial and temporal information on the structural and chemical properties of tropical forest canopies are key to understanding ecosystem processes. However, such information is usually limited to field studies performed at the plot level (similar to 1 ha). The combination of imaging spectroscopy with physically based radiative transfer (RT) models holds great promise for generalizing and extrapolating insights from plot-based studies to whole landscapes. Here, we tested the capacity of a simplified 3D RT approach to retrieve the structural and chemical traits of individual tree crowns (ITCs) from a highly diverse tropical forest. We first produced two datasets called measured and simulated. The measured dataset was composed of ITC reflectance extracted from sunlit imaging spectroscopy pixels. The simulated dataset was produced using a look-up-table approach and the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model. We then compared the simulated and measured reflectances of ITCs in terms of shape difference by computing the spectral angle. The results showed small disagreements between the simulated and measured reflectances. Such differences impacted neither the spectral variability nor the spectral regions recognized as useful for species discrimination, showing that the spectral angle was a suitable measure of spectral similarity. Simulation robustness was assessed by comparing model parameters obtained by inversion to imaging spectroscopy vegetation indices and the proportion of non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), green photosynthetic vegetation (GV) and shade estimated within ITCs. DART canopy structural parameters were related to NPV (R-2 = 0.71), GV (R-2 = 0.78) and shade (R-2 = 0.55). DART canopy foliar parameters such as chlorophyll and carotenoids were related to the ratio of TCARI/OSAVI (R-2 = 0.80) indices and the simple ratio between reflectances at 515 nm and 570 nm (R-515/R-570) (R-2 = 0.54), respectively. Species-related differences in NPV, GV and shade were explained by variations in crown architectural characteristics. The simulation framework employed in this study can be applied to retrieve structural and chemical traits of ITCs from other areas in which high-resolution imaging spectroscopy data are available.

AB Studies have attempted to disentangle the relationships between urban properties and species richness patterns by studying them within the urban-rural gradient context, the Island Biogeography framework, or the patch matrix approach. We compared and contrasted these frameworks, to highlight their attributes. We assessed the role of patch properties and matrix characteristics, in light of these approaches, to identify the relative roles of different drivers in dictating urban plant species richness patterns.
   Vegetation surveys were conducted in 41 open space patches within the city boundaries of Haifa, Israel. Plants were classified into three categories: rare, native and non-native. Patch properties, distance to nearest neighboring patch, distance to city boundary, within patch heterogeneity and percentage of sealed surface buffering the patch were evaluated in relation to species richness. Non-linear regressions indicated that total, rare and native species richness were best explained by a combination of patch area, sealed surface and patch habitat heterogeneity. Non-native species richness was best explained indirectly by the proportion of sealed surface. No clear cut distinctions between the three frameworks were observed. The results point to the existence of non-linear interactive relationships between the drivers and species richness, which depend on patch and urban matrix properties, particularly on degree of urbanization. We conclude that patch-matrix mechanisms interact with the urban-rural gradient approach to determine plant richness patterns in urban landscapes. Additionally, the degree of urbanization is differentially associated with richness patterns, where rare and native species are negatively associated with it, and non-native species are positively associated with urbanization.

AB Radiocarbon dating shows that Cedrela trees from Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela form one ring per year but Cedrela trees from Suriname form two rings per year.
   Tropical tree rings have the potential to yield valuable ecological and climate information, on the condition that rings are annual and accurately dated. It is important to understand the factors controlling ring formation, since regional variation in these factors could cause trees in different regions to form tree rings at different times. Here, we use 'bomb-peak' radiocarbon (C-14) dating to test the periodicity of ring formation in Cedrela trees from four sites across tropical South America. We show that trees from Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela have reliably annual tree rings, while trees from Suriname regularly form two rings per year. This proves that while tree rings of a particular species may be demonstrably annual at one site, this does not imply that rings are formed annually in other locations. We explore possible drivers of variation in ring periodicity and find that Cedrela growth rhythms are most likely caused by precipitation seasonality, with a possible degree of genetic control. Therefore, tree-ring studies undertaken at new locations in the tropics require independent validation of the annual nature of tree rings, irrespective of how the studied species behaves in other locations.

AB Natural environments on Earth are amenable to a diverse array of chemical reactions that can convert one form of nitrogen into another, often with the participation of additional substances such as minerals, dissolved metals, and organic compounds. These processes collectively define a natural chemical nitrogen cycle, analogous to the familiar biologically driven cycle but even more intricate with respect to the number of pathways by which nitrogen can be transformed and transported across land, air, and water. The fully assembled abiotic nitrogen cycle manifests a landscape rich in opportunities for investigation either with or without parallel attention to biological processes.

AB AimOverall species richness in habitat remnants is seldom explained by the island biogeography theory (IBT). In this study, we tested the effectiveness of the IBT in explaining species richness of forest birds with or without considering the effect of the different forest specialization of species (generalist, edge and interior; community analysis). We also identified single species and groups of species that could serve as indicators of different fragmentation degrees (indicator species analysis).
   LocationBroadleaved forests in western Lombardy (northern Italy).
   MethodsWe evaluated bird species richness in 344 forest fragments. Fragment area (FA), distance from the nearest source area (>1000ha) (DSA) and number of neighbouring fragments (NF) were calculated for each fragment. Using Poisson generalized linear models, we compared a model that evaluated the relationships between fragment covariates and species richness to a model that also considered the effect of forest species specialization on each relationship. Moreover, we investigated the association between each species and particular fragmentation conditions by calculating the IndVal index.
   ResultsThe application of the IBT to species richness performed significantly better if we took into account forest species specialization when evaluating the effect of fragment covariates. In particular, the positive effects of FA and NF and the negative effect of DSA were significantly stronger on interior species rather than on generalist and edge species. Using the IndVal index we identified six species in three groups strongly associated with specific fragmentation degrees.
   Main conclusionsThe results showed the strong influence of the specialization of species on their distribution in fragmented landscapes. Interior species were the best candidates as a proxy of fragmentation effects. However, the indicator species analyses revealed that not all interior species showed the same sensitivity to fragment covariates.

AB Macroevolutionary theory posits three processes leading to lineage diversification and the formation of regional biotas: dispersal (species geographic range expansion), speciation (species lineage splitting), and extinction (species lineage termination). The Theory of Island Biogeography (TIB) predicts species richness values using just two of these processes; dispersal and extinction. Yetmost species on Earth live on continents or continental shelves, and the dynamics of evolutionary diversification at regional and continental scales are qualitatively different from those that govern the formation of species richness on biogeographic islands. Certain geomorphological processes operating perennially on continental platforms displace barriers to gene flow and organismal dispersal, and affect all three terms of macroevolutionary diversification. For example, uplift of a dissected landscape and river capture both merge and separate portions of adjacent areas, allowing dispersal and larger geographic ranges, vicariant speciation and smaller geographic ranges, and extinction when range sizes are subdivided below a minimum persistence threshold. The TIB also does not predict many biogeographic and phylogenetic patterns widely observed in continentally distributed taxa, including: (i) power function-like species-area relationships; (ii) log-normal distribution of species geographic range sizes, in which most species have restricted ranges (are endemic) and few species have broad ranges (are cosmopolitan); (iii) mid-domain effects withmore species toward the geographic center, and more early-branching, species-poor clades toward the geographic periphery; (iv) exponential rates of net diversification with log-linear accumulation of lineages through geological time; and (v) power function-like relationships between species-richness and clade diversity, in which most clades are species-poor and few clades are species-rich. Current theory does not provide a robust mechanistic framework to connect these seemingly disparate patterns. Here we present SEAMLESS (Spatially Explicit Area Model of Landscape Evolution by SimulationS) that generates clade diversification by moving geographic barriers on a continuous, neutral landscape. SEAMLESS is a neutral Landscape Evolution Model (LEM) that treats species and barriers as functionally equivalent with respect to model parameters. SEAMLESS differs from other model based biogeographic methods (e.g., Lagrange, GeoSSE, BayArea, and BioGeoBEARS) by modeling properties of dispersal barriers rather than areas, and by modeling the evolution of species lineages on a continuous landscape, rather than the evolution of geographic ranges along branches of a phylogeny. SEAMLESS shows how dispersal is required to maintain species richness and avoid clade-wide extinction, demonstrates that ancestral range size does not predict species richness, and provides a unified explanation for the suite of commonly observed biogeographic and phylogenetic patterns listed above. SEAMLESS explains how a simple barrier-displacement mechanism affects lineage diversification under neutral conditions, and is advanced here toward the formulation of a general theory of continental biogeography.

AB Through different policies and measures reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation and enhancing conservation (REDD+) has grown into a way to induce behavior change of forest managers and landowners in tropical countries. We argue that debates around REDD+ in Brazil have typically highlighted rewards and punishments, obscuring other core interventions and strategies that are also critically important to reach the goal of reducing deforestation, supporting livelihoods, and promoting conservation (i.e., technology transfer and capacity building). We adopt Foucault's concepts of governmentality and technologies of governance to provide a reading of the REDD+ discourse in Brazil and to offer an historical genealogy of the rewards and punishments approach. By analyzing practical elements from REDD+ implementation in the Brazilian Amazon, our research provides insights on the different dimensions in which smallholders react to rewards and punishments. In doing so, we add to the debate on governmentality, supplementing its focus on rationalities of governance with attention to the social practices in which such rationalities are embedded. Our research also suggests that the techniques of remuneration and coercion on which a rewards and punishments approach relies are only supporting limited behavioral changes on the ground, generating negative adaptations of deforestation practices, reducing positive feedbacks and, perhaps as importantly, producing only short-term outcomes at the expense of positive long-term land use changes. Furthermore, the approach ignores local heterogeneities and the differences between the agents engaging in forest clearing in the Amazon. The practical elements of the REDD+ discourse in Brazil suggest the rewards and punishments approach profoundly limits our understanding of human behavior by reducing the complex and multi-dimensional to a linear and rational simplicity. Such simplification leads to an underestimation of smallholders' capacity to play a key role in climate mitigation and adaptation. We conclude by highlighting the importance of looking at local heterogeneities and capacities and the need to promote trust, altruism and responsibility towards others and future generations.

AB This study explores the main direct and underlying causes of deforestation in Brazil's Legal Amazon region by considering spatial differences. The computation of localized parameters is based on geographically weighted regression (GWR). The novelty of this paper lies in its incorporation of economic, rather than Euclidean, distances into the GWR. Economic distances are measured by travel time, sourced from Google Inc. A global approach revealed several important factors that affect deforestation, including: rural population, GDP (suggesting a U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve), forest stock, cattle ranching, timber value, and road networks (both official and unofficial). Local analysis uncovered patterns not seen under global models, especially in the state of Para. Most notably, crop cultivation was found to accelerate deforestation in southeastern Para and northeastern Mato Grosso, while in some regions (especially in the northeastern corner of Para), the area covered by crop plantations was negatively associated with deforestation. For Para, rural credit constraints, larger territories designated as sustainable use areas and indigenous lands, and higher levels of precipitation inhibit deforestation. Further, rural population has a very heterogeneous impact on deforestation across Legal Amazon: it is not a significant factor of deforestation in northern Para and Amapa, but it has a relatively strong effect in the western parts of Mato Grosso and Rondonia. Also, official and illegal roads create significantly more pressure on forests in remote regions compared to developed areas. Finally, the use of economic distances, as opposed to Euclidean distances, leads to notably different GWR results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Both water availability and temperature modulate the growth of Hymenaea courbaril on karst in Central Brazil. There is evidence of teleconnections between South Atlantic SST and tree growth.
   Tropical dry forests have low annual precipitation and long dry seasons. Water availability, the main restrictive growth factor, becomes more pronounced in the shallow and highly porous soil of karst regions. Understanding how climate regulates tree growth in stressful environments is essential for predicting climate change impacts on trees. The aim of this study was to build a tree-ring chronology of Hymenaea courbaril growing in a karst dry forest and evaluate how local climate and teleconnections modulate its growth. To accomplish this, increment cores of 19 individuals were sampled in Terra Ronca State Park located in Goias State, Central Brazil. After surface polishing, tree rings were identified, measured, dated, and a tree-ring chronology was built with 17 individuals. The chronology was correlated with local and regional climate data (temperature, precipitation, air humidity). We also tested teleconnections with sea surface temperature (SST) of the Equatorial Pacific and South Atlantic. Results show that air humidity, precipitation amount, and its distribution during the transition period between dry and wet seasons positively regulate this species growth. On the other hand, growth is negatively correlated with temperature during the middle of the previous year's dry season. Additionally, growth is negatively correlated with SST of the Southern Atlantic, but not with Equatorial Pacific. These relationships between climate and growth indicate that predicted increases in regional temperature and decreases in water availability may limit the growth of H. courbaril in karst dry forests.

AB Herbaceous plants are a key component of tropical forests. Previous work indicates that herbs contribute substantially to the species richness of tropical plant communities. However, the processes structuring tropical herb diversity, and how they contrast with woody communities, have been underexplored. Within the understory of a 50-ha forest dynamics plot in central Panama, we compared the diversity, distribution, and abundance of vascular herbaceous plants with woody seedlings (i.e., tree and lianas < 1 cm DBH and >= 20 cm tall). Beta-diversity was calculated for each community using a null model approach. We then assessed the similarity in alpha and beta-diversity among herbs, tree seedlings, and liana seedlings. Strengths of habitat associations were measured using permutational ANOVA among topographic habitat-types. Variance partitioning was then used to quantify the amount of variation in species richness and composition explained by spatial and environmental variables (i.e., topography, soils, and shade) for each growth form. Species richness and diversity were highest for tree seedlings, followed by liana seedlings and then herbs. In contrast, beta-diversity was 16-127% higher for herbs compared to woody seedlings, indicating higher spatial variation in this stratum. We observed no correlation between local richness or compositional uniqueness of herbs and woody seedlings across sites, indicating that different processes control the spatial patterns of woody and herbaceous diversity and composition. Habitat associations were strongest for herbs, as indicated by greater compositional dissimilarity among habitat types. Likewise, environmental variables explained a larger proportion of the variation in species richness and composition for herbs than for woody seedlings (richness = 25%, 14%, 12%; composition = 25%, 9%, 6%, for herbs, trees, and lianas, respectively). These differences between strata did not appear to be due to differences in lifespan alone, based on data from adult trees. Our results point to contrasting assembly mechanisms for herbaceous and woody communities, with herbs showing stronger niche-derived structure. Future research on tropical herbaceous communities is likely to yield new insights into the many processes structuring diverse plant communities.

AB QuestionsWhich factors affect the diversity and species composition of tropical secondary rain forests in a region with little information regarding their contribution to global biodiversity? Can older secondary forests approach the diversity and composition of mature forests following 100yr of pasture use?
   LocationTropical secondary rain forest, northeast Australia.
   MethodsWe identified trees, shrubs and vines 2.5cm DBH in a chronosequence comprising 33 sites, aged 3-60yr since the formation of closed canopy (9-69yr since pasture abandonment) and compared them with eight sites in nearby mature forest remnants.
   ResultsSpecies richness and community composition were strongly influenced by secondary forest age but did not attain values of mature forest. Sites in close proximity to mature forests had higher plant richness, whereas low soil fertility appeared to depress species recruitment. Thus, multiple factors operated in secondary forest community assembly. Unusual tree community patterns that suggest accelerated or slowed successional trajectories were observed at several sites.
   ConclusionsSecondary forests in our study region contained important plant diversity for conservation, particularly in older sites, however, even the oldest secondary forests (60yr) did not converge with the species composition and diversity of mature forests. The protection of mature forest tracts and remnants must be a priority if we are to maintain high levels of plant diversity in tropical landscapes, conserve rare species and facilitate the recruitment of plant species in recovering forests.

AB Soils are integral to agricultural productivity, biodiversity, and the maintenance of ecosystem services. However, soil ecosystem research depends on foundational biological knowledge that is often missing. In this review, we present a comprehensive, cross-taxa overview of the soil biota of South Africa. We discuss the literature and sampling methods used to assess soil biota, the available taxonomic expertise and main collections within South Africa, the availability of identification guides and online resources, and the status and distribution of described species. We include species lists for all South African soil biota and, for groups with sufficient distribution records, species richness maps. Despite South Africa being only 0.8% of the earth's terrestrial area, it contains nearly 1.8% of the world's described soil species (mean per taxon 3.64%, range 0.17-15%; n = 36 groups), with nematodes and earthworms showing a remarkable (6.4 and 7.7%) proportion of globally described diversity. Endemism is high for most groups, ranging from 33-92%. However, major knowledge gaps exist for most soil biota groups. While sampling has been relatively comprehensive in some areas for a few groups (particularly those with direct socioeconomic impacts), the Nama-Karoo, Northern Cape and Eastern Cape are poorly sampled. Natural soils in biodiversity hotspots, such as the Fynbos Biome, are also understudied. We argue that a more integrative approach to acquiring foundational knowledge in soil biodiversity is needed if applied soil research is to be effective in ensuring sustainable soil health. Considerable investment will be required to bring our understanding of the soil biodiversity in this megadiverse region to a level where the Millennium Development Goals can be reached.

AB Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) has been recognized as a key mechanism underlying species coexistence, especially in tropical forests. Recently, some studies have reported that seedling survival is also negatively correlated with the phylogenetic relatedness between neighbors and focal individuals, termed phylogenetic negative density dependence (PNDD). In contrast to CNDD or PNDD, shared habitat requirements between closely related individuals are thought to be a cause of observed positive effects of closely related neighbors, which may affect the strength and detectability of CNDD or PNDD. In order to investigate the relative importance of these mechanisms for tropical tree seedling survival, we used generalized linear mixed models to analyze how the survival of more than 10 000 seedlings of woody plant species related to neighborhood and habitat variables in a tropical rainforest in southwest China. By comparing models with and without habitat variables, we tested how habitat filtering affected the detection of CNDD and PNDD. The best-fitting model suggested that CNDD and habitat filtering played key roles in seedling survival, but that, contrary to our expectations, phylogenetic positive density dependence (PPDD) had a distinct and important effect. While habitat filtering affected the detection of CNDD by decreasing its apparent strength, it did not explain the positive effects of closely related neighbors. Our results demonstrate that a failure to control for habitat variables and phylogenetic relationships may obscure the importance of conspecific and heterospecific neighbor densities for seedling survival.

AB Replacement of native forests by forest plantations may change the composition and abundance of small mammals, thus influencing the foraging behavior of mesocarnivores in these human-created habitats. We assessed how differences in prey abundance between native forests and exotic plantations in southern Chile may explain the prey selection of four mesocarnivores, as analyzed from their scats. Using a spatial zero-inflated Poisson model, we determined that the abundance of most small mammals was lower in plantations than native forests, except for three common species, which had similar or larger abundances in exotic plantations. We assessed mesocarnivores' prey selection by assessing the coefficients and log-ratios of use and availability of a Bayesian Resource Selection Function. We determined that in native forest, the preferences of kodkod (Leopardus guigna) for arboreal prey was stronger, whereas chilla fox (Pseudalopex griseus) and Darwin's fox (Pseudalopex fuhdpes) exhibited a selective preference for ground prey. Darwin's fox also exhibited a habitat-dependent changes in their selection for Darwin's leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini), from a positive log ratio in native forest to a negative ratio in exotic plantations. Conversely, culpeo fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus) selected long-tailed colilargo (Oligoriaomys longicaudatus) and Chilean climbing mouse (Irenomys tarsalis) in plantations only, even though these prey were more abundant in native forests. Although mature commercial forest plantations may provide feeding grounds for mesocarnivores, depending on their species-specific ability to capture available prey, the decline of small mammal availability in plantations may modify the prey selection of mesocarnivores.

AB Newly created forest edges have significant ecophysiological effects on bordering trees. We studied edge effects on microclimate and tree transpiration rates during wet and dry seasons along a 250 m transect spanning the edge of an unpaved road into an old growth tropical lowland forest in the Central Brazilian Amazon. Canopy openness decreased only minimal from the road (3.68%) towards the forest interior (1.69%). Vapor pressure deficit (measured at 2.2 m height above ground) was lower in the forest interior. The edge effect on microclimate penetrated deeper into the forest (>100 m) during the dry season compared to the wet season (<100 m). Overall, sap flux, and therefore transpiration rate, was 54% higher in trees adjacent to the road compared to forest interior trees. Higher transpiration rates at the forest edge can be explained by higher turbulences and energy exchange of the canopy boundary layer and by a shift in species composition to high water using secondary forest species 25 years after the road construction. Similar changes might be expected for other disturbances affecting local relative humidity and in situations that favor plants with water use traits differing from those found in the forest interior.

AB We examined tree-soil habitat associations in lowland forest communities at Paracou, French Guiana. We analyzed a large dataset assembling six permanent plots totaling 37.5 ha, in which extensive LIDAR-derived topographical data and soil chemical and physical data have been integrated with precise botanical determinations. Map of relative elevation from the nearest stream summarized both soil fertility and hydromorphic characteristics, with seasonally inundated bottomlands having higher soil phosphate content and base saturation, and plateaus having higher soil carbon, nitrogen and aluminum contents. We employed a statistical test of correlations between tree species density and environmental maps, by generating Monte Carlo simulations of random raster images that preserve auto-correlation of the original maps. Nearly three fourths of the 94 taxa with at least one stem per ha showed a significant correlation between tree density and relative elevation, revealing contrasted species-habitat associations in term of abundance, with seasonally inundated bottomlands (24.5% of species) and well-drained plateaus (48.9% of species). We also observed species preferences for environments with or without steep slopes (13.8% and 10.6%, respectively). We observed that closely-related species were frequently associated with different soil habitats in this region (70% of the 14 genera with congeneric species that have a significant association test) suggesting species-habitat associations have arisen multiple times in this tree community. We also tested if species with similar habitat preferences shared functional strategies. We found that seasonally inundated forest specialists tended to have smaller stature (maximum diameter) than species found on plateaus. Our results underline the importance of tree-soil habitat associations in structuring diverse communities at fine spatial scales and suggest that additional studies are needed to disentangle community assembly mechanisms related to dispersal limitation, biotic interactions and environmental filtering from species-habitat associations. Moreover, they provide a framework to generalize across tropical forest sites.

AB Precise identification of plant species requires a high level of knowledge by taxonomists and presence of reproductive material. This represents a major limitation for those working with seedlings and juveniles, which differ morphologically from adults and do not bear reproductive structures. Near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) has previously been shown to be effective in species discrimination of adult plants, so if young and adults have a similar spectral signature, discriminant functions based on FT-NIR spectra of adults can be used to identify leaves from young plants. We tested this with a sample of 419 plants in 13 Amazonian species from the genera Protium and Crepidospermum (Burseraceae). We obtained 12 spectral readings per plant, from adaxial and abaxial surfaces of dried leaves, and compared the rate of correct predictions of species with discriminant functions for different combinations of readings. We showed that the best models for predicting species in early developmental stages are those containing spectral data from both young and adult plants (98% correct predictions of external samples), but even using only adult spectra it is still possible to attain good levels of identification of young. We obtained an average of 75% correct identifications of young plants by discriminant equations based only on adults, when the most informative wavelengths were selected. Most species were accurately predicted (75-100% correct identifications), and only three had poor predictions (27-60%). These results were obtained despite the fact that spectra of young individuals were distinct from those of adults when species were analyzed individually. We concluded that FT-NIR has a high potential in the identification of species even at different ontogenetic stages, and that young plants can be identified based on spectra of adults with reasonable confidence.

AB Although a growing number of studies address how Neotropical birds respond to anthropogenic disturbance and deforestation, we continue to poorly understand responses of groups of interacting species, such as mixed-species flocks in the Andes. In this study, we examined how attributes at landscape (i.e., percentage of forest cover within 1-km(2)) and local (i.e. structural complexity of microhabitat) scales shaped mixed-species flocks within five broadly-defined habitat types in the Northern and Central Andes. From 2007 to 2010, we systematically surveyed flocks along line transects in 97 1-km(2) plots distributed from Venezuela to Peru based on a stratified-random design. We recorded 220 avian species in 186 mixed-species flocks, with the greatest species richness and largest flocks detected in forested habitats. Understory insectivores were most closely associated with mature and secondary forests. Increasing forest cover promoted species richness and size of flocks, with particularly strong associations in successional habitats and shade coffee. Structural complexity was positively associated with flock size in early successional and silvopastoral habitats, where 20% increases in complexity doubled flock size. However, the opposite pattern was true in shade coffee and secondary forests. Encounter rates of flocks were poorly explained by simple metrics of forest cover and structural complexity. Unlike flocks reported in many lowland forests, Andean flocks tended to span all vertical strata, with fewer understory-specializing flocks (e.g. flocks led by Basileuterus warblers and Chlorospingus tanagers). Nonetheless, in such flocks, understory insectivores were most closely associated with mature and secondary forests. Our research supports the idea that managed habitats with overstory trees can contribute to flock conservation. Overall, our results further suggested that understory birds require the more forested of habitats (e.g., mature forest held almost twice as many understory specialists as other habitats), and may be less amenable to conservation with agroecosystems or working landscapes.

AB Ecosystem services provided by tropical forests are becoming scarcer due to continued deforestation as demand for forest benefits increases with the growing population. There is need for comprehensive valuation of key ecosystem services in order to inform policy and implement better management systems to enhance the supply of ecosystem services. This study estimates local economic value of key ecosystem services provided by Kakamega rainforest and examines how the information can support sustainable forest management in Kenya. This is the only rainforest in Kenya and it has exceptional biocliversity value including several unique species not found anywhere else in the country. Kakamega rainforest also provides a classic case of conflict between conservation and exploitation goals given the dense population around it We carried out elaborate household and visitors surveys to collect data used to estimate the economic value of three main ecosystem services. We estimated the total economic value of key ecosystem services (excluding biodiversity value) at about US$ 74 million per year or US$ 415 ha(-1) yr(-1). The local economic benefits are considerably less than forgone returns from agricultural activities if the forest were to be converted to the best agricultural uses. Arguably, continued protection of this forest is justified on the basis of the unknown value of its rich biodiversity and capacity to sequester CO2. Empirical findings show that the existing forest management system was less effective due to resource constraints and institutional weaknesses. Our study provides insights for the need to manage this forest for multiple uses. We recommend an integrated management strategy that balances local resource needs with biodiversity conservation. We suggest that improved stakeholder collaboration can facilitate sustainable management of this forest resource. Besides, carefully crafted payment for ecosystem services mechanisms and broad environmental education programs can support sustainable forest conservation for this arid other similar forest ecosystems in Africa.

AB Conversion of tropical forests to agriculture affects vertebrate assemblages, but we do not know how fast or to what extent these assemblages recover after field abandonment. We addressed this question by examining amphibians and reptiles in secondary forests in southeastern Mexico. We used chronosequence data (12 secondary forests fallow for 1-23yr and 3 old-growth forest sites) to analyze successional trajectories and estimate recovery times of assemblage attributes for amphibians and reptiles. We conducted 6 surveys at each site over 14mo (1200 person-hours) and recorded 1552 individuals, including 25 species of amphibians and 36 of reptiles, representing 96 and 74 percent of the expected regional number of species, respectively. Abundance, species richness, and species diversity of amphibians increased rapidly with successional age, approaching old-growth forest values in < 30yr. Species richness and species diversity of reptiles reached old-growth forest values in < 20yr. By contrast, the abundance of reptiles and the assemblage composition of amphibians and reptiles recovered more slowly. Along the chronosequence, we observed more species replacement in reptile assemblages than in amphibian assemblages. Several species in the old-growth forest were absent from secondary forests. Dispersal limitation and harsh conditions prevailing in open sites and early successional environments appear to preclude colonization by old-growth forest species. Furthermore, short fallow periods and isolation of forest remnants lead to the formation of new assemblages dominated by species favored by human disturbances.
   Resumen La conversion de los bosques tropicales en campos agropecuarios afecta a los ensambles de vertebrados, pero no sabemos en que medida y con que rapidez estos ensambles se recuperan despues del abandono de los campos. Exploramos este aspecto para el caso de los anfibios y reptiles en el sureste de Mexico. Basados en datos de una cronosecuencia (12 bosques secundarios con edades de 1-23 anos de desarrollo y tres sitios de bosques maduro), analizamos trayectorias sucesionales para estimar los tiempos de recuperacion de diferentes atributos de los ensambles de anfibios y reptiles. En cada sitio, se llevaron a cabo seis muestreos a lo largo de 14 meses (1200 horas persona en total). Globalmente, se registraron 1552 individuos, 25 especies de anfibios y 36 de reptiles, lo que represento el 96% y el 74% del numero esperado de especies regionales, respectivamente. La abundancia, la riqueza de especies y la diversidad de especies de anfibios se incrementaron rapidamente con la edad sucesional, acercandose a los valores del bosque maduro en menos de tres decadas. La riqueza de especies y la diversidad de especies de reptiles alcanzaron valores del bosque maduro en menos de 20 anos. Por el contrario, la recuperacion de la abundancia de reptiles fue mucho mas lenta como fue tambien el caso de la composicion del ensamble de anfibios y reptiles. A lo largo de la cronosecuencia, hubo una mayor sustitucion de especies en los ensamblajes de reptiles que en los de anfibios. Varias especies que se encontraron en el bosque maduro estuvieron ausentes en los bosques secundarios. Discutimos que la limitacion de la dispersion y las duras condiciones que prevalecen en los sitios abiertos y en los ambientes sucesionales tempranos impiden a las especies que habitan en el bosque maduro la colonizacion de esos habitats. Ademas, los periodos de barbecho corto y el aislamiento de los remanentes de bosques llevan a la formacion de nuevos ensambles dominados por especies favorecidas por las perturbaciones humanas.

AB Differences in litter quality, microbial activity or abiotic conditions cannot fully account for the variability in decomposition rates observed in semiarid ecosystems. Here we tested the role of variation in litter quality, water supply, and UV radiation as drivers of litter decomposition in arid lands. And show that carry-over effects of litter photodegradation during dry periods can regulate decomposition during subsequent wet periods. We present data from a two-phase experiment, where we first exposed litter from a drought-deciduous and an evergreen shrub to natural UV levels during five, rainless summer months and, subsequently, in the laboratory, we assessed the carry-over effects of photodegradation on biomass loss under different irrigation treatments representing the observed range of local rainfall variation among years (15-240 mm). Photodegradation of litter in the field produced average carbon losses of 12%, but deciduous Proustia pungens lost > 25%, while evergreen Porlieria chilensis less than 5%. Natural exposure to UV significantly reduced carbon-to-nitrogen and lignin:N ratios in Proustia litter but not in Pot-tier-fa. During the subsequent wet phase, remaining litter biomass was lower in Proustia than in Porlieria. Indeed UV exposure increased litter decomposition of Proustia under low and medium rainfall treatments, whereas no carry-over effects were detected under high rainfall treatment. Consequently, for deciduous Proustia carry-over effects of UV exposure were negligible under high irrigation. Litter decomposition of the evergreen Porlieria depended solely on levels of rainfall that promote microbial decomposers. Our two-phase experiment revealed that both the carry-over effects of photodegradation and litter quality, modulated by inter-annual variability in rainfall, can explain the marked differences in decomposition rates and the frequent decoupling between rainfall and litter decomposition observed in semiarid ecosystems.

AB Carbon forestry has become a cornerstone of attempted climate change mitigation in developing countries. As such, dozens of projects have been developed to supply carbon offsets to both voluntary and regulated carbon markets. In this paper we shed further light on the effects of such projects on communities and households by studying the implementation of a carbon forestry project in four communities in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. The project pays farmers to carry out a number of tree-planting activities depending on the local agro-ecological systems. We investigate how such activities have been promoted in and adopted by communities and we identify a series of community-based, institutional, resource management and asset-related factors that explain farmers' willingness to participate in the projects. Our analysis highlights a number of shared motivations for joining the project but varied levels of understanding about the project rationale. We also show how community norms, access to land tenure, financial and physical assets differ among participants and non-participants which translates in increasing inequalities in access to income and to other development projects. However, we also demonstrate that project activities, as currently designed, motivate some farmers to participate because of the potential of the project to act as a mechanism to bridge existing social divides through cooperation in the project and therefore financially and politically benefit from participation. Overall, the paper demonstrates that the project contributes to transforming local livelihoods and institutions, unfortunately not always as originally designed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Theory predicts that species performing similar roles for ecological processes or functions can compensate for the loss of others and that this functional redundancy may promote resilience. However, there is no clear evidence for this mechanism, because functional redundancy has been observed to be low in many ecosystems. Using a severe flood event, this study tests whether functional redundancy exists in floodplain ground beetle communities, how it is controlled and how it connects to post-flood resilience. Ground beetles were sampled in floodplain grassland of the Elbe River, Germany. Functional redundancy was estimated as the proportion of species in a community having neutral effects on functional diversity. Null models were used to determine whether functional redundancy is higher or lower than expected and mixed effects modelling was applied to estimate the relationships between functional redundancy, flood disturbance and sampling season. It was found that highly redundant ground beetle communities experienced fewer losses in functional diversity caused by an extreme flood than less redundant communities. Functional redundancy was lowest immediately after the flood, but quickly increased with time since flooding. It was significantly higher in spring than in autumn seasons and significantly higher in habitats exposed to frequent flooding. Null models confirmed that these patterns were to a high degree non-random. The results indicate that functional redundancy plays an important role for stabilizing ground beetles under regular, predictable flooding. However, given sizeable differences in functional diversity before and after the extreme flood, this effect may be lower than expected during extreme events. Other regulating forces, such as stochastic colonization processes and habitat templets, play more important roles directly after extreme disturbances. I therefore assume that a temporal hierarchy of mechanisms, including FR, controls the functional diversity of ground beetles in riparian habitats.

AB Rodent-borne hantaviruses are a group of zoonotic agents that cause hemorrhagic fever in humans. The transmission of hantaviruses among rodent hosts may be higher with the increase of reservoir host abundance in a given area (density-dependent transmission) and with the decrease of small mammal diversity (dilution effect phenomenon). These population and community parameters may be modified by habitat fragmentation; however, studies that focus on fragmentation and its effect on hantavirus infection risk are scarce. To further understanding of this issue, we assessed some population and community responses of rodents that may increase the risk for hantavirus transmission among wildlife hosts in the Americas. We conducted a meta-analysis of published studies to assess the responses of small mammals to fragmentation of native habitats, relative to patch size. Our analyses included five countries and 14 case studies for abundance of reservoir hosts (8 species) and 15 case studies for species richness. We found that a reduction of patch area due to habitat fragmentation is associated with increased reservoir host abundances and decreased small mammal richness, which is mainly due to the loss of non-host small mammals. According to these results, habitat fragmentation in the Americas should be considered as an epidemiological risk factor for hantavirus transmission to humans. These findings are important to assess potential risk of infection when fragmentation of native habitats occurs.

AB In tropical and temperate trees, wood chemical traits are hypothesized to covary with species' life-history strategy along a wood economics spectrum' (WES), but evidence supporting these expected patterns remains scarce. Due to its role in nutrient storage, we hypothesize that wood nitrogen (N) concentration will covary along the WES, being higher in slow-growing species with high wood density (WD), and lower in fast-growing species with low WD. In order to test this hypothesis we quantified wood N concentrations in 59 Panamanian hardwood species, and used this dataset to examine ecological correlates and phylogenetic patterns of wood N. Wood N varied >14-fold among species between 0.04 and 0.59%; closely related species were more similar in wood N than expected by chance. Wood N was positively correlated with WD, and negatively correlated with log-transformed relative growth rates, although these relationships were relatively weak. We found evidence for co-evolution between wood N and both WD and log-transformed mortality rates. Our study provides evidence that wood N covaries with tree life-history parameters, and that these patterns consistently co-evolve in tropical hardwoods. These results provide some support for the hypothesized WES, and suggest that wood is an increasingly important N pool through tropical forest succession.

ID BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; GLOBAL PATTERNS; DIVERSITY
AB We aspired to set conservation priorities in ways that lead to direct conservation actions. Very large-scale strategic mapping leads to familiar conservation priorities exemplified by biodiversity hotspots. In contrast, tactical conservation actions unfold on much smaller geographical extents and they need to reflect the habitat loss and fragmentation that have sharply restricted where species now live. Our aspirations for direct, practical actions were demanding. First, we identified the global, strategic conservation priorities and then downscaled to practical local actions within the selected priorities. In doing this, we recognized the limitations of incomplete information. We started such a process in Colombia and used the results presented here to implement reforestation of degraded land to prevent the isolation of a large area of cloud forest. We used existing range maps of 171 bird species to identify priority conservation areas that would conserve the greatest number of species at risk in Colombia. By at risk species, we mean those that are endemic and have small ranges. The Western Andes had the highest concentrations of such species100 in totalbut the lowest densities of national parks. We then adjusted the priorities for this region by refining these species ranges by selecting only areas of suitable elevation and remaining habitat. The estimated ranges of these species shrank by 18-100% after accounting for habitat and suitable elevation. Setting conservation priorities on the basis of currently available range maps excluded priority areas in the Western Andes and, by extension, likely elsewhere and for other taxa. By incorporating detailed maps of remaining natural habitats, we made practical recommendations for conservation actions. One recommendation was to restore forest connections to a patch of cloud forest about to become isolated from the main Andes.

AB Scarabaeinae dung beetles are indicator insects used in the evaluation of the ecological effects caused by changes in habitat structure and ecosystem integrity resulting from environmental degradation. We compared dung beetle diversity in conserved restinga forests (coastal tropical moist broadleaf forest) and in reforested areas of various ages during the rainy and dry seasons, on the coast of Paraiba State, Brazil. A total of 3,634 individuals comprising 14 species were collected. In the reforested areas there was a gradual increase in species abundance relative to the area's age, but in the conserved restinga the abundance of individuals was 10-20 times higher than that recorded in areas of recent reforestation. The highest species richness was found in the conserved restinga and in the oldest reforested area (16 years old) during the rainy season. During the dry season, when environmental conditions do not seem to favor adult survival, most of the species were found in the conserved restinga forest. The dung beetle community structure was related to the increases in habitat heterogeneity in the successional processes of the reforested areas. Our results suggest that reforested areas act as a source of and refuge for dung beetle species.

AB Seedling survival plays an important role in the maintenance of species diversity and forest dynamics. Although substantial gains have been made in understanding the factors driving patterns of seedling survival in forests, few studies have considered the simultaneous contribution of understory light availability and the local biotic neighborhood to seedling survival in temperate forests at different successional stages. Here, we used generalized linear mixed models to assess the relative importance of understory light availability and biotic neighborhood variables on seedling survival in secondary and old-growth temperate forest in north eastern China at two levels (community and guild). At the community level, biotic neighborhood effects on seedling survival were more important than understory light availability in both forests. In both the old-growth and secondary forests, conspecific basal area had a negative effect on seedling survival, consistent with negative conspecific density dependence. At guild levels, the relative importance of light and biotic neighborhood on seedling survival showed considerable variation among guilds in both forests. Available understory light tended to have positive effects on seedling survival for shrub and light-demanding species in the old-growth forest, but negative effects on survival of shade-tolerant seedlings in the secondary forest. For tree species and shade-tolerant species, the best fit models included neighborhood variables, but that was not the case for shrubs, light-demanding, or mid shade-tolerant species. Overall, our results demonstrate that the relative importance of understory light availability and biotic factors on seedling survival vary with species life-history strategy and forest successional stage.

AB Damage to agricultural and forest plantations caused by wild animals, including primates, is increasing globally due to shrinking habitats and the expansion of plantations. Over recent decades there has been an increase in reports of Sapajus nigritus causing damage (bark-stripping) to commercial Pine plantations in Southern Brazil. We conducted a two-year census and a phenological study of plant species consumed by S. nigritus to investigate if bark-stripping behavior is associated with overpopulation and/or food scarcity. We obtained a density of 2.23 +/- 1.09 individuals/km(2) in our study area, which is lower than previously reported in the literature for this species. The population experienced periods of food shortage from July to November, coinciding with a peak in damage to Pinus by S. nigritus. Thus, our results suggest that S. nigritus tree damage is primarily related to seasonal fluctuations in fruit and seed availability. Nevertheless, short term remediation strategies based on forestry management may be effective. These include planting less-preferred pine species, and reducing economic losses by optimizing both the timing of removal of injured trees, and the use of damaged trees depending on the type and intensity of the injury. In the longer term, native forests could be enriched with plant species that produce fruits during the period of fruit scarcity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; OFFSETS
AB Continuous decline of biodiversity over the past decades suggests that efforts to decrease biodiversity loss have been insufficient. One option to deal with this problem is the use of market-based mechanisms for biodiversity conservation. Several studies have analysed such mechanisms individually, but there is no comprehensive review with a comparative assessment of the performance of various mechanisms. This paper presents (i) an analysis of the economic conditions under which markets for biodiversity can be expected to function; (ii) an analysis of the efficiency of five selected biodiversity markets in the light of market and contract theory; and (iii) an assessment of the potential to scale up local or national payment mechanisms for biodiversity conservation. Our analysis shows the difficulties that market-based mechanisms face, among which are the need to ensure long-term conservation and the lack of a standardized unit of measurement for biodiversity. We provide a number of recommendations on how to overcome these difficulties. We argue that the set-up of a global registry embedded within the framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity would facilitate measurement, reporting and verification of biodiversity credits to support market-based mechanisms.

AB Habitat loss is the primary reason for species extinction, making habitat conservation a critical strategy for maintaining global biodiversity. Major habitat types, such as lowland tropical evergreen forests or mangrove forests, are already well represented in many conservation priorities, while others are underrepresented. This is particularly true for dry deciduous dipterocarp forests (DDF), a key forest type in Asia that extends from the tropical to the subtropical regions in South-east Asia (SE Asia), where high temperatures and pronounced seasonal precipitation patterns are predominant. DDF are a unique forest ecosystem type harboring a wide range of important and endemic species and need to be adequately represented in global biodiversity conservation strategies. One of the greatest challenges in DDF conservation is the lack of detailed and accurate maps of their distribution due to inaccurate open-canopy seasonal forest mapping methods. Conventional land cover maps therefore tend to perform inadequately with DDF. Our study accurately delineates DDF on a continental scale based on remote sensing approaches by integrating the strong, characteristic seasonality of DDF. We also determine the current conservation status of DDF throughout SE Asia. We chose SE Asia for our research because its remaining DDF are extensive in some areas but are currently degrading and under increasing pressure from significant socio-economic changes throughout the region. Phenological indices, derived from MODIS vegetation index time series, served as input variables for a Random Forest classifier and were used to predict the spatial distribution of DDF. The resulting continuous fields maps of DDF had accuracies ranging from R-2 = 0.56 to 0.78. We identified three hotspots in SE Asia with a total area of 156,000 km(2), and found Myanmar to have more remaining DDF than the countries in SE Asia. Our approach proved to be a reliable method for mapping DDF and other seasonally influenced ecosystems on continental and regional scales, and is very valuable for conservation management in this region.

AB As land use change continues to increase throughout the Amazon basin, there is a pressing need to accurately map, quantify and assess the effects of different factors on forest cover change (FCC). Land tenure may sometimes have important effects on forest cover, yet such effects remain poorly understood in Amazonia, particularly outside Brazil. In this paper we assess whether significant differences in trends of FCC can be partially explained by different land tenure arrangements, using a case study in southwestern Beni (Bolivian Amazon). We examine spatio-temporal dynamics of FCC across four land tenure systems (indigenous titled territory, protected area, logging concession, and private land) by classifying forests using a time-series of Landsat satellite imagery consisting of four dates (1986, 1996, 2001, 2009). Specifically, we unravel (1) trends in early growth and old-growth forest extent, including changes in total cover area, annual change rates, and spatial change dynamics, and (2) trends in old-growth forest fragmentation. To better understand the association between land tenure and FCC, we qualitatively assess the potential role that other underlying and proximate drivers may have had in FCC over the study period. We found that private lands underwent, by far, the largest FCC, that indigenous territories and the protected area had little FCC, and that logging concessions were responsible for the lowest FCC. Our findings suggest that land tenure played a key role in FCC except in private areas, where many other drivers had operated. Our study sheds light into the potential role of land tenure in FCC and has important implications for public policies aimed at socioeconomic development and environmental conservation in the Amazon. We give some policy recommendations drawn from a biocultural conservation perspective that could contribute to implement more inclusive conservation policies in the region. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) is a major pool within the global carbon cycle and understanding its composition (and compositional variability) is critical for predicting its response to future climatic change. Arid and semi-arid regions are typified by relatively low soil organic matter concentrations, but their vast area means that they still represent an important component of the global soil carbon pool. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS) to elucidate basic inter-biome differences in SUM composition. This study provides a first systematic application of py-GC/MS to the analysis of macromolecular SUM across a semi-arid/arid environment; specifically the Fynbos and Succulent Karoo Biomes of South Africa. Data from 27 sites across the region reveal considerable plot-scale variability in SOM quantity and quality, but also demonstrate distinct inter-biome differences in SOM composition. Overall, the pyrolysis data suggest that SOM in the Fynbos Biome contains a higher abundance of minimally/unaltered plant-derived structures, such as lignin and cellulose, in contrast with the more variable, more microbially-altered SOM of the Succulent Karoo. Pyrolysis of soils in the latter biome generally produces higher proportions of simple aromatic and certain nitrogen-bearing pyrolysis products. The majority of soils associated with lowest total organic carbon contents tend to produce a much more limited number of aromatic pyrolysis products. Principal component analyses (PCA) suggest that the overall extent of organic matter degradation is the primary driver of compositional variability across the study area and regardless of biome/ecoregion, the pathways of degradation are essentially similar. Additional affects are also observed, notably in the Succulent Karoo where some soils are relatively enriched in short to mid chain length aliphatic pyrolysis products. Across the whole study area, the extent of degradation, which is broadly represented by the PCA axis 1 scores, is correlated with mean annual rainfall, although the relationship is relatively weak, highlighting the potential significance of other factors, such as local edaphic conditions, soil mineralogy and other mechanisms of dryland SOM degradation such as photo-degradation. Overall, the study demonstrates that despite some known limitations, the systematic application of py-GC/MS can yield insights into large/landscape-scale variability in SOM quality and quantity.

AB Drought and pests are primary abiotic and biotic factors proposed as selective filters acting on species distributions along rainfall gradients in tropical forests and may contribute importantly to species distributional limits, performance, and diversity gradients. Recent research demonstrates linkages between species distributions along rainfall gradients and physiological drought tolerance; corresponding experimental examinations of the contribution of pest pressure to distributional limits and potential interactions between drought and herbivory are limited. This study aims to quantitate differential performance and herbivory as a function of species range limits across a climatic and floristic transition in Southeast Asia. Khao Chong Botanical Garden, Thailand and Pasoh Forest Reserve, Malaysia straddle the Kangar-Pattani Line. A reciprocal transplantation across a seasonality gradient was established using two groups of species ("widespread" taxa whose distributions include seasonally dry forests and "aseasonal" taxa whose distributions are limited to aseasonal forests). Growth, biomass allocation, survival, and herbivory were monitored for 19 months. Systematic differences in performance were a function of species distribution in relation to rainfall seasonality. In aseasonal Pasoh, aseasonal species had both greater growth and survivorship than widespread species. These differences were not a function of differential herbivory as widespread and aseasonal species experienced similar damage in the aseasonal forest. In seasonally dry Khao Chong, widespread species showed higher survivorship than aseasonal species, but these differences were only apparent during drought. We link this differential performance to physiological mechanisms as well as differential tolerance of biotic pressure during drought stress. Systematic decreases in seedling survival in aseasonal taxa during drought corresponded with previously documented physiological differences and may be exacerbated by herbivore damage. These results have important implications for tropical diversity and community composition in light of predicted increases in the frequency and severity of drought in hyperdiverse tropical forests.

AB Forest fragmentation threatens the sustainability of forest interior environments, thereby endangering subordinate ecological attributes and functions. We analyzed the spatial patterns of forest loss and gain for the conterminous United States from 2001 to 2006 to determine whether forest interior environments were maintained at five spatial scales. A1.1% net loss of total forest area translated to net losses of 3.2% to 10.5% of forest interior area over spatial scales of 4.41 ha to 5,310 ha. At the 65.6-ha scale, the reduction of forest interior area was 50,000 km(2) - almost double the net loss of total forest area. The pervasive discrepancy between total forest loss and forest interior loss indicates a widespread shift of the extant forest to more fragmented conditions, even in regions exhibiting small net changes in extant forest area. In the conterminous United States, trends in total forest area underestimate threats to forest from forest fragmentation.

AB A continuing challenge in tropical ecology is to explain the coexistence of large numbers of rain forest tree species. One possible coexistence mechanism is partitioning of the highly variable and dynamic forest light environment, in which species that grow better in one light treatment grow worse in another. To test whether species respond differently to the light environment, we estimated growth rates of 21 Dipterocarpaceae species from Malaysian Borneo grown in shade houses for 2 similar to yr in three light treatments (0.3%, 3%, and 18% full sunlight). We made regular measurements of height, diameter, and aboveground biomass, enabling us to calculate growth rates for each response. We estimated size-specific growth rates using nonlinear mixed-effects models, as average relative growth rate was strongly size dependent. For all species, the greatest diameter growth rate was achieved in 18 percent full sunlight, whereas for five of the twenty-one species, the greatest height growth rate was achieved in three percent full sunlight. We investigated correlations among growth rates in different light treatments, but no negative correlations were found, indicating that species growing well in one light treatment did not grow poorly in the others. There were substantial crossovers, however, in species ranks among the three light treatments, indicating that there was no single growth rate hierarchy common to all light treatments. The lack of a single consistent growth hierarchy across light treatments indicates that heterogeneity in the forest light environment could contribute to the maintenance of the diversity of Dipterocarpaceae found in lowland Bornean rain forests via light-based regeneration niches.

AB I review the distribution of ant genera in cold biomes of the northern hemisphere, and discuss opportunities and challenges in using ants as environmental, ecological, and biodiversity indicators in these biomes. I present five propositions that, if supported with future research, would allow ants to be used as biological indicators in north-temperate cold biomes: (1) Distribution of individual species or species groups are leading (early-warning) indicators of climatic warming at tundra / taiga or taiga / broadleaf forest boundaries; (2) mound-building species in the Formica rufa LINNAEUS, 1761 group are ecological indicators for land-use changes in European taiga and broadleaf forests; (3) relative abundance (evenness) is a leading indicator of environmental changes whereas high species richness is an indicator of past or ongoing disturbance; (4) presence of social parasites and slave-making species are better indicators of ecological integrity than presence or abundance of their hosts alone; (5) occurrence of non-native or invasive species is an indicator of reduced ecological integrity. Important aspects of long-term sampling, surveying, monitoring, and experimenting on ants are discussed in light of future research needs to test these propositions and to further develop ants as indicators of changing environmental conditions in north-temperate cold biomes.

AB There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that tree survival is influenced by negative density-dependence, but it is still controversial how the effect may vary with life-stage, and to what extent it plays a role in regulating tree survival in heterogeneous subtropical forests. In this study, we investigated density-dependent effects on tree survival of six tree species in a 5-ha subtropical forest in eastern China. The roughly 45 000 individuals in the forest were fully censused in 2003 and 2008. For each of these species, we used an inhomogeneous pair-correlation function to quantify the change in spatial distribution for different size classes, and a case-control design to study seedlingadult associations in 2003. Autologistic regression was used to determine the influence of neighborhood factors on individual survival from 2003 to 2008. We found that seedlings of five species were repulsed by distance to nearest conspecific adults in terms of their survival, consistent with predictions of the JanzenConnell mechanism. By contrast, only the least shade-tolerant Schima superba had a negative relationship with individual survival and conspecific distance-weighted basal area. This suggests that the JanzenConnell effect is only prevalent at the early seedling stage or seed-to-seedling phase. The strength of clustering significantly declined at saplingpole and poleadult transitions for Sycopsis sinensis and at seedlingsapling transition for Cleyera pachyphylla. Correlations between individual survival and conspecific abundance for these species were consistent with trends in the strength of clustering. These results suggest that density dependence plays a limited role in individual survival and species spatial structure beyond the early seedling stage (i.e. after true leaves growing) in this forest. In addition, this study indicates that including individuals from early life-stages and factoring out potential confounding factors such as habitat preference are important in studies that seek evidence for density dependence in forest trees.

AB . 1. Abandonment of traditional activities in the rural areas is widespread in the developed world, and in the case of grazing, it is known to have negative consequences on the diversity of plant communities. Few studies have examined the impact of grazing abandonment on fauna, which in the case of ants is of considerable interest, given their usefulness as an indicator for monitoring environmental change. 2. Here, we present the results of a study conducted in Mediterranean grasslands of central Spain. Using pitfall traps, ants were sampled from 10 40 mx 20 m plots; five of them located in grazed systems and five in abandoned grazing systems. Descriptors used for the ant assemblage were ant species composition, ant species richness, ant functional groups, and subguilds of granivores. We used a seed bait test to discriminate between granivorous and non-granivorous ant species. 3. Our results show that abandoned grazing systems have more ant species and more heterogeneous ant assemblages. Changes in ant species composition and ant functional groups are more pronounced in habitats where woody encroachment progresses more rapidly (i.e. dry sectors and tree islands). Specialised granivores have reduced importance in the same habitat types. Conversely, facultative granivores increase their presence in abandoned grazing systems. 4. The increased functional and species ant diversity observed with grazing abandonment can be explained by the generation of a more heterogeneous environment at the smaller scales, in spite of being more homogenous at the larger scales, because the latter are less significant for the organisms studied.

AB Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are world-wide established with the aim of conserving biodiversity and preventing overexploitation of marine organisms. Evaluating the effectiveness of MPAs is needed in order to support and implement their management, but it is complicated by the large natural variability in space and time of distribution and abundance of natural populations. Here, we tested the hypothesis that patterns of total abundance and size-frequency distribution of two intensively harvested intertidal species (the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis) differed between a protected and three reference shores along the rocky coast of north Portugal. Response variables were in terms of mean values and measures of variance at different spatial scales (from centimetres to metres) and over time (along a period of about 12 months). A further comparison involved the estimation of the reproductive potential of sea urchins, quantified as variations of Gonad Index (GI = gonad dry weight/body dry weight x 100) at the scale of shore. Results did not generally support a predictable direct effect of protection, as the total abundance and the abundance of larger individuals of both species and Cl did not differ between the MPA and reference shores. However, a considerable temporal and spatial variability at smaller scales was detected for several response variables. Such findings have implications for management of MPAs, highlighting the need for sampling designs properly replicated in space and time, in order to examine their effectiveness, and for considering spatial and temporal heterogeneity of target populations and driving processes as a criterion for their implementation and design.

AB Core areas are highly used parts of the home range on which the survival of solitary or group-living animals depends. We investigated the home range and core area size and area fidelity of a spider monkey community in a tropical dry forest over a 4-year period. Home ranges overlapped extensively across years, subgroup sizes, and seasons. In contrast, spider monkeys used core areas that varied in size and location across the study years, subgroup sizes, and seasons. These shifts in core areas suggest that the understanding of core areas, and thus the spatial requirements, of a species in a particular habitat may be limited if based on short-term studies. In this respect, our findings emphasize the importance of long-term studies of the spatial ecology of any species in a particular habitat. Our study also shows that the yearly home range basically includes all the core areas from different years, seasons, and subgroup sizes (i.e., the super-core area). This is conceptually important for territorial species, such as spider monkeys, which defend a stable home range as it contains not only the current, but also the future core areas.

AB Balancing ever-increasing agricultural and biofuel needs with biodiversity conservation is one of the greatest challenges facing conservation biologists in the 21st century. The conversion of > 75 million hectares of forests in Brazilian Amazonia over four decades for agropastoral uses has resulted in the 'creation' of a similar-sized amount of non-forest 'agricultural matrix' habitats. Despite extensive research on the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on the Amazonian biota, the value of increasingly larger areas of non-forest habitat for forest wildlife remains poorly understood. We conducted 325 fixed-radius point counts of the avifaunal assemblage of non-forest vegetation within a 1200-km(2) region along the Amazonian 'Arc of Deforestation' in Northern Mato Grosso, Brazil. Our sampling included 2,814 records of 164 species, 15 and 54% of which were recorded in more than 10% and fewer than 2% of all sampling sites, respectively. In particular, nearly 70% of the regional scale avifauna of 560 species failed to use the agricultural matrix, regardless of the persistence of ameliorating structural features, such as isolated trees. At the local scale, higher species richness in the agricultural matrix was best predicted by the presence of relictual trees, and to a lesser extent by standing water and scrubby habitats. The presence of relictual trees, rather than scrub, predicted the occurrence of those forest-dependent species that did use the agricultural matrix. Our results indicate that intensive agricultural production coupled with land sparing would better suit conservation of vulnerable forest species than more extensive 'wildlife friendly' agricultural practices that require more land under production to produce the same yield.

AB Surface litter decomposition in arid and semiarid ecosystems is often faster than predicted by climatic parameters such as annual precipitation or evapotranspiration, or based on standard indices of litter quality such as lignin or nitrogen concentrations. Abiotic photodegradation has been demonstrated to be an important factor controlling aboveground litter decomposition in aridland ecosystems, but soil fauna, particularly macrofauna such as termites and ants, have also been identified as key players affecting litter mass loss in warm deserts. Our objective was to quantify the importance of soil organisms on surface litter decomposition in the Patagonian steppe in the absence of photodegradative effects, to establish the relative importance of soil organisms on rates of mass loss and nitrogen release. We estimated the relative contribution of soil fauna and microbes to litter decomposition of a dominant grass using litterboxes with variable mesh sizes that excluded groups of soil fauna based on size class (10, 2, and 0.01 mm), which were placed beneath shrub canopies. We also employed chemical repellents (naphthalene and fungicide). The exclusion of macro- and mesofauna had no effect on litter mass loss over 3 years (P = 0.36), as litter decomposition was similar in all soil fauna exclusions and naphthalene-treated litter. In contrast, reduction of fungal activity significantly inhibited litter decomposition (P < 0.001). Although soil fauna have been mentioned as a key control of litter decomposition in warm deserts, biogeographic legacies and temperature limitation may constrain the importance of these organisms in temperate aridlands, particularly in the southern hemisphere.

AB Climatic change is expected to have differential effects on ecological communities in different geographic areas. However, few studies have experimentally demonstrated the effects of warming on communities simultaneously at different locales. We manipulated air temperature with in situ passive warming and cooling chambers and quantified effects of temperature on ant abundance, diversity, and foraging activities (predation, scavenging, seed dispersal, nectivory, granivory) in two deciduous forests at 35 degrees and 43 degrees N latitude in the eastern U.S. In the southern site, the most abundant species, Crematogaster lineolata, increased while species evenness, most ant foraging activities, and abundance of several other ant species declined with increasing temperature. In the northern site, species evenness was highest at intermediate temperatures, but no other metrics of diversity or foraging activity changed with temperature. Regardless of temperature, ant abundance and foraging activities at the northern site were several orders of magnitude lower than those in the southern site.

AB Little is known about the natural history of phorid parasitoids of leaf-cutting ants, an important pest in the Neotropics. This is particularly so for phorids attacking Acromyrmex species. We searched for phorids ovipositing and reared them from ants collected in the field. We found that these phorids formed a guild. Acromyrmex phorids selected ants from all sizes available outside the nests, whereas Atta phorids did not parasitize the smallest workers and soldiers. Maximum parasitism by phorids was 12% for Acromyrmex and 35% for Atta hosts, percentages higher than any reported previously. Some phorid species coexisting in a site showed differences in developmental times. Only 1.1% of phorids collected over hosts were males; however, as the male : female ratios from parasitoid rearing did not differ from one, mating is suspected to occur elsewhere. Our results helped to increase the knowledge of the phorids of leaf-cutters, and highlighted their potential use for the biocontrol of these ants.

AB More than ninety years after Wheeler's 1919 "Ants of Borneo," we present a comprehensive list of the Bornean ant fauna, recorded in the states of Brunei, Sabah and Sarawak (Malaysia), and Kalimantan (Indonesia). Our critical review of ant literature resulted in a catalogue of 97 ant genera with 717 valid species and 52 additional subspecies of ants from 12 subfamilies, including eight genera for which, up to now, only morphospecies have been recorded in Borneo. The subfamilies Myrmicinae (315) and Formicinae (213) comprised the most species; the most speciose genera were Polyrhachis (98) and Strumigenys (71), followed by Pheidole, Camponotus and Crematogaster. However, half of the Bornean ant genera included only one or two species, for example, the endemic monotypic genera Anomalomyrma, Bregmatomyrma, Ishakidris, Loweriella, Secostruma and Tetheamyrma. Ant taxonomic research in Borneo dates back to the nineteen century and has resulted in 418 type descriptions, of which 390 are currently valid. Since many habitats of Borneo have still not been effectively sampled, the actual number of Bornean ant species may be much higher; we estimate that at least 1,100 species are to be expected. As destruction of natural habitat on Borneo is accelerating, great conservation efforts must urgently be made if current ant diversity is to be saved.

AB The neutral theory of biodiversity purports that patterns in the distribution and abundance of species do not depend on adaptive differences between species (i.e. niche differentiation) but solely on random fluctuations in population size ("ecological drift"), along with dispersal and speciation. In this framework, the ultimate driver of biodiversity is speciation. However, the original neutral theory made strongly simplifying assumptions about the mechanisms of speciation, which has led to some clearly unrealistic predictions. In response, several recent studies have combined neutral community models with more elaborate speciation models. These efforts have alleviated some of the problems of the earlier approaches, while confirming the general ability of neutral theory to predict empirical patterns of biodiversity. However, the models also show that the mode of speciation can have a strong impact on relative species abundances. Future work should compare these results to diversity patterns arising from non-neutral modes of speciation, such as adaptive radiations.

AB Fire plays an important role in determining the structure of savannas, so that frequent fires tend to favor the herbaceous species in savannas. Functional diversity is a measure of the range of the species functional traits and is thought to be related to many functions and properties like community stability, nutrient cycling, and productivity, for example. We examined if functional diversity of herbaceous species was different along a fire gradient, and if observed functional diversity differed from a random assembly of species traits. We sampled three sites with different fire frequencies. According to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, we expected the functional diversity to be higher in the intermediate fire frequency site. Subsequently, we excluded rare species from the analyses - species with less than ten individuals in each site - to verify their contribution to the observed patterns of functional diversity. We expected to find no difference with the exclusion of rare species. Functional diversity values, either considering all species or excluding the rare ones, were not different among sites, suggesting that (1) frequent fires may not affect overall functioning of the herbaceous community in savannas and (2) rare herbaceous species seem to present lower functional complementarity. According to the neutral theory, most of the herbaceous species may have evolved stochastically in niches more similar than competitive exclusion could allow. Also, functional diversity was not different from what one may expect by chance in any of the three sites. We also calculated the floristic similarity among sites. When we considered qualitative data, we found floristic differences between the sites of high and intermediate as well as between high and low fire frequency sites, but there was no difference between the intermediate and low fire frequency situation. Floristic similarities were different among all the three sites when the abundances of species were considered. Consequently, different fire conditions may change species composition without affecting the functional diversity of the herbaceous layer of savannas, corroborating the idea that savannas are more stable in functional than in floristic terms.

AB Based on Fligstein's (1990) work on 'conceptions of control' (broad managerial paradigms), this paper provides an analysis of the ways in which information technology (IT) artefacts shape and are shaped by institutional contexts. Specifically, we report on primary and secondary empirical data that spans a 44-year period pertaining to the uses made of the Amazon rainforest monitoring system (a set of satellite-based geographic information systems). This paper argues that: (1) the process of institutional change is conflictual, emergent and contested; (2) the design and use of IT artefacts tend to reflect the currently dominant conceptions of control; (3) that IT artefacts that emerge within a specific conception of control can be later reconfigured to serve the interests of other conceptions of control; (4) and finally, IT artefacts might unintentionally reinforce alternate conceptions of control and lead to institutional change.

AB Aim The invasion of natural communities by alien species represents a serious threat, but creates opportunities to learn about community functions. Neutral theory proposes that the niche concept may not be needed to explain the assemblage and diversity of natural communities, challenging the classical view of community ecology and generating a lasting debate. Biological invasions, when considered as natural experiments, can be used to contrast some of the predictions of neutral and classic niche theories.
   Location Global.
   Methods We use data from biological invasions as natural experiments to contrast some of the fundamental predictions of neutral theory.
   Results Some emerging patterns did not differ from neutral model expectations (e. g. the relationship between native and exotic species richness, invasibility of resource-rich habitats, and the relationship between propagule release and invasion success). Nevertheless, other patterns (e. g. experimental evidence of the relationship between diversity and susceptibility to invasion, the invasion of communities with a low resource availability, invasiveness related to species traits) contrasted with the predictions that can be inferred from neutral theory.
   Main conclusions Neutral theory correctly highlights the need to include randomness in models of community structure. Biological invasion patterns show that neutral forces are important in structuring natural communities, but the patterns differ from those inferred from a complete neutral model. For biodiversity-conservation purposes, the implications of accepting or not accepting neutral theory as a process-based theory are very important.

AB The search for indicators to monitor management impact on biodiversity is a crucial question because management practices promote changes in community structure and composition of different animal groups. This study explores the effect of widely conducted management practices (forest logging and livestock) in Pinus uncinata forests in the Pyrenees range (NE Spain) on the structure and composition of ground ant communities compared to those of old-growth stands. Forest structure clearly differed in stands with different forest managements. These stands managed for different uses also showed marked differences in structure and composition of ground ant communities. There was a great dominance of a single species, Formica lugubris, which accounted for 99% of ants collected in pitfall traps. Rarefaction curves indicated that species richness was highest in old-growth stands and lowest in even-aged ones, with woodland pasture stands showing an intermediate value. Classification methods allowed us to identify two groups of species: six species related to old-growth plots and three species (including F. lugubris) associated to managed stands. Habitat structure played an important role in determining the structure of ant communities: forests with high tree density but low basal area were the most favourable forest type for F. lugubris, while the abundance of the remaining ant species was negatively affected by the abundance of F. lugubnis and by tree cover.

AB Increase in rainfall variability has important consequences for organisms in arid and semiarid regions around the world. In South American and Australian deserts, the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon greatly influences rainfall patterns, and therefore the dynamics of plant communities. However, the field data needed to assess the effect of climate change on vegetational patterns is difficult to obtain because of the large spatial scale required for such studies. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) characteristics allow the use of several indexes related to vegetational structure. Due to its direct relationship with primary productivity, it is possible to obtain several measures of annual productivity. These include annual plant yield, annual maximum yield, onset of 'greening-up' and senescence phases, length of the 'green' season, vegetation peak, and therefore, the periods when more or less food is available for herbivores. After verification with ground-truth measures, we used NDVI data from two semiarid localities in north-central Chile (Fray Jorge and Auco) to determine the relationship between rainfall patterns and vegetation cover and productivity related to El Nino phenomenon. With this information we gauge the influence of climatic processes on primary productivity in western South America, an area subject to strong climate variability. We predict significant variation in Chilean semiarid regions due to climate change, affecting mainly the extent and timing of annual growth season of vegetation, and also including a shorter and delayed greening-up season. Also, we predict that important decreases in rainfall levels will not have strong effects on primary production in these semiarid ecosystems.

AB The aim of this work was to explore the relationship between population density of Akodon azarae (Muridae: Sigmodontinae) and climatic and environmental variables, and determine which of them are associated to within and among-year changes in rodent abundance in agro-ecosystems from south Cordoba, Argentina. The study was carried out in a rural area of central Argentina, from 1983 to 2003. Density was estimated as a relative density index (RDI). Temperature, precipitation and humidity were obtained from records of the National University of Rio Cuarto. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature were recorded from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (1983-1998) and Landsat (1998-2003) imagery data sets. We performed simple correlations, multiple regressions and distributed lag analysis. Direct association of climatic and environmental variables with RDI was in general, low. The amount of variability in seasonal changes in density explained by climatic and environmental variables altogether varied from 10% to 70%. Seasonal population fluctuations were influenced by NDVI and rainfall with one and two seasons of delay. Autumn maximum density of the species was also associated with vegetation and rainfall of previous seasons. There also seemed to be an indirect influence of rainfall through vegetation given that we found a positive correlation between them. Results were consistent with basic aspects of the ecology of the species, such as its strong preference for highly covered areas, which provide food and protection from predators, likely increasing its reproductive success. Therefore, in the rural area central Argentina, A. azarae showed seasonal fluctuations with delayed influence of rainfall and vegetation and indirect effects of rainfall.

AB In order to assess the potential value of differently managed cacao plantations for bird conservation on Sulawesi, We Surveyed birds in near-primary forest (with limited timber and rattan extraction, and Some hunting), cacao plantations with remnant forest trees and plantations lacking forest trees, from February to April 2007. A total of 16 50 x 50 in plots were visited twice and records of 87 species were obtained. Bird species richness and the number of endemics and forest specialists decreased along this gradient of forest conversion, With 20% of the forest specialists, among them 10 endemics, exclusively found in forest. Species composition changed dramatically between habitat types. Sorensen indices showed a similarity of species composition between forests and plantarions of 45-60% for forest specialists and 65-71% for all species. The most important environmental variable for the diversity and composition of birds was the number of remnant rainforest trees present in the plantations. Our results Suggest that large, undisturbed rainforest arc, most important for the conservation of forest specialists and endemics but that cacao plantations, if managed to maintain a high and diverse cover of forest trees, call harbour up to 60% of forest specialists and endemics.

AB Fragmentation of old-growth forests and greatly reduced amounts of coarse dead wood in managed forests threat the persistence of many saproxylic species in boreal Fennoscandia. Individual old-growth forest remnants may lose species over time as they pay off their extinction debt. We tested this by comparing the observed site occupancy of individual wood-inhabiting fungal species in isolated old-growth stands (i.e. woodland key habitats; WKHs) with statistical predictions of their occupancy assuming potential extinction debt had already been paid off. The occupancy of species was analysed in two sets of WKHs differing in time since isolation (i.e. recent and old isolates).
   Few species occurred more frequently than expected in WKHs. However, patterns across species and across all WKHs masked important differences among species in their risk of facing future extinction. The site occupancy decreased significantly between recent and old isolates for a group of annual, red-listed specialist fungal species, suggesting that an extinction debt in WKHs may exist among specific species confined to coarse dead wood and old-growth forest habitat. Generalist species that also occur in the surrounding matrix showed no negative trends, or actually increased in site occupancy, making future extinctions less likely. Thus, continuing loss of threatened species are likely if not preservation of WKHs are combined with other conservation efforts in managed forest landscapes. Natural forest landscapes may serve as important references when aiming to identify species in risk of future extinction but more detailed knowledge about the biology of the most vulnerable species is also required.

AB Lianas differ from trees in many life history characteristics, and we predicted that they are phenotypically more responsive to environmental variation than trees. We analyzed responsiveness to light and nutrient availability of five Bauhinia species (three lianas and two trees). Seedlings were grown in a shade house in two light regimes (5 and 25% Of full Sunlight) and two nutrient Supply regimes (field soil and N fertilization equivalent to 100 kg ha(-1)), and important growth-related physiological and morphological plant parameters were measured. Light availability affected most of the measured variables, whereas N addition had only weak effects. In the four light-demanding species (two lianas and two trees), relative plant biomass growth rate increased and specific leaf area (SLA) decreased with increased light availability, whereas a shade-tolerant liana did not respond. Leaf N concentration and light-saturated photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area increased in response to increased irradiance or soil N in the light-demanding tree species and the shade-tolerant liana, but not in the two light-demanding lianas. The light-demanding lianas also had higher SLA and leaf mass ratio, resulting in a higher leaf area ratio (LAR) in high light, whereas the light-demanding trees did not. Across all treatments, mean plasticity indices of physiological and morphological traits, and all traits combined were similar among the studied species. Plasticity was higher in response to light than to N, indicating that light is the main factor controlling seedling responses of the Studied species. Although lianas and trees did not differ in mean plasticity in response to light and N, the light-demanding lianas were phenotypically less plastic in LAR and in photosynthetic rates and biomass allocation than the trees. Light and N interacted in their effects on most physiological variables, but the consequences for relative growth rate differed little among species. We conclude that, contrary to Our predictions, lianas were no more responsive to variation in light and N availability than trees.

AB This study investigated the impacts of soil fungi on seeds of two eastern North American temperate-zone trees: Acer saccharum Marsh. (sugar maple) and Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr (eastern hemlock). Seeds of each species were buried at locations dominated by either conspecifics or heterospecifics. Half were protected with fungicide, and the net consequences for survival and germination were assessed. Net effects of fungicide usually were positive, indicating that pathogens affected seeds more strongly than any potential mutualists. Losses of A. saccharum to fungi were modest, and almost identical in areas dominated by itself versus areas dominated by T. canadensis. In contrast, fungal impacts on T. canadensis were strongly habitat-dependent: losses to fungi were high in T. canadensis-dominated sites, but not in A. saccharum-dominated sites. This result is consistent with an accumulation of host-specific pathogens, either by a direct feedback between T. canadensis and its fungal enemies, or indirectly through modification of the soil environment. Even though these two trees share similar habitats, responses to fungicide indicate that their seeds are affected very differently by the soil environment.

AB Forest fragmentation is thought to threaten primate populations, yet the mechanisms by which this occurs remain largely unknown. However, fragmentation is known to cause dietary shifts in several primate species, and links between food resource distribution and within-group spatial dynamics are well documented. Thus, fragmentation has the potential to indirectly affect spatial dynamics, and these changes may present additional stresses to fragmented populations. I present the results from a 12-month study of Propithecus diadema at Tsinjoarivo, eastern Madagascar, including two groups in fragments and two in continuous forest. Instantaneous data on activity and spatial position were collected during all-day focal animal follows. Fragment groups had much lower cohesion, being more likely to have no neighbor within 5 and 10 m. For continuous forest groups, cohesion was highest in the rainy season (when food patches are large) and lowest in winter (when the animals rely on small-crowned mistletoes), and the chance of having no neighbor within 5 m was positively correlated with mistletoe consumption. Thus the decreased cohesion in fragment groups is inferred to result from their increased reliance on mistletoes and other small resources, which causes them to spread out among multiple patches. This scenario is consistent with the reduced body mass of subordinate individuals (males and immatures) in fragments, and suggests the occurrence of steeper within-group fitness gradients. Further research is necessary to determine whether these patterns apply to other primates; however, since fragmentation tends to cause the loss of the largest trees, many primates in fragments may lose their largest food resources and undergo similar behavioral shifts.

ID LANDSCAPE CHANGE; DEFORESTATION; LEVEL
AB This paper considers the size of a farmer's property as a key variable influencing land cover and land cover change in rural areas of developing countries. Data from 126 rural familial properties in the region around the city of Santarem, Pari, in the Brazilian Amazon, indicate that property size is important for understanding the trajectories of land cover change. Past research has focused on the distinction between small family farms and large capitalized farms, arguing that family farmers have a higher deforestation intensity, or on estimating the strength of the effect of property size relative to economic or demographic factors. This paper shows that larger familial properties are able both to retain a larger area in forest and to have long enough cycles of use and fallow to allow previously used land to become forested again. Based on these analyses and discussion, we argue that land use and land cover research must consider property size as an organizing principle in order to better comprehend the reciprocal relationship between population and environment in frontier areas of the Brazilian Amazon and other rural landscapes.

AB The distribution of intertidal organisms can often be determined by processes operating at the time of recruitment. Recruitment has been demonstrated to influence the composition of assemblages of natural habitats, but there is less evidence of its importance in artificial habitats. Coastal areas are becoming increasingly urbanised, with the replacement of many natural habitats by man-made structures. It is, therefore, important to test processes that influence the structure of assemblages in artificial habitats in order to evaluate whether processes act in a way that is predictable from knowledge of natural shores. Much of the foreshore of Sydney Harbour has been replaced by seawalls, many of which are built in association with wharves. It has been shown that features of wharves may cause small-scale differences between assemblages on adjacent sections of seawalls which are under or not under wharves. The present study tested the hypothesis that these patterns are determined by differences in recruitment, by monitoring recruitment to experimental clearings and settlement plates in both habitats. In general, algae and mobile invertebrates had greater cover or abundance on unshaded seawalls, while sessile invertebrates had greater cover on shaded seawalls. Not all taxa in these habitats recruited to experimental clearings or plates, but the abundance or cover of those that did resembled patterns observed in the surrounding established assemblage. This indicates that, at least for some organisms on intertidal seawalls, patterns of distribution are determined at the time of recruitment and are probably influenced by shading. Furthermore, patterns in the present study were similar to what was predicted from work done on natural shores, showing that studies from natural shores can be applied to these artificial habitats.

AB By using pitfall traps, the effects of rainfall and habitat type on the denso-activity of epigean arthropods Tenebrionidae in particular-inhabiting at Llanos de Challe National Park were investigated. This park is located in the Chile's transitional coastal desert, Atacama's III Region. Sampling was conducted during three days per month (september. october and december) in the period of maximal biological activity of the system, and in 1989 (dry no-ENSO year), 1997 (intense ENSO-year), and 2000 (damp no-ENSO year). Two pedological contrasting sites were used to compare the effects of the factors being examined: a coastal dune habitat and an interior stony habitat. The presence of 15 orders of Arthropoda was recorded. Hexapods made the > 95 % of total specimens captured (9,065 individuals), with Collembola (36.1 %) and Coleoptera (29.8 %) being the orders with the highest numerical representativeness. The numbers of orders with active members varied slightly among years: 13 orders were recorded in 1989 (44 % rainfall below the average), 15 in 1997 (443 % rainfall above the average), and 11 in 2000 (52 % above average). The effect of the ENSO event was clearly reflected in the numerical contribution both for the years Studied and for most of the recorded taxa. Although more Subtlety. this effect was also reflected in the assemblage composition of dominant taxa and between pedological habitats, particularly in regard to Tenebrionidae and Formicidae. Specially in the coastal dunes, Tenebrionidae clearly dominated the assemblage of epigean arthropods, being Gyriosomus Guerin-Meneville the most abundant and diverse genus. The dominance of Gyriosomus sets a number of questions regarding the levels of endemism, species diversity and distribution, and their functional role in the ecosystem Studied.

AB It is now generally accepted that the relationship between vegetation and climate is dynamic: vegetation is influenced by climate, but. feedbacks between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere mean that vegetation also affects climate. From this it follows that land use changes may have climatic consequences. Specifically, it is widely believed that forest clearance may inhibit rainfall. Although models often support this view, this is not universally the case, and empirical evidence is scarce. We have compiled a database of forest cover and precipitation for the state of Sao Paulo, which lies within the diverse and highly endangered Atlantic forest region of Brazil. We do not find a strong relationship between forest cover and total rainfall, which appears to be influenced primarily by factors such as distance to the coast; but significant positive relationships between tree cover and the number of rain days consistently emerge. The degree of forest fragmentation seems to influence this relationship, with patchier forests associated with fewer rain days; and tree cover also predicts interannual variability in rainfall. The directionality of these relationships, is inferred by considering only sites which are known to have been forested in the recent past. Given that across Sao Paulo state there is no overall trend for a reduction in rainfall over the study period (1962-1992), it would appear that important local-scale processes may be hidden by regional trends. We discuss these results with reference to conservation strategies in fragmented landscapes. For instance, the spatial scale over which tree cover-precipitation relationships occur appears to be somewhat larger. than that over which studies of tropical forest fragmentation typically operate, but similar to the area, of habitat deemed necessary to maintain viable populations of several Atlantic forest species.

AB We examine the role of the native fox, Pseudalopex culpaeus, as a frugivore and seed disperser in a semiarid thornscrub of Chile. We quantified the fruit and animal components in its diet versus the availability of fruits and small mammals in the field over a 2-year period (January 1998 through February 2000). We tested the legitimacy and effectiveness of foxes as dispersers by quantifying the percentages of seed viability and of germination of seeds that passed through fox gut versus those picked from plants. We also studied their efficiency as dispersers, monitoring the fate of seeds in faeces placed in the field. The highest frequencies of fruit consumption by foxes were observed when abundances of small mammal prey were < 6 individuals per hectare, regardless of fruit abundance in the field. Thus, foxes consumed fruits as a supplementary food resource. Based on 326 faeces, the total number of fruits consumed was about 34 000 over the 2-year study period, and fruits from the alien shrub Schinus molle represented 98% of that total, with the native Porlieria chilensis a distant second. Germination and viability of defecated seeds of P. chilensis were reduced by 66% and 48%, respectively, in comparison to controls. In contrast, germination of seeds of S. molle increased by 50% and no effect on viability was observed. With regard to P. chilensis, foxes were legitimate (they defecated viable seeds), but ineffective (seeds in faeces had lower germination than those taken directly from parental plants and there was no seedling establishment in the field) and inefficient dispersers (seeds in faeces were deposited on microhabitats hostile to seed germination and seedling establishment). However, with regard to S. molle, foxes were legitimate, effective (seeds in faeces had higher germination than those taken directly from parental plants; there was germination but no establishment in the field), and efficient dispersers (over 41% of seeds were deposited on safe microsites). Thus, a native fox may be contributing to the spread of an alien shrub, co-opting existing community processes.

AB The density and floristic composition of the soil seed bank was assessed in six cloud forest fragments with different levels of human disturbance in central Veracruz, Mexico. A total of 8416 seeds germinated in 60 soil samples, at 5-cm depth, corresponding to 107 species, 85 genera, and 48 families. Significant differences were found among study sites in seed densities with values ranging from 873 to 3632/m(2). Tree species contributed 20 percent of the total soil seed bank in four sites and herbs accounted for the majority of the species in each site. Among tree species, Trema micrantha displayed the highest seed density, accounting for 84 percent of the germinated seeds. In general, the tree species composition of the soil seed bank did not closely reflect the composition of the tree community. Results suggest that disturbance produced by human activities (trail use, selective cutting of trees, livestock) may influence the size and composition of the soil seed bank in forest fragments. Sites where human activity has been reduced showed the highest proportion of dormant seeds.

AB The effects of harvesting of callianassid shrimp (Trypaea australiensis) on the abundance and composition of macrobenthic assemblages in unvegetated sediments of a subtropical coastal embayment in Queensland, Australia were examined using a combination of sampling and manipulative experiments. First, the abundance and composition of the benthic infauna in an area regularly used for the collection of shrimp for bait by recreational anglers was compared with multiple reference areas. Second, a BACI design, with multiple reference areas, was used to examine the short-term effects of harvesting on the benthic assemblages from an intensive commercialised fishing competition. Third, a large-scale, controlled manipulative experiment, where shrimp were harvested from 10,000 m(2) plots at intensities commensurate with those from recreational and commercial operators, was done to determine the impacts on different components of the infaunal assemblage.
   Only a few benthic taxa showed significant declines in abundance in response to the removal of ghost shrimp from the unvegetated sediments. There was evidence, however, of more subtle effects with changes in the degree of spatial variation (patchiness) of several taxa as a result of harvesting.. Groups such as capitellid polychaetes, gammarid amphipods and some bivalves were significantly more patchy in their distribution in areas subjected to harvesting than reference areas, at a scale of tens of metres. This scale corresponds to the patterns of movement and activity of recreational harvesters working in these areas. In contrast, patchiness in the abundance of ghost shrimp decreased significantly under harvesting at scales of hundreds of metres, in response to harvesters focussing their efforts on areas with greater numbers of burrow entrances, leading to a more even distribution of the animals. Controlled experimental harvesting caused declines in the abundance of soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus), polychaetes and amphipods and an increase in the spatial patchiness of polychaetes. Populations of ghost shrimp were, however, resilient to harvesting over extended periods of time. In conclusion, harvesting of ghost shrimp for bait by recreational and commercial fishers causes significant but localised impacts on a limited range of benthic fauna in unvegetated sediments, including changes in the degree of spatial patchiness in their distribution.

AB The diversity of plants in tropical forests makes dietary studies of frugivores difficult. This paper provides a botanical inventory of a tropical seasonal forest community in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. The forest is valuable from a conservation perspective because it is one of the last remaining intact forests in northeastern Thailand, and is an important refuge for many animal and plant species. A 4-ha inventory plot measuring 200 x 200 m was established and all plants greater than or equal to 10 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) were measured and permanently labeled. We found 1610 stems belonging to 105 species, 76 genera and 35 families, with a combined basal area of 142.5 m(2). The community was dominated by species of Lauraceae, Cornaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Meliaceae, and Elaeocarpaceae. About one-third of the plant species ( 40 spp.) identified in this study were vulnerable to extinction because they were mostly dispersed by large frugivores, which were intolerant of human impact. If they disappear, these forests may become dominated by plant species that are dispersed by abiotic means and species with small-seeded fruits.

ID COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DIVERSITY; SUSTAINABILITY; DISTURBANCE; DENSITY
AB To assess the effect of on-going and of previous or near by hunting pressure on game birds in a neotropical rain forest (French Guiana), I compared species abundances between six hunted and disturbed areas, seven non-hunted and pristine areas and eight intermediate areas, undisturbed and not currently hunted, but formerly hunted or close to current hunting areas. I recorded all birds detected within 100 m-wide strip transects, walked at random through every forest type all day long. The frequency of records per 10 h and flock sizes on each transect were averaged over all surveys in each study site (N = 3025 h). Censused groups included terrestrial (tinamous, woodquails, curassow and trumpeter) and arboreal species (guans, macaws, parrots, toucans), but not waterbirds. The abundance of all game birds was higher in non-hunted than in hunted areas, though not always significantly for secretive understorey species (tinamous, guans, wood-quail) or canopy frugivores (parrots, macaws, toucans). The Black Curassow and Gray-winged Trumpeter exhibited the highest and most consistent increases (7-10-fold) and more so between intermediate and non-hunted sites than between hunted and intermediate sites. The mean flock size also increased along the hunting gradient, especially in flocking species (macaws, parrots, trumpeter). Low reproductive rates and/or seasonal movements may explain that hunting pressure could still be felt after hunting has ceased or when it persists only away from a given area. Such a persistent effect would affect some populations in small protected areas.

AB The spatial distribution and abundance of animals are in part determined by the distribution and abundance of their resource base. In the Central Andes of Colombia, monospecific tree plantations have been used to recover vegetative cover in watershed protection programs, but these plantations differ from natural forests in structure, composition, and resources available to wildlife. To evaluate these plantations as habitat for wildlife, we compared the diversity and abundance of understory birds, flowers, and fruits between juxtaposed 40-yr-old patches of exotic Chinese ash (Fraxinus chinensis) plantations and naturally regenerated forest of the same age. We observed more fruiting species in the regenerated forest, but there were no differences in total flower and fruit availability between habitat types. We also observed differences between habitats in the size of some understory shrubs, but these differences did not lead to differences between habitats in the diversity and abundance of birds. Capture rates of nectarivores correlated with resource abundance at sampling plot scale, but no such correlation was found for frugivores. Understory frugivorous birds are apparently functioning at a larger spatial scale than the patchiness created by the two habitats. Nectarivorous birds are responding to small-scale patchiness in resource availability, but not to the different habitats. These results indicate that at small scales, the ash plantation understory provides adequate habitat for birds.

AB Intertidal invertebrates are model organisms for examining the environmental control of life-history traits because of the sharp gradients in biological and physical factors found in their habitat, including wave action, temperature, food availability, and predation. However, the effect of a particular factor on ecological and evolutionary processes is difficult to separate when multiple factors vary simultaneously. We examined shifts in life-history traits in the intertidal gastropod Littorina saxatilis Olivi across an intertidal shoreline where predation appears to have little influence. We determined the density, size, fecundity, and size at maturity of snails in 4 distinct zones across the shoreline and estimated growth rates in each zone. Size, fecundity, median size at maturity, and growth rate all exhibited pronounced clines across the shoreline with higher values in the lower zones, where food abundance was highest. Snail density, however, peaked in the mid-zones. The clines in life-history traits corresponded with food availability and environmental stress (wave forces and desiccation stress), and these factors were the likely determinants of the patterns observed. We also conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment between the extreme zones to assess if any differences in growth rate might have a genetic basis. Snails transplanted from the high zone to the low zone grew 7 times faster than snails that remained in the high zone and, more unexpectedly, 1.6 times greater than local snails from the low zone. Snails transplanted from the low zone to the high zone did not grow at all while local snails from the high zone had slow, although measurable, growth. These divergent responses of transplanted snails (i.e. counter-gradient variation) suggest that there may be differential size-dependent selection between the extreme zones with the greater wave forces of the low shore selecting against fast growth which would otherwise be supported by the abundance of food found there.

AB We compared the bird distributions in the understorey of treefall gaps and sites with intact canopy in Amazonian terra firme forest in Brazil. We compiled 2216 mist-net captures (116 species) in 32 gap and 32 forest sites over 22.3 months. Gap habitats differed from forest habitats in having higher capture rates, total captures, species richness and diversity. Seventeen species showed a significantly different distribution of captures between the two habitats (13 higher in gap and four higher in forest). Gap habitats had higher capture rates for nectarivores, frugivores and insectivores. Among insectivores, capture rates for solitary insectivores and army ant followers did not differ between the two habitats. In contrast, capture rates were higher in gaps for members of mixed-species insectivore flocks and mixed-species insectivore-frugivore flocks. Insectivores, especially members of mixed-species flocks, were the predominant species in gap habitats, where frugivores and nectarivores were relatively uncommon. Although few canopy species were captured in gap or forest habitats, visitors from forest mid-storey constituted 42% of the gap specialist species (0% forest) and 46% of rare gap species (38% forest). Insectivore, and total, captures increased over time, but did so more rapidly in gap than in forest habitats, possibly as a response to gap succession. However, an influx of birds displaced by nearby timber harvest also may have caused these increases. Avian gap-use in Amazonian terra firme forests differs from gap-use elsewhere, partly because of differences in forest characteristics such as stature and soil fertility, indicating that the avian response to gaps is context dependent.

AB The demography of the acaulescent palm Attalea humilis was studied from 1996 to 1999 in three forest fragments (1.6, 6.4, and 9.9 ha) in southeastern Brazil (22degrees30'-22degrees33' S, 42degrees15'-42degrees19' W). A human-induced fire damaged the populations in August-September 1997. Palm density was higher in the medium-sized fragment, where it was concentrated in a single disturbed sector. Population ontogenetic stage structure was dependent on fragment and year, but in general later stages were more abundant than initial ones. Population finite growth rates projected from linear, stage-structured demographic models indicated that the populations were increasing before fire. Population growth rate in the smallest fragment was larger due to a single recruitment event, being most sensitive to changes in survival and growth of seedlings, virgins and the immature, and relatively insensitive to changes in shrinkage and fecundity. Observed growth rates for the entire study period showed that populations remained in equilibrium after fire, but the population in the medium-sized fragment showed a declining tendency. Population structure was resilient to fire, which caused a transitory concentration of individuals in the medium-sized stage. The self-sustainability of the population in the largest, most preserved fragment suggests that habitat-protection measures may suffice to ensure the persistence of populations in small fragments. However, population fluctuations and exclusion from hyper-disturbed sectors in the smallest fragment suggest that reduced fragment area, habitat degradation and human-induced fires can interact to threaten the persistence of even abundant, preadapted to fire, species like A. humilis.

AB The occurrence of disturbed sectors may be as important as microscale edge effects in tropical forests fragments. We considered the spatial distribution dynamics of life stages (youngs, immatures, and adults) of the acaulescent, endemic palm Attalea humilis Mart. ex. Spreng. in fire-prone fragments of the Brazilian Atlantic forest to investigate population responses to fragment size and fire occurrence. From 1996 to 1999, we recorded the number of individuals in different life stages in adjacent 10x10-m plots in two perpendicular transects across each of three fragments of different sizes (1.6, 6.4, and 9.9 ha) in the Reserva Nacional de Poco das Antas, Southeastern Brazil. A fire burnt the fragments studied in 1997. Application of Morisita's Index showed clumping at most scales, with a marked reduction in clumping degree from youngs to adults, a pattern not influenced by fragment size. After fire, clumping degree increased temporarily among the youngs. No association between life stages was detected using presence/absence data. Palm density concentrated in the most disturbed transect arms, a pattern very little affected by fragment size or fire. No consistent relationship between palm density and distance from fragment edge was detected for any stage, fragment, or year. We hypothesize that short-distance seed dispersal by scatterhoarding rodents results in discrete, low-density clumps of youngs dissociated from reproductive plants. The spatial pattern of later stages is probably conditioned by the distribution of canopy gaps in the largest, more closed fragment. In the other fragments, the presence of large disturbed sectors promotes the formation of large, continuous stands of palms. This pattern would be reinforced by fire, which is known to be recurrent on already disturbed sites. For the species studied, large-scale variations in the forest structure (degraded vs. preserved fragment sectors) seems to be more important than microscale edge effects.

AB Corridors are predicted to benefit populations in patchy habitats by promoting movement, which should increase population densities, gene flow, and recolonization of extinct patch populations. However, few investigators have considered use of the total landscape, particularly the possibility of interpatch movement through matrix habitat, by small mammals. This study compares home range sizes of 3 species of small mammals, the cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus), old-field mouse (P. polionotus) and cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) between patches with and without corridors. The study site was in S. Carolina, USA. Corridor presence did not have a statistically significant influence on average home range size. Habitat specialization and sex influenced the probability of an individual moving between 2 patches without corridors. The results of this study suggest that small mammals may be more capable of interpatch movement without corridors than is frequently assumed.

AB To determine the importance of different fire variables in promoting ant diversity in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa, ants were studied in savanna grassland patches of different post-fire fuel age, and fire frequency. Pitfall traps were set in six grassland sites representing three fire regimes (1: young (<24 months post-fire) and frequently burned; 2: young and infrequently burned; 3: old (4 and 6 years post-fire) and infrequently burned). Species richness declined with decreasing fire influence, being greatest on young and frequently burned plots, and lowest on old and infrequently burned plots. There was pronounced dominance by a few species on young and infrequently burned plots, and greater equitability at other sites. Ant diversity appears to be influenced more by post-fire fuel age than frequency of burning, although there is a need for a wider range of fire frequencies and greater replication to explore this further. Species richness was inversely correlated with the proportion of foliage biomass at ground level. Southern African ant communities may be quite resilient to differences in fire regime, and only a limited amount of fire diversity (young us old patches) may be necessary to maintain ant diversity.

AB A growth analysis was conducted with 24 central European grass species in full daylight to test whether traits underlying interspecific variation in relative growth rate (RGR) are the same in full daylight as they are at lower light, and whether this depends on the ecological characteristics of the studied species, i.e., their requirements with respect to nutrient and light availability. In contrast to studies with herbaceous species at lower light, net assimilation rate (NAR) contributed more than leaf area ratio (LAR) or specific leaf area (SLA) to interspecific variation in RGR. This was associated with a larger interspecific variation in NAR than found in experiments with lower light. Without the two most shade-tolerant species, however, the contribution of LAR and its components to interspecific variation in RGR was similar or even higher than that of NAR. Leaf dry matter content correlated negatively with RGR and was the only component of LAR contributing in a similar manner to variation in LAIR and RGR. There was a positive correlation between NAR and biomass allocation to roots, which may be a result of nutrient-limited growth. RGR correlated negatively with biomass allocation to leaves. Leaf thickness did not correlate with RGR, as the positive effect of thin leaves was counterbalanced by their lower NAR. Low inherent RGR was associated with species from nutrient-poor or shady habitats. Different components constrained growth for these two groups of species, those from nutrient-poor habitats having high leaf dry matter content, while those from shady habitats had thin leaves with low NAR.

AB Physical damage to saplings is considered an important factor that affects tree population dynamics in tropical forests, but interspecific differences in post-damage vegetative recovery and survival have been rarely quantified. Over 4 years, the vegetative and demographic responses to experimental mechanical damage were monitored in naturally-growing saplings of four coexisting tree species, under comparable overhead illumination conditions, in a lowland moist forest in Central Panama. Inflicted damage mimicked both crown loss and stem breakage ('snapped') and stem pinning by fallen debris ('bent') in individuals (1.0-2.5 m tall) of Alseis blackiana (Rubiaceae), Protium panamense, P. tenuifolium, and Tetragastris panamensis (all Burseraceae). For all species combined, 4-year percent mortality was significantly different between bent (21%), snapped (13%), and undamaged controls (6%). Species differed in their capacity to survive damage. Saplings of A. blackiana showed the highest resilience, expressed as a high ability to regain pre-damage height in snapped individuals, production of adventitious roots in bent individuals, and very high survival. A previous classification of the study species fit them into a large 'generalist' guild, after no illumination preferences were obvious for their juvenile growth and survival at the study site. In contrast, this study suggests that tree vegetative behavior should be incorporated in future tropical forest research that attempts to detect species differentiation in regeneration potential at the sapling phase.

AB Foraging activity of two mid- to low- shore species of limpet, Patella granularis (Prosobranchia) and Siphonaria concinna (Pulmonata) from an exposed shore on the Eastern Cape coast of South Africa was monitored. In both species, activity was compared during spring and neap tides and, in P. granularis between summer and winter. Rhythms of activity of the two species were similar, with foraging excursions being mainly associated with nocturnal low tide times, although some P. granularis foraged during daytime low tides. It is suggested that foraging excursions in P. granularis are triggered by wave action. Both species foraged further on spring tides than on neap tides and this is suggested to be a result of the limited time limpets have to forage. P. granularis was also found to forage further during summer when compared to winter and the possibility that seasonal micro-algal productivity influences foraging distances in limpets is discussed.
   The foraging activity of both species could be divided into 3 distinct phases, a relatively rapid outward phase, a much slower foraging phase and a rapid homeward phase. Whether or not these limpets graze throughout an excursion is not known. S. concinna was found to home to a fixed scar, although during the experiment some scar-swapping occurred. P. granularis did not home to a fixed scar but possessed a 'home range' (approx. 5 cm(2)) to which it returned after each excursion.
   Patella granularis was found to move randomly during foraging, whilst S. concinna foraged in a nonrandom direction which took individuals upshore. No tidal-influence is thought to be present in this case and the possibility of a learning component in the foraging behaviour of certain limpet species in relation to the return to optimal feeding patches is discussed.

AB Environmental and biological conditions of the intertidal zone vary according to tidal level. Monodonta labio (Gastropoda; trochidae) occurs over the whole range of the intertidal zone, but juveniles occur only in the mid intertidal zone. In this study, vertical migration of this snail was investigated by mark-recapture techniques for 1 yr at Amakusa, Japan. Snails migrated vertically throughout the year, but varied with season and size. Generally, juvenile snails (<7 mm in shell width) did not actively migrate. Upward migration was conspicuous only in small snails (7 to 10 mm) in summer. Downward migration was greatest in the larger size classes. Thus, large snails (greater than or equal to 13 mm) gradually migrated downward to the lower zone. Seasonal fluctuations in the vertical distribution pattern of M. labio could be explained by this vertical migration. Possible factors affecting this vertical migration and the adaptive significance of migration in the life history of M. labio are discussed.

AB Little is known about the biology and ecology of the eastern chestnut mouse (Pseudomys gracilicaudatus), let alone the details of its diet. In this paper, we examined the dietary composition, diversity and variation among individuals of this species in a coastal heathland of New South Wales, by means of microscopic examination of its faacal pellets. From 200 faecal samples, P. gracilicaudatus was found to consume considerable amounts of fungi (20% overall) and insects (over 10% on average). Seed was the most abundant food in its diet from August to February, accounting for 39%, with stem contributing 28% of the diet. Stem was dominant at other times, accounting for 34%, with seed contributing 24%. Although cohort-dependent foraging strategies have been reported in many small mammals, age-dependent foraging only occurred in autumn; sex-dependent foraging was not observed in P. gracilicaudatus. Analysis of dietary diversity (H') and among-individual variation (CV(p)) showed that there were significant variations in the diet of P. gracilicaudatus in different seasons and successional stages. Negative association between H' and CV(p) for seasons and vegetation succession suggested that individuals of P. gracilicaudatus consumed a range of food items, producing maximum dietary diversity. These results indicate that P. gracilicaudatus is a generalist herbivore, opportunistic in foraging and less specialised in food selection than any other Pseudomys species reported so far.

AB Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) initiatives, which provide financial incentives for management practices thought to increase the production of environmental benefits, have expanded across the global South since the late 1990s. These initiatives have thus far been conceptualized rather narrowly; by their early proponents as a novel economic instrument for more 'rational', effective and efficient environmental policy or by their critics as an exogenously imposed conduit of hegemonic neoliberalism. This introductory article to the special issue that follows advocates for and demonstrates a more grounded and historically situated approach for understanding the conformation and outcomes of PES in actual practice. It proposes a framework for examining individual PES initiatives as shaped by dynamic interactions between imposed structure and the development pathways and situated agency of actors in the territories in which they are implemented. It finds that certain ubiquitous components of this approach - the valuation of nature, the creation of institutions and the negotiations that inevitably surround the distribution of benefits - provide potential openings for articulation and engagement that can allow these initiatives to be contested, adapted, hybridized or more fully co-opted and captured. This framework opens a pathway for more inclusive, nuanced and grounded research on PES and on market-based environment and development policies more broadly.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) may alter dynamics in coupled human and natural systems, producing reciprocal feedback effects on socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. As forests recover following China's two nation-wide PES programs, wildlife-related crop raiding has been increasingly affecting rural people's livelihoods. We evaluate the feedback effect of crop raiding on people's intention to convert their cropland plots into forests under different PES program scenarios in the Tianma National Nature Reserve. Increases in crop raiding, conservation payment amounts, and program duration significantly increased local people's intention to enroll their cropland plots in future PES programs. Our results suggest that a substantial portion of economic benefit from the current PES programs was offset by the feedback effect of crop raiding promoted by these programs. Therefore, such complex human-environment interactions should be incorporated into the design and evaluation of China's PES practices and other PES programs around the world.

AB Tropical rainforests play important roles in carbon sequestration and are hot spots for biodiversity. Tropical forests are being replaced by rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations, causing widespread concern of a crash in biodiversity. Such changes in aboveground vegetation might have stronger impacts on belowground biodiversity. We studied tropical rainforest fragments and derived rubber plantations at a network of sites in Xishuangbanna, China, hypothesizing a major decrease in diversity with conversion to plantations. We used metabarcoding of the 18S rRNA gene and recovered 2313 OTUs, with a total of 449 OTUs shared between the two land-use types. The most abundant phyla detected were Annelida (66.4% reads) followed by arthropods (15.5% reads) and nematodes (8.9% reads). Of these, only annelids were significantly more abundant in rubber plantation. Taken together, alpha- and beta-diversity were significantly higher in forest than rubber plantation. Soil pH and spatial distance explained a significant portion of the variability in phylogenetic community structure for both land-use types. Community assembly was primarily influenced by stochastic processes. Overall it appears that forest replacement by rubber plantation results in an overall loss and extensive replacement of soil micro- and mesofaunal biodiversity, which should be regarded as an additional aspect of the impact of forest conversion.

AB Aim To test whether the species richness of understorey insectivorous birds on forest islands induced by a major hydroelectric dam is best explained by either the island biogeography theory (IBT) or the habitat amount hypothesis (HAH). Given the low dispersal ability of the focal species group and the hostile water matrix, we predict that the species richness will be predominantly driven by an island effect as posited by the IBT, rather than a sample area effect as posited by the HAH. Location Forest islands within the Balbina Hydroelectric Reservoir, central Brazilian Amazonia. Taxon Birds. Methods We mist-netted birds at 33 forest islands (0.63-1,699 ha), totalling 874 individuals of 59 species. The size of the local landscape used to calculate the habitat amount was determined by a multi-scale analysis in which buffers around mist-net lines ranged from 50 to 2,000 m. We applied four tests to examine whether the species richness on forest islands is predominantly driven by either an island effect (island size) or a sample area effect (habitat amount). Results From the four tests applied, one was consistent with an island effect, two were regarded as inappropriate to test the HAH, and one could not be adequately addressed due to island size being highly correlated with habitat amount in the local landscape (200-m buffer). Main conclusions Some of the proposed ways of testing the HAH may lead to misleading conclusions. The relative importance of island size in determining the species richness of understorey insectivorous birds on forest islands is higher than that of surrounding habitat amount, thereby providing stronger support for IBT. We propose a conceptual framework, based on the degree of matrix permeability and species dispersal ability, to determine to what extent a patch- or landscape-centric worldview in landscape ecology provides the most appropriate framework to assess the effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity.

AB Excessive nitrogen (N) application combined with water shortage has a negative effect on crop production, particularly wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in the North China Plain. This study examined root growth and water and nitrogen use efficiencies in wheat grown on loam soil in the North China Plain, from 2012 to 2014 using a fixed-position experiment initiated in 2010. The experiment followed a completely randomized split-plot design with four replications, taking irrigation [no irrigation (WO) versus irrigation at jointing plus flowering (W2)] as the main plot and N treatment (0, 180, 240, and 300 kg N ha(-1)) as the subplot. Compared with WO, W2 increased grain yield and root weight density (RWD) by up to 91.3 and 57.7% in 2012-2013, and 15.5 and 43.0% in 2013-2014, respectively, across all N application rates. Irrigation had no effect on grain water use efficiency (VVUEy), but caused a decrease in biomass WUE at vegetative growth stage (VVUEF) and at grain-filling stage (WUEm). Significant improvements in grain yield and biomass WUE during vegetative growth stage, and reductions in nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) and RWD, were observed with increasing N application. Compared with non-N treatment, N treatment increased yield by up to 98.9 and 93.7% in 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, respectively, decreasing RWD by 12.0 and 16.9%. Correlation analysis further revealed that RWD was positively correlated with grain yield, evapotranspiration (ET) and NUE. NUE was also positively correlated with nitrogen uptake efficiency (UPE). Overall, the findings suggest that optimal N application improves NUE by increasing above-ground nitrogen uptake as a result of optimized RWD and a synchronous increase in WUE, thus increasing yield. Under the experimental conditions, an N application rate of 240 kg N ha(-1) plus irrigation at jointing and flowering is recommended.

AB The southeastern Amazon region has been intensively occupied by human settlements over the past three decades. To evaluate the effects of human settlements on land-cover and land-use (LCLU) changes over time in the study site, we evaluated multitemporal Landsat images from the years 1984, 1994, 2004, 2013 and Sentinel to the year 2017. Then, we defined the LCLU classes, and a detailed "from-to" change detection approach based on a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) was employed to determine the trajectories of the LCLU changes. Three land-cover (forest, montane savanna and water bodies) and three land-use types (pasturelands, mining and urban areas) were mapped. The overall accuracies and kappa values of the classification were higher than 0.91 for each of the classified images. Throughout the change detection period, similar to 47% (19,320 km(2)) of the forest was preserved mainly within protected areas, while almost 42% (17,398 km(2)) of the area was converted from forests to pasturelands. An intrinsic connection between the increase in mining activity and the expansion of urban areas also exists. The direct impacts of mining activities were more significant throughout the montane savanna areas. We concluded that the GEOBIA approach adopted in this study combines the advantages of quality human interpretation and the capacities of quantitative computing.

AB For a long time, interaction between plants in both general plant and forest science has been somewhat limited to competition, although an intuitive, non-scientific understanding of facilitation has influenced the development of a wide range of forest management techniques including silvicultural systems. Despite this, competition has dominated many ecological theories and the interpretation of density effects. Ongoing research in tree mechanics and in verifying the stress-gradient hypothesis reveal that our understanding of tree interactions is still incomplete. Promising research is currently underway attempting to uncover the physiological receptors and processes related to interaction whilst in the past largely plant performance, e.g. plant size and growth rates, was used for verifying competition. We give an overview of quantification methods and suggest a standardisation by common construction principles. Plant performance has been much used for providing empirical evidence of interactions, but when used in isolation it can be a confounding criterion leading to misinterpretations despite promising new developments in quantifying tree interaction. We therefore suggest using pattern-oriented modelling in analyses of tree interactions, where several plant traits are applied simultaneously.

AB Aim: We investigated habitat heterogeneity and patterns of avian taxonomic and functional diversity change across a decreasing patch-size gradient in a critically endangered, fragmented forest-system to elucidate: (1) habitat patch-size and structural drivers of avian diversity change, (2) potential patch-size thresholds at which avian diversity and habitat heterogeneity changes occurred and (3) avian species/communities within thresholds that indicated distinct patch-size categories.
   Location: Indian Ocean Coastal Belt, South Africa.
   Methods: We conduced habitat-structure and fixed-radius point-count surveys during the avian breeding season across 123 habitat patches (range 0.06-386.9 ha). We calculated taxonomic and functional diversity/patch (alpha) using a distance matrix of all traits present in the avian community (gamma) and described community change across the patch-size gradient (beta). We compared linear regressions of patch-size effects on avian functional alpha-diversity and habitat-structural heterogeneity to segmented regression at five bands, determined by mean patch sizes responsible for provisioning avian functional alpha-diversity at <50%, 50%-62.5%, 62.5%-75%, 75%-87.5% and 87.5%-100% of avian functional gamma-diversity to explore patch-size thresholds, and tested for significant avian indicator species of categories identified.
   Results: Avian taxonomic and functional alpha-diversity significantly decreased with decreasing patch size and habitat heterogeneity; correlations between taxonomic and functional diversity declines and a positive significant influence of habitat heterogeneity on avian functional diversity indicated selective extinction pressure on niches and concomitant functional traits. Species turnover significantly increased in smaller patches. Segmented regressions of patch size-effect on avian functional diversity and habitat heterogeneity out-performed linear regressions at three patch-size thresholds (157, 96 and 9 ha). Forest-dependent specialists were significant indicators of high-diversity patches >90 ha. Species characterizing small patches <9 ha were generalists, but many were also present in larger patches, highlighting nested-community subsets of alpha-diversity.
   Main conclusions: Specialized niches and concomitant species became locally extinct at patch-size thresholds. We present replicable methodology and recommendations for conservation of forest systems using a critically endangered biome containing disproportionately high avifauna.

AB Wildfires are one of the most prominent risks for Mediterranean forests, reducing the flow of ecosystem services and representing a hazard for infrastructure and human lives. Several wildfire prevention programs in southern Europe are currently incorporating extensive livestock grazers in fire prevention activities to reduce the high costs of mechanical clearance. Among these the Andalusian network of grazed fuel breaks, the so-called RAPCA program, stands out for its dimension and stability over time. RAPCA currently works with 220 local shepherds who, with their guided flocks maintain low biomass levels in almost 6000 ha of fuel breaks in public forests to meet fire prevention standards. This work analyses the institutional design and performance of the RAPCA payment scheme under a payment for environmental services (PES) framework. Results show effectiveness of the payment scheme while efficiency is achieved through savings relative to the mainstream mechanized biomass removal, as well as through reduced information asymmetry. High-level and stable political commitment has been crucial for the emergence and consolidation of RAPCA. Moreover, key intermediaries and sound monitoring practices increased levels of trust amongst involved actors. Beneficial side-effects include social recognition of shepherds' activities and reduction of their friction with forest managers.

AB Our objectives were to assess how turnover and nestedness contribute to beta-diversity patterns of the Zygoptera in Amazonian streams, and to relate these components of beta diversity to environmental, spatial and biogeographic predictors. Our first hypothesis is that the turnover is the most important component of beta-diversity patterns due to the historical isolation of all or part of the areas located in the interfluves of the major Amazonian rivers. Our second hypothesis is that the interaction between environmental conditions and the area of endemism (biogeography) would be the most important predictor of beta-diversity patterns. To test these hypotheses, we compiled data on the Zygoptera communities from 172 Amazonian streams. We used three sets of predictor variables: (i) environmental variables, (ii) area of endemism (biogeographic) and (iii) spatial filters. The turnover explained 99.36% of the beta diversity, corroborating our first hypothesis. Together, environmental and biogeographic variables were the best predictors of beta-diversity patterns. For turnover, however, the biogeographic variables were the best predictors, contrary to our second hypothesis. We found high gamma diversity, but low alpha diversity in the Zygoptera communities. This paradox is explained by the high turnover among sites within the study landscape. This pattern of diversity is related to both historical biogeographic factors and the spatial structuring of environmental conditions in the Amazon region. In the light of our results (high turnover and beta diversity), and their correspondence with areas of endemism, adequate conservation of Amazonian Zygoptera diversity will depend on the establishment of so-called mega-reserves throughout the major Amazonian interfluves and, whenever possible, in the areas with adequate environmental conditions for the greatest possible number of species, otherwise, most species may be at a constant risk of extinction.

AB Protecting aboveground carbon stocks in tropical forests is essential for mitigating global climate change and is assumed to simultaneously conserve biodiversity. Although the relationship between tree diversity and carbon stocks is generally positive, the relationship remains unclear for consumers or decomposers. We assessed this relationship for multiple trophic levels across the tree of life (10 organismal groups, 3 kingdoms) in lowland rainforests of the Congo Basin. Comparisons across regrowth and old-growth forests evinced the expected positive relationship for trees, but not for other organismal groups. Moreover, differences in species composition between forests increased with difference in carbon stock. These variable associations across the tree of life contradict the implicit assumption that maximum co-benefits to biodiversity are associated with conservation of forests with the highest carbon storage. Initiatives targeting climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation should include both old-growth and regenerating forests to optimally benefit biodiversity and carbon storage.

AB Simple mathematical models can exhibit rich and complex behaviors. Prototypical examples of these drawn from biology and other disciplines have provided insights that extend well beyond the situations that inspired them. Here, we explore a set of simple, yet realistic, models for savanna-forest vegetation dynamics based on minimal ecological assumptions. These models are aimed at understanding how vegetation interacts with both climate (a primary global determinant of vegetation structure) and feedbacks with chronic disturbances from fire. The model includes three plant functional types-grasses, savanna trees, and forest trees. Grass and (when they allow grass to persist in their subcanopy) savanna trees promote the spread of fires, which in turn, demographically limit trees. The model exhibits a spectacular range of behaviors. In addition to bistability, analysis reveals (i) that diverse cyclic behaviors (including limit and homo- and heteroclinic cycles) occur for broad ranges of parameter space, (ii) that large shifts in landscape structure can result from endogenous dynamics and not just from external drivers or from noise, and (iii) that introducing noise into this system induces resonant and inverse resonant phenomena, some of which have never been previously observed in ecological models. Ecologically, these results raise questions about how to evaluate complicated dynamics with data. Mathematically, they lead to classes of behaviors that are likely to occur in other models with similar structure.

AB Land use change has been the primary driving force of human alteration of terrestrial ecosystems. With 80% of agricultural land dedicated to livestock production, the sector is an important lever to attenuate land requirements for food production and carbon emissions from land use change. In this study, we quantify impacts of changing human diets and livestock productivity on land dynamics and depletion of carbon stored in vegetation, litter and soils. Across all investigated productivity pathways, lower consumption of livestock products can substantially reduce deforestation (47-55%) and cumulative carbon losses (34-57%). On the supply side, already minor productivity growth in extensive livestock production systems leads to substantial CO2 emission abatement, but the emission saving potential of productivity gains in intensive systems is limited, also involving trade-offs with soil carbon stocks. If accounting for uncertainties related to future trade restrictions, crop yields and pasture productivity, the range of projected carbon savings from changing diets increases to 23-78%. Highest abatement of carbon emissions (63-78%) can be achieved if reduced consumption of animal-based products is combined with sustained investments into productivity increases in plant production. Our analysis emphasizes the importance to integrate demand- and supply-side oriented mitigation strategies and to combine efforts in the crop and livestock sector to enable synergies for climate protection.

AB This research provides for the first time a valuation of Veun Sai-Siem Pang National Park (VSSPNP) in Cambodia, which is a forest largely unfamiliar to the international community yet extremely significant in terms of biodiversity value. This study aimed to measure the monetary and non-monetary values of ecosystem services (ESS) of the forest. We estimated the total annual contribution of VSSPNP was US $129.84 million. Its primary contribution was air purification (US$ 56.21 million yr(-1)) followed by water storage (US$ 32.31 million yr(-1)), soil-erosion reduction (US$ 22.21 million yr(-1)), soil-fertility improvement (US$ 9.47million yr(-1)), carbon sequestration (US$ 7.87 million yr(-1)), provisioning services (US $ 1.76 million yr(-1)) and recreation (US$ 0.02 million yr(-1)). Traditionally the forest is used for timber and non-timber forest products, which in fact, composed only 1.36% of the total benefits. By analysing the published articles and reports on VSSPNP we determined the area had generated valuable academic and non-academic knowledge on natural resources. This forest had also created a diverse network among scientists and different organizations worldwide. We also identified the forest to be of cultural importance for indigenous people as they believe that their ancestors live inside the forest and protect them from vulnerabilities. Despite being part of one of the most important eco-regions in the world VSSPNP is undervalued and facing multiple threats such as illegal logging, poaching, population pressure and corruption. The current estimation of ESS would thus assist in the sustainable management of VSSPNP. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Plant species within communities may overlap in pollinators' use and influence visitation patterns of shared pollinators, potentially engaging in indirect interactions (e.g., facilitation or competition). While several studies have explored the mechanisms regulating insect-pollination networks, there is a lack of studies on bird-pollination systems, particularly in species-rich tropical areas. Here, we evaluated if phenotypic similarity, resource availability (floral abundance), evolutionary relatedness and flowering phenology affect the potential for indirect effects via shared pollinators in hummingbird-pollinated plant species within four communities in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Among the evaluated factors, phenotypic similarity (corolla length and anther height) was the most important variable, while resource availability (floral abundance) had a secondary importance. On the other hand, evolutionary relatedness and flowering phenology were less important, which altogether highlights the relevance of convergent evolution and that the contribution of a plant to the diet of the pollinators of another plant is independent of the level of temporal overlap in flowering in this tropical system. Interestingly, our findings contrast with results from multiple insect-pollinated plant communities, mostly from temperate regions, in which floral abundance was the most important driver, followed by evolutionary relatedness and phenotypic similarity. We propose that these contrasting results are due to high level of specialization inherent to tropical hummingbird-pollination systems. Moreover, our results demonstrated that factors defining linkage rules of plant-hummingbird networks also determinate plant-plant potential indirect effects. Future studies are needed to test if these findings can be generalized to other highly specialized systems. Overall, our results have important implications for the understanding of ecological processes due resource sharing in mutualistic systems.

AB Conservation of degraded forests is a challenging issue in the tropics, since the maintenance of environmental services and economic demands must be conciliated. Environmental services must be conserved while degraded tropical forests are demanded to be competitive against more financially profitable land uses as crop fields and pastures. The objective of this study was to evaluate productivity and financial profitability of enrichment planting in degraded forests. Seeds of Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum were planted in logging gaps of a 108-ha degraded forest in southeast Para (Brazil) in February 1995 (average = 91.7 seeds ha(-1) and 15.3 seeds gap(-1)). After 13 years (2008), S. parahyba presented a volume increase of 3.1 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) for individuals >= 25 cm in DBH. More than 30% of the planted seeds were able to germinate, establish, and grow up to sizes >= 25 cm in DBH. A cost-benefit analysis through Net Present Value (NPV) and a sensitivity analysis with different interest rates were performed to compare financial profitability of the treated and control area under roundwood and laminated plus sawnwood production. Enrichment planting using S. parahyba seeds presented higher NPVs in the treated than in control area for all simulations, except roundwood under interest rate of 9% per year. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) concept is mainly based on Coasean economics theory that emphasizes the creation of a voluntary or market-based transaction for ecosystem services. Alternatively, many PES practiced in developing countries are based on Pigouvian economic theory allowing government intervention such as through regulation, tax or subsidy. A hybrid PES approach that compound Coasean and Pigouvian theory was developed in West Lombok Indonesia leading to a new policy paradigm that combines elements of both a voluntary market-based and mandatory policy-based system. This study aims to assess how the hybrid PES program contributes to poverty alleviation. By employing a participatory econometrics approach, this study found that the hybrid PES system does not contribute to poverty alleviation in shortterm. It is possible that this PES program contributes to poverty alleviation in long-term.

AB A variety of landscape models are used to conceptualize and interpret human impacts on ecosystems and their biodiversity. The simplest, a 'patch-matrix' model, is rooted in island biogeography theory and assumes a dichotomy between generic, easily-defined habitat patches and a surrounding matrix that is completely inhospitable. This dichotomy between patch and matrix habitats has been recently relaxed, with the 'continuum' model taking this relaxation to its extreme and logical endpoint - a species-based model with no a priori definition of habitat or matrix, but rather focusing on ecological gradients. Yet, because few empirical comparisons of these bookending models exist, we lack understanding of their relative utility or the merits of hybrid approaches that combine attributes of patch-matrix and continuum models. To guide such considerations, we first develop a decision-making framework for the application of patch-matrix, continuum, and hybrid models. The framework takes into account study objectives, attributes of the landscape, and species traits. We then evaluate this framework by empirically comparing how continuum, patch-matrix, and hybrid models explain beetle distributions across two contrasting fragmented landscapes, for species differing in trophic level and habitat specificity. Within the Hope River Forest Fragmentation Project, a system with strong landscape contrast and distinct ('hard') structural edges between forest fragments and grassland, we find broad support for hybrid models, particularly those incorporating surrounding landscape structure. Conversely, within the Wog Wog Habitat Fragmentation Experiment, a system with weak landscape contrast and 'soft' structural edges between natural and plantation forest, we find co-support for continuum and hybrid models. We find no support in either system for patch-matrix, relative to continuum and hybrid models. We conclude by considering key questions and areas of research for advancing the application of models to understand species responses and biodiversity patterns associated with land-use change.

AB Avian brood parasites lay their eggs in the nests of their hosts, which rear the parasite's progeny. The costs of parasitism have selected for the evolution of defence strategies in many host species. Most research has focused on resistance strategies, where hosts minimize the number of successful parasitism events using defences such as mobbing of adult brood parasites or rejection of parasite eggs. However, many hosts do not exhibit resistance. Here we explore why some hosts accept parasite eggs in their nests and how this is related to the virulence of the parasite. We also explore the extent to which acceptance of parasites can be explained by the evolution of tolerance; a strategy in which the host accepts the parasite but adjusts its life history or other traits to minimize the costs of parasitism. We review examples of tolerance in hosts of brood parasites (such as modifications to clutch size and multi-broodedness), and utilize the literature on host-pathogen interactions and plant herbivory to analyse the prevalence of each type of defence (tolerance or resistance) and their evolution. We conclude that (i) the interactions between brood parasites and their hosts provide a highly tractable system for studying the evolution of tolerance, (ii) studies of host defences against brood parasites should investigate both resistance and tolerance, and (iii) tolerance and resistance can lead to contrasting evolutionary scenarios.

AB Study background: The Amazon basin is a mosaic of different environments. Flooded riparian and upland forests play a significant role for the establishment of human settlements. Riparian communities in the Amazon have evolved depending on the use of plants applied for therapeutic purposes, thus developing important knowledge about their management and preparation.
   Aim of the study: This paper describes and analyzes the use and management of medicinal plants in order to establish links to environmental conservation. The categorization of habitats of occurrence and categories of diseases were held in five riparian communities at Rio Jauaperi, in the border between Roraima and Amazonas states in Brazil. The study sight is poorly investigated in terms of scientific research.
   Materials and methods: Quantitative and qualitative ethnobotanical field inquiries and analytical methods including observations, individual and focus group discussions, individual interviews, preference ranking by free listing tasks, guided tours and community mapping were applied. Sutrop's cognitive salience index was applied in order to check the most important ethnospecies and diseases. The survey was conducted from February to December 2012.
   Results: A total of 62 informants were interviewed, resulting in 119 botanical species documented. The most salient medicinal species are usually wide distributed and recognized transculturally. Arboreal habit was the most important corresponding to 47% of total species used. The most frequent accessed environments were terra-firme (upland forest), vargeado (flooded forest), poultry (regenerating forest) and restinga (seasonally flooded forest) which together provides 59% of the total medicinal plant species. Exotic species played a secondary role with only 20% of the total. Thirty seven percent of the species were cultivated. Plants at homegardens are usually associated with children's or women's disease. Xixuati is the community with improved ability to environmental preservation using more forestry species. The most worrying disease was malaria. Biomedical assistance is precarious in the region and many diseases and healing rituals are culturally built.
   Conclusions: Ethnobotanical surveys of medicinal plants can indicate the level of biodiversity conservation and human health by integrating social and ecological analytical elements. Considering a predominance of management for subsistence, the higher richness of native medicinal species availability indicates that biodiversity and associated traditional knowledge are better preserved. The methods applied here might contribute for the decision-making process regarding conservation public policies and medical assistance in remote areas of the Amazon basin.

AB Seed predation is an important ecological process that affects the abundance, diversity and distribution of plant species, and it is known to be influenced by defaunation and forest fragmentation. Most studies on seed predation in human-modified landscapes do not take into account the different spatial scales in which this process operates. In this study, we evaluated how variables at three distinct spatial scales affected the seed predation of a palm that provides a keystone resource to the frugivore community, the queen palm Syagrus romanzoffiana. Thirteen landscapes that vary in forest cover, number of fragments and patch sizes were sampled in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We also evaluated the contribution of the three main groups of seed predators: squirrels, terrestrial rodents and invertebrates. Our results indicate that seed predation is more affected by fragment and local variables than by landscape influences. In addition, the size of the fragment, its shape and the distance from the nearest forest edge were the main predictors of the proportion of predated seeds. Moreover, the two main seed predators (squirrels and invertebrates) responded to the same fragment and local variables. Because most of the Atlantic forest consists of small fragments, we expect that the seed predation of this keystone palm should be high in most of its distribution, with potential consequences for the frugivore community.

AB Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation and land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.

AB The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, and is currently highly fragmented and disturbed due to human activities. Variation in environmental conditions in the Atlantic Forest can influence the distribution of species, which may show associations with some environmental features. Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) are insects that act in nutrient cycling via organic matter decomposition and have been used for monitoring environmental changes. The aim of this study is to identify associations between the spatial distribution of dung beetle species and Atlantic Forest structure. The spatial distribution of some dung beetle species was associated with structural forest features. The number of species among the sampling sites ranged widely, and few species were found in all remnant areas. Principal coordinates analysis indicated that species composition, abundance and biomass showed a spatially structured distribution, and these results were corroborated by permutational multivariate analysis of variance. The indicator value index and redundancy analysis showed an association of several dung beetle species with some explanatory environmental variables related to Atlantic Forest structure. This work demonstrated the existence of a spatially structured distribution of dung beetles, with significant associations between several species and forest structure in Atlantic Forest remnants from Southern Brazil.

AB The Janzen-Connell hypothesis states that tree diversity in tropical forests is maintained by specialist predators that are distance- or density-responsive (i.e. predators that reduce seed or seedling survival near adults of their hosts). Many empirical studies have investigated whether predators are distance-responsive; however, few studies have examined whether distance-responsiveness matters for how predators maintain tree diversity. Using a site-occupancy model, we show analytically that distance-responsive predators are actually less able to maintain diversity than specialist predators that are not distance-responsive. Generally, specialist predators maintain diversity because they become rare when their host's densities are low, reducing predation risk. However, if predators are distance-responsive, and most seeds cannot disperse away from these predators, then seed predation rates will remain high, even if predator density is low across the landscape. Consequently, a reduction in a host's population density may not lead to a significant reduction in seed and seedling predation. We show that habitat partitioning can cause recruitment to be highest near conspecific adults, even in the presence of distance-responsive predators, without any change in the effect that the predators have on coexistence (a result contrary to predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis). Rather, specialist predators and habitat partitioning have additive effects on species coexistence in our model, i.e., neither mechanism alters the effect of the other one. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

SO PLOS ONE

AB Brazil has presided over the most comprehensive agrarian reform frontier colonization program on Earth, in which similar to 1.2 million settlers have been translocated by successive governments since the 1970's, mostly into forested hinterlands of Brazilian Amazonia. These settlements encompass 5.3% of this similar to 5 million km(2) region, but have contributed with 13.5% of all land conversion into agropastoral land uses. The Brazilian Federal Agrarian Agency (INCRA) has repeatedly claimed that deforestation in these areas largely predates the sanctioned arrival of new settlers. Here, we quantify rates of natural vegetation conversion across 1911 agrarian settlements allocated to 568 Amazonian counties and compare fire incidence and deforestation rates before and after the official occupation of settlements by migrant farmers. The timing and spatial distribution of deforestation and fires in our analysis provides irrefutable chronological and spatially explicit evidence of agropastoral conversion both inside and immediately outside agrarian settlements over the last decade. Deforestation rates are strongly related to local human population density and road access to regional markets. Agrarian settlements consistently accelerated rates of deforestation and fires, compared to neighboring areas outside settlements, but within the same counties. Relocated smallholders allocated to forest areas undoubtedly operate as pivotal agents of deforestation, and most of the forest clearance occurs in the aftermath of government-induced migration.

AB The relative importance of niche-based (e.g., competitive or stress-based) and stochastic (e.g., random dispersal) processes in structuring ecological communities is frequently analyzed by studying trait distributions of co-occurring species. While filtering processes, such as the exclusion of stress-intolerant species from particular habitats, increase the trait similarity between co-occurring species, other processes, such as resource competition, can limit the similarity of co-occurring species. Comparing the observed trait distribution patterns in communities to null expectations from randomized communities (e.g., a draw of the same observed richness from the regional pool) therefore gives a first indication of the dominant process driving community assembly.
   However, such comparisons do not inform us about the relative contribution of these different processes in shaping community compositions in case of their joint operation (a likely scenario). Using an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach, we develop a new method that allows inference of the relative importance of dispersal, filtering, and limiting similarity processes for the assembly of observed communities with known species and trait composition. We applied this approach to a tree community data set, collected across 20 plots along strong rainfall and fire gradients in a South African savanna.
   Based on comparisons with simulations, we find that our new approach is powerful in identifying which community assembly scenario has the highest probability to generate the observed trait distribution patterns, while traditional null model comparisons perform poorly in detecting signs of limiting similarity. For the studied savanna tree communities, our analysis yields that dispersal processes are most important in shaping the functional trait distribution patterns. Furthermore, our models indicate that filtering processes were relatively most important in areas with high fire frequencies, while limiting similarity processes were relatively most important in areas with low fire frequency and high rainfall. We conclude that our new method is a promising improvement on current approaches to estimate the relative importance of community assembly processes across different species groups, ecosystems, and biomes. Future model modifications (e.g., the inclusion of individual-based processes) could provide further steps in uncovering the underlying assembly processes behind observed community patterns.

AB Large-scale studies are needed to increase our understanding of how large-scale conservation threats, such as climate change and deforestation, are impacting diverse tropical ecosystems. These types of studies rely fundamentally on access to extensive and representative datasets (i.e., "big data"). In this study, I asses the availability of plant species occurrence records through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the distribution of networked vegetation census plots in tropical South America. I analyze how the amount of available data has changed through time and the consequent changes in taxonomic, spatial, habitat, and climatic representativeness. I show that there are large and growing amounts of data available for tropical South America. Specifically, there are almost 2,000,000 unique geo-referenced collection records representing more than 50,000 species of plants in tropical South America and over 1,500 census plots. However, there is still a gaping "data void" such that many species and many habitats remain so poorly represented in either of the databases as to be functionally invisible for most studies. It is important that we support efforts to increase the availability of data, and the representativeness of these data, so that we can better predict and mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Local government planning agencies play an important role in conserving biodiversity in human-altered landscapes. Such agencies frequently have a limited knowledge of wildlife biology and few resources to carry out research, and therefore require simple, practical guidelines for biodiversity conservation. We propose a landscape design framework for biodiversity conservation that is sequential, prescriptive, and supported by current landscape ecological science. Unlike existing guidelines, our framework can be implemented in any given landscape using only land cover data and it explicitly considers constraints on land use planning. The steps of our framework, in the order in which they should be implemented are: (1) select land cover data and decide which land cover classes constitute unaltered or altered land covers; (2) list the constraints on land use planning (e.g., economic, social) that exist for the landscape; (3) maximize the total amount and diversity of unaltered land cover, especially near water; (4) minimize human disturbance within altered land cover, especially near water; and (5) aggregate altered land covers associated with high-intensity land uses, especially away from water. We illustrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a hypothetical landscape and comparing the outcome to those from the application of traditional ecological guidelines to inform land use planning.

AB AimForest fragmentation is often accompanied by an increase in hunting intensity. Both factors are known drivers of species extirpations, but understanding of their independent effects is poor. Our goal was to partition the effects of hunting and fragmentation on bird species extirpations and to identify bird traits that make species more vulnerable to these two stressors.
   LocationMenglun, Yunnan, SW China
   MethodsWe studied the landscape within 10km radius of Menglun town, where forests have become highly fragmented by monoculture rubber plantations. We compiled data on birds recorded between 1954 and 1983 before forest loss and compared it with a checklist prepared between 2011 and 2014. We used countryside and matrix-calibrated species-area models (SAMs) to estimate the observed slope of forest bird extirpations in Menglun and compared it with the slope expected in the absence of hunting. We also investigated six ecological traits to determine those that best explained bird extirpation probability (EP).
   ResultsWe found that 34% of the bird fauna had been extirpated from the study landscape, and the estimated slopes of countryside and matrix-calibrated SAMs for forest birds were around 1.4 and 1.7 times higher, respectively, than the 0.35 expected without hunting. Bird EP was strongly associated with size, and understorey insectivores that are known to be susceptible to fragmentation were less susceptible to hunting than frugivores. Given evidence of past and present hunting activity in the area, and the lack of support for alternative explanations, we suggest that hunting increased forest bird extirpations by around 1.3- to 1.6-fold.
   ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of using species-area relationships to separate area effects from the impacts of hunting. Our results suggest that hunting substantially increases species extirpations in tropical fragmented landscapes and conservation interventions that only target deforestation will therefore be inadequate.

AB Climate change is strong in the Amazon basin. Climate models consistently predict widespread warmer and drier conditions by the end of the 21st century. As a consequence, water stress will increase throughout the region. We here review current understanding of the impact of climate change on forests' distribution patterns, species diversity and ecosystem functioning of lowland rainforests in the Amazon basin. We reviewed 192 studies that provide empirical evidence, historical information and theoretical models. Over millions of years rainforests expansions and contractions have been accompanied by changes in the diversity and productivity of forests. In the future, drought will produce forest contractions along the forest edges and the savanna ecotone, causing an extensive savannization, particularly in the east. In terms of diversity, warming will reduce plant species survival by decreasing their productivity, but extinctions may also occur as a result of vegetation disequilibrium, as many plants, dispersal and pollinator species will fail to track changing climate; mild drought kills understory trees and severe drought may eliminate canopy trees as well. Severe droughts will thus produce directional changes in species composition, although these shifts may vary among forests on different soil types. In terms of ecosystem functioning, droughts will reduce root growth and standing biomass and may shift the Amazonian forest from being CO2 sinks to become CO2 sources. Physiological and ecological responses to warming and the feedback between vegetation and climate are still not completely understood. In particular, experimental assays that allow direct conclusions on the response of Amazonian plants to the predicted climatic conditions are needed. Such studies could make possible more reliable estimates of future climatic and vegetation responses.

AB The Leguminosae family is one of the most representative families in the seasonal semidecidual lowland forest, and many of their species have economical and ecological importance, including for the recovery of degraded areas. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the biology of native species for forest restoration. Tree growth dynamics features, such as increment rates, life expectancy and tree responses to environmental variations can be assessed through tree-ring studies. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the growth features of Copaifera langsdorffii, Dalbergia nigra, Pterocarpus rohrii, Schizolobium parahyba and Senna multijuga trees in a known age experimental plantation. The study site was located in Espirito Santo State, southeastern Brazil. Stem discs were obtained for anatomical characterization of tree-rings. Wood samples were sectioned and processed following the usual plant anatomy techniques. For macroscopic analysis, samples were polished and analyzed under a stereoscopic microscope. All species showed distinct growth rings with annual periodicity formation. Growth rates, tree size measurements and growth trajectories were established for each species. These features varied even among trees of the same age and species growing under homogeneous conditions. It is noteworthy that growth variation was not related to the species' ecological group. These data are important to characterize growth behavior of native species in order to subsidize species selection for recovery of degraded areas and economical purposes. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs), a varied and extensive ecosystem type in the tropics, are characteristically adapted to seasonal water stress in zones of low rainfall. Land-use change, resource extraction, alien invasives, changes to the atmosphere, and changing fire and climatic regimes may have serious implications for the continued persistence of SDTFs. This paper assesses the extent to which SDTFs may be resilient in the face of these threats, considering their dynamics, community-level characteristics, and functional traits of constituent species. There is evidence that some SDTF biodiversity- and structure-related properties are resistant to low-to moderate-intensity disturbances and have the potential to recover after severe, even chronic, disturbances, at timescales in the order of decades. Although global SDTFs are, on average, not necessarily more resilient than moist tropical forests (MTFs), they may be more resilient to particular disturbances such as fires and drought. SDTFs are vulnerable to regime shifts and there is considerable uncertainty about their future under a changing climate and its interactions with other anthropogenic effects.

AB Amazonian rainforests sustain some of the richest tree communities on Earth, but their ecological and evolutionary responses to human threats remain poorly known. We used one of the largest experimental datasets currently available on tree dynamics in fragmented tropical forests and a recent phylogeny of angiosperms to test whether tree communities have lost phylogenetic diversity since their isolation about two decades previously. Our findings revealed an overall trend toward phylogenetic impoverishment across the experimentally fragmented landscape, irrespective of whether tree communities were in 1-ha, 10-ha, or 100-ha forest fragments, near forest edges, or in continuous forest. The magnitude of the phylogenetic diversity loss was low (< 2% relative to before-fragmentation values) but widespread throughout the study landscape, occurring in 32 of 40 1-ha plots. Consistent with this loss in phylogenetic diversity, we observed a significant decrease of 50% in phylogenetic dispersion since forest isolation, irrespective of plot location. Analyses based on tree genera that have significantly increased (28 genera) or declined (31 genera) in abundance and basal area in the landscape revealed that increasing genera are more phylogenetically related than decreasing ones. Also, the loss of phylogenetic diversity was greater in tree communities where increasing genera proliferated and decreasing genera reduced their importance values, suggesting that this taxonomic replacement is partially underlying the phylogenetic impoverishment at the landscape scale. This finding has clear implications for the current debate about the role human-modified landscapes play in sustaining biodiversity persistence and key ecosystem services, such as carbon storage. Although the generalization of our findings to other fragmented tropical forests is uncertain, it could negatively affect ecosystem productivity and stability and have broader impacts on coevolved organisms.

AB Up-scaling the evaluation of threat status of biodiversity from species to ecosystem level has remained for long a research challenge in global conservation science. To meet this challenge, the present study makes an attempt toward actionable conservation prescription and assigning a threat category scheme for forest ecosystems. The scheme sets the quantitative criteria for evaluation of cumulative anthropogenic threats in grid cells, such as deforestation, degradation, fragmentation, forest fires and biological invasions. Adopting the convention of IUCN, five conservation status categories (i.e. Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, Near Threatened, Least Concern) have been similarly adopted for the forest ecosystems facing these threats. The operational success of this scheme of threat categories at ecosystem level has been strengthened by remote sensing and field data generated for the forest ecosystems of Odisha, India. The threat category status of the forest ecosystems were identified by creating grids (5 km x 5 km) in GIS and assigned the degree of the threats for each grid. The database on deforestation was generated using topographical maps of 1935 and remote sensing data of 1975 and 2010. The degradation in forest ecosystems have been assessed based on the change in forest canopy closure, fragmentation pattern, forest fire distribution and impact of biological invasions. The analysis for conservation priority hotspots complements an assessment of the threatened ecosystems undergoing remarkable level of multiple threats. Areas under the danger of cumulative anthropogenic threats would have a higher priority. 5.8% grids of existing forest had included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I, followed by 12.4% in conservation priority hotspot-II, and 12.5% in conservation priority hotspot-III. An integrated approach involving the cumulative anthropogenic threat indicators have been found to be the most appropriate tool to empirically evaluate the threat status of the forest ecosystems. Finally, identification of ecosystems especially those facing increasing extinction risks, as attempted in the present study, can help in devising an appropriate policy and management agenda for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.

AB The aboveground carbon sequestration rate (ACSR) reflects the influence of climate change on forest dynamics. To reveal the long-term effects of climate change on forest succession and carbon sequestration, a forest landscape succession and disturbance model (LANDIS Pro7.0) was used to simulate the ACSR of a temperate forest at the community and species levels in northeastern China based on both current and predicted climatic data. On the community level, the ACSR of mixed Korean pine hardwood forests and mixed larch hardwood forests, fluctuated during the entire simulation, while a large decline of ACSR emerged in interim of simulation in spruce-fir forest and aspen-white birch forests, respectively. On the species level, the ACSR of all conifers declined greatly around 2070s except for Korean pine. The ACSR of dominant hardwoods in the Lesser Khingan Mountains area, such as Manchurian ash, Amur cork, black elm, and ribbed birch fluctuated with broad ranges, respectively. Pioneer species experienced a sharp decline around 2080s, and they would finally disappear in the simulation. The differences of the ACSR among various climates were mainly identified in mixed Korean pine hardwood forests, in all conifers, and in a few hardwoods in the last quarter of simulation. These results indicate that climate warming can influence the ACSR in the Lesser Khingan Mountains area, and the largest impact commonly emerged in the A2 scenario. The ACSR of coniferous species experienced higher impact by climate change than that of deciduous species.

AB The diversity of complex multi-species uneven-aged forests is not easy to describe efficiently and meaningful. In the past, most importance has been assigned to species diversity and there is a wide range of approaches to quantifying this aspect of diversity. In woodlands, size diversity is another important dimension of biodiversity, as trees can be small or large and depending on their size play different ecological roles. Traditionally size diversity has often been neglected in diversity surveys of woody vegetation or considered as difficult to handle. We investigated the size and species diversity of two multispecies uneven-aged forests from monsoon- and subtropical/warm-temperate climate zones in northern China using non-spatial and spatially explicit forestry and diversity characteristics. We found that the analysis of both species and size diversity provided a much better understanding of diversity patterns in complex multi-species forests. Interestingly the relationship between size- and individual-based relative abundances follows a saturation curve. The analysis using non-spatial forestry and biodiversity characteristics led to approximately similar results in all four plots despite the very different woodland communities involved. However, with spatial measures we gained a deeper insight concerning the deviation from random distributions of species and size as well as interaction ranges of trees. We also found an aggregation of similar species and sizes at small inter-tree distances in the monsoon influenced climate and an aggregation of different sizes in the subtropical/warm-temperate climate zone. The use of second-order characteristics was instrumental in elaborating the subtle differences between the diversity of the two study areas and thus made an important contribution to this study.

AB In this work we evaluated anuran species distribution in an Atlantic forest fragmented landscape, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Sampling was carried out in three continuous forest sites, 12 forest fragments, and five pasture areas (matrix). We recorded, by visual encounter surveys, 2,495 individuals from 50 amphibian species for all sampled areas. Considering the pooled data, higher richness occurs in continuous forest area. Additionally, more than a third of species that occurred in continuous forest area did not occur in fragments or in matrix. Both ordination analyses showed that continuous forest sites clustered together and matrix areas seemed to be separated from other areas. This ordination resulted from the existence of species occurring only in continuous forest, suggesting that these species may be sensitive to habitat fragmentation. Besides, matrix appears separated from other areas due to occurrence of frog species typical from disturbed environments, which are not recorded in continuous forest sites or in sampled fragments. By analyzing the effect of landscape metrics, we found that there was a tendency for fragments with lower isolation to have higher species richness and proportion of species which did not occur in matrix areas and amphibian local communities seems to be affected in a more local scale by habitat changes. Because local matrix is apparently hostile to typically forest-associated amphibian species, many of them may be unable to reach most isolated fragments by dispersal, which may explain observed results.

AB 1. Parasites comprise a substantial proportion of global biodiversity and exert important ecological influences on hosts, communities and ecosystems, but our knowledge of how parasite populations respond to human impacts is in its infancy. Here, we present the results of a natural experiment in which we used a system of highly successful marine protected areas and matched open-access areas in central Chile to assess the influence of fishing-driven biodiversity loss on parasites of exploited fish and invertebrate hosts. We measured the burden of gill parasites for two reef fishes (Cheilodactylus variegatus and Aplodactylus punctatus), trematode parasites for a keyhole limpet (Fissurella latimarginata), and pinnotherid pea crab parasites for a sea urchin (Loxechinus albus). We also measured host density for all four hosts. We found that nearly all parasite species exhibited substantially greater density (# parasites m(-2)) in protected than in open-access areas, but only one parasite species (a gill monogenean of C.variegatus) was more abundant within hosts collected from protected relative to open-access areas. These data indicate that fishing can drive declines in parasite abundance at the parasite population level by reducing the availability of habitat and resources for parasites, but less commonly affects the abundance of parasites at the infrapopulation level (within individual hosts). Considering the substantial ecological role that many parasites play in marine communities, fishing and other human impacts could exert cryptic but important effects on marine community structure and ecosystem functioning via reductions in parasite abundance.

AB Invasions of woody species into grasslands abandoned by agriculture are a global phenomenon, but their effects on diversity of other taxa have been rarely investigated across both regional and local scales. We quantified how shrub encroachment affected the activity, composition, and diversity of ant communities in managed and abandoned grasslands in western Carpathians of Central Europe across four regions and four shrub encroachment stages in each region. We surveyed ant communities on 48 sites in total, with each encroachment stage replicated three times in each region and twelve times overall. We used pitfall traps to sample ants over three years (2008, 2009, 2011) and identified 9,254 ant workers belonging to 33 species in total. Although the epigaeic activity and composition of ant communities varied with region, abandoned grasslands supported a greater species richness of ants than managed grasslands regardless of the region, and especially so in more advanced shrub encroachment stages. Since the woody colonization within grasslands was moderate even in the advanced encroachment stages (on average similar to 40 % of grassland colonized by woody species), it allowed coexistence of forest specialists (e.g. Temnothorax crassispinus) with species typical of open grasslands, thus increasing overall ant diversity. Managed grasslands were not only less species rich compared to abandoned grasslands, but they were characterized by different species (e.g. Lasius niger, Myrmica rugulosa). The differences in ant communities between managed and abandoned grasslands are likely to cause differences in ecological functions mediated by ants (e.g. predation of arthropods or plant seed dispersal).

AB Niche theory predicts that few closely related species can co-occur because such species tend to be ecologically similar and niche differentiation is required to avoid competitive exclusion. We analyse the co-occurrence of a remarkable 10-15 species of the ant genus Monomorium occurring within single 10x10m plots in a tropical savanna of northern Australia. Most of the species are undescribed, so we use genetic analysis to validate our species demarcations. We document nest dispersion patterns, and investigate differentiation in the three primary niche dimensions: space, time and food. We also examine species differences in competitive abilities, by describing rates of foraging activity, foraging ranges, worker aggression, and levels of behavioural dominance. Analyses of nest and forager distributions showed very limited evidence of spatial segregation within plots. The great majority of species foraged either exclusively or primarily during daylight hours. Body size and isotopic analyses indicated very limited dietary differentiation. Such limited niche partitioning occurred despite the species differing markedly in their competitive abilities as measured by rates of resource discovery, recruitment and monopolization. Our findings defy the traditional assumption that multiple closely related and ecologically similar species of highly interactive taxa cannot co-occur. It seems very likely that species coexistence in our study system is determined to a very large degree by stochastic processes relating to dispersal and establishment, as predicted by neutral theory. However, neutral theory assumes competitive equivalence, whereas we found very marked differences in the competitive abilities of our co-occurring species. We suggest that competitive exclusion is prevented by the modular nature of ant colonies, with competition limiting colony performance but not preventing occurrence. We conclude that other factors that allow species persistence, and not just competitive equivalence, can allow dispersal and establishment processes to drive species coexistence.

AB We explore and compare quantities and patterns of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) in protected forest and neighboring land around Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (a mountain protected area in Southwestern Uganda). We assessed paired sites of natural forest and major land uses (potato, tea and grazing lands) converted between 1973 and 2010. These pairings were replicated at three altitudinal zones. Plots (20 m by 50 m) were demarcated within each site. Five composite soil and core samples were obtained from 0 to 15 cm (top-soil) and 15-30 cm (sub-soil) at each plot. In total, 192 composite soil and core samples were collected. Within forest we found marked site to site variation in SOC from 54.6 to 82.6 Mg/ha. There was a tendency for higher SOC in converted land, associated with higher bulk density suggesting quality based land use selection with forest left on inferior soils. Cultivation, landscape position, slope and sampling depth were all significantly (P < 0.05) related to variation in SOC stocks following forest conversion but time since conversion had no detectable impact. Interestingly, there was no significant relationship between SOC in the top and sub-soils. Higher SOC is largely determined by higher bulk density. The large SOC stocks in these afro-montane soils are less predictable and more persistent than anticipated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Niche differentiation is a key issue in the current debate on community assembly mechanisms. In highly diverse moist tropical forests, tree species sensitivity to canopy openness is thought to be a major axis in niche differentiation. In the past, the syndrome of traits driving the demographic trade-off involved in the niche-based theory of coexistence has always been established among species situated at the two extremities of the shade-tolerance gradient, even though most tropical tree species have intermediate light requirements. In addition, trait plasticity has seldom been linked to tropical tree species distribution along environmental gradients. This article examines covariations between leaf traits, whole-plant traits and niche parameters among 14 tree species with intermediate light requirements in French Guiana and across a range of canopy openness. Each functional trait measured under field conditions was characterized by a median value and a degree of plasticity expressed under contrasting light regimes. Niche differentiation was characterized in terms of spatial light gradient. We first examined covariations between functional traits then explored to what degree the median value and plasticity in functional traits could predict light niche characteristics at the sapling stage and the ontogenetic change in light availability estimated by adult stature. Leaf mass per area (LMA) was positively correlated with leaf life span (LLS); species with higher LMA and higher LLS displayed lower diameter growth rates (GRs) and lower responsiveness to canopy gap at both whole-plant and population levels. This proved that the relationships previously established over a broader range of species held true within the narrow range of the light requirements covered. Height GR plasticity accounted for 49% of the variation in light niche optimum. LMA plasticity, unlike LLS plasticity, was significantly correlated with light niche breadth and adult stature. Synthesis. This study demonstrates the relevance of considering the phenotypic plasticity in functional traits in community ecology, particularly for quantifying breadth of species distribution over environmental gradients. Our findings did not support Hubbell's hypothesis of functional equivalence and suggest that even a rather subtle variation in forest canopy disturbance promotes the coexistence of tropical tree species.

AB This article contributes to the public administration and environmental governance literature by proposing the notion of institutional subversion as a way of describing how the strategies adopted by local actors may change and even go against the initial aims of institutional development initiatives. The article discusses the case of the system for the environmental licencing of rural properties (SLAPR), an institutional development initiative by the state government of Mato Grosso in the south-eastern portion of the Brazilian Amazon. It will be shown that even though this initiative has earned the status of best practice in controlling deforestation, a closer look at SLAPR reveals that it has led to contradictory outcomes. During the first 8?years of SLAPR, it had no significant impact on reducing deforestation and, in some cases, even permitted the increase of total deforestation by providing authorization for this. According to an institutional analysis of the case study, the article draws particular conclusions that could be relevant to public administrators in the region and in other countries. In particular, it is argued that by accepting the possibility of institutional subversion, public administrators may become more attentive to unexpected consequences and be able to take corrective action. Furthermore, in order to avoid institutional subversion, public administrators should integrate institutional initiatives into broader governmental, technological and economical dimensions.

AB The future of tropical forests may lie in integrating different revenue sources, such as timber, non-timber products and environmental services, to make standing forests more economically competitive with other land uses such as pasture. Therefore, analytical techniques that couple economic models with ecological understanding are an increasingly important tool to promote forested landscapes. This study explores the potential revenue associated with different harvest strategies of the multipurpose tropical tree Carapa guianensis, a species valued for both the high quality oil extracted from its seeds and its mahogany-like timber. We calculated the equal annual equivalent (EAE), a measure of profitability that annualizes net present value, of revenues and costs associated with simulations of sustainable seed and timber harvests. Our specific objectives were (1) to simulate and compare the revenue from ecologically viable seed and timber harvests of C. guianensis in stochastically varying environments; and (2) to calculate the EAE of revenues and costs from seed and timber harvest under different market prices and different oil extraction methods. We found profits from both timber and seed harvest of C. guianensis for oil production, though only when seed presses were available for oil extraction; manual oil extraction had negative returns due to intensive labor requirements. Combined profits from C. guianensis press-extracted seed oil and timber harvests were economically competitive with other common forest use activities that provide communities with cash profits. Combining extraction of NTFPs with timber may provide continuous income while forests recover volume between timber harvests. Combining this income with harvest of other resources in the context of multi-use management may be an economically viable management strategy in similar forests in Amazonia. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Aim: Shaded coffee plantations constitute an important refuge for biodiversity. Despite the fact that epiphytic plants form a significant component of these agroecosystems, their removal from the shade trees is commonplace in Latin America. To what extent does the epiphyte community recover from this severe disturbance?
   Location: Shaded coffee agroecosystem in Veracruz, Mexico (19 degrees 28'03 '' N, 96 degrees 55'58 '' W; 1200 m asl).
   Methods: We assessed the diversity, biomass and recolonization patterns of vascular epiphytes in shade trees, 8-9 yr after complete epiphyte removal (E(-)), and in control 'non-removal' sites (E(+)). In order to evaluate the effects of prior epiphyte removal, all vascular epiphytes were completely removed from 10 trees per treatment (E(-) and E(+)); all epiphyte species collected were identified and dry biomass measured.
   Results: Eight to nine years after removal, epiphyte biomass in the E(-) shade trees was 35% of that found in the control sites. A total of 55 epiphyte species, belonging to 12 families, were registered; 40 in E(-), and 48 in E(+). Six species belonging to Bromeliaceae, Orchidaceae, Cactaceae and Araceae accounted for 75% of the biomass in E(+) while six species of bromeliads accounted for 76% of the biomass in E(-). Some bromeliads proliferated following disturbance; however, ferns showed lower recovery.
   Conclusions: Epiphyte community recovery, in terms of biomass and diversity, is considerably higher in the coffee plantation than has been previously reported for other tropical ecosystems. Epiphyte recolonization patterns reflected both the abundance of species in the surrounding matrix and certain species-specific traits. For such agroecosytems to function as effective reservoirs of epiphyte diversity, epiphyte stripping should be avoided.

AB Competition between neighboring plants plays a major role in the population dynamics of tree species in the early phases of humid tropical forest succession. We evaluated the relative importance of above-versus below-ground competition during the first years of old-field succession on soil with low fertility in Southern Mexico, using the premise that competition for light is size-asymmetric, unlike competition for nutrients. Plant growth is thus expected to be disproportionally impeded by larger neighbors. We studied how growth and survival of 3.5-5.5 m tall saplings of Cecropia peltata and Trichospermum mexicanum, two pioneer species that dominate the secondary forests in the study region, varied with the abundance and size of neighboring trees in 1-2 year old secondary vegetation. We found that local neighborhood basal area varied 10-fold (3 to 30 cm(2) m(-2)) and explained most of the variation in diameter and height growth of the target saplings. Most growth variables were strongly affected by the neighbors bigger than the focal trees with no significant additive effect of the smaller neighbors, indicating asymmetric competition. Smaller neighbors did have a small but significant additive effect on the diameter growth of Cecropia saplings and stem slenderness of Trichospermum saplings. We conclude that competition for light was more important than below-ground competition in this initial phase of moist tropical forest successional, despite the low soil fertility.

AB Background and Aims Plants are able to tolerate tissue loss through vigorous branching which is often triggered by release from apical dominance and activation of lateral meristems. However, damage-induced branching might not be a mere physiological outcome of released apical dominance, but an adaptive response to environmental signals, such as damage timing and intensity. Here, branching responses to both factors were examined in the annual plant Medicago truncatula.
   Methods Branching patterns and allocation to reproductive traits were examined in response to variable clipping intensities and timings in M. truncatula plants from two populations that vary in the onset of reproduction. Phenotypic selection analysis was used to evaluate the strength and direction of selection on branching under the damage treatments.
   Key Results Plants of both populations exhibited an ontogenetic shift in tolerance mechanisms: while early damage induced greater meristem activation, late damage elicited investment in late-determined traits, including mean pod and seed biomass, and supported greater germination rates. Severe damage mostly elicited simultaneous development of multiple-order lateral branches, but this response was limited to early damage. Selection analyses revealed positive directional selection on branching in plants under early-compared with late-or no-damage treatments.
   Conclusions The results demonstrate that damage-induced meristem activation is an adaptive response that could be modified according to the plant's developmental stage, severity of tissue loss and their interaction, stressing the importance of considering these effects when studying plastic responses to apical damage.

AB Environmental protection and poverty alleviation in the developing world are usually heralded as joint objectives. However, these two goals are often associated with different sectoral policy instruments. While so called payments for environmental services (PES) are increasingly being promoted for environmental protection, poverty alleviation is increasingly addressed by conditional cash transfers (CCT) program. These instruments although aimed to achieve distinct objectives have a number of similarities and challenges in their design and implementation phases. This paper elaborates on these similarities and develops a unifying generic framework that is used to discuss the extent to which both approaches could be unified. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the Brazilian Cerrado (neotropical savanna), the development of bud-bearing underground systems as adaptive structures to fire and dry periods can comprise an important source of buds for this ecosystem, as already demonstrated in the Brazilian Campos grasslands and North American prairies. Asteraceae species from both woody and herbaceous strata have subterranean organs that accumulate carbohydrates, reinforcing the adaptive strategy of these plants to different environmental conditions. This study aims to analyse the morpho-anatomy of underground systems of six species of Asteraceae (Mikania cordifolia L.f. Willd., Mikania sessilifolia DC, Trixis nobilis (Vell.) Katinas, Pterocaulon alopecuroides (Lam.) DC., Vernonia elegans Gardner and Vernonia megapotamica Spreng.), to describe these structures and to verify the occurrence and origin of shoot buds, and to analyse the presence of reserve substances. Individuals sampled in Cerrado areas in Sao Paulo State showed thick underground bud-bearing organs, with adventitious or lateral roots and presence of fructans. Xylopodium was found in all studied species, except for Trixis nobilis, which had stem tuber. The presence of fructans as reserve, and the capacity of structures in the formation of buds indicate the potential of herbaceous species of Asteraceae in forming a viable bud bank for vegetation regeneration in the Brazilian Cerrado.

AB The Thousand-Island Lake region in Zhejiang Province, China is a highly fragmented landscape with a clear point-in-time of fragmentation as a result of flooding to form the reservoir. Islands in the artificial lake were surveyed to examine how population sex ratio of a dioecious plant specie Pistacia chinensis B. was affected by landscape fragmentation. A natural population on the mainland near the lake was also surveyed for comparison. Population size, sex ratio and diameter at breast height (DBH) of individuals were measured over 2 years. More than 1,500 individuals, distributed in 31 populations, were studied. Soil nitrogen in the different populations was measured to identify the relationship between sex ratio and micro-environmental conditions. In accordance with the results of many other reports on biased sex ratio in relation to environmental gradient, we found that poor soil nitrogen areas fostered male-biased populations. In addition, the degree of sex ratio bias increased with decreasing population size and population connectivity. The biased sex ratios were only found in younger individuals (less than 50 years old) in small populations, while a stable 1:1 sex ratio was found in the large population on the mainland. We concluded that the effects of landscape fragmentation on the dioecious population sex ratio were mainly achieved in relation to changing soil nitrogen conditions in patches and pollen limitation within and among populations. Large populations could maintain a more suitable environment in terms of nutrient conditions and pollen flow, subsequently maintaining a stable sex ratio in dioecious plant populations. Both micro-environmental factors and spatial structure should be considered in fragmented landscape for the conservation of dioecious plant species.

AB We assessed the extent of recent environmental changes on leaf morphological (stomatal density, stomatal surface, leaf mass per unit area) and physiological traits (carbon isotope composition, delta C-13(leaf), and discrimination, Delta C-13(leaf), oxygen isotope composition, delta O-18(leaf)) of two tropical rainforest species (Dicorynia guianensis; Humiria balsamifera) that are abundant in the Guiana shield (Northern Amazonia). Leaf samples were collected in different international herbariums to cover a 200 year time-period (1790-2004) and the whole Guiana shield. Using models describing carbon and oxygen isotope fractionations during photosynthesis, different scenarios of change in intercellular CO2 concentrations inside the leaf (C-i), stomatal conductance (g), and photosynthesis (A) were tested in order to understand leaf physiological response to increasing air CO2 concentrations (C-a). Our results confirmed that both species displayed physiological response to changing C-a. For both species, we observed a decrease of about 1.7% in delta C-13(leaf) since 1950, without significant change in Delta C-13(leaf) and leaf morphological traits. Furthermore, there was no clear change in delta O-18(leaf) for Humiria over this period. Our simulation approach revealed that an increase in A, rather than a decrease in g, explained the observed trends for these tropical rainforest species, allowing them to maintain a constant ratio of C-i/C-a.

AB Quantifying and monitoring the structure and degradation of tropical forests over regional to global scales is gaining increasing scientific and societal importance. Reliable automated methods are only beginning to appear; for instance, through the recent development of textural approaches applied to high resolution optical imagery. In particular, the Fourier Transform Textural Ordination (FOTO) method shows some potential to provide non-saturating estimates of tropical forest structure, including for large scale applications. However, we need to understand more precisely how canopy structure interacts with physical signals (light) to produce a given texture, notably to assess the method's sensitivity to varying sun-view acquisition conditions. In this study, we take advantage of the detailed description of canopy topography provided by airborne small footprint LiDAR data acquired over the Paracou forest experimental station in French Guiana. Using hillshade models and a range of sun-view angles identical to the actual parameter distributions found for Quickbird (TM) images over the Amazon, we study noise and bias in texture estimation induced by the changing configurations. We introduce the bidirectional texture function, which summarizes these effects, and in particular the existence of a textural 'hot spot', similar to a well-known feature of bidirectional reflectance studies. For texture, this effect implies that coarseness decreases in configurations for which shadows are concealed to the observer. We also propose a method, termed partitioned standardization, that allows mitigating acquisition effects and discuss the potential for an operational use of VHR optical imagery and the FOTO method in the current context of international decisions to reduce CO2 emissions due to deforestation and forest degradation.

AB The matrix-tolerance hypothesis suggests that the most abundant species in the inter-habitat matrix would be less vulnerable to their habitat fragmentation. This model was tested with leaf-litter frogs in the Atlantic Forest where the fragmentation process is older and more severe than in the Amazon, where the model was first developed. Frog abundance data from the agricultural matrix, forest fragments and continuous forest localities were used. We found an expected negative correlation between the abundance of frogs in the matrix and their vulnerability to fragmentation, however, results varied with fragment size and species traits. Smaller fragments exhibited stronger matrix-vulnerability correlation than intermediate fragments, while no significant relation was observed for large fragments. Moreover, some species that avoid the matrix were not sensitive to a decrease in the patch size, and the opposite was also true, indicating significant differences with that expected from the model. Most of the species that use the matrix were forest species with aquatic larvae development, but those species do not necessarily respond to fragmentation or fragment size, and thus affect more intensively the strengthen of the expected relationship. Therefore, the main relationship expected by the matrix-tolerance hypothesis was observed in the Atlantic Forest; however we noted that the prediction of this hypothesis can be substantially affected by the size of the fragments, and by species traits. We propose that matrix-tolerance model should be broadened to become a more effective model, including other patch characteristics, particularly fragment size, and individual species traits (e. g., reproductive mode and habitat preference).

AB The relationship between ecosystem functioning and species diversity is important for conservation and restoration management of endangered ecosystems. Here we experimentally analysed the effects of tree species richness and composition on the fundamental ecosystem process of leaf litter decomposition in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. We measured the decomposition rates of leaf litter of eight broad-leaved, native tree species either individually or in mixtures of two, four, or six species. Additionally, we analysed the effect of macro- and meso-invertebrate exclusion using coarse- and fine-meshed litter bags. Species composition, but not species richness, significantly influenced litter decomposition rates. Invertebrate exclusion also influenced litter decomposition, although this effect varied between species and mixtures. Overall, litter decomposition dynamics was non-additive, i.e. observed decomposition rates of litter mixtures differed from what would be expected from the decomposition rates of their component species. However, there were also differences between mixtures, which could be at least partly attributed to the varying influence of invertebrates. We conclude that the relationship between the decomposition subsystem and species diversity in the Atlantic Rainforest follows the idiosyncratic response hypothesis and not the rivet hypothesis. For conservation or reforestation management, our results emphasise the need to maintain or restore the composition of locally native tree species communities rather than to maintain only a high tree species richness.

AB The discovery of biogeographical patterns among microbial communities has led to a focus on the empirical evaluation of the importance of dispersal limitation in microbial biota. As a result, the spatial distribution of microbial diversity has been increasingly studied while the synthesis of biogeographical theory with microbial ecology remains undeveloped. To make biogeographical theory relevant to microbial ecology, microbial traits that potentially affect the distribution of microbial diversity need to be considered. Given that many microorganisms in natural environments are in a state of dormancy and that dormancy is an important microbial fitness trait, I provide a first attempt to account for the effects of dormancy on microbial biogeography by treating dormancy as a fundamental biogeographical response. I discuss the effects of dormancy on the equilibrium theory of island biogeography and on the unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography, and suggest how the equilibrium theory of island biogeography can produce predictions approaching those of the Baas-Becking hypothesis (i.e. everything is everywhere, but the environment selects). In addition, I present a conceptual model of the unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography, generalized to account for dormancy, from which a full model can be constructed for species with or without dormant life history stages.

AB Despite the fact that tree plantations are not able to completely replace the ecological function of natural forests, the present study proposes to evaluate for which bird species or avian groups tree plantations act as habitat in fragmented landscape in southern Brazil. We compared the richness and abundance of bird species in a natural forest to adjacent plantations of Araucaria, a native tree species and of pine, an exotic plant in South America. Moreover, we evaluated the impact of tree plantations on richness of avian groups with different levels of dependence on forest habitat, feeding habits and foraging strata as well as on threatened species. The fixed 100 m radius point-counts method was used. A total of 114 bird species were recorded in all areas. Of those, 93 occurred in natural forest, 87 in Araucaria plantations and 81 in pine plantations. These results indicate that richness and abundance were lower in the pine plantations than in the natural forest and in the Araucaria plantations. Araucaria plantations can be used by a high number of bird species and their richness was not significantly lower than that observed in the adjacent natural forest. Our results suggest that Araucaria plantations could act as habitat for a large number of bird species, especially for forest-dependents species, insectivores, frugivores and species at different threat categories.

AB The reform of water policies in Brazil has involved a combination of regulatory norms and economic-incentive instruments. Nonetheless, contrary to its formal objectives, the process has largely failed to prevent widespread environmental impacts and growing spatial and sectoral conflicts. The main reason for such failures is the perverse influence of market rationality, which is particularly evident in the reorganization of the public sector, the quantification of the monetary value of water, and the payment for environmental services.

AB Many primate species are severely threatened, but little is known about the effects of global warming and the associated intensification of El Nino events on primate populations. Here, we document the influences of the El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) and hemispheric climatic variability on the population dynamics of four genera of ateline (neotropical, large-bodied) primates. All ateline genera experienced either an immediate or a lagged negative effect of El Nino events. ENSO events were also found to influence primate resource levels through neotropical arboreal phenology. Furthermore, frugivorous primates showed a high degree of interspecific population synchrony over large scales across Central and South America attributable to the recent trends in large-scale climate. These results highlight the role of large-scale climatic variation and trends in ateline primate population dynamics, and emphasize that global warming could pose additional threats to the persistence of multiple species of endangered primates.

AB The present study illustrates a method for analysing the biogeography of a group that is based on the group's phylogeny but does not invoke founder dispersal or centre of origin. The case studies presented include groups from many different parts of the world, but most are from the south-west Pacific. The idea that basal groups are ancestral is not valid as a generalization. Neither the basal group, nor the oldest fossil represents the centre of origin, the time of origin or the ancestral ecology. Basal groups comprise less diverse sister groups and their distributions occur around centres of differentiation in already widespread ancestors, and not centres of origin for the whole group. Thus, the sequence of nodes in a phylogeny may indicate the spatial sequence of differentiation in a widespread ancestor rather than a series of founder dispersal events. Allocation of clades to a priori geographic areas, such as the continents, in the initial stages of biogeographic analysis has often involved incorrect assumptions of sympatry. This has led to the idea that the 'areas of sympatry' were centres of origin. Areas other than those defined by the taxa themselves need not be used in analysis. The fossil-calibrated molecular clock, with dates transmogrified from minimum to maximum dates, has been used to test for vicariance. Recent work in population genetics, however, indicates that allopatry is caused by vicariance rather than founder dispersal, and so vicariance can instead be used to test the clock. Deriving evolutionary chronology by calibrating spatial vicariance in molecular clades with associated tectonic events is more reasonable than relying on the fossil record to give maximum (absolute) dates.

AB We investigated how much forest structure and floristics independently contributed to the composition of avian assemblages at multiple scales and for individual foraging guilds in tropical deciduous forests of Central Highlands, India. We derived dissimilarity matrices between all pairs of the 36 sampling sites with respect to forest structure, floristics, and bird species composition and ran Mantel's randomization tests to detect significant associations among the matrices after partialling out the effect of geographic distance between sites. Bird species composition was found to be significantly related to forest structure across habitats, and floristics within the moist-deciduous forests. This finding is consistent with earlier observations that birds respond, in their species composition, to vegetation structure across habitats and to vegetation composition within a habitat. As predicted, the composition of insectivorous birds was influenced by forest structure, but the phytophagous guild did not show any relation to vegetation composition in contrast to patterns observed elsewhere. We explain this anomaly as a result of availability of a wide choice of food plants for phytophagous birds in central Indian tropical forests and weak species-environment relationships on account of their nomadism. Extraction of non-timber forest products remains a key economic activity in central India and our results imply that it can potentially influence the composition of forest bird communities through alteration of forest structure and floristics.

AB Advanced recruitment and neutral processes play important roles in determining tree species composition in tropical forest canopy gaps, with few gaps experiencing clear secondary successional processes. However, most studies are limited to the relatively limited spatial scales provided by forest inventory plots, and investigations over the entire range of gap size are needed to better understand how ecological processes vary with tree mortality events. This study employed a landscape approach to test the hypothesis that tree species composition and forest structural attributes differ between large blowdown gaps and relatively undisturbed primary forest. Spectral mixture analysis on hyperspectral satellite imagery was employed to direct field sampling to widely distributed sites, and blowdown plots were compared with undisturbed primary forest plots. Tree species composition and forest structural attributes differed markedly between gap and non-gap sites, providing evidence of niche partitioning in response to disturbance across the region. Large gaps were dominated by classic Neotropical pioneer genera such as Cecropia and Vismia, and average tree size was significantly smaller. Mean wood density of trees recovering in large gaps (0.55 g cm(-3)) was significantly lower than in primary forest plots (0.71 g cm(-3)), a difference similar to that found when comparing less dynamic (i.e., tree recruitment, growth, and mortality) Central Amazon forests with more dynamic Western Amazon forests. Based on results, we hypothesize that the importance of neutral processes weaken, and niche processes strengthen, in determining community assembly along a gradient in gap size and tree mortality intensity. Over evolutionary time scales, pervasive dispersal among colonizers could result in the loss of tree diversity in the pioneer guild through competitive exclusion. Results also underscore the importance of considering disturbance processes across the landscape when addressing forest carbon balance.

AB Variation in postdispersal seed fate is an important factor driving patterns of forest regeneration. Because most previous studies have not tracked final seed fate and have commonly equated seed removal with predation without considering the possibility of secondary dispersal, little is known about individual seed mortality factors in successional and degraded habitats. This study tracked the postdispersal fate of large-seeded tropical montane trees in abandoned pasture, young secondary forests, and small forest fragments during two consecutive years in an agricultural landscape in southern Costa Rica. The incidence of secondary dispersal by animals, scatterhoarding in particular, and the effects of seed burial on germination were measured. Overall, seeds survived through germination more often in secondary forests with high levels of mortality occurring in abandoned pastures and forest fragments. The majority of seed mortality was caused by rodent predation in forest fragments, insects and fungal pathogens in secondary forests, and a combination of desiccation, insects, and fungal pathogens in pastures. Seeds were frequently secondarily dispersed in larger forest fragments, whereas they were only rarely moved in pastures and secondary forests. Burial tended to improve germination in pastures and was important for an often scatterhoarded species, Otoba novogranatensis, in all habitats. The results of this study suggest that: (1) seed mortality factors differ in response to the type of habitat degradation; (2) large-seeded species have high potential for survival when dispersed to young secondary forests; and (3) seed removal is not a reliable proxy for seed predation, particularly in less degraded forest fragments.

AB In tropical forests. trees compete not only with other trees, but also with lianas. which may limit tree growth and regeneration. Liana effects may depend on the availability of above- and below-ground resources and differ between tree species. We conducted a shade house experiment to test the effect of light (4% and 35% full sun, using neutral-density screen) on the competitive interactions between seedlings of one liana, (Byttneria grandifolia) and three tree species (two shade-tolerant trees, Litsea dilleniifolia and Pometia tomentosa, and one light-demanding tree. Bauhinia variegata) and to evaluate the contribution of both above- and below-ground competition. Trees were grown in four competition treatments with the liana: no competition. root competition. shoot competition and root and shoot competition. Light: strongly affected leaf photosynthetic capacity (light-saturated photosynthetic rate, P-n), growth and most morphological traits of the tree species. Liana-induced competition resulted in reduced P-n, total leaf areas and relative growth rates (RGR) of the three tree species. The relative importance of above- and below-ground competition differed between the two light levels. In low light. RGR of the three tree species was reduced more strongly by shoot competition (23.1-28.7% reduction) than by root competition (5.3-26.4%). In high tight. in contrast, root competition rather than shoot competition greatly reduced RGR. Liana competition affected most morphological traits (except for specific leaf area and leaf area ratio of Litsea and Pometia), and differentially altered patterns of biomass allocation in the tree seedlings. These findings suggest that competition from liana seedlings can greatly suppress growth in tree seedlings of both light-demanding and shade-tolerant species and those effects differ with competition type (below- and above-ground) and with irradiance.

AB The spatially implicit neutral model (SINM) of S. P. Hubbell predicts species' abundance distributions at two levels: local communities where extinction balances immigration, characterized by the immigration number I, and the metacommunity, a source pool of migrants where speciation balances extinction. Previously, a plot's I was estimated from its species abundance distribution. Here, we relate neutral theory to the additive partitioning of species diversity and calculate the immigration rate into different plots from the variation in species composition among them. We revisit the G(ST) statistic of population genetics to introduce a new version, G(ST)(k), conditional on each community sample k. We derive an analytical expectation of G(ST)(k) as a function of the local immigration number, I(k), under a generalized version of the SINM, which allows the pool of migrants to deviate from the large-scale speciation-extinction balance. Simulations and field data suggest that G(ST)(k) provides reasonable estimates of immigration numbers, which were compared with the results from alternative likelihood-based estimations.

AB Question: What is the main ecological process determining species assemblage in roadside herbaceous plant communities?
   Location: Roadside slopes ( roadcuts and embankments) in the south ( Malaga, mesic Mediterranean) and east ( Valencia, dry and continental) of the Iberian Peninsula.
   Methods: We identified 417 plant species, from which we selected the 331 most abundant ( within the 70th abundance percentile) at each site. We compiled information on 28 functional traits and on the biogeographic range of each of these 331 species. We quantified the phylogenetic signal of each trait for the species of each community and determined the number of functional convergences or divergences over the phylogenetic tree for each of the four situations ( roadcuts and embankments in the two sites).
   Results: There was a significant phylogenetic signal in many traits, being positive in Valencia embankments and negative in Valencia roadcuts with almost no signal in any type of slope in Malaga. Each trait was significantly correlated with 20%-35% of all other traits but correlation coefficients were low. No significant phylogenetic signal was found for the species' distribution range in any of the four communities studied, which might be the consequence of the complex mixture of biogeographic origins of the species found in these communities.
   Conclusion: The lack of a phylogenetic signal in most traits in Malaga, a climatically favourable locality, suggests that competitive exclusion was the main process involved in the assemblage of these communities. The significant and either positive or negative phylogenetic signal ( in embankments and roadcuts respectively), the latter coupled with a significant number of functionally convergent nodes in the phylogenetic tree, suggests that environmental filtering is the most likely process involved in the harsh locality of Valencia.

AB High quality wood core samples were collected from individual Acacia erioloba trees of unknown age in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. In the majority of samples examined, seasonal changes were reflected in the wood anatomy as bands of marginal parenchyma on the polished surfaces of discs or cores. Estimated radiocarbon age was determined by means of C-14 analysis for all samples. There was a strong correlation between the annual growth ring count and estimated radiocarbon age. A correlation was also found between age and stem circumference. Age structure of several A. erioloba populations in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park was subsequently determined. It could be demonstrated that the populations growing in the bed of the Nossob River showed poor recruitment; however, no clear relationship was found between flooding and regeneration of A. erioloba in the riverbed. The population growing in the dune field had a healthy age structure. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between phenology and tree stem diameter increment is largely unexplored in tropical species, especially in wet tropical forests. To explore links between these phenomena, we measured stem diameter increment and phenology often canopy tree species from a range of functional types in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica to test for seasonal and interannual patterns. We measured stem diameter increment using band dendrometers and visually assessed leaf and reproductive phenology monthly from 1997 to 2000. We categorized the species into groups based on patterns of leaf exchange and reproduction. Species were either deciduous with synchronous or asynchronous leaf drop, or evergreen with continuous or seasonal leaf flushing. Flowering occurred supra-annually, annually, or continuously. Of the ten species studied, four species, Cecropia insignis, Dipteryx panamensis, Lecythis ampla, and Simarouba amara, had consistent seasonal stem diameter increment patterns in both years. Dipteryx panamensis and L. ampla were deciduous with synchronized leaf drop. Cecropia insignis was evergreen and produced new leaves continuously. Simarouba amara, also evergreen, exchanged leaves over a brief period once a year. We tested whether stem diameter increment was correlated to phenology using logistic regression. Leaflessness significantly explained patterns in stem diameter increment but reproductive phenology did not. Deciduous trees were 2.6-9.3 times more likely to grow less than average the month following leaffall than in months when trees had full crowns.

AB This study evaluates the effects of fragmentation on the spatial and temporal dynamics of small litterfall production in Atlantic rainforest in Pernambuco State, Brazil. Litterfall. was collected for 24 months at two 0.2 ha sites, located in the forest edge zone and the forest interior, within a rainforest patch of about 300 ha. Structural parameters of both forest sites were recorded. Litter was sorted into six fractions (foliage, twigs, buds/flowers, fruits/seeds, peduncles, rest), dried and weighed. The interior forest plot contained 314 live trees with a dbh >= 5 cm and a stand basal area of 41.8 +/- 8.7 m(2), whereas the forest edge contained 211 live trees and a stand basal area of 23.4 +/- 3.6 m(2). Total small litterfall was extraordinarily high and totalled 12.62 +/- 4.73 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in interior forest and 14.74 +/- 2.78 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in forest edge. High litterfall rates are probably due to a pronounced periodicity, edge effects alter litterfall strongly. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Studies of post-dispersal seed removal in the Neotropics have rarely examined the magnitude of seed removal by different types of granivores. The relative impact of invertebrates, small rodents, and birds on seed removal was investigated in a 2,178 ha Atlantic forest fragment in southeastern Brazil. We used popcorn kernels (Zea mays-Poaceae) to investigate seed removal in a series of selective exclosure treatments in a replicated, paired design experiment that included forest understory, gaps, and forest edge sites. We recorded the vegetation around the experimental seed stations in detail in order to evaluate the influence of microhabitat traits on seed removal. Vertebrate granivores (rodents and birds) were surveyed to determine whether granivore abundance was correlated with seed removal levels. Seed removal varied spatially and in unpredictable ways at the study site. Seed encounter and seed use varied with treatments, but not with habitat type. However, seed removal by invertebrates was negatively correlated with gap-related traits, which suggested an avoidance of large gaps by granivorous ants. The abundance of small mammals was remarkably low, but granivorous birds (tinamous and doves) were abundant at the study site. Birds were the main seed consumers in open treatments, but there was no correlation between local granivorous bird abundance and seed removal. These results emphasize the stochastic spatial pattern of seed removal, and, contrary to previous studies, highlight the importance of birds as seed predators in forest habitats.

AB Worldwide, urbanisation has resulted in extensive replacement of natural habitats with manmade habitats. In Sydney Harbour, Australia, approximately half of the natural foreshore has been replaced by seawalls. Many of these have wharves built over part of their length, which could affect intertidal assemblages on seawalls beneath the wharves. This was tested by sampling and comparing assemblages under and not under wharves in Sydney Harbour. Assemblages differed between the two habitats, with greater cover of macro-algae and abundance of grazing molluscs on seawalls without a wharf and, to a lesser extent, greater cover of sessile invertebrates on seawalls under a wharf. There was, however, considerable spatial variability among locations in composition of assemblages and the species dominating differences between the two habitats. The impact of multiple artificial structures in close proximity and the variability among apparently homogeneous artificial habitats must be considered for the management of urbanised estuaries.

AB The size of treefall gaps is an important determinant of regeneration composition in tropical and temperate forests. Preliminary studies in the laurel forest of Tenerife have shown that small gaps (< 100 m(2)) were the most numerous. However, due to this small size, no significant differences were found between regeneration in gaps and regeneration below the canopy. Because infrequent large gaps (> 100 m(2)) are present in the laurel forest, we analyzed the regeneration in these large uncommon gaps, considering their potentially important role in the dynamics of the system. Our main hypothesis is that large gaps are important disturbance to ensure the regeneration and stablishment of shade intolerant species. Only five gaps larger than 100 m(2) (ranging from 125-268 m(2)) were found in the study area. Data from a further 20 small gaps (< 100 m(2)), analysed in a previous study, was also included. Control plots were examined close to the gaps in order to determine regeneration below the closed canopy. We did not find a significant difference between regeneration density in the gaps (< 100 m(2)) and regeneration below the canopy in the control plots. Contrary to our expectations, regeneration was lower in the large gaps than under the canopy. The open canopy in the large gaps increases light intensity, and has a negative effect on the germination and growth of shade-tolerant tree species like Viburnum tinus (although non-statistically significant); however, the increase in light intensity is not sufficient to stimulate the germination of shade-intolerant tree species. The effects of treefall gaps in the dynamics of the laurel forest of Anaga should be not considered as significant in comparison to other factors such as human disturbances or infrequent disturbances (land slides or hurricanes).

AB Beta diversity, or the turnover in species composition among sampling sites in a region, is an important criterion for obtaining adequate representation of regional biodiversity in systems of protected areas. Recently, the additive model for partitioning regional (gamma) diversity (in opposition to the multiplicative model) has been proposed because it allows a direct measure of the contribution of beta diversity to gamma diversity. We determined avian beta diversity along latitudinal (among neighboring river drainages) and elevational axes in a 1347-km(2) region on the western slope of the Central Cordillera of the Colombian Andes, where a regional system of protected areas is being designed. We then compared avian beta diversity between sites based on rapid versus long-term (> 1 year) inventories and between fragmented sites versus continuous forest Overall, beta diversity represented 63.1% of gamma diversity among 16 sites. Elevational differences in species composition accountedfor 43.3% of regional diversity, whereas differences among drainages accounted for 19.8%. A complementary cluster analysis showed that sites grouped by elevational zones. Rapid inventories overestimated beta diversity because of sampling effects, but the effect was biologically small. Estimators of species richness derived from species accumulation curves provided a useful alternative to compensate for undersampling in short-term surveys. Forest fragmentation increased beta diversity because of differential local extinction of populations. Nevertheless, in our region, forest fragments contributed to gamma diversity because they contained complementary sets of species. More importantly, they containedpopulations of specialinterest species. Although the region is relatively small, our analyses indicate that spatial differentiation of the biota is an important factor for deciding number and location of protected areas in the Andean region.

AB Fossil wood is both abundant and ubiquitous through geological time and space. During growth the parent plant was directly influenced by the biotic and abiotic (including climatic-) factors in the surrounding environment. The climate affects wood production in a number of ways and it is the resulting physiognomic and chemical characters that can help retrodict palaeoclimate. Physiognomic characters include those morphological and anatomical characters that in turn have enabled the use of wood characters, tree ring characters and statistical parameters (Mean Sensitivity) to determine seasonality, length and favourability of growing season, growth rates and forest productivity. Potential chemical characters discussed include (i) the preservation of wood-derived compounds (e.g. guaiacyl, syringyl p-hydroxyphenyl and resins); (ii)degree of lignin degradation to determine climate induced environmental changes; and (iii) stable isotopes (delta D, delta C-13 and delta O-18) to help determine aspects of past climates as derived from environmental changes. The feasibility and methodology of these characters, in both angiosperm and conifer wood, are reviewed in order to establish certain safe guards, or prerequisites, such that interpretations of palaeoclimate can be as unbiased, and thus as reliable, as possible.

AB According to the forest-growth-cycle theory, forest communities are dynamic, mosaic systems composed of patches in different developmental phases. Based on an investigation in a sample of tropical montane rain forest of Hainan Island in South China, four distinct growth phases or patch types were recognized and patterns of patch mosaics and changes in tree species diversity were studied. Diurnal changes in light and temperature regimes in different patch types of the forest growth cycle were measured and analysed. Our results were as follows: (1) The percentages of different patch types within the sampled forest Community were for the gap phase 38.5%, building phase 28.5%, mature phase 27.0% and degenerate phase 6.0%; (2) The change of densities (number of individuals/ha) of trees in the forest growth cycle was mainly caused by the larger sized trees; (3) The changes of species diversity with the forest growth cycle showed a humpback pattern; (4) The average DBH, average height, average basal area at DBH, and average volume of each individual and stand volume all increased with the forest cycle process; (5) Tree species richness and tree density at each phase of the forest cycle were positively correlated; (6) The environmental factors changed significantly, both diurnally and with progress of the forest cycle. Light intensity and soil surface temperature changed more in the gap phase than the other three phases. A framework to explain the mechanism for maintaining biological diversity within the tropical montane forest of Hainan Island is described. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Question: Does the development of Brachystegia-Julber-nardia (miombo) woodland after felling, and under a variable fire regime. occur via a seral stage of fire-tolerant species?
   Location: Four sites in central Zambia, Africa.
   Methods: Trees in replicate plots were clear-cut and stumps and resprouts enumerated. Species recruited into the tree layer (> 2.0 m tall) were monitored for 11 years (1991 - 2001) and fire occurrence and herbaceous biomass assessed annually to determine fuel loads.
   Results: Fire frequency was variable at the study sites and fuel loads were generally too low to suppress woodland regeneration after felling. However, at one site a change from low to high fire frequency arrested woodland development and triggered a regression towards a 'fire-trap' vegetation type in which a few fire-tolerant species survived. There was no evidence to support the hypothesis that miombo woodland regeneration is facilitated by a sere of fire-tolerant species. All regrowth after felling was from resprouting plants present before felling. Trees with a previous history of felling sprouted more vigorouslv than trees that had not been felled before. Species richness ill the tree layer increased with time since felling because resprout species had different height growth rates.
   Conclusion: The resilience of miombo trees after clear-felling is largely due to their capacity to regenerate vegetatively from resprouts and stumps after release from frequent fires. Coppicing is therefore recommended as a suitable management technique for miombo, woodland in central southern Africa.

AB The effects of tree species on the dynamics of nutrient transformations during leaf-litter decomposition are not well understood in tropical rain forests. To examine differences in the dynamics of C, nutrients, and organic constituents during decomposition among tree species, the leaf-litter decomposition of 15 trees was assessed using a litter-bag method in a lowland tropical rain forest in Sarawak. The dynamics of C was parallel to that of weight loss. The dynamics of nutrients were grouped into three patterns. The dynamics of K was characterized by a high leaching loss in the initial stages, and that of Ca and Mg generally showed a gradual decrease over the course of decomposition. The dynamics of N and P showed highly different patterns with the weight loss, and was characterized by relatively higher remaining mass at the end of the experiment. The variations or exceptions of nutrient dynamics among tree species were considered to be related to the initial concentration of each nutrient. For the dynamics of organic constituents, water-soluble carbohydrates disappeared quickly at the initial stages, and acid-soluble carbohydrates were the second fastest decomposing fraction; the decomposition of acid-insoluble residue (AIS) was the slowest. The release of limiting nutrients (N and P) generally followed the disappearance of AIS, but was independent of the disappearance of AIS when the initial concentrations of these nutrients were very low.

AB Although activity patterns are an important component of the ecology of animals as they search for food, mates and appropriate habitats, substantial variation can be observed even within a single population. The source of this variation is the combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors acting at an individual level. We documented the activity patterns of the ovoviviparous intertidal gastropod Littorina saxatilis (Olivi) over a series of tidal cycles to assess how differences in movements of individuals with different reproductive attributes (non-gravid females, gravid females and mates) might explain intra-population variability in activity. Four behaviors were measured for four consecutive tidal cycles for each of 3 months: the magnitude, frequency, and orientation of movements, and the use of shelters (i.e., crevices). In addition, we correlated movements with variations in several environmental factors (temperature, wind, humidity) during low tide to investigate the possible risk sensitivity of the different reproductive groups. All groups were more active and moved greater distances during high tide. Females, especially gravid females, appeared to be more risk-sensitive as they moved shorter distances and used shelters more often. Gravid females were also the only group with a negative relationship between air temperature and movement during low tide. We interpret these behaviors as a means to increase the probability of survival of the brooded offspring carried by the female. Males were the only group to consistently have directionality in their movements and showed evidence of an "up-down" behavior for remaining in a restricted zone. Reproductive attributes appear to be able to explain part of the intra-population variability in foraging activity in natural populations and should be taken into account in the design and interpretation of behavioral and ecological studies.

AB The present study describes the seasonal reproductive cycle and population structure of the porcellanid crab Petrolisthes laevigatus , a typical inhabitant of the rocky intertidal. A total of 960 individuals (including 372 females) was collected in monthly samples from October 1993 to December 1994 in central-southern Chile. Ovigerous females were present between August and December, and were absent between January and July. The breeding season started during late winter (August), and females with embryos close to hatching occurred between October and end of spring (December). Considering the gonadosomatic index and the duration of the incubation period, it is concluded that P. laevigatus has a markedly seasonal breeding period with probably two successive spawnings per female per season. Our results compared with previous studies in temperate intertidal porcellanids suggest a lower structural variability of the population during the sampling period, but a pronounced seasonal variation in both sex ratio and abundance. The influence of environmental habitat conditions (i.e. temperature) is suggested to be responsible for the lower variation in the crab population size structure in ovigerous females, and the almost constant size distribution observed in males.

AB Seed removal by rodents was investigated for Manilkara huberi and Chrysophyllum lucentifolium in a French Guianan forest. According to the escape hypothesis, seed survival was expected to be greater in populations of low conspecific adult density, while on the contrary, under the satiation hypothesis, it was expected to be greater in populations of high density. The two plots under study showed opposite densities for the two studied tree species. Therefore, according to both hypotheses, seed survival at each plot was expected to be opposite between species. To assess seed fate, seeds were thread-marked in order to relocate them after removal and to determine whether they were consumed or scatterhoarded by rodents. Contrary to what was expected, our results showed that both M. huberi and C. lucentifolium had better survival in the same plot. This suggests that seed fate for both study species was not influenced by the density of conspecific adult trees, but was rather affected by other habitat characteristics, likely the global resource abundance. Variation in seed predation rates of both species seemed largely related to their respective fruiting period, while seatterhoarding rate seemed more affected by intrinsic seed characteristics.

AB The potential generality of local processes in determining spatial patterns of molluscan assemblages in turfs of Corallina officinalis is evaluated by testing hypotheses about consistency in ecological pattern on shores in Australia, Ireland and Chile. Identical sampling protocols on 2 shores in each country were used to test 2 specific hypotheses: (1) that molluscan assemblages vary significantly among patches of turf separated by tens of meters, and (2) that these assemblages differ significantly between low- and mid-shore areas. In total, 58, 24 and 27 species of molluscs were found in samples from Australia, Ireland and Chile, respectively. There was a remarkable degree of congruence in the proportion of species that were represented in broad taxonomic groups, with proso-branch gastropods accounting for 52 to 79% of the total diversity at each locality. As predicted, there was significant variation in diversity and abundance of molluscs among patches of turf separated by tens of meters on each of the shores sampled. There was, however, little consistency in the structure of molluscan assemblages at different tidal heights, with significant differences on Australian shores, weak differences on Irish shores and no clear pattern on Chilean shores. Moreover, while the richness of species and abundance of prosobranchs was significantly greater in low-shore areas in Australia and Chile, the opposite trend was found in Ireland. Overall, the results show the potential for generality of factors that have previously been demonstrated to cause patchiness in molluscan assemblages in coralline turf at scales of tens of meters. It is proposed that testing for consistency in ecological patterns can be a useful and cost-effective first step in establishing the general importance of ecological processes.

AB The recruitment of a dioecious bird-dispersed tree, the holly Ilex aquifolium (Aquifoliaceae), was studied considering the stages of fruit removal by birds, seed rain, post-dispersal seed predation, seed germination and seedling survival. The main objective was to test the effect of different microhabitats within a beech forest on recruitment stages. Migrant thrushes were the main dispersers of this tree whose fruit crops were entirely removed during two study years. Seed rain was greatest beneath holly trees regardless of their sex and lowest in the open sites. Post-dispersal seed predation was examined by two experiments and did not differ between microhabitats despite its quantitative importance (about 70%). Seedling emergence, which probably corresponded to seeds from several cohorts, was greater beneath trees than in open sites and the density of second-yr to 5 cm seedlings depended on the presence-absence of ungulate herbivores and litter. While the former had a detrimental effect, the latter had a beneficial effect on seedling abundance. Seedling survival showed no significant variations between microhabitats but depended on seedling density in some microhabitats (holly, beech). Finally, the initial seed arrival seemed to determine microhabitat suitability for holly seedling establishment. However, under heavy browsing the density of seedlings may be strongly reduced leading to microhabitat homogeneity for holly seedling establishment.

AB In the tropical montane cloud forest of Veracruz, Mexico, most canopy trees are deciduous, whereas the understory is composed of small broadleaved evergreen trees and shrubs. In this study, I tested the hypotheses that (1) leafing and flowering in the understory occur when the canopy is most open; and (2) a shift in phenological patterns occurs in plants growing at the forest edge. In two microhabitats (interior and edge) at each of three study sites, foliar and reproductive phenologies were recorded in five shrub species (Eugenia xalapensis, Miconia glaberrima, Moussonia deppeana, Ocotea psychotrioides, and Palicourea padifolia), and canopy openness and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were measured monthly for 36 months. Canopy openness was greatest from November through February; however, PAR was highest during January-March. Leaf drop of the shrubs was continuous during the year. Leafing occurred throughout the year for Miconia, Moussonia, and Talicourea; leafing coincided with maximum PAR for Ocotea, but occurred during March-April for Eugenia. Flowering peaked from December to May, but Miconia, Moussonia, and Ocotea peaks coincided with levels of maximal PAR and were displaced by one month with respect to maximal canopy openness; the Palicourea flowering peak was negatively correlated with canopy openness. Fruiting was extended from March to October, coinciding with tree canopy fruiting. The results indicated that leafing and flowering in the understory started earlier than in the forest canopy. Leafing and flowering were synchronous in the interior and forest edge, but there was a weak trend for reduced peaks at the edge. The hypotheses were not supported: phenological patterns were temporally displaced between forest strata, but only three shrub species produced leaves and flowers during maximum PAR in the understory; there were no differences in phenological patterns between forest interior and edge.

AB A model of ecological processes that determine the behaviour of individual trees, and thus the overall characteristics of forest stands, is described, evaluated and discussed. The purpose of the model is to simulate individual trees as part of the SYMFOR framework for modelling the effects of silviculture on the growth and yield of tropical forests. The model encompasses the response of individual trees to a range of conditions, described in a spatially explicit form, that represent typical situations occurring in forests at all stages following management interventions. The model describes the processes governing the behaviour of trees, allowing it to be used with validity for simulations of management regimes that do not have experimental precedent. The model can thus guide or negate the requirement for lengthy and laborious field trials. Sub-models of tree growth, natural mortality and recruitment processes specify the ecological model. The growth model describes the annual diameter increment for an individual tree, calculated from a deterministic component using tree diameter, local competition (5 m radius), wider competition (30 m radius) and the effect of previous harvesting and a stochastic component representing the remaining variation. The mortality model represents the death of trees as a probability function that increases with diameter. Damage from falling trees is represented by a trapezium-shaped area in which all trees smaller than the falling tree are killed. The recruitment model uses 10 by 10 m(2) grid-squares to represent the probability of recruitment of trees past the 10 cm diameter threshold of the SYMFOR framework based upon the average competition within a grid-square. The whole model is derived from data and does not rely on theories of tree or forest behaviour, but all aspects represent real forest processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The dominance of a given tree or shrub species in a particular forest community may be determined by many ecological traits of the target species, as well as those of the surrounding species as its potential competitors. The present study was conducted to evaluate the possibility of predicting community status (species composition and dominance) on the basis of traits of local flora using statistical methods, and to visualize the mathematical function which determines species dominance. A general linear model and logistic regression were used for the statistical analysis. Dependent variables were designated as dominance and presence/absence of species in climax forest, with independent variables as vegetative and reproductive traits. Subalpine, cool-temperate, warm-temperate and subtropical climax rain forests in East Asia were studied. Quantitative prediction of climax community status could readily be made based on easily measured traits of local flora. Species composition and 74.6% of the total variance of species dominance were predicted based on two traits maximum height and shade tolerance. Through application of this method, the capacity of an alien species to invade a climax forest community could possibly be predicted prior to introduction of the alien species,

AB In addition to acting as seed predators. some terrestrial mammals bury seeds via scatter hoarding. This study system used two permanent plots in examining the interaction between small rodents and the seeds of the palm Astrocaryum mexicanum. We tested how experimental burial, and fruiting status of the parent, distance to the parent, seed size, and microsite characteristics affect the survival of these seeds. Up to 34% of the buried seeds that were exposed only to ignorant rodent foragers (individuals not responsible for burial) survived. In comparison. less than 1% of seeds buried by scatter hoarding rodents survived in previous studies, a percentage that is comparable to the low survival of unburied seeds in this study (<2%). Although unburied seeds had very low survival, increasing distance and/or seed density positively affected survival of unburied seeds. Distance to parent had no effect on buried seed survival.
   Buried seed survival was most strongly and significantly determined by the fruiting status of the trees under which they occurred. Seeds experienced significantly greater predation if buried under "parent" trees that fruited during the experiment. Buried seed survival was also negatively affected by germination, as germination may signal the presence of a seed to foraging rodents. There was some indication of a positive effect of tree density on seed survival between the two plots, whereas differences in rodent abundance appear to have no effect on seed survival. Seed size and microsite characteristics had no significant effect on buried seed survival, likely due to the greater proportional effects of other factors and the longevity of A. mexicanum seeds. The results of this study were used to generate a hypothetical causal network showing how comparatively low recovery of buried seeds by ignorant foragers combined with processes determining the removal of scatter hoarding foragers from their scattered seed caches may affect seedling recruitment in A. mexicanum.

   DEFORESTATION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; EASTERN AMAZON; RESPONSES; IMPACT; FIRES;
   CYCLE
AB This paper describes four global-change phenomena that are having major impacts on Amazonian forests. The first is accelerating deforestation and logging. Despite recent government initiatives to slow forest loss, deforestation rates in Brazilian Amazonia have increased from 1.1 million ha yr(-1) in the early 1990s, to nearly 1.5 million ha yr(-1) from 1992-1994, and to more than 1.9 million ha yr(-1) from 1995-1998. Deforestation is also occurring rapidly in some other parts of the Amazon Basin, such as in Bolivia and Ecuador, while industrialized logging is increasing dramatically in the Guianas and central Amazonia.
   The second phenomenon is that patterns of forest loss and fragmentation are rapidly changing. In recent decades, large-scale deforestation has mainly occurred in the southern and eastern portions of the Amazon - in the Brazilian states of Para, Maranhao, Rondonia, Acre, and Mate Grosso, and in northern Bolivia. While rates of forest loss remain very high in these areas, the development of major new highways is providing direct conduits into the heart of the Amazon. If future trends follow past patterns, land-hungry settlers and loggers may largely bisect the forests of the Amazon Basin.
   The third phenomenon is that climatic variability is interacting with human land uses, creating additional impacts on forest ecosystems. The 1997/98 Fl Nino drought, for example, led to a major increase in forest burning, with wildfires raging out of control in the northern Amazonian state of Roraima and other locations. Logging operations, which create labyrinths of roads and tracks in forests, are increasing fuel loads, desiccation and ignition sources in forest interiors. Forest fragmentation also increases fire susceptibility by creating dry, fire-prone forest edges.
   Finally, recent evidence suggests that intact Amazonian forests are a globally significant carbon sink, quite possibly caused by higher forest growth rates in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 fertilization. Evidence for a carbon sink comes from long-term forest mensuration plots, from whole-forest studies of carbon flux and from investigations of atmospheric CO2 and oxygen isotopes. Unfortunately, intact Amazonian forests are rapidly diminishing. Hence, not only is the destruction of these forests a major source of greenhouse gases, but it is reducing their intrinsic capacity to help buffer the rapid anthropogenic rise in CO2.

AB Hermit crabs that rely on gastropod shells for protection have to assess a number of shell features, each of which can bring different, and sometimes conflicting, advantages to their bearer. We examined how environmentally induced stress, in the form of hypoxia, can alter the relative benefits of different shell features and result in the selection of different shells by the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus. Hermit crabs under hypoxic conditions spent significantly less time investigating shells before entering them. Despite this apparently superficial assessment, they chose shells that were well suited to hypoxic conditions; After 24 h, they were found in shells that were significantly lighter than those chosen by hermit crabs under normal oxygen. This shift in preference was achieved at the expense of the internal spaciousness of the shell, which may have deleterious implications for predation and reproduction. This cost was more evident for larger hermit crabs since there was no relationship between hermit crab size and shell characteristics for hermit crabs in hypoxia. Under oxygen stress, hermit crabs therefore alter their shell preference in favour of lighter, and thus smaller, shells, probably reflecting a greater concern for energy minimization than protection from predation or reproduction.

AB Despite the importance of treefall gaps in tropical forest dynamics, few studies have followed gap-phase processes for more than 2 y. We monitored, for five years, the growth and survival of many seedlings of Tetragastris panamensis (Engler) O. Kuntze, Protium panamense (Rose) I. M. Johnston, and Desmopsis panamensis (Rob.) Saff. (three common tree species of the Panamanian tropical moist forest) in artificially created treefall gaps and under intact-canopy control plots. On these same plots, we also monitored light levels using hemispherical photographs taken over an 8-y period. Seedling height growth was faster in gaps than under intact canopies during the first 42 mo of regrowth, then declined to rates similar to those under intact canopies. Light levels in gaps similarly rose and fell, returning to pre-gap levels by month 48. Only Tetragastris panamensis showed higher survival in gaps, contrary to the general assumption that seedling survival is enhanced by gap creation. Our results document important transition points that mark the conclusion of the gap phase, suggesting an estimate of dry for the duration of the gap phase in this tropical forest.

AB Shells of small (< 7 mm) Littorina striata are frequently nodulose, but shells of larger individuals are striate. Nodulose L. striata dominated the littoral fringe of a black basalt Azorean shore where daytime rock temperatures rose significantly higher than nearby shores of different rock composition or colour. There was no evidence of intraspecific size-partitioning on the latter shores, where the numbers of striate and nodulose L. striata were approximately equal between high eulittoral (low-shore) and high littoral fringe (high-shore) localities. The prevalence of small L. striata in the littoral fringe is opposite to that usually characteristic of the Littorinidae, where the largest individuals usually occupy the higher positions on the shore. It is hypothesized that small L. striata attain a resting posture better able to minimize heat absorption from the substratum than attained by larger individuals. Smaller individuals also take advantage of both posture and a nodulose shell surface to re-radiate absorbed incident radiant thermal energy more effectively to the atmosphere by convection. Thus, small, nodulose L. striata are especially well adapted to occupy geologically young basaltic rocks commonly found fringing islands of the mid-Atlantic. The rate of evaporative water loss was determined for Melarhaphe neritoides and striate and nodulose L. striata for approximately 11 days emersion. All three groups are exceptionally capable of controlling evaporative water loss. Total percent evaporative water loss by nodulose L, striata (17.9%) was significantly greater than that lost by either striate L. striata (14.1%) or M. neritoides (13.5%) but, among 15 species for which evaporative water loss has been determined by similar methodology, M. neritoides and striate L. striata are the most capable of conserving body water during 11 days of emersion.

AB The production and post-deposition fate of pedal mucus from a tropical high shore limpet, Cellana grata (Could), was investigated on an exposed tropical shore. Mucus production while limpets were stationary, though a function of animal flesh weight, did not scale as expected if mucus production is proportional to foot area. Per unit area of foot, larger limpets secreted less mucus than smaller limpets. Mucus production per unit distance moved (maximum = 15.2 mu g . mm(-1) for an animal of 0.891 g flesh dry weight; minimum = 2.1 mu g . mm(-1) for an animal of 0.139 g flesh dry weight) showed great intraspecific variation and did not correlate with any measure of animal size (flesh dry weight, pedal width or foot area). The calorific value of pedal mucus (10.81 kJ . g(-1) dry weight) and the water (90.4%) and ash content (61.9%) were within the ranges determined for other, temperate and polar species of gastropod. The persistence of mucus placed on vertical and horizontal surfaces in situ (a half-life of 1-2 days), however, was greatly reduced in comparison with records for the temperate limpets Patella vulgata and Lottia gigantea. Cellulose nitrate filter discs coated with mucus and then fixed on-shore trapped microalgae (measured as chlorophyll a) as compared to uncoated discs, although values were 3-5 orders of magnitude lower (maximum mean increase: 0.279 mu g . 25 cm(-2) on discs fixed vertically and harvested after 10 days) than values for temperate species, Cellana grata invested a similar amount of energy in mucus production as the temperate P. vulgata. In energy terms, export of limpet mucus from Hong Kong shores was similar to export of gastropod mucus from temperate shores, However, on Hong Kong shores there does not appear to be any post-deposition off-set or benefit to this expenditure through trail-following or provendering: the persistence of mucus was too short and algal entrapment too slight to allow these functions. It is suggested that environmental factors, such as high temperatures and heavy wave splash, prevent any postdeposition function of C. grata mucus and this may constrain the energy budget of tropical species as compared to their temperate counterparts.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) drives many fundamental biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage, nutrient cycling, and soil development) in forest soil. However, the molecular-level characteristics of DOM derived from different types of tropical forest soils are poorly understood. Here, water samples at different soil depths (0, 20, and 40 cm) from tropical legume (Acacia auricuhformis, AA) and non-legume (Eucalyptus urophylla, EU) tree plantations were analyzed using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), and solution-state H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The FT-ICR MS results indicated that DOM persisted in the soil, but its molecular composition notably shifted from low-mass (150-300 Da) and more-aromatic molecules to middle- (300-450 Da) and highmass (>450 Da) and less-aromatic molecules with increasing soil depth. This was primarily mediated by consumption and mineral sorption of low-mass plant-derived DOM (e.g., low-mass carbohydrates and polyphenols) and further formation of larger microbial products (e.g., protein-like and lipid-like compounds). In addition, a higher abundance of microbial-derived molecules (e.g., protein-like and carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules) was found at the legume plantation relative to the non-legume plantation, which suggests a faster microbial turnover of DOM. Also, the legume plantation had greater enrichment of middle- and high-mass and condensed aromatic-like DOM components in soils. These findings improve our understanding of the drivers that mediate the response of DOM to soil depth and tree species in tropical plantations.

AB Climate models predict increases in drought conditions in many parts of the tropics. Yet the response of tropical forests to drought remains highly uncertain, especially with regards to the factors that generate spatial heterogeneity in drought response across landscapes. In this study, we used Landsat imagery to assess the impacts of a severe drought in 2015 across an 80,000-ha landscape in Puerto Rico. Specifically, we asked whether drought effects varied systematically with topography and with forest age, height, and fragmentation. We quantified drought impacts using anomalies of two vegetation indices, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), and fit random forest models of these metrics including slope, aspect, forest age, canopy height, and two indices of fragmentation as predictors. Drought effects were more severe on drier topographic positions, that is, steeper slopes and southwest-facing aspects, and in second-growth forests. Shorter and more fragmented forests were also more strongly affected by drought. We also assessed which factors were associated with stronger recovery from drought. Factors associated with more negative drought anomalies were also associated with more positive postdrought anomalies, suggesting that increased light availability as a result of drought led to high rates of recovery in forests more severely affected by drought. In general, recovery from drought was rapid across the landscape, with postdrought anomalies at or above average across the study area. This suggests that forests in Puerto Rico might be resilient to a single-year drought, though vulnerability to drought varies depending on forest characteristics and landscape position.

AB The concept of growth rings is little discussed in the literature and their treatment remains somewhat confusing in terms of the diversity of structures described. This situation has a major impact on the study of growth rings in tropical species, in which variations and complexity are greater and accuracy of identification less good. The rigid conceptual delimitations used by dendrochronologists and wood anatomists of temperate regions cannot be applied to the study of growth rings in most tropical species, which has led to neglect of this subject. With the objective of discussing the concept of growth rings, the present study consists of a survey of anatomical, periodicity, causal and evolutionary aspects of the treatment of these structures as evidenced in previous studies, and the evaluation of their application and limitations to the development of this concept. Anatomical aspects arise through radial integrity, or the presence of early and late wood; the degree of distinction of the rings, which may vary from well to poorly defined; and tangential continuity, meaning that rings may form a complete circle in the transverse section of the trunk, or instead be tangentially discontinuous, lens-shaped or in wedges. In addition there are a diversity of anatomical markers which enable us to recognize growth rings. Regarding periodicity, the rings may be annual, infra-annual or supra-annual. Causal aspects include genetic, endogenous and environmental components. Evolutionary aspects continue to be insufficiently investigated, and although most comparative studies treat growth rings recognized by different markers as though they were a single character, it remains questionable whether they can be regarded as homologous or the result of homoplasy. We conclude that the elaboration of a robust but broad definition which can include all the variation observed in growth rings of tropical species is a complex task, which is only possible by overcoming the restrictions adopted by dendrochronologists and wood anatomists of temperate regions for whom growth rings are essentially annual, strongly demarcated, tangentially continuous and restricted to the most pronounced markers.

AB ContextThe classical theory of island biogeography explains loss of species in fragmented landscapes as an effect of remnant patch size and isolation. Recently this has been challenged by the habitat amount and habitat continuum hypotheses, according to which persistence in modified landscapes is related to total habitat amount rather than habitat configuration or the ability of species to use all habitats to varying degrees. Distinguishing between these theories is essential for effective conservation planning in modified landscapes.ObjectiveIdentify which factors of habitat type, amount and configuration predict the persistence of a keystone woodland specialist, the eastern bettong Bettongia gaimardi, in a fragmented landscape.MethodIn the Midlands region of Tasmania we carried out camera surveys at 62 sites in summer and winter. We included habitat and landscape features to model whether habitat amount or patch size and isolation influenced the presence of the eastern bettong, and to measure effects of habitat quality.ResultsHabitat amount within a 1km buffer was a better predictor of occupancy than patch size and isolation. Occupancy was also affected by habitat quality, indicated by density of regenerating stems.ConclusionOur results support the habitat amount hypothesis as a better predictor of presence. For a species that is able to cross the matrix between remnant patches and utilise multiple patches, the island biogeography concept does not explain habitat use in fragmented landscapes. Our results emphasize the value of small remnant patches for conservation of the eastern bettong, provided those patches are in good condition.

AB PurposeConversion of shaded agroforests to unshaded monocultures endangers the resilience of tropical landscapes. Landscape-scale impacts of alternative shade managements have rarely been assessed. This study explored plantation- and landscape-level impacts of different shade management strategies on aboveground biomass, functional group diversity, and economic potential of cocoa production in northern Ecuador.MethodsWe simulated several cocoa shade management scenarios, using the dynamic forest model LANDIS-II: (i) baseline' projections representing the current mosaic of traditional agroforests, planted agroforests, and unshaded monoculture plantations; (ii) traditional' agroforestry shaded by native fruit and timber trees; (iii) planted' agroforests shaded by planted fruit trees; and (iv) monoculture' unshaded plantations. The impacts of setting aside 20, 30, and 40% of cocoa plantations for natural regeneration was tested for the monoculture scenario.ResultsTraditional agroforests shaded by native trees stored up to 7% more aboveground biomass and had higher abundances of rare functional groups compared to monocultures after 50years of simulation. Smaller effects were found for planted agroforests. Shaded plantations and land set aside for natural regeneration reduced forest fragmentation at the landscape level. The estimated yield gap for monoculture and shaded plantations could not be compensated by additional revenues for carbon storage at current carbon market price.ConclusionsImproving payment-for-ecosystem services and certification schemes are needed to incentivize smallholders to maintain substantial non-cocoa tree cover that may provide an environmental-friendly way to improve economic potential and food security for smallholders, while supporting biomass and functional group diversity at the landscape level.

AB Intensively managed timber plantations represent 7% of global forest cover and may partially compensate for deforestation-related biodiversity loss, yet are often criticized as 'green deserts' which support limited biodiversity. Growing concerns about the environmental impact of plantations in Chile have prompted numerous calls for a new forestry paradigm. Here, we systematically review the literature on biodiversity maintenance or loss in Chilean timber plantations and outline a new framework for biodiversity conservation therein, envisioning plantations as potential habitat that can be improved through informed management. Our review (N = 67 relevant publications) shows a strong taxonomic bias towards plants, mammals, birds, and invertebrates, as well as biases in the age and species composition of plantations studied. Most studies (78%) examined Pinta radiata plantations, 48% examined mature stands, and 46% did not specify stand age. Research to date is difficult to translate into conservation policy, since most studies simply compare biodiversity within versus outside of plantations, and do not evaluate alternative management options. To better inform conservation, we identify six critical stages of plantation development during which management decisions may greatly influence biodiversity outcomes. Within each stage we discuss the effects of specific management practices on Chilean biodiversity, highlighting opportunities and key knowledge gaps. Strategies which promote structural complexity, understory cover, and landscape connectivity should help convert plantations into a less hostile matrix that provides adequate habitat for substantial native biodiversity. Given the global proliferation of plantations and their consequences for biodiversity, similar studies are needed in multiple regions of the world.

AB Humans can alter fire dynamics in grassland systems by changing fire frequency, fire seasonality and fuel conditions. These changes have effects on vegetation structure and recovery, species composition, and ecosystem function. Understanding how human management can affect fire regimes is vital to detect potential changes in the resilience of plant communities, and to predict vegetation responses to human interventions. We evaluated the fire regimes of two recently protected areas in Madagascar (Ibity and Itremo NPA) and one in Brazil (Serra do Cipo NP) before and after livestock exclusion and fire suppression policies. We compare the pre- and post-management fire history in these areas and analyze differences in terms of total annual burned area, density of ignitions, burn scar size distribution, fire return period and seasonal fire distribution. More than 90% of total park areas were burned at least once during the studied period, for all parks. We observed a significant reduction in the number of ignitions for Ibity NPA and Serra do Cipo NP after livestock exclusion and active fire suppression, but no significant change in total burned area for each protected area. We also observed a seasonal shift in burning, with fires happening later in the fire season (October November) after management intervention. However, the protected areas in Madagascar had shorter fire return intervals (3.23 and 1.82 years) than those in Brazil (7.91 years). Our results demonstrate that fire exclusion is unattainable, and probably unwarranted in tropical grassland conservation areas, but show how human intervention in fire and vegetation patterns can alter various aspects of the fire regimes. This information can help with formulating realistic and effective fire management policies in these valuable conservation areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook) plantations are widely grown for timber production in southern China, they have low biodiversity and provide limited ecosystem services. To address this problem, C. lanceolata are increasingly mixed with broadleaf Schima superba Gardn. & Champ. (Theaceae). The success of these mixed plantations relies on introducing each species in the appropriate sequence, which requires understanding how tree species respond to light variations. We therefore compared S. superba and C. lanceolata seedling light tolerance in shaded houses under five light gradients (5%, 15%, 40%, 60%, and 100% sunlight). Our findings showed that S. superba seedlings exhibited greater net height increment (Delta Ht), net diameter growth (Delta Dia), leaf area, root mass, stem mass, leaf mass, and total mass under low light conditions (15% sunlight). However, as sunlight increased, these growth variables became higher in C. lanceolata seedlings. With more sunlight, both species experienced a drop in height to diameter ratio (HDR), and specific leaf area (SLA), but an elevated root to shoot ratio. Additionally, under the same light levels, S. superba seedlings exhibited greater leaf area and root to shoot ratio than C. lanceolata seedlings. Our results suggested that S. superba might be more suitable for underplanting beneath a heavy canopy due to its shade-tolerant traits. In contrast, C. lanceolata was less shade-tolerant, having an optimum seedling growth under full sunlight. These findings suggest that underplanting S. superba seedlings in C. lanceolata monoculture plantation (i.e., underplanting regeneration approach) could be a better silvicultural alternative than simultaneously planting both seedlings.

TI Biogeography and diversification of Rhegmatorhina (Aves:

AB Aim: To test the importance of alternative diversification drivers and biogeographical processes for the evolution of Amazonian upland forest birds through a densely sampled analysis of diversification of the endemic Amazonian genus Rhegmatorhina at multiple taxonomic and temporal scales.
   Location: Amazonia.
   Taxon: Antbirds (Thamnophilidae).
   Methods: We sequenced four mtDNA and nuclear gene regions of 120 individuals from 50 localities representing all recognized species and subspecies of the genus. We performed molecular phylogenetic analyses using both gene tree and species tree methods, molecular dating analysis and estimated population demographic history and gene flow.
   Results: Dense sampling throughout the distribution of Rhegmatorhina revealed that the main Amazonian rivers delimit the geographic distribution of taxa as inferred from mtDNA lineages. Molecular phylogenetic analyses resulted in a strongly supported phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus, with two main clades currently separated by the Madeira River. Molecular dating analysis indicated diversification during the Quaternary. Reconstruction of recent demographic history of populations revealed a trend for population expansion in eastern Amazonia and stability in the west. Estimates of gene flow corroborate the possibility that migration after divergence had some influence on the current patterns of diversity.
   Main Conclusions: Based on broad-scale sampling, a clarification of taxonomic boundaries, and strongly supported phylogenetic relationships, we confirm that, first, mitochondrial lineages within this upland forest Amazonian bird genus agree with spatial patterns known for decades based on phenotypes, and second, that most lineages are geographically delimited by the large Amazonian rivers. The association between past demographic changes related to palaeoclimatic cycles and the historically varying strength and size of rivers as barriers to dispersal may be the path to the answer to the long-standing question of identifying the main drivers of Amazonian diversification.

AB Africa's savannas are undergoing rapid conversion from rangelands into villages and croplands. Despite limited research, and evidence of deleterious effects to biodiversity, international organisations have earmarked this system for cropland. Invertebrates, and ants in particular, are sensitive indicators of habitat fragmentation, and contribute to ecosystem services at a range of scales. We investigated how rangelands, villages and croplands differ in ant species and functional diversity, and assemblage composition. We sampled ants using pitfall traps at 42 sites (14 replicates each in rangeland, cropland, and village) in northern South African savannas. We investigated the impact of landuse, season, and multiple soil and vegetation habitat variables on ant species diversity, assemblages and functional diversity. Rangelands had the greatest ant species richness, particularly in the wet season. Richness declined with increasing soil clay content. Ant assemblages were distinctly different between landuse types. Rangeland harboured the widest diversity of indicator species, and contained greatest functional diversity. Rangelands accommodated more scavengers, granivores, and plant-matter feeders than cropland, and representation of these groups varied with season. Ants play essential roles in soil nutrient cycling, plant and seedling recruitment, and impact other arthropods through predation and aphidoculous behaviour that in turn influences entire food webs. Thus, the reduced species richness, changes in assemblage composition and the loss of functional groups in ant assemblages found in cropland and villages is potentially problematic. Left unchallenged, these new forms of landuse threaten to characterise the entire African savanna system, impacting not only future ecological, but possibly also human wellbeing.

AB This study presents the setup, calibration, validation and scenario application of the soil and water assessment tool for two contrasting macro-catchments along the Amazon agricultural frontier in the federal states of Para and Mato Grosso, Brazil. Calibration and validation of the model are realised for the periods of the most intensive deforestation and agricultural expansion. In order to give consideration to the rapid, however gradual nature of land use change, the model implements an annual land use update combined with a land use dependent soil parameterization of the upper most soil layer. The comparison of these results with the results of a setup with a steady land use distribution shows distinct improvements of the prediction quality. Discharge prediction improves through the application of gradual land use change in the model by 12 % for a 1.8 % deforestation rate per year and 1.2 % for a deforestation rate of 0.7 % per year. Consequently, the validated models are applied to four land use scenarios for the period 2026-2035. Scenario simulation results show effects on the water balance proportional to land use change. Further, the changes in the water balance follow clear seasonal patterns with highest hydrological effects due to land use change during the rainy season in both catchments. Overall, with continuous deforestation, peak discharge increases. Further, the conversion of native vegetation to pasture has the highest impact on the water balance. For example, monthly discharge in the rainy season increases by up to 24 % for a 13 % conversion of Cerrado savannah into pasture.

AB Ecosystem restoration can help reverse biodiversity loss, but whether faunal communities of forests undergoing restoration converge with those of primary forest over time remains contentious. There is a need to develop faunal indicators of restoration success that more comprehensively reflect changes in biodiversity and ecosystem function. Ants are an ecologically dominant faunal group and are widely advocated as ecological indicators. We examine ant species and functional group responses on a chronosequence of rainforest restoration in northern Australia, and develop a novel method for selecting and using indicator species. Four sampling techniques were used to survey ants at 48 sites, from grassland, through various ages (1-24years) of restoration plantings, to mature forest. From principal components analysis of seven vegetation metrics, we derived a Forest Development Index (FDI) of vegetation change along the chronosequence. A novel Ant Forest Indicator Index (AFII), based on the occurrences of ten key indicator species associated with either grassland or mature forest, was used to assess ant community change with forest restoration. Grasslands and mature forests supported compositionally distinct ant communities at both species and functional levels. The AFII was strongly correlated with forest development (FDI). At forest restoration sites older than 5-10years that had a relatively closed canopy, ant communities converged on those of mature rainforest, indicating a promising restoration trajectory for fauna as well as plants. Our findings reinforce the utility of ants as ecological indicators and emphasize the importance of restoration methods that achieve rapid closed-canopy conditions. The novel AFII assessed restoration status from diverse and patchily distributed species, closely tracking ant community succession using comprehensive species-level data. It has wide applicability for assessing forest restoration in a way that is relatively independent of sampling methodology and intensity, and without a need for new comparative data from reference sites.

AB Aims
   Most biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research has been carried out in grassland ecosystems, and little is known about whether forest ecosystems, in particular outside the temperate zone, respond similarly. Here, we tested whether productivity, assessed as leaf area index (LAI), increases with species richness in young experimental stands of subtropical trees, whether this response is similar for early-season leaf area (which is dominated by evergreens) and seasonal leaf area increase (which is dominated by deciduous species), and whether responses saturate at high species richness.
   Methods
   We used a planted tree biodiversity experiment in south-east China to test our hypotheses. LAI was determined three times by digital hemispheric photography in 144 plots that had been planted with 400 trees each, forming communities with 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 tree species.
   Important Findings
   LAI increased significantly with tree species richness in the fifth year of stand establishment. Similar, but weaker, statistically non-significant trends were observed 1 year before. We did not observe leaf area over-yielding and the presence of particularly productive and unproductive species explained large amounts of variation in leaf area, suggesting that selection-type effects contributed substantially to the biodiversity effects we found in this early phase of stand establishment. Effects sizes were moderate to large and comparable in magnitude to the ones reported for grassland ecosystems. Subtropical (and tropical) forests harbor substantial parts of global net primary production and are critical for the Earth's carbon and hydrological cycle, and our results suggest that tree diversity critically supports these ecosystem services.

AB Payments for Hydrologic Services (PHS) programs are increasingly used as a policy tool to provide incentives for upstream landowners to adopt land use activities that favor sustainable provision of high-quality water to downstream areas. However, the effectiveness of PHS programs in achieving their objectives and the potential for unintended (often undesirable) consequences remain poorly understood. We integrate results from ecohydrological and socioeconomic research to explore the impact of Mexico's PHS program on the target hydrologic services and people's decisions, behavior, and knowledge regarding forest conservation and water. Using central Veracruz as our case study, we identify areas of both synchrony and disconnection between PHS goals and outcomes. Mature and regenerating cloud forests (targeted by PHS) were found to produce enhanced hydrologic services relative to areas converted to pasture, including reduced peak flows during large rain events and maintenance of dry-season base flows. However, unexpectedly, these hydrologic benefits from cloud forests were not necessarily greater than those from other vegetation types. Consequently, the location of forests in strategic watershed positions (e.g., where deforestation risk or hydrologic recharge are high) may be more critical than forest type in promoting hydrologic functions within watersheds and should be considered when targeting PHS payments. While our results suggest that participation in PHS improved the level of knowledge among watershed inhabitants about forest-water relationships, a mismatch existed between payment amounts and landowner opportunity costs, which may contribute to the modest success in targeting priority areas within watersheds. Combined, these findings underscore the complexity of factors that influence motivations for PHS participation and land use decisions and behavior, and the importance of integrating understanding of both ecohydrological and socioeconomic dynamics into PHS design and implementation. We conclude by identifying opportunities for improving the design of PHS programs and recommending priority areas for future research and monitoring, both in Mexico and globally.

AB We investigated the magnitude and drivers of spatial variability in soil and plant delta N-15 across the landscape in a topographically complex semiarid ecosystem. We hypothesized that large spatial heterogeneity in water availability, soil fertility and vegetation cover would be positively linked to high local-scale variability in delta N-15.
   We measured foliar delta N-15 in three dominant plant species representing contrasting plant functional types (tree, shrub, grass) and mycorrhizal association types (ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal). This allowed us to investigate whether delta N-15 responds to landscape scale environmental heterogeneity in a consistent way across species.
   Leaf delta N-15 varied greatly within species across the landscape and was strongly spatially correlated among co-occurring individuals of the three species. Plant delta N-15 correlated tightly with soil delta N-15 and key measures of soil fertility, water availability and vegetation productivity, including soil nitrogen (N), organic carbon (C), plant-available phosphorus (P), water-holding capacity, topographic moisture indices and normalized difference vegetation index. Multiple regression models accounted for 62-83% of within-species variation in delta N-15 across the landscape.
   The tight spatial coupling and interdependence of the water, N and C cycles in drylands may allow the use of leaf delta N-15 as an integrative measure of variations in moisture availability, biogeochemical activity, soil fertility and vegetation productivity (or 'site quality') across the landscape.

AB The upper soil provides support, water, and nutrients to terrestrial plants and is therefore crucial for forest dynamics. We hypothesised that a tree's metabolic activity (and therefore its metabolome; the total set of metabolites) would be affected by both the depth of upper soil layers and water availability. We sampled leaves for stoichiometric and metabolomic analyses once per season from differently sized Quercus ilex trees under natural and experimental drought conditions representing the likely conditions in the coming decades). Although the metabolomes varied according to tree size, smaller trees did not show higher concentrations of biomarker metabolites related to drought stress. However, the effect of the drought treatment on the metabolomes was greatest for small trees growing in shallow soils. Our results suggest that tree size is more dependent on the depth of the upper soil, which indirectly affects a tree's metabolome, rather than on the moisture content in the upper soil. Metabolomic profiling of Q. ilex supports our finding that water availability in the upper soil is not necessarily correlated with tree size. The higher impact of drought on trees growing in shallower soils nevertheless indicates that any increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of drought - as has been projected for the Mediterranean Basin and other areas - would affect small trees most. Metabolomics has proved to be a useful means for investigating the links between plant metabolism and environmental conditions. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB Forests with closed canopy are generally thought to resist invasion by other species because of the low light conditions under the canopy. However, moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) is capable of invading adjacent intact forests, including Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) forest, broad-leaved forest, and mixed broadleaf-conifer forest. How does moso bamboo manage to expand and grow under the deep shade of forest canopies? To test this question and explore the light conditions in which bamboo shoots survive, we experimented with shading treatments under field conditions. The levels of shading included total shading of young bamboo shoots, shading with light only to the tip of the shoots (tip light), and no shading (full light). Treatments were applied to shoots developing in pure stands of moso bamboo, and shoots that were invading Chinese fir stands. Shoot survivorship, height, and diameter at breast height (DBH) were measured weekly. Total shading of bamboo shoots led to mortality of all shoots, compared with >90% survival for shaded shoots with tip light and for unshaded shoots. Bamboo shoots elongated over a 60 day period, reaching heights of more than 10 m. Height growth was 8-13% higher for shaded shoots with tip light than for unshaded shoots, with no significant effect of stand type. The elongation of bamboo shoots is largely independent of the light environment that would influence current photosynthesis of the shoot, indicating that shoot elongation likely depends on supplies of carbohydrates from the clonal root system. The deep tolerance of shade that results from clonal of new shoots appears to be a key factor allowing its invasion of intact forest stands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Conspecific density may contribute to patterns of species assembly through negative density dependence (NDD) as predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, or through facilitation (positive density dependence; PDD). Conspecific density effects are expected to be more negative in darker and wetter environments due to higher pathogen abundance and more positive in stressful, especially dry, environments (stress-gradient hypothesis). For NDD to contribute to maintaining diversity, it should be apparent at the community-wide scale as a negative correlation between seedling recruitment, growth or survival and conspecific adult abundance (community compensatory trend; CCT).
   2. We examined seedling survival in relation to con-and heterospecific adults within 10 m and con-and heterospecific seedlings within 1 m for 13 species within two 4-ha permanent plots located in dry and wet forests in Hawaii. We also examined interactions between conspecific density and light and species' commonness.
   3. For all species pooled, adult conspecific effects were positive (PDD) in both dry and wet forests, though they were stronger in the dry forest. In contrast, seedling conspecific effects were negative (NDD), though only significantly so in the wet forest.
   4. The strength and direction of density effects varied with understorey light such that seedlings had the highest survival where both adult conspecific density and light were high but the lowest survival where seedling conspecific density and light were high.
   5. In the wet forest, the most common species showed positive effects of adult conspecifics, but the less common species showed negative adult conspecific effects. We found mixed evidence for a CCT: seedling survival was positively correlated with basal area, but negatively correlated with tree density (stems ha(-1)). Thus, it remains unclear whether NDD is a diversity-maintaining mechanism in these forests.
   6. Synthesis. Overall, we found that positive conspecific effects influenced seedling mortality patterns more than negative interactions did, even in tropical wet forest where NDD is predicted to drive species' abundances. Additionally, the strength and direction of density effects varied with forest type, PAR, and species' abundance, underscoring the need to consider abiotic factors and species' life-history traits in tests of density dependence hypotheses.

AB MacArthur and Wilson's theory of island biogeography predicts that island species richness should increase with island area. This prediction generally holds among large islands, but among small islands species richness often varies independently of island area, producing the so-called 'small-island effect' and an overall biphasic species-area relationship (SAR). Here, we develop a unified theory that explains the biphasic island SAR. Our theory's key postulate is that as island area increases, the total number of immigrants increases faster than niche diversity. A parsimonious mechanistic model approximating these processes reproduces a biphasic SAR and provides excellent fits to 100 archipelago datasets. In the light of our theory, the biphasic island SAR can be interpreted as arising from a transition from a niche-structured regime on small islands to a colonization-extinction balance regime on large islands. The first regime is characteristic of classic deterministic niche theories; the second regime is characteristic of stochastic theories including the theory of island biogeography and neutral theory. The data furthermore confirm our theory's key prediction that the transition between the two SAR regimes should occur at smaller areas, where immigration is stronger (i.e. for taxa that are better dispersers and for archipelagos that are less isolated).

AB Background: Preimaginal black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) are important components of the stream ecosystem. However, there has been limited research undertaken on the vertical distribution of preimaginal black flies and their associated ecological factors. Stream conditions are generally variable along the altitudinal gradient. Therefore, we conducted an in-depth entomological survey to investigate the simuliid distribution pattern along an altitudinal gradient in Peninsular Malaysia.
   Methods: A total of 432 collections were performed in this study (24 samplings at each of 18 fixed-streams at monthly intervals) from February 2012 to January 2014. Larvae and pupae attached on aquatic substrates such as grasses, leaves and stems, twigs, plant roots and rocks were collected by hand using fine forceps. Stream depth (m), width (m), velocity (m/s), water temperature (degrees C), acidity (pH), conductivity (mS/cm) and dissolved oxygen (mg/L) were measured at the time of each collection.
   Results: A total of 35 black fly species were recorded in the present study. The most frequently collected species were Simulium tani (31.7 %) and S. whartoni (21.5 %), while the relatively common species were Simulium sp. (nr. feuerborni) (16.2 %), S. decuplum (15.5 %), S. angulistylum (14.8 %), S. bishopi (13.2 %) and S. izuae (11.8 %). Total estimated species richness ranged between 39.8 and 41.3, which yielded more than 80 % of sampling efficiency. Six simuliid species were distributed below 500 m, whereas eight species were distributed above 1400 m. Simulium sp. (nr. feuerborni) and S. asakoae were found from middle to high altitudes (711-1813 m). Simulium whartoni, S. brevipar and S. bishopi were distributed widely from low to high altitudes (159-1813 m). Regression analysis between species richness and PCs revealed that the species richness was significantly associated with wider, deeper and faster streams at low altitude, normal water temperature (23-25 degrees C), low conductivity, higher discharge, more canopy cover and riparian vegetation and with larger streambed particles (F = 20.8, df = 1, 422, P < 0.001). Forward logistic regression indicated four species were significantly related to the stream variables (S. whartoni, Simulium sp. (nr. feuerborni), S. tani and S. angulistylum). Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the temperature, stream size and discharge were the most important factors contributing to the separation of the stream sites from different altitude and hence are the predictors for the distribution of black fly species assemblages.
   Conclusions: This study has provided insight into the distribution pattern of preimaginal black fly assemblages along an altitudinal gradient in Peninsular Malaysia. This study could deepen our knowledge on the ecology and biology of the specialised taxa in response to environmental changes.

AB Rainforest restoration is an important application in today's multipurpose management of secondary forest. However, our knowledge of tree species' traits and responses to treatment is insufficient for foresters to make good decisions for sustainable management. The aim of our study was to see whether it is possible to predict tree species' responses to increased light based on species' traits, and to relate these responses to a possible pioneer-climax continuum of life history traits, also among species with presumed climax properties. We examined 33 taxa (including 19 from the dipterocarp family) replicated 20 times and randomly planted in lines over a 3 ha area in the interior of Sabah, Borneo. Four years after establishment we performed a canopy reduction treatment to increase the light conditions up to levels present in tree gaps in the forest. We created a PLS (Partial Least Square Regressions) model with the two predicted variables HGR (height growth response) and Q3 HGR (the 75 percentile of a species' HGR, interpreted as the potential HGR). The model captured 47% of the variation for the predicted variables. We found significant tree species' responses in height growth to the increased light. High specific leaf area, strong early height growth, high foliar N content, high leaved stem length and large crown were linked to fast growth, while high wood density and high foliar K content were associated with slow growth. We also found a trade-off between growth response and survival among the species. We conclude that climax tree species have specific life history adaptations along a pioneer-climax continuum, which can be predicted from species' traits. The importance of easily observed or extracted traits such as initial growth rate, specific leaf area and wood density for predicting growth suggests the possibility of fast screening of species with unknown characteristics, which could be of great value in practical forest management.

AB The loss of tropical forests has continued in recent decades despite wide recognition of their importance to maintaining biodiversity. Here, we examine the conversion of forests to pastures and coca crops (illicit activity) on the San Lucas Mountain Range, Colombia for 2002-2007 and 2007-2010. Land use maps and biophysical variables were used as inputs to generate land use and cover change (LUCC) models using the DINAMICA EGO software. These analyses revealed a dramatic acceleration of the pace of deforestation in the region, with rates of conversion from forest to pasture doubling from the first to the second period. Altitude, distance to other crops, and distance to rivers were the primary drivers of deforestation. The influence of these drivers, however, differed markedly depending on whether coca cultivation or pastures replaced forest. Conversion to coca was more probable farther from other crops and from settlements. In contrast, proximity to other crops and to settlements increased conversion to pasture. These relationships highlight the different roles of coca and pastures in forest loss, with coca tending to open up new forest frontiers, and pastures tending to consolidate agricultural expansion and urban influence. Large differences between LUCC processes for each period suggest highly dynamic changes, likely associated with shifting underlying causes of deforestation. These changes may relate to shifts in demand for illicit crops, land, or mining products; however, the data to test these hypotheses are currently lacking. More frequent and detailed monitoring is required to guide actions to decrease the loss of forest in this highly vulnerable biodiversity hotspot in the Northern Andes.

AB Although one of the most widely studied hypotheses for high tree diversity in the tropics, the Janzen-Connell hypothesis (JC), and the community compensatory trend upon which it is based, have conflicting support from prior studies. Some of this variation could arise from temporal variation in seedling survival of common and rare species. Using 10 years of data from La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, we analyzed annual seedling survival and found that negative density-dependence (negative DD) was significantly stronger for rare species than for common species in 2 years and was significantly stronger for common species than for rare species in 4 years. This temporal variation in survival was correlated with climatic variables: in warmer and wetter years, common species had higher negative DD than rare species. The relationship between climate and variation in JC effects on seedling survival of common and rare species could have important consequences for the maintenance of tree species diversity in Central America, which is predicted to experience warmer and wetter years as global change proceeds.

AB Many leaf-cutter ant species are well known pests in Latin America, including species of the genera Acromyrtnex and Atta. An environmentally friendly strategy to reduce the number of leafcutter ants and avoid indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides is biological control. In this work we evaluated the effectiveness of a strain of the entomopathogen Putpureocillium lilacinum, against worker ants from six Acromyrmex lundii field colonies, after immersions in pure suspensions at a concentration of 1 x 10(6) conidia ml(-1). Survival of ants treated with P. lilacinum was significantly lower than that recorded in controls, and median lethal time (LT50) was 6-7 days. P. lilacinum was responsible for 85.6% (80.6-89.7) of the mortality in inoculated ants, in which we found that the percentage of other entomopathogens that naturally infected ants decreased also, suggesting a good competitive capability of the fungus. Horizontal transmission to non-inoculated ants was also evidenced, given that 58.5% (41.9-64.2) of them died because of P. lilacinum. Moreover, we tested pathogenicity for three concentrations of this strain (1.0 x 10(4), 10(6) and 10(8) conidia ml(-1)) and found a significantly faster mortality of ants and greater median percentage of infection at 10(6) conidia ml(-1) of P. lilacinum. CL50 value was 2.8 x 10(5) conidia ml(-1). We thus propose the use of P. lilacinum as a biological control agent of leafcutter ants in crops and plantations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Direct seeding is a promising technique for ecological restoration, but it has been poorly studied in neotropical savannas. Different types of plant cover (no cover, crops, or green manure) and fertilization (unfertilized, synthetic fertilizer, or poultry litter) were used to verify if survival and growth of different tree species after direct seeding could be enhanced by the use of any combination of these techniques. Seedling emergence, establishment, and growth were followed for 2 years for six savanna tree species sown in an agricultural field in Central Brazil. Germination was high (52%, on average) for Anacardium occidentale, Aspidosperma macrocarpon, Hymenaea stigonocarpa, Dipteryx alata, Eugenia dysenterica, and Magonia pubescens. Six additional species were planted, but less than 5% of these seeds germinated. Crops (60% shade) did not affect seedling survival and biomass compared with the control treatment, supporting the use of this strategy during the initial phase of restoration to involve farmers in the process. In contrast, the excessive shading (95%) from the green manure treatment decreased the survival of two species and the growth in biomass and diameter of five species, especially when combined with fertilization. Seedling growth was very slow throughout the experiment, requiring extended weed management. This study supports the use of direct seeding of the studied species for savanna restoration, but methods could be improved to include a larger number of species.

AB Terrestrial invertebrates constitute most of described animal biodiversity and soil is a major reservoir of this diversity. In the classical attempt to undetstand the processes supporting biodiversity, ecologists are currently seeking to unravel the differential roles of environmental filtering and competition for resources in niche partitioning processes: these processes are in principle distinct although they may act simultaneously, interact at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and are often confounded in studies of soil communities. We used a novel combination of methods based on stable isotopes and trait analysis to resolve these processes in diverse oribatid mite assemblages at spatial scales at which competition for resources could in principle be a major driver. We also used a null model approach based on a general neutral model of beta diversity. A large and significant fraction of community variation was explainable in terms of linear and periodic spatial structures in the distribution of organic C, N and soil structure: species were clearly arranged along an environmental, spatially structured gradient. However, competition related trait differences did not map onto the distances separating species along the environmental gradient and neutral models provided a satisfying approximation of beta diversity patterns. The results represent the first robust evidence that in very diverse soil arthropod assemblages resource-based niche partitioning plays a minor role while environmental filtering remains a fundamental driver of species distribution.

AB The prehistoric archaeology of Sri Lanka is of considerable significance for investigations of the evolution, dispersal and adaptation of our species within a variety of environments beyond Africa during the Late Pleistocene. In particular, the archaeological and fossil sequences of Sri Lanka's 'Microlithic tradition', c. 38,000-3,000 cal. years BP, have yielded some of the earliest Homo sapiens fossils, microlithic technologies, osseous toolkits, and evidence for symbolic ornamentation and long-distance contacts anywhere in South Asia. The further association of the Late Pleistocene portion of these records with the tropical rainforest of Sri Lanka's Wet Zone also makes Sri Lanka of particular interest for debates regarding the viability of tropical rainforest for early human foraging and specialization. Yet beyond mentions of its fossil evidence, the archaeology and palaeoenvironmental contexts of the 'Microlithic tradition' have remained little-explored in the international literature. Here we present the first critical review of this period of Sri Lankan prehistory, examining its local chronologies, the spatial and diachronic patterns of its material cultural sequence, and relating its technological and fossil record to broader international archaeological, anthropological and genetic debates.

AB Ectotherms use specialized behavior to balance amelioration of environmental temperature stress against the need to forage. The intertidal snail Nucella ostrina risks aerial exposure at low tide to feed on the barnacle Balanus glandula. We hypothesized that N. ostrina foraging behavior would be constrained by duration and timing of low tide exposure. We added snails to intertidal blocks on San Juan Island, Washington, USA, and forced them to choose between barnacles placed on the western or eastern face of each block, or to shelter and forgo foraging. Snail behavior and barnacle mortality were monitored daily for 8 wk during summer 2011. N. ostrina foraging peaked every 2 wk, when temperature was minimized by tidal cycling. Low tide timing determined which substrate orientation was coolest and coincided with the proportion of snails foraging on one substrate face or the other: snails foraged on the western faces on days with morning low tides and on eastern faces on days with afternoon low tides. Barnacle consumption rates mirrored this spatiotemporal foraging pattern. Our conceptual model predicted mobile organism presence and location: snails foraged during the days of the tidal cycle least likely to be hot and selected the coolest available surface when foraging. These results suggest that N. ostrina alters foraging behavior to minimize risk of exposure to high temperatures or other emersion stresses. Consequently, predation on barnacles varies over space and time. This spatiotemporal behavior may buffer warming air temperatures and should be considered in models of coastal population and community dynamics.

AB Phosphorus (P) often limits plant growth in subtropical forests. Many studies have focused on plant P responses to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and increasing nitrogen (N) deposition; however, the response of soil P availability to these anthropogenic changes remains unclear. We used open-top chambers to study the changes in soil P fractions in model subtropical forests after 5 years of exposure to elevated CO2 and N addition. Soils studied here were highly weathered and P-deficient. Elevated CO2 increased plant available P in soils as well as P input from litter. The increase in soil P availability was related to the decreased recalcitrant P under elevated CO2. Soil P availability was not reduced by N addition due to the replenishment of P during litter decomposition. N addition led to a small increase in the most readily desorbed inorganic P. N addition with elevated CO2 depleted recalcitrant P. Our results suggest that elevated CO2 and N addition could maintain or even increase soil P availability.

AB Citizen science can generate data that would not exist otherwise while increasing public scientific literacy. However, the quality and use of citizen science data have been criticized in the recent ecological literature. We need an approach that advances eco-evolutionary understanding, achieves education goals and incorporates public participation into as many aspects of the scientific process as possible. We collaborated with public participants to make new discoveries about the distribution and ecology of ants while informing the next studies that participants and scientists might perform together. We implemented the School of Ants (SoA) program in which participants sample ants that are identified by taxonomic experts. Using a comprehensive framework that meets the needs of multiple agents, we also developed outreach materials about ant biology, collaborated with educators to incorporate SoA into classroom science, and launched an international SoA module in Italy. In the first 17 months, SoA volunteers collected ants at 500 unique sites across the USA-including all 50 states and Washington, D. C. To address concerns about the validity of citizen scientist-derived data, we conducted a ground truthing trial that confirmed that trained and untrained volunteers were equally effective at collecting ants. Data from SoA samples indicate that ant diversity varies across wide geographic scales and that there can be high levels of native ant diversity where people live. SoA volunteers collected 7 exotic and 107 native ant species. Although exotic ants were common, ants native to North America occurred in; 70% of all sites. Many of the ants common in backyards were species that tend to be very poorly studied. For example, citizen scientists documented a range extension of more than 2000 miles for the Asian Needle Ant, Pachycondyla chinensis. Using SoA data as a starting point, we collaborated with a science writer to produce a free, interactive iBook about the common ants in North America; the book included distribution maps such as that for P. chinensis informed by participant collections. Moving forward, we plan to leverage this existing framework to address more complex ecological and evolutionary questions in partnership with our public participants.

AB Plants are often attacked by pathogens and insects. Their combined impact on plant performance and fitness depends on complicated three-way interactions and the plant's ability to compensate for resource losses. Here, we evaluate the response of Barbarea vulgaris, a wild crucifer, to combined attack by an oomycete Albugo sp., a plant pathogen causing white rust, and a flea beetle, Phyllotreta nemorum. Plants from two B. vulgaris types that differ in resistance to P. nemorum were exposed to Albugo and P. nemorum alone and in combination and then monitored for pathogen infection, herbivore damage, defence compounds, nutritional quality, biomass and seed production. Albugo developed infections in the insect-resistant plants, whereas insect-susceptible plants were scarcely infected. Concentrations of Albugo DNA were higher in plants also exposed to herbivory; similarly, flea beetle larvae caused more damage on Albugo-infected plants. Concentrations of saponins and glucosinolates strongly increased when the plants were exposed to P. nemorum and when the insect-susceptible plants were exposed to Albugo, and some of these compounds increased even more in the combined treatment. The biomass of young insect-susceptible plants was lower following exposure to flea beetles, and the number of leaves of both plant types was negatively affected by combined exposure. After flowering, however, adult plants produced similar numbers of viable seeds, irrespective of treatment. Our findings support the concept that pathogens and herbivores can affect each other's performance on a host plant and that the plant reacts by inducing specific and general defences. However, plants may be able to compensate for biomass loss from single and combined attacks over time.

TI Co-investment paradigms as alternatives to payments for tree-based
   ecosystem services in Africa
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
LA English
DT Review
ID ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; CONSERVATION; CHALLENGES; DESIGN
AB Multiple paradigms have emerged within the broad payments for ecosystem services (ES) domain for internalizing externalities of local land-use change decisions. These range from reward of ready-made ES delivery (commoditised) to reward of processes of ES generation (co-investment). Evidence from tree-based projects in Africa suggests that currently, only carbon sequestration and emission reduction are 'commoditised', however in an artificial way where payments are not matched to ES delivery, but adjusted or supplemented with co-benefits. Co-investment in stewardship alongside rights is more widespread and versatile for a variety of ES. Efficiency concerns of co-investment schemes can be addressed when commoditised ES or profitable enterprises with positive ES externalities evolve from these.

AB The effects of multiple defence traits on herbivory under different abiotic conditions have not been reported in the literature. To clarify the relations between plant defence traits and abiotic factors in the field, we investigated the plasticity of multiple defence traits in young Mallotus japonicus growing in three habitat conditions: open sites, forest edges and treefall gaps. The plants used multiple defence traits differently in three habitats. At open sites, trichomes, pellucid dots and extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) were expressed better than at the treefall gaps, but food bodies (lipid-rich particles) were fewer. Fewer ants were observed on the plants at open sites than on plants in other habitats. Leaves collected from the open sites were consumed less by the generalist herbivore, Spodoptera litura, than leaves collected from the other habitats. The effect of ants on herbivore exclusion was not readily apparent at open sites. Light intensity at the open sites was high. Soil water contents were low. Tolerance was greater in the forest edge condition, where light intensity and soil water contents were intermediate.Synthesis. The defence tactics of EFN-bearing plants in the field must be determined considering the complex effects of different abiotic factors. Each plant can change its combination of defence traits in response to abiotic habitat conditions.

AB Subsistence was characterized during the Pleistocene to Holocene transition on the Cantabrian Coast (northern Spain) by a progressive diet widening, with a greater exploitation of marine environments and a more intense consumption of low-ranked species. This trend was also accompanied by a general and noticeable decrease in the amount of ungulates that were recovered from a set of archaeological sites clearly dominated by shells. The causes behind this change in the economic practice of the last hunter gatherer groups are still being debated. There are currently two opposing views on the matter, with some scholars defending the role of demographic pressure as the main driving force, while other researchers invoke the importance of the environment in the food procurement preferences that were adopted. Due to their overwhelming abundance, the debate has been mainly focused on marine resources, whereas the comparatively less-represented macromammal assemblages have been poorly interpreted. However, it is precisely this scarcity that makes them so remarkable. Here, a new interpretation of the available data is presented, with a special focus on the identification of overhunting evidence and on the comparative productivity of each type of resource. Altogether, the demographic hypothesis seems to be more coherent with the existing facts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The metacommunity concept provides a useful framework to assess the influence of local and regional controls over diversity patterns. Culture-independent studies of soil microbial communities in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of East Antarctica (77 degrees S) have shown that bacterial diversity is related to soil geochemical gradients, while studies targeting edaphic cyanobacteria have linked local diversity patterns to dispersal-based processes. In this study, we increased the spatial extent of observed soil microbial communities to cover the Beardmore Glacier region in the central Transantarctic Mountains (84 degrees S). We used community profiling techniques to characterize diversity patterns for bacteria and the cyanobacterial subcomponent of the microbial community. Diversity partitioning was used to calculate beta diversity and estimate among-site dissimilarity in the metacommunity. We then used variation partitioning to assess the relationship between beta diversity and environmental and spatial gradients. We found that dominant groups in the soil bacterial metacommunity were influenced by gradients in pH and soil moisture at the Transantarctic scale (800 km). Conversely, beta diversity for the cyanobacterial component of the edaphic microbial metacommunity was decoupled from these environmental gradients, and was more related to spatial filters, suggesting that wind-driven dispersal dynamics created cyanobacterial biogeography at a local scale (<3 km).

AB Assessing effects of winter habitat quality and environmental conditions on fitness of migratory birds is important to understand factors that regulate migratory bird populations throughout the annual cycle. We evaluated effects of winter habitat occupancy, as inferred from tissue stable-carbon (delta C-13) and -nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope values, on nutritional condition and arrival date of seven long-distance Nearctic-Neotropical migratory species sampled at Delta Marsh Bird Observatory (DMBO, Manitoba, Canada) during their spring migration to more northerly breeding areas. Additionally, we used a long-term dataset of DMBO to assess the effect of May minimum temperature, May minimum daily temperature, and El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index on body condition and spring arrival date. A positive effect of assumed mesic winter habitat on nutritional condition and arrival phenology was detected primarily in species overwintering in the Caribbean (Palm Warbler Setophaga palmarum, Northern Waterthrush Parkesia novaboracensis). We caution, then, against generalizing the results of previous isotopic studies inferring winter habitat use applied to Neotropical migrants wintering in the Caribbean (e.g., American Redstart Setophaga ruticilla) to those species or populations wintering elsewhere and especially away from dichotomous mangrove versus scrub habitats. In general, birds arrived later and in lower nutritional condition during colder springs, and early migrants did not adjust their timing of migration to spring temperature. Early arrival was associated with poorer nutritional condition, and most species had their lowest nutritional condition during the coldest periods of migration. ENSO, probably through its influence on weather and food availability during winter, carried over to northern latitudes and affected both spring arrival date and nutritional condition.

AB The ecological behaviors of a network of pure evergreen oak stands (Quercus suber L. and Quercus ilex L.) in the Central-Western Mediterranean Basin were investigated toward climatic and edaphic factors implemented with the application of topographic wetness index (TWI). A Categorical Principal Component Analysis (Catpca) using climatic and soil physico-chemical parameters was performed on 23 cork oak and holm oak pure stands with the aim to understand better the effectiveness of TWI for characterizing soil ecology of the two species. Catpca pointed out that, although cork oak and holm oak are able to growth in similar Mediterranean conditions, they show different behaviors in terms of needs and tolerance to soil water content. TWI confirmed such results at local scale, allowing highlighting some interesting features of the species differential ecology. Although both species confirmed to be drought-tolerant, the heliophilous cork oak revealed to dominate the landscape on wettest soils with high TWI values-indicating the capacity to tolerate stresses due to periods of waterlogging-, while the shade-tolerant holm oak prevails for low-medium TWI values-drier and mesophilous sites. Despite the application of TWI to vegetation science and ecology is relatively recent, results are encouraging and suggest considering this user-friendly and synthetic index in ecological investigations and modeling.

AB Loss of native forest is a key conservation concern globally, for reasons of biodiversity, climate change and ecosystem services. Landscape measures are used widely to characterize forest loss and associated landscape structure, but often without regard for structure imposed by the data used, and associated assumptions. Notably, forest loss is often expressed simply as net change in forest cover over time, but this approach does not account for turnover (i.e. the gross losses and gains of forest). It also ignores forest age (e.g. young regrowth forest or mature forest), which is significant in conservation terms. We investigate the effects of removing common data constraints on landscape characterization, as typically used in landscape dynamic analyses. We produced fine-resolution (0.0225 ha) classified maps from satellite imagery of the temperate Araucania Region of Chile, for 1986, 1999 and 2008. We calculated areas of land-use classes and associated landscape indices. Landscape measures and trends through time varied markedly around the region, with forest loss and fragmentation confined to areas not designated as protected. Net ('headline') figures masked very large turnover through time, with about 30% of unprotected land switching land use each decade. Accounting for this, in unprotected areas the loss of established native forest was 2.4% and 3.5% per year in the two time periods, much higher than equivalent 'standard' figures. Using finer-resolution data increased estimates of native forest loss and reversed temporal trends in patch density and mean patch size, compared with the commonly-used National Vegetation Classification (6.25 and 4.5 ha resolution). Interestingly, mean patch size of native forest actually switched, from a decreasing trend to an increasing one, with continued deforestation. We conclude that landscape characterization can lead to effective conservation practices, but it is necessary to use appropriate data resolution, define the data domain carefully and examine change through time, including the degree of dynamism (turnover) within the landscape: our results suggest a strong need to consider continuity of forest cover as well as overall totals.

AB Many plants are simultaneously attacked by arthropod herbivores and phytopathogens. These may affect each other directly and indirectly, enhancing or reducing the amount of plant resources they each consume. Ultimately, this may reduce or enhance plant performance relative to what should be expected from the added impacts of herbivore and pathogen when they attack alone. Previous studies have suggested synergistic and antagonistic impacts on plant performance from certain combinations of arthropods and pathogens, for example, synergistic impacts from necrotrophic pathogens together with wounding arthropods because of facilitated infection and antagonistic impacts from induction of pathogen resistance by sucking herbivores. We compiled published studies on the impact of plantherbivorepathogen interactions on plant performance and used meta-analysis to search for consistent patterns of impacts among plant, herbivore and pathogen characteristics and experimental conditions, and to test the suggested hypotheses on synergistic or antagonistic impacts. None of the hypotheses based on proximate interactions between arthropods and pathogens were supported by our analysis; in contrast, the patterns we found were related to plant traits and experimental conditions. Our results suggest that immediate loss of resources from interactions between arthropod herbivores and pathogens is generally moderated by compensation to an extent where there are no interactive effects on plant performance. However, as interactive impacts also differed among environments and parasite manipulation methods, this suggests that the ability of plants to compensate such losses may depend on environmental conditions and probably also overall infection load.

AB The expansion of biofuel production can lead to an array of negative environmental impacts. Therefore, the European Union (EU) has recently imposed sustainability criteria on biofuel production in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). In this article, we analyse the effectiveness of the sustainability criteria for climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. We first use a global agriculture and forestry model to investigate environmental effects of the EU member states National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAPs) without sustainability criteria. We conclude that these targets would drive losses of 2.2Mha of highly biodiverse areas and generate 95MtCO 2 eq of additional greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, in a second step, we demonstrate that the EU biofuel demand could be satisfied sustainably' according to RED despite its negative environmental effects. This is because the majority of global crop production is produced sustainably' in the sense of RED and can provide more than 10 times the total European biofuel demand in 2020 if reallocated from sectors without sustainability criteria. This finding points to a potential policy failure of applying sustainability regulation to a single sector in a single region. To be effective this policy needs to be more complete in targeting a wider scope of agricultural commodities and more comprehensive in its membership of countries.

AB Because conventional markets value only certain goods or services in the ocean (e.g. fish), other services provided by coastal and marine ecosystems that are not priced, paid for, or stewarded tend to become degraded. In fact, the very capacity of an ecosystem to produce a valued good or service is often reduced because conventional markets value only certain goods and services, rather than the productive capacity. Coastal socio-ecosystems are particularly susceptible to these market failures due to the lack of clear property rights, strong dependence on resource extraction, and other factors. Conservation strategies aimed at protecting unvalued coastal ecosystem services through regulation or spatial management (e.g. Marine Protected Areas) can be effective but often result in lost revenue and adverse social impacts, which, in turn, create conflict and opposition. Here, we describe ecomarkets' markets and financial tools that could, under the right conditions, generate value for broad portfolios of coastal ecosystem services while maintaining ecosystem structure and function by addressing the unique problems of the coastal zone, including the lack of clear management and exclusion rights. Just as coastal tenure and catch-share systems generate meaningful conservation and economic outcomes, it is possible to imagine other market mechanisms that do the same with respect to a variety of other coastal ecosystem goods and services. Rather than solely relying on extracting goods, these approaches could allow communities to diversify ecosystem uses and focus on long-term stewardship and conservation, while meeting development, food security, and human welfare goals. The creation of ecomarkets will be difficult in many cases, because rights and responsibilities must be devolved, new social contracts will be required, accountability systems must be created and enforced, and long-term patterns of behaviour must change. We argue that efforts to overcome these obstacles are justified, because these deep changes will strongly complement policies and tools such as Marine Protected Areas, coastal spatial management, and regulation, thereby helping to bring coastal conservation to scale.

AB Considerable intraspecific variation exists in responses to habitat fragmentation owing to regional differences in fragment quality. Habitat use and activity patterns of resident populations are related to the abundance and predictability of resources in time and space, and thus space use is one of the most important considerations for evaluating habitat quality. Here I examine inter- and intrasite differences in the ranging behavior; use of the matrix, i.e., surrounding nonhabitat; and activity budgets of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) inhabiting two forest fragments-Anja Special Reserve and Tsaranoro Valley Sacred Forest-in Madagascar's central highlands to test the prediction that intraspecific variation in habitat use and activity patterns is indicative of fragment quality. At Anja, Lemur catta has access to abundant year-round anthropogenic resources (introduced fruit trees, agricultural crops, water), whereas the population at Tsaranoro relies on seasonally variable and patchily distributed resources throughout the forest and matrix. Lemur catta at Anja occupy smaller home ranges; have shorter daily path lengths (DPLs); and spend less time foraging and more time resting, locomoting, and engaging in social and territorial behavior. In contrast, groups at Tsaranoro occupy larger home ranges, have longer DPLs, rely heavily on the matrix, and expend most of their energy in foraging behavior. These differences point to variation in the relative habitat quality of the two fragments and are thus an important consideration for conservation managers when assessing the capacity of forest fragments to sustain populations.

AB Acorn sowing is a reforestation technique that can potentially render high-quality oak seedlings and high seedling survival, although it is often discarded due to high rates of seed predation. Predator activity can be modified by habitat complexity due to its effects on accessibility and protection for different predators. In this study we analysed how habitat complexity generated by different post-fire management treatments, sowing depth, and capsaicin (a chemical repellent) affect acorn predation by two guilds of post-dispersal predators that differ in size and foraging behaviour. We carried out two acorn predation experiments. In Experiment #1 we buried acorns at two depths (2 and 8 cm) in two post-fire burnt-wood management treatments of different habitat complexity, namely: (1) Salvage Logging (SL), where the burnt trunks were cut and piled and the branches were masticated (lower habitat complexity), and (2) Non-Intervention (NI), with no action after the fire and 100% of the trees naturally fallen by 2009, thus leaving a habitat with lying burnt logs and branches (higher habitat complexity). In Experiment #2 we repeated Experiment #1, with the addition of capsaicin as a mammal repellent treatment. Most acorns were consumed in both years (ca. 90%), mainly by rodents. In Experiment #1 predation by boars accounted for 4.1% of overall predation, and it was about twice as high in SL than in NI, likely due to the physical difficulty for large mammals to forage in an area with a complex structure created by lying logs and branches. In contrast, rodents consumed ca. 1.4 times more acorns in NI than in SL, which led to overall greater predation in NI in both experiments. This was likely due to the protection provided by the branches for the rodent community. Deeper burial reduced predation by small percentages, although in Experiment #1 it had a negligible effect in NI. Capsaicin did not reduce predation, and it reduced seedling emergence to half. This study suggests that habitat complexity created by trunks and branches reduced predation by wild boars, but favoured rodent acorn predation. We conclude that other methods for the protection of individual acorns need to be identified to increase the success of oak reforestation via seeding. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quantifying the importance of pollinators for reproductive success of plants is a central question in reproductive biology. However, the literature contains a profusion of terms and sometimes conflicting definitions. This inconsistency is a barrier to broad comparisons and conceptual advances in different fields. In recent decades, some widely disseminated studies have proposed recommendations to foster greater standardization. Nevertheless, the literature continues with little uniformity, and terms such as "efficacy," "efficiency," and "effectiveness" of pollinators are still used inconsistently. Previous studies concerning conceptual and terminological uniformity provided a series of particular terms related to specific metrics and/or strict definitions for these widely used terms. I here propose comprehensive verbal definitions for the terms that have historically been used by most specialists. Pollinator performance in achieving reproductive success is defined here as its effectiveness, which is, broadly, given by the product of two components: pollinator efficacy and intensity of visitation. In some approaches, a third component - pollinator efficiency - is important for estimates of its effectiveness. The definitions suggested here apply to different variables, parameters, and procedures for study, and may refer to either individuals or populations of a pollinator species, or to functional groups of pollinators. This terminology can be applied widely, as it is not constrained by the scope, approach or scale of a study. A basic terminology with simple definitions may facilitate consistent use of these terms by specialists, particularly among younger investigators, thus surmounting the first barrier to future proposals for conceptual and methodological unification at larger scales.

AB Recent assessments by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) indicate the existence of about 612 recognized primate species and subspecies (IUCN RedList, 2012), but close to 50% of these taxa are at risk of extinction as a result of human action. In this article, I call attention to underlying regional and global socioeconomic contexts of primate conservation. Using information from FAO and UN databases and other sources, I examine, for the Neotropics, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, trends in forest loss and human demographics and social condition, discuss the impact of global market pressures upon primate habitats, and examine land-use patterns that may favor primate conservation. Between 1990 and 2010, an estimated 149 million ha of forest were lost in the three regions and additional losses are expected in the future. Global human population will increase from 7 billion in 2012 to 9 billion in 2050. Currently, 2 billion people live in the three primate range regions under high levels of poverty. Large-scale deforestation is related to global market demands, especially from developed and developing nations, for food (e.g., cattle), domestic animal feed (e.g., soybeans), biofuel-based crops (e.g., oil palm), and industrial round wood. The growth of protected areas in the three regions has been steady for several decades, but it is not enough to ensure long-term conservation of many primate taxa. Other conservations tools involving sustainable land use and biodiversity conservation corridors are required at the landscape level. The above assessment can easily be applied at the local level by primatologists, giving more precision to conservation initiatives. Am. J. Primatol. 75:30-45, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Question How reliable is the process of delimiting plant species by morphotyping sterile specimens from a highly diverse Amazonian forest plot?
   Location Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP), Central Amazon, Manaus, Brazil.
   Methods A taxonomic exercise was conducted during a Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) Taxonomy Workshop held in Manaus in April 2011, using specimens collected in a 25-ha forest plot. The plant species from this plot had been previously delimited by morphotyping of ca. 80 000 sterile specimens, a process that resulted in the recognition of 115 cases (accounting for 38% of all trees) in which species delimitation was problematic. For the workshop, we selected a subsample of specimens for eight of these difficult cases (taxonomic groups/complexes) and asked 14 participants with different levels of botanical training to independently sort these specimens into morphospecies. We then compared the classifications made by all participants and explored correlations between botanical training and plant classification.
   Results The classification of specimens into morphospecies was highly variable among participants, except for one taxonomic group/complex, for which the median pair-wise similarity was 95%. For the other seven taxonomic groups/complexes, median pair-wise similarity values ranged from 52% to 67%. Training did not increase the similarity in the definition of morphospecies except for two taxonomic groups/complexes, for which there was higher congruence between the classifications made by participants with a high level of botanical training than in comparisons that included less-experienced participants. The total number of morphospecies defined by participants was highly variable for all taxonomic groups/complexes, with the total number varying from 12 to 46 (a 383% difference).
   Conclusions Local plant species delimitation by morphotyping sterile specimens is prone to large uncertainties, and botanical training may not reduce them. We argue that uncertainty in species delimitation should be explicitly considered in plant biodiversity inventories as diversity estimates may be strongly affected by such uncertainties. We recommend that species delimitation and identification be treated as separate processes and that difficulties be explicitly recorded, so as to permit error estimates and the refinement of taxonomic data.

AB The fixation of carbon in tropical forests mainly occurs through the production of wood and leaves, both being the principal components of net primary production. Currently field and satellite observations are independently used to describe the forest carbon cycle, but the link between satellite-derived forest phenology and field-derived forest productivity remains opaque. We used a unique combination of a MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) dataset, a wood production model based on climate data and direct litterfall observations at an intra-annual timescale in order to question the synchronism of leaf and wood production in tropical forests. Even though leaf and wood biomass fluxes had the same range (respectively 2.4 +/- 1.4 and 2.2 +/- 0.4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)), they occurred separately in time. EVI increased with leaf renewal at the beginning of the dry season, when solar irradiance was at its maximum. At this time, wood production stopped. At the onset of the rainy season, when new leaves were fully mature and water available again, wood production quickly increased to reach its maximum in less than a month, reflecting a change in carbon allocation from short-lived pools (leaves) to long-lived pools (wood). The time lag between peaks of EVI and wood production (109 days) revealed a substantial decoupling between the leaf renewal assumed to be driven by irradiance and the water-driven wood production. Our work is a first attempt to link EVI data, wood production and leaf phenology at a seasonal timescale in a tropical evergreen rainforest and pave the way to develop more sophisticated global carbon cycle models in tropical forests.

AB The high diversity of epiphytes typical of undisturbed montane tropical forests has been negatively affected by continuous deforestation and forest conversion to secondary vegetation. Macrolichens are an important component of these epiphytes. Because their physiology is strongly coupled to humidity and solar radiation, we hypothesized that microclimatic changes derived from forest clearing and logging can affect the diversity of these poikilohydric organisms. In southern Ecuador, we examined three types of forests according to a disturbance gradient (primary forests, secondary forests, and monospecific forests of Alnus acuminata) for the presence/absence and coverage of epiphytic macrolichens that we identified on 240 trees. We found that total richness tended to decrease when the range of the disturbance increased. The impoverishment was particularly drastic for "shade-adapted lichens", while the richness of "heliophytic lichens" increased in the drier conditions of secondary growth. Epiphytic composition also differed significantly among the three types of forests, and the similarity decreased when the range of the disturbance was greater. We concluded that a span of 40 years of recovery by secondary vegetation was not enough to regenerate the diversity of epiphytic macrolichens that was lost due to forest disturbances.

AB In tropical and subtropical forests there is limited information about how to integrate sustainable timber management with the conservation of biodiversity. We examined the effect of selective logging on the bird community to help develop management guidelines to assure the conservation of biodiversity in forests managed for timber production. The study design consisted of control and harvested plots in piedmont and cloud forests of the subtropical montane forests of the Andes in northwestern Argentina. We conducted bird point-count surveys combined with distance estimation. Breeding season bird community composition was more similar between control and logged forest in both the cloud forest and piedmont, than between the two elevations, probably because Neotropical bird communities change dramatically along elevational gradients. Within each elevation zone, community composition changed significantly between harvested and control forests. Both between and within each elevation zone no significant differences in bird density were detected. Similarly, when we analyzed bird density according to diet guilds no general pattern could be extracted. However, we found a significantly greater density of cavity nesters and lower of non-cavity nesters in control plots, probably because most trees that can develop suitable cavities were extracted in logged plots and these plots had a greater structural diversity enabling more nesting resources. Grouping species according to their nesting habitat requirements has rarely been used in the neotropics and other tropical and subtropical forests, but focusing management attention on cavity nesters might address the most sensitive portion of the avian community as well as other species dependent on trees likely to hold cavities.

AB There is growing recognition that the fate of the world's terrestrial biodiversity depends on the management of human-dominated tropical forest landscapes. While global environmental change is transforming the ecology of tropical forests, a number of studies have also demonstrated that tropical forests are able to recover following disturbance. But are tropical forests resilient to environmental and anthropogenic disturbances over timescales of centuries or millennia? Here we examine the relationship between vegetation cover and variation in monsoon rainfall, soil erosion, and fire over 7500 years in an ancient tropical landscape in the Western Ghats of India. We collected two overlapping sediment sequences at one study site and analysed them with palaeoecological techniques to reconstruct vegetation cover. Results suggest that climate and land-use changes might have had synergistic effects on this forested landscape, although the relationship between these factors and vegetation cover has varied over time. Results also indicate that the weakening of monsoon around 5750 BP might have caused a threshold event altering this landscape to a low tree-cover state. Although anthropogenic fire has maintained this landscape in low tree cover state from 3500 BP, this degraded tree-grassland mosaic has remained relatively resilient to fluctuations in environmental and anthropogenic factors. Tree taxa present throughout the sequence have lighter seeds than those absent in parts of the sequence, suggesting that dispersal mode might be an important factor in their persistence. Despite maintaining a degraded and fragmented forest mosaic, however, this landscape has supported populations of heavy-seeded trees and a probable refuge to their dispersal agents. We suggest that retaining tree cover on this landscape, even if fragmented, is key to maintaining its ecological resilience to environmental and anthropogenic disturbance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Drought-related tree mortality at a regional scale causes drastic shifts in carbon and water cycling in Southeast Asian tropical rain forests, where severe droughts are projected to occur more frequently, especially under El Nino conditions. We examine how the mortality of a Bornean tropical rain forest is altered by projected shifts in rainfall, using field measurements, global climate model (GCM) simulation outputs, and an index developed for drought-induced tree mortality (Tree Death Index h) associated with a stochastic ecohydrological model. All model parameters have clear physical meanings and were obtained by field observations. Rainfall statistics as primary model forcing terms are constructed from long-term rainfall records for the late 20th century, and 14 GCM rainfall projections for the late 21st century. These statistics indicate that there were sporadic severe droughts corresponding with El Nino events, generally occurring in January-March, and that seasonality in rainfall will become more pronounced, e. g., dry (January-March) seasons becoming drier and wet (October-December) seasons becoming wetter. The computed eta well reflects high tree mortality under severe drought during the 1997-1998 El Nino event. For the present, model results demonstrate high and low probabilities of mortality in January-March and October-December, respectively, and they predict that the difference in such probabilities will increase in the future. Such high probability of mortality in the dry season is still significantly high, even considering the beneficial effect of increased soil water storage in the wet season (which is projected to increase in the late 21st century).

AB The Soy Moratorium is an initiative to reduce deforestation rates in the Amazon biome based on the hypothesis that soy is a deforestation driver. Soy planted in opened areas after July 24th, 2006 cannot be commercialized by the associated companies to the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (ABIOVE) and the National Association of Cereal Exporters (ANEC), which represent about 90% of the Brazilian soy market. The objective of this work is to present the evaluation of the fourth year of monitoring new soy plantations within the Soy Moratorium context. With the use of satellite images from the MODIS sensor, together with aerial survey, it was possible to identify 147 polygons with new soy plantations on 11,698 ha. This soy area represents 0.39% of the of the total deforested area during the moratorium, in the three soy producing states of the Amazon biome, and 0.6% of the cultivated soy area in the Amazon biome, indicating that soy is currently a minor deforestation driver. The quantitative geospatial information provided by an effective monitoring approach is paramount to the implementation of a governance process required to establish an equitable balance between environmental protection and agricultural production.

AB Light requirements and functional strategies of plants to cope with light heterogeneity in the field have a strong influence on community structure and dynamics. Shade intolerant plants often show a shade avoidance strategy involving a phytochrome-mediated stem elongation in response to changes in red : far red ratio, while shade-tolerant plants typically harvest light very efficiently. We measured plant size, stem diameter, internode and leaf lengths in randomly chosen saplings of 11 woody species differing in their shade tolerance in both a secondary forest and an old-growth temperate evergreen rainforest in southern Chile. We also recorded the irradiance spectrum and the diffuse and direct light availabilities at each sampling point. Significant differences were found for the mean light environment of the saplings of each species, which also differed in basal stem diameter, internode length and leaf length, but not in plant height. Both plant slenderness (plant height/stem diameter) and mean internode length increased with increasing light availability, but no relationship was found between any of these two traits and red : far red ratio. The change in plant slenderness with light availability was of lesser magnitude with increasing shade tolerance of the species, while internode change with light availability increased with increasing shade tolerance of the species. Shade tolerators afford higher costs (thicker stems and plants), which render more biomechanically robust plants, and respond more to the light environment in a trait strongly influencing light interception (internode length) than shade intolerant species. By contrast, less shade-tolerant plants afforded higher risks with a plastic response to escape from the understorey by making thinner plants that were biomechanically weaker and poorer light interceptors. Thus, species differing in their shade tolerances do differ in their plastic responses to light. Our results contribute to explain plant coexistence in heterogeneous light environments by improving our mechanistic understanding of species responses to light.

AB This study explores and interprets relevant literature to construct a typology of benefit sharing arrangements for the governance of social-ecological systems in developing countries. The typology comprises three generic categories of benefit sharing arrangements: collaborative, market-oriented, and egalitarian. We contend that the three categories provide a useful basis for exploring and classifying the different societal arrangements required for governance of social-ecological systems. The typology we present is founded on a related set of explicit assumptions that can be used to explore and better understand the linkages among ecosystem services, benefit sharing, and governance. Issues that are strongly related to sustainability in developing countries form the core basis of our assumptions. Our aim is not to write a definitive exposition, but to spark debate and engage ongoing dialogue on governance and benefit sharing in the field of social-ecological systems.

AB The flowpaths by which water moves from watersheds to streams has important consequences for the runoff dynamics and biogeochemistry of surface waters in the Amazon Basin. The clearing of Amazon forest to cattle pasture has the potential to change runoff sources to streams by shifting runoff to more surficial flow pathways. We applied end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) to 10 small watersheds throughout the Amazon in which solute composition of streamwater and groundwater, overland flow, soil solution, throughfall and rainwater were measured, largely as part of the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia. We found a range in the extent to which streamwater samples fell within the mixing space determined by potential flowpath end-members, suggesting that some water sources to streams were not sampled. The contribution of overland flow as a source of stream flow was greater in pasture watersheds than in forest watersheds of comparable size. Increases in overland flow contribution to pasture streams ranged in some cases from 0% in forest to 27-28% in pasture and were broadly consistent with results from hydrometric sampling of Amazon forest and pasture watersheds that indicate 17- to 18-fold increase in the overland flow contribution to stream flow in pastures. In forest, overland flow was an important contribution to stream flow (45-57%) in ephemeral streams where flows were dominated by stormflow. Overland flow contribution to stream flow decreased in importance with increasing watershed area, from 21 to 57% in forest and 60-89% in pasture watersheds of less than 10 ha to 0% in forest and 27-28% in pastures in watersheds greater than 100 ha. Soil solution contributions to stream flow were similar across watershed area and groundwater inputs generally increased in proportion to decreases in overland flow. Application of EMMA across multiple watersheds indicated patterns across gradients of stream size and land cover that were consistent with patterns determined by detailed hydrometric sampling.

AB Calcareous grasslands are among the most species-rich ecosystems in temperate countries. However, these ecosystems have suffered from fragmentation and destruction during the last century. We studied the response of calcareous grassland plant diversity to landscape changes in Belgium. Results indicated that high area loss (since 1965) old habitat patches exhibited an extinction debt inverse to low area loss old habitat patches, little depending on the area loss threshold (60%, 70%, 80% or 90%) considered for the distinction between the high and low area loss patches. However, human activities also created new habitat patches in the landscape and therefore provided opportunities for calcareous grassland plant species to colonize new habitats. This also provided opportunities to study species colonization abilities in the context of habitat restoration. We analyzed species richness in new patches compared to old patches in order to detect colonization credit. We detected the presence of a colonization credit in new patches when using high loss old patches (area loss >80%, exhibiting an extinction debt) or all old patches as a reference. However, when the reference was low loss old patches alone (area loss <80%, less likely to exhibit an extinction debt), no colonization credit was detected. In addition, species composition was similar between new patches and old patches. These results are encouraging for restoration programs. However, the results indicated that the presence of an extinction debt in reference habitats could lead to inaccurate conclusions in restoration monitoring. Therefore, extinction debt should be considered when choosing reference habitats to evaluate restoration success.

AB Eucalypts (Eucalyptus and Corymbia spp.) dominate (> 60%) the tree biomass of Australia's tropical savannas but account for only a fraction (28%) of the tree diversity. Because of their considerable biomass and adaptation to environmental stressors, such as fire, the eucalypts may drive tree dynamics in these savannas, possibly to the exclusion of non-eucalypts. We evaluated whether the eucalypt and non-eucalypt components in tropical savannas are dependent so that changes in one component are matched by opposite trends in the other. Using tree inventory data from 127 savanna sites across the rainfall and fire frequency gradients, we found that eucalypt and non-eucalypt basal area and species richness had a negative relationship. This relationship was maintained across the rainfall gradient, with rainfall having a positive effect on the basal area and species richness of both components, but with a greater effect in non-eucalypts. Fire frequency negatively affected basal area, but not species richness, although basal area and species richness of eucalypts and non-eucalypts did not differ in their response to fire. Rainfall appears to set the upper bounds to woody biomass in these mesic savannas, while fire maintains woody biomass below carrying capacity and facilitates coexistence of the components. The magnitude of the component responses, particularly for non-eucalypts, is determined by rainfall, but their dependence is likely due to their differential response to both rainfall and fire, but not to competition for resources. Thus, while eucalypts dominate biomass overall, at high rainfall sites non-eucalypt basal area and diversity are highest, especially where fire frequency is low.

AB The regeneration of Brazil nut trees depends on tree-fall gaps in the forest. However, shifting cultivation fallows also create comparable biotic and abiotic opportunities for the dispersion and establishment of this gap-loving species. At the same time, the ability of Brazil nut trees to resprout enables fallow individuals to survive successive slash-and-burn cycles. Recognizing the importance of shifting cultivation for the food security of forest dwellers, we investigated whether the high level of Brazil nut regeneration found in cultivation fallows could be explained by the resprouting capability of Brazil nut trees, the number of cultivation cycles, past agricultural use and distance to the nearest conspecific productive adults. We found that the Brazil nut tree population density increased from 8.86 trees ha(-1) to 13.69 trees ha(-1) and 27.09 trees ha(-1) at sites after one, two and three or more shifting cultivation cycles, respectively. As a consequence of resprouting, after a certain number of shifting cultivation cycles, the fallows become dominated by Brazil nut trees, and the landholders may decide to preserve them and to exclude enriched sites from future agricultural use. Protected for their extractive value, the secondary forests spontaneously enriched with Brazil nut trees are allowed to develop into nut-producing forests that have reduced chances of conversion into crops or pastures, thus reversing the classical process of Amazon forest degradation.

AB Differential herbivory in contrasting environments is commonly explained by differences in plant traits. When several plant traits are considered, separate correlation analyses between herbivory and candidate traits are typically conducted. This makes it difficult to discern which trait best explain the herbivory patterns, or to avoid spurious inferences due to correlated characters. Aristotelia chilensis saplings sustain greater herbivory in shaded environments than in open habitats. We measured alkaloids, phenolics, trichomes, leaf thickness and water content in the same plants sampled for herbivory. We conducted a multiple regression analysis to estimate the relationship between herbivory and each plant trait accounting for the effect of correlated traits, thus identifying which trait(s) better explain(s) the differential herbivory on A. chilensis. We also estimated insect abundance in both light environments. Palatability bioassays tested whether leaf consumption by the main herbivore on A. chilensis was consistent with field herbivory patterns. Overall insect abundance was similar in open and shaded environments. While saplings in open environments had thicker leaves, lower leaf water content, and higher concentration of alkaloids and phenolics, no difference in trichome density was detected. The multiple regression analysis showed that leaf thickness was the only trait significantly associated with herbivory. Thicker leaves received less damage by herbivores. Sawfly larvae consumed more leaf tissue when fed on shade leaves. This result is consistent with field herbivory and, together with results of insect abundance, renders unlikely that the differential herbivory in A. chilensis was due to greater herbivory pressure in open habitats.

AB Both forest fragmentation and overhunting have profound effects on the structure of large-vertebrate assemblages in neotropical forests. However, the long-term value of habitat fragments for forest mammals remains poorly understood and few regional scale studies have replicated sampling across spatially independent landscapes. Here, we assess the species occupancy and abundance of midsized to large-bodied mammals within three neighbouring Amazonian forest landscapes varying widely in extent of forest cover. One of these consisted of forest fragments surrounded by semi-natural scrub savannahs that had been occupied by paleoindian populations for at least 7,000 years, whereas forest cover in the other two landscapes was either variegated or continuous. Data on species occurrence and abundance from diurnal and nocturnal line-transect surveys and local interviews in each landscape were used to examine the effects of forest cover and hunting pressure on mammal persistence within forest patches. The extent of forest cover was a key determinant of species persistence across the three landscapes, but populations of large-bodied species were either reduced or driven to local extinction by hunting even in the most forested and least fragmented landscape. Many game and non-game species persisted in forest isolates, even though, individually, these were likely too small to support viable populations. This study indicates that even small, long-term forest fragments may retain significant conservation value if they can be managed within the context of enhanced connectivity across wider fragmented landscapes.

AB Background and aims - Knowledge on diversity and distribution of algae and cyanobacteria in subaerial habitats still lags behind those of freshwater and marine environments. Notably, data on diversity of microalgae in tropical corticolous habitats are still scarce. We investigated species composition of subaerial epixylic algae and cyanobacteria from two Singaporean rainforest localities. We asked whether there are differences in species composition and alpha-diversity of samples taken in different areas and in different habitat types (bark vs. decaying bare wood). In addition, we asked whether there are differences in species turnover (beta-diversity) among different habitat types and areas.
   Methods - The cultivation-based approach and the microscopic analysis of populations were used. In total, 20 samples of bark and decaying wood from two forested areas were analyzed. Statistical analyses involved the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of species data. Significance of differences in algal composition between groups of samples was evaluated by the non-parametric two-way ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities) using the crossed design with permutations in blocks. The SIMPER method was used to identify species that characteristically discriminate between habitat types and sampling areas.
   Key results - In total, 57 species were identified. Green algae (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Trentepohliales) were dominant, and Cyanobacteria were the second most frequent group. The dominants of the subaerial assemblages differed from corresponding temperate habitats and, in addition, their alpha-diversity was considerably higher. Several green algal morphospecies were characteristic for the bark localities (e.g. Diciyochloropsis spp., Pseudomarvania aerophytica, Printzina effusa and Printzina lagenifera). The alpha-diversity was similar in both habitat types, but the species turnover among samples (beta-diversity) was significantly higher in the decaying wood samples.
   Conclusions - Tropical corticolous habitats probably harbour higher diversity than corresponding temperate habitats. High beta-diversity of decaying wood illustrates general importance of this substrate for biodiversity of subaerial algae in the tropics.

AB Patterns of above- and below-ground biomass allocation in seedlings of nine common cloud forest (CF) tree species of western Mexico were examined under varying controlled light conditions using artificial shade houses. We analysed the relationships between vital rates (growth and survival) and four morphological traits (SLA, biomass allocation to stems, leaves and roots). We hypothesised that these traits represent differentiation axes in the way seedlings face the heterogeneous light regime typical of the CF understorey. For all species, traits between the different light levels, i.e. allocation to leaves, roots and stems differed among light levels. Five species had the largest SLA in the lowest light levels at the end of the experiment (Citharexylum, Dendropanax, Fraxinus, Quercus and Magnolia). Juglans was the only species with a large SLA at the highest light level (377.47 cm(2) g(-1)). In contrast, light levels did not cause any significant variation in SLA of Persea and Simplococarpon at the end of the experiment. The relative height growth rates (RHGR) of the seedlings of five species were significantly different between light levels (P < 0.05). Overall, all species grew better in the highest light levels. The RHGR of three species were correlated positively with SLA. In turn, allocation to stem, leaves and root biomass were strongly correlated with the RHGR of five species (e.g. Citharexylum, Dendropanax and Fraxinus). Survival did not vary significantly between treatments in any species, only in the case of Simplococarpon (P < 0.05) and was correlated with all morphological variables. For this species, Peto and Peto's test showed a significantly larger survival of seedlings in the highest light level. The mean responses of these species based on all traits to the controlled light variation did not differed significantly. Our results show that these species display a wide range of resource allocation patterns when exposed to the varying light conditions that may be found in the forest understorey and highlight the role of morphological traits in this variation.

AB The growth of human populations has many direct and indirect impacts on tropical forest ecosystems both locally and globally. This is particularly true in the Solon-ion Islands, where coastal rainforest cover still remains, but where climate change and a growing human Population is putting increasing pressure on ecosystems. This study assessed recent primary productivity changes in the Kahua region (Makira, Solomon Islands) using remote sensing data (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI). In this area, there has been no commercial logging and there is no existing information about the state of the forests. Results indicate that primary productivity has been decreasing in recent years, and that the recent changes arc more marked near vi I]ages. Multiple factors may explain the reported pattern in primary productivity. The study highlights the need to (1) assess how accurately remote sensing data-based results match field data on the ground; (2) identify, the relative contribution of the climatic, socioeconomic and political drivers of such changes; and (3) evaluate how primary productivity changes affect biodiversity level, ecosystem functioning and human livelihoods.

AB Australian ants belonging to the genus Aphaenogaster excavate dense and frequently relocated nest systems in topsoil and deposit ephemeral, highly erodible (type-1) mounds at their funnel-shaped nest entrances. Rates of mounding are generally higher for this genus than for other Australian ant species, and are amongst the highest rates recorded for ant mounding anywhere in the world. Furthermore, tentative analysis of subsurface mixing suggests that overall rates of Aphaenogaster bioturbation are higher than indicated by mounding alone. This bioturbation has pronounced implications for soil and landscape processes, particularly in modifying soil fabric and texture and in impacting on soil hydrology and erosion. Aphaenogaster bioturbation may also be viewed as a form of ecosystem engineering, and affects the distribution of soil nutrients and the dispersal of seeds. This can lead to localized increases in soil fertility, although Aphaenogaster are notorious as a nuisance in agricultural landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Determining the permeability of different types of landscape matrices to animal movement is essential for conserving populations in fragmented landscapes. We evaluated the effects of habitat patch size and matrix type on diversity, isolation, and dispersal of ithomiine butterflies in forest fragments surrounded by coffee agroecosystems in the Colombian Andes. Because ithomiines prefer a shaded understory, we expected the highest diversity and abundance in large fragments surrounded by shade coffee and the lowest in small fragments surrounded by sun coffee. We also thought shade coffee would favor butterfly dispersal and immigration into forest patches. We marked 9675 butterflies of 39 species in 12 forest patches over a year. Microclimate conditions were more similar to the forest interior in the shade-coffee matrix than in the sun-coffee matrix, but patch size and matrix type did not affect species richness and abundance in forest fragments. Furthermore, age structure and temporal recruitment patterns of the butterfly community were similar in all fragments, independent of patch size or matrix type. There were no differences in the numbers of butterflies flying in the matrices at two distances from the forest patch, but their behavior differed. Flight in the sun-coffee matrix was rapid and directional, whereas butterflies in shade-coffee matrix flew slowly. Seven out of 130 recaptured butterflies immigrated into patches in the shade-coffee matrix, and one immigrated into a patch surrounded by sun coffee. Although the shade-coffee matrix facilitated movement in the landscape, sun-coffee matrix was not impermeable to butterflies. Ithomiines exhibited behavioral plasticity in habitat use and high mobility. These traits favor their persistence in heterogeneous landscapes, opening opportunities for their conservation. Understanding the dynamics and resource requirements of different organisms in rural landscapes is critical for identifying management options that address both animals' and farmers' needs.

AB Sustainable forest management requires a sound understanding of the impacts of forestry management practices, especially prescribed fire and timber harvesting, on biodiversity. Many studies have examined the impacts of fire and logging separately, but few have considered them together. Here we describe the combined effects of selective logging and repeated prescribed fire on ants in eucalypt forest near Eden in south-eastern Australia. The study was conducted within 18 experimental coupes comprising three replicates of each of six treatments, representing combinations of two logging (selectively logged and unlogged) and three prescribed burning (unburnt, routine and high fire frequency over 20 years) practices. Ants were sampled using terrestrial and arboreal pitfall traps in two plots within each of the 18 coupes. A total of 92 species from 35 genera were recorded, with ant species richness increasing with both increasing fire frequency and selective harvesting. We also found significant differences in ant species composition between management treatments; however, these differences were rather modest, and apparent only between extremes of fire and harvesting combinations. Logging on its own was not a significant factor contributing to variation in ant species composition. However, the responses of two common species and a key functional group to fire depended on logging treatment; in each case their abundance decreased with increasing fire frequency at unlogged sites, but increased at logged sites. The general resilience of ant communities suggests that forests remain in good functional health even when subject to a combination of selective logging and frequent burning. However, our study under-sampled species with specialist microhabitat requirements, and these might have been more heavily impacted. We have also revealed some significant interactions between the effects of fire and logging, which highlights the importance of considering combined impacts of forest management practices.

AB A widely accepted biodiversity crisis in the tropics has been recently challenged by claims that secondary forests will gradually restore biodiversity losses. This prediction was examined for the herpetofauna in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Quantitative sampling (108 transects) of reptiles was undertaken monthly (January-September 2004) along a vegetation gradient covering induced grasslands, and regrowth and primary rain forests. A total of 35 species was found, 14 being present in and five showing dependence on mature forests. Lizards contributed > 90 per cent of the individuals observed. Reptile abundance and snake species richness was highest in primary forests, even though the lower abundance and richness did not differ between regrowth forest and induced grasslands. Multivariate ordinations and ANOSIM tests displayed clear differences in assemblage structure among vegetation types, mainly caused by contrasting abundances of lizard species having distinctive arboreal or terrestrial habits. There was no evidence that snake assemblages differed between secondary forests and induced grasslands. Microhabitat availability had a key role in shaping species composition through the vegetation gradient. Our results dismiss the hypothesis that secondary forests can act as reservoirs of primary forest reptile diversity on the basis that many taxa depend largely on habitat quality and have specialized life-history traits, and that biological succession does not guarantee the recovery of assemblage complexity.

AB Understanding coexistence of highly shade-tolerant tree species is a long-standing challenge for forest ecologists. A conceptual model for the coexistence of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia) has been proposed, based on a low-light survival/high-light growth trade-off, which interacts with soil fertility and small-scale spatiotemporal variation in the environment. In this study, we first tested whether the spatial distribution of seedlings and saplings can be predicted by the spatiotemporal variability of light availability and soil fertility, and second, the manner in which the process of environmental filtering changes with regeneration size. We evaluate the support for this hypothesis relative to the one for a neutral model, i.e., for seed rain density predicted from the distribution of adult trees. To do so, we performed intensive sampling over 86 quadrats (5 x 5 m) in a 0.24-ha plot in a mature maple-beech community in Quebec, Canada. Maple and beech abundance, soil characteristics, light availability, and growth history (used as a proxy for spatiotemporal variation in light availability) were finely measured to model variation in sapling composition across different size classes. Results indicate that the variables selected to model species distribution do effectively change with size, but not as predicted by the conceptual model. Our results show that variability in the environment is not sufficient to differentiate these species' distributions in space. Although species differ in their spatial distribution in the small size classes, they tend to correlate at the larger size class in which recruitment occurs. Overall, the results are not supportive of a model of coexistence based on small-scale variations in the environment. We propose that, at the scale of a local stand, the lack of fit of the model could result from the high similarity of species in the range of environmental conditions encountered, and we suggest that coexistence would be stable only at larger spatial scales at which variability in the environment is greater.

AB Ants moderate the supply of critical resources such as water and nutrients in desert environments by changing the physical arrangement of soils during nest construction. We measured water infiltration and soil physical and chemical properties on and off the nests of two ant species (Pogonomyrmex rugosus, Aphaenogaster cockerelli) across five sites at differing landscape positions within a Chihuahuan Desert watershed. Our aim was to test whether the effects of these long-lived ant nests on water infiltration and soil chemistry varied between ant species or across sites within a watershed. Water flow was generally slowest at the site with the highest silt and clay contents, and fastest at the site with sandy soils. Flow was generally greater through ant nest soils than adjacent non-nest soils, and we attribute this to increases in macropores in the nests. However, the effects of both ant nests and species varied among sites. Despite wide variation in soil chemical properties across all sites, ant nests had a consistent effect on soil chemical properties, with higher levels of carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus and electrical conductivity on nests compared with non-nest soils. Our results demonstrate that while we can generalise about the effects of ant nests on water flow and nutrient levels, differences in soil type, nest density and ant species across sites are likely to moderate these effects.

AB The carnivorous gastropod Concholepas concholepas, known in Chile as "loco", is a species present only along the Chilean coast line and in central-southern Peru showing high economic and ecological importance. Its fishery, which in the past decades has ranged between 828 (2001) and 24,828 (1980) metric tons per year [SERNAP, 2005. Servicio Nacional de Pesca: Anuarios estadisticos. (http://www.sernap.cl/paginas/publicaciones/anuarios/index_anuario.php)], is based exclusively on the exploitation of wild stocks. So far, there has been limited interest in tackling the biological and technical feasibility of cultivation of C concholepas. Hence, the knowledge about its early ontogenetic stages (i.e., larval, early postmetamorphic and small juvenile) cultivation is still deficient. In this study we investigated, under laboratory and field conditions, C. concholepas survivorship, growth rates, feeding rates and the onset of sexual reproduction. Competent loco's larvae were collected in the field and metamorphosed in the laboratory to assess growth rates and survivorship during the first six months of postmetamorphic life. Moreover, using small juvenile C. concholepas of ca. 20 mm of peristomal length, collected in the field, we monitored for the body size and live weight traits in laboratory and field rearing conditions. The feeding of the early postmetamorphics and small juveniles was exclusively based in mono diets of the mussel Semimytilus algosus. The rearing of small juveniles was conducted in two consecutive phases, using two specially designed rearing apparatus. The biochemical content of our laboratory cultivated specimens was compared with values obtained from specimens collected in natural habitats. Their rapid growth and good survivorship makes this species suitable for rearing of cocktail-size specimens (50-60 mm) in less than a year. According to the growing rates reported in this study the legal commercial size of C. concholepas: 100 mm of PL would be reached under field and laboratory conditions in 1.65 and 2.64 years respectively. Moreover, it was found that in our rearing conditions C. concholepas reach sexual maturity in less than a year of benthic life. In summary, considering the findings about C. concholepas high growth rates, and low mortalities, we suggest that our rearing methodologies may be scaled up and implemented for the commercial aquaculture of this unique and valuable muricid.

AB One of the major environmental challenges of the twenty-first century is the continued rapid deforestation of Amazonia. The 2005 dieback crisis emphasizes the unprecedented challenges facing Brazil. The examination of past and present institutions for ecosystem management, in Amazonia, shows structural barriers across public, private and community arrangements. The adaptive governance concept helps to understand why these institutions are failing to deliver sustainable futures. In looking forward, it is encouraging to see that important networks of knowledge and a number of novel initiatives are emerging in Brazil. These new arrangements are novel in the way that they seem to be adaptive and navigate structures in the hope of overcoming insurmountable drivers of deforestation.

AB An important challenge of invasion biology is to understand how interactions between species traits and ecosystem properties enable alien species to become invasive at particular locations. We investigated how gap dynamics in a tropical rain forest on the island of Reunion affected the invasiveness of alien plants. In the 12 000-m(2) study area, alien plants occupied 24.9% of the area of gaps, which represented 5.62% of the forest area, but only 0.8% of the understorey area. The most abundant invasive species was Rubus alceifolius, which formed dense, monospecific stands in the largest gaps (>25 m(2)). Although plants could persist in the shade, a germination experiment revealed that canopy openings were essential for seedling establishment. A cyclone that struck the study area in 2002 caused a temporary thinning of the canopy, increasing light levels to above the threshold needed for germination of R. alceifolius and also stimulating the growth of established plants. We conclude that the ability of this and other alien species to colonize intact lowland tropical rain forest is strongly influenced by the prevailing gap dynamics. Because gaps are also essential for the regeneration of many native trees in our study area, there is a real danger of the forest being progressively degraded by alien plants. There are no simple solutions to controlling species such as Rubus alceifolius, but efforts should be focused mainly upon the larger gaps where the species are most invasive.

AB Forest certification programmes promote sustainable management of the world's forests. Certification can be given to a forest management system that fulfils certain environmental, social and economic criteria.
   The ecological criteria for certified forestry include limiting harvest intensity and minimizing the mechanical damage of logging. Based on these requirements, we hypothesized that in comparison to conventionally managed forests, the logging gaps of certified forests would (1) host more established saplings of timber trees, due to a higher abundance of seed trees left in the forest, and (2) provide more favourable environments for the establishment and growth of timber seedlings, due to the control of negative logging impacts.
   We tested these hypotheses, using regeneration data on 10 shade-tolerant Neotropical timber species in a total of 46 treefall gaps in certified, conventionally managed and natural broad-leaved forests in northern Honduras. We analysed 12 environmental gap characteristics as determinants of sapling abundance, using a statistical approach that emphasizes their sensitivity to the forest management system as well as their ecological role.
   We found that gaps in certified forests were characterized by lower levels of logging-related disturbance than gaps in conventionally managed forests. The differences were however relatively small, since loggings are done at low intensity and without heavy machinery in the area. Despite the more favourable gap environment, regeneration success was poorer in certified forests than in conventionally logged forests. As expected, highest regeneration was found in natural forests.
   The good regeneration success in conventionally logged forests was largely due to the high abundance of a single species, Mortoniodendron vestitum. To explain the remaining differences in regeneration between management types, we suggest that loggings in certified forests have been more intensive in the past, leading to a scarcity of timber seed trees. We further propose two alternative explanations related to treefall gap frequency: (a) low logging intensity after certification may have led to low frequency of treefall gaps, limiting the recruitment of timber species; or (b) intensive loggings currently maintain an environment with too much disturbance for the success of timber regeneration.

AB Here, I report on how forest area in Southeast Asia has changed for different types of forest and across different countries between the periods of 1990-2000 and 2000-2005. The loss of old growth forests has accelerated in Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam but have ceased in Thailand, Malaysia, Laos and the Philippines. Secondary forests continue to be lost in Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. Plantation forests have increased in area by 25.0% from 1990 to 2005 but still comprise only 6.2% of the total forest area in Southeast Asia. Overall, the loss of native forests (old growth and secondary forests) has slowed down in Thailand, the Philippines and Brunei but has worsened in Laos, Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia.

AB Long-term records were used to compare the flowering of Eucalyptus microcarpa, E. melliodora, E. leucoxylon, E. polyanthemos and E. tricarpa between Havelock Forest (1940-1971) and Rushworth District (1945-1970). Indices were developed and used to compare the mean monthly annual flowering patterns (e.g., mean duration, annual flowering success) between the two locations. Additionally, the long-term flowering pattern of each species between 1945 and 1970 was examined for concordance. Results of the analysis suggest that despite the similarity of species composition there are differences in flowering behaviour. Flowering always commences and peaks at Rushworth prior to Havelock. The earlier commencement is influenced by Rushworth's slightly warmer climate. There are also similarities. Only the flowering duration for E. melliodora was significantly different (P < 0.001). The annual flowering success (defined as the proportion of years when flowering occurred) was similar between both sites, except for E. polyanthemos, which had more reliable flowering at Havelock, flowering on average in 9 out of 10 years (compared to 7 out of 10 for Rushworth). E. tricarpa, E. leucoxylon and E. microcarpa were identified as concordant species, and E. polyanthemos and E. melliodora as discordant. The combination of results (indices and concordancy) suggests that three species (E. tricarpa, E. leucoxylon and E. microcarpa) occupy a similar temporal niche at the different sites (i.e., they flower contemporaneously), whilst the remaining two (E. polyanthemos and E. melliodora) species do not. The results provide a useful baseline description of the flowering behaviour of two important Box-Ironbark forest sites in Victoria, and may assist in understanding the migration of nectar-dependent species at the landscape scale.

ID STREAM; COMMUNITY; SOUTH; HISTORY; RANGE
AB River environments are characterized by extreme spatial and temporal variation in the physical environment. The relationship of fish assemblages to environmental variation is poorly understood in many systems. In Chile zonation patterns of fish assemblages have been documented in several Andean river drainages. Coastal river drainages are comparatively small, but inordinately important because of their highly endemic flora and fauna and their proximity to major human populations. For conservation purposes it is important to understand what environmental factors affect assemblage structure of fishes especially in the comparatively high diversity coastal drainages. We studied patterns of fish distribution and abundance in three rivers of the coastal, Andalien drainage near Concepcion, Chile. We used multi-dimensional scaling analyses to compare patterns among zones (rithron, transition and potamon) and high and low flow seasons. Species assemblages differed by zone, but not with season. Assemblages consisted of nested subsets of species characterized by their range of distribution among zones. One species group was composed of widespread species that occurred in all three zones, another species group consisted of species found only in transitional and potamal zones, and a final group was comprised of species found only in the potamal zone. The potamal zone contained the most diverse and abundant fish assemblage. Fish assemblages were related to both water quality and habitat structure variables. This study suggests that the key to conserving the diversity of native fish communities in coastal Chilean rivers is in the conservation of potamal regions. Unfortunately, most protected areas in Chile are in the depauperate headwaters of drainages. Protection of only headwaters is clearly inadequate and will not contribute to the conservation of this unique freshwater fish fauna.

AB Ecological theory based on the dynamic equilibrium model (DEM) suggests that maintenance of endemic taxa is most likely in stable, unproductive environments. We tested whether this hypothesis, which was developed mainly using terrestrial plant examples, held when applied to distributions of benthic freshwater diatoms in New Zealand. Given current arguments for the ubiquity of microbial organisms, with distributions determined mainly by environmental tolerances, demonstration that distinctive taxa with evidently restricted distributions conform to theory applicable to larger organisms would lend support to the opposite point of view, that barriers to dispersal do exist. We examined diatom communities from over 320 sites representing the entire spectrum of freshwater habitats in New Zealand and assessed relative abundances of the main taxa present. Each taxon distinguished was assigned to one of five distribution categories ranging from cosmopolitan to endemic. We derived indices of disturbance and productivity for each site using the River Environment Classification (REC), a GIS-based classification system developed for New Zealand rivers. Diatom taxa assigned to endemic or distinctive potential endemic categories were significantly more abundant in low disturbance sites but occurred across a range of productivities. However, bogs and tarns, both of which fell mainly into low disturbance and productivity classes, were distinctive in supporting relatively high proportions of endemic and potential endemic diatoms. Thus our findings in general conformed to the patterns predicted by the DEM, thereby supporting the role of dispersal limitation in diatoms. At the same time, conformity with the DEM helps to explain the continued coexistence in New Zealand freshwaters of many common and apparently cosmopolitan taxa with endemic diatoms, since the DEM explanation for maintenance of endemism does not rely on geographic isolation of species.

AB Distylous polymorphisms represent a useful model system for studying the functioning of flower morphology because floral morphs have reciprocal flower developmental pathways and co-occur in the same environment such that they share the same pollinators. Distylous plants typically display both reciprocal herkogamy and a heteromorphic incompatibility system, which allows mating only between morphs. In this paper, we document morph-specific patterns in floral morphology and pollen receipt of Palicourea padifolia, a hummingbird-pollinated shrub. Floral traits typically associated with the functioning of distyly, reciprocal herkogamy, and population morph ratios of flowering individuals from 10 populations were measured and quantified. Pollen receipt on stigmas of the same measured flowers was then used to determine the effectiveness of distyly in promoting disassortative pollen transfer. Pollen of long-styled flowers was more effective in reaching legitimate stigmas, while short-styled morphs were more successful in the reception of legitimate pollen across populations. Variation in pollen receipt across populations was not explained by reciprocal herkogamy, which typically promotes legitimate pollination. Natural pollination resulting in a higher proportion of legitimate pollen in short-styled flowers increased with stigma-anther separation (promotion of outcross pollination) and width of corolla entrance (avoidance of self-pollination).

AB Interactions among environmental drivers commonly occur in natural environments, but their influence on plant performance is not fully understood. We tested for significant interactive effects of light and nutrient availabilities on foliage architecture, chemistry, biomass allocation and growth in shade intolerant temperate deciduous trees Betula pendula Roth. and B. pubescens Ehrh. First-year seedlings were grown at four irradiance and four N and P availability combinations, and the experiment was repeated in two consecutive years. In both species, increases in light availability resulted in larger net assimilation rate (NAR, total plant biomass production rate per unit leaf area), root mass fraction (F-R) and leaf mass per unit area M-A but reductions in leaf area ratio (LAR, foliage area per total plant dry mass), stem mass fraction (F-S) and leaf mass fraction (F-L). The strong decrease in LAR (LAR = F-L/M-A) With light mainly resulted from increases in MA. The light-dependent increase in NAR was larger than the decline in LAR such that plant relative growth rate (RGR = NAR x LAR) scaled positively with light in both species. Nutrient availability mainly enhanced LAR, and moderately NAR, further improving RGR. The increase in LAR was primarily associated with increases in F-L and decreases in FR. Significant interactions between light and nutrients were found for most of the studied variables, overall indicating that plant allocation and growth were more responsive to nutrients at higher light availability. Several significant species and year-to-year differences were observed among the allocation and growth characteristics that were driven by plant size, climate and seedling source. Greater RGR of B. pubescens that is a species colonizing habitats with lower nutrient availability was linked to its greater foliage nitrogen concentrations. Overall, the study highlights a significant light x nutrient interaction that can modify seedling performance along natural gap-understory gradients. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Terrestrial hermit crabs use mollusc shells to protect their soft bodies from predation and desiccation, but their use is costly. The energetic short-term cost of using shells has been demonstrated, yet this could theoretically be overcome by increasing feeding rate or food quality. In the long term, shells have the potential to constrain growth, which may in turn have a negative effect on fitness. Thus crabs should choose the lightest (least expensive to carry) shell amongst those of a size that permit growth. Since in nature lighter shells are also thinner-walled, these may provide insufficient protection from predation or desiccation, facing the crabs with a trade-off between protection and growth. This potential trade-off was investigated in the terrestrial hermit crab Coenobita compressus. Crabs were individually maintained in captivity for a variable period of between I and 7 months, during which light or heavy replicates of the preferred shell were available. In a second experiment, crabs were given a choice between a thick (and heavy) or a thin (and light) shell. In addition, the resistance and water retention capacity of thin and thick shells was compared. As predicted, crab growth was negatively correlated with the weight of the shell used, but crabs rejected the thin (light) shells. Thin shells were more likely to break when crabs used the normal 'rolling' behaviour in response to perceived threats. In addition, thin shells lost water at a faster rate than thick ones. Since two putative functions of shell use in terrestrial hermit crabs are protection against predation and against desiccation, it is inferred that the preference for shells of intermediate weight in C. compressus results from a balance between the need to grow and the cost of carrying a brittle shell that is not sufficiently water tight.

AB Although it is known that small changes in boreal soil carbon (C) fluxes may affect the global soil C balance, our knowledge of the variability in the origin and magnitude of boreal soil C fluxes is still limited. Red wood ant (RWA; Formica rufa group) mounds can be found in high densities in boreal forests, but little is known about how these mounds influence forest soil C dynamics. We developed a dynamic closed-loop chamber system to measure carbon dioxide (CO2) effluxes from a RWA mound and tested the results against measurements of forest floor C fluxes made with a commercial respirometer. The two methods yielded comparable results. CO2 efflux from a RWA mound as measured with the new system was significantly higher than that from the surrounding forest floor. The result suggests that RWA mounds are CO2 "hot spots" within a forest. More investigations would be necessary to evaluate the role of RWA mounds in ecosystem C dynamics. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB If specialization influences species presence, then high tropical tree and shrub diversity should correspond with high environmental heterogeneity. Such heterogeneity may be found among different successional communities (i.e., canopy types). We explore species associations in three forest-dominated canopy types, forest, gap, and edge, in Kibale National Park, Uganda and determine environmental, soil and light, differences among canopy types. To determine the strength of differences among forested canopy types, they are also compared to grasslands. Tree and shrub density and species richness using rarefaction analysis were determined based on data from 24 small plots (5 x 5 m) in all four canopy types and 16 large plots (10 x 50 m) in forest and grassland canopy types. Environmental variables were determined along 10 (20 m) transects in the four canopy types. Using analysis of variance and principal components analysis, we demonstrate that forest and gap environments had similar soils, but forest had lower light levels than gap. We also found that grassland and edge were more similar to one another than to forest and gap, but differed in a number of important biotic and abiotic factors controlling soil water availability (e.g., edge had higher root length density of small roots < 2 mm diameter in the top 20 cm than grassland). Using principal components analysis to assess similarities in community composition, we demonstrate that gap and forest had indistinguishable communities and that edge was similar to but distinct from both communities. Complete species turnover only occurred between grassland and the three forested canopy types. Even though overall community composition was similar in the three forested canopy types, in analyses of individual species using randomization tests, many common species were most frequently found in only one canopy type; these patterns held across size classes. These results suggest that despite differences among environments, community composition was similar among forested canopy types, which are likely intergrading into one another. Interestingly, individual species are more frequently found in a single canopy type, indicating species specialization.

AB The establishment of plants depends crucially on where seeds are deposited in the environment. Some authors suggest that in forest understory seed predation is lower than in gaps, and higher than at the forest edge. However, most studies have been carried out in large forest patches and very little is known about the effects of microhabitat conditions on seed predation in forest fragments. We evaluated the effects of three microhabitats (gaps, forest edge, and understory) on seed predation of two palm species (Euterpe edulis and Syagrus romanzoffiana) in two semi-deciduous forest fragments (230 and 2100 hat in southeast Brazil. Our objective was to test two hypotheses: (1) Low rodent abundance in small fragments as a result of meso-predator action levels leads to lower seed predation in small fragments. (2) Most mammal species in small fragments are generalists with respect to diet and habitat, so that seed predation is similar in different microhabitats (gaps, forest edge and understory) in the small fragment, but not in the larger one. The study community of small fragments is usually composed of generalist species (in diet and habitat aspects), so we expected the same rate of seed predation among microhabitats (gaps, forest edge and understory) in the tested smaller fragment. The experiment was carried out in the dry season (for E. edulis) and in the wet season (for S. romanzoffiana) in 1999. We conclude that post-dispersal seed predation in forest fragments can be directly connected with mammal communities, reflecting their historical and ecological aspects. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS.

AB We assessed tree species density and diversity in 12 1-ha plots in four forests of the Albertine rift, western Uganda. There were 5747 trees of diameter greater than or equal to 10 cm in 53 families, 159 genera, and 212 species. Density ranged between 344 and 557 trees ha(-1) (average 479 trees ha(-1)). Tree species diversity was highest in the Bwindi and Budongo forests. The Euphorbiaceae family was the most species rich (25 species) followed by Rubiaceae and Meliaceae with 16 species each. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that major gradients in environmental variables influenced tree species distribution. Sample scores on ordination axes 1 and 2 were strongly correlated with pH and altitude, respectively. Correlated with rainfall and other soil factors, pH and altitude are presumed to be among the most important in influencing the distribution of tree species in the Albertine rift forests. Strategies that take account of variations in pH and elevation are required to conserve tree species in forests of the Albertine rift.

AB Understanding patterns of tropical deforestation is a crucial issue for Mexico, a country that has lost more than 95% of its original rainforest cover. This paper examines the causes of accelerated deforestation in the Sierra Santa Marta, Veracruz, Mexico, by looking at settlement history and the evolution of productive schemes in the villages of Venustiano Carranza and Magallanes. Both settlements were founded in the 1960s, after the government donated land to landless peasants. Conversion of forests into pastures, after several agricultural enterprises failed, resulted in more than 80% of the original tropical rainforests being removed in both communities between 1960 and 1998. The process of deforestation in the villages differed from models proposed for the Amazon and Central America, in which deforestation responded to capital-intensive efforts to open up the tropical frontier. In the villages, transformation of forests into pastures was, from the beginning, a smallholder phenomenon. Misguided policies and institutional malfunctions appeared to direct households toward deforestation. Nevertheless, environmental deterioration could not only be explained by external causes. Inside the communities, demographic pressure over land, the modification of traditional land tenure systems and the cultural adoption of cattle as a way to overcome poverty were significant factors in the relationship between colonization and forest clearance. Deforestation at Venustiano Carranza and Magallanes cannot be considered an ecologically destructive practice performed by peasants. In fact, the process reflects not only a lack of environmental awareness in national development policies, but also the intricate interaction of ecological, cultural, social and economical variables.

AB A community of middle-sized and larger mammals was studied in a seasonally dry forest in the far north of the Brazilian Amazon. Diurnal and nocturnal surveys were carried out through the Line-transect method, in 5 different forest types along a 10-km transect. Data were collected on density, biomass, and use of the forest types, and forest strata by the mammals. The terrestrial community of mammals was more abundant than the arboreal one, with ungulates contributing to the bulk of the biomass, as a result of Maraca being highly seasonal. Overall densities were lower than in other sites in the neotropics, varying from 90.2 ind/km(2) in mixed forest, to 159.9 ind/km(2) in Terra Firme forest, whereas biomass, due to the contribution of large mammals, was much higher (2613.2 kg/km(2) in mixed forest, and 4351.6 kg/km(2) in Terra Firme forest). This study confirms that the animals surviving in Larger numbers in these highly seasonal forests, where food productivity may be very Low during the dry season, are those that have Larger home ranges and travel longer distances in search of food.

AB Interspecific interactions that produce nontransitive competitive networks have been proposed to promote diversity in a broad range of systems, including coral reefs. In this paper, we model the effect of size-dependent shifts in competitive ability on the coexistence of canopy-forming and understory coral species, and we predict how these shifts influence patterns of community structure along large-scale gradients in disturbance and recruitment limitation. We consider three models, representing a gradient from purely hierarchical competition in which the canopy-former is dominant, to competition involving standoffs and reversals between the understory species and juvenile canopy-formers. Analysis of these models leads to two key conclusions. First, as competition becomes less transitive, coexistence may be promoted or inhibited, depending upon the extent to which the canopy-former can sustain itself by clonal propagation. Specifically, when clonal growth alone is adequate to sustain the canopy-former, increasing nontransitivity promotes coexistence. When it is not, nontransitivity inhibits coexistence. Secondly, size-dependent nontransitivity dramatically changes how gradients in disturbance and recruitment affect species coexistence. In contrast to hierarchical interactions, standoffs and reversals do not show an "intermediate recruitment" phenomenon, in which coexistence is facilitated at intermediate levels of recruitment. Moreover, under hierarchical competition, the dominant always benefits mote than the subordinate as recruitment is increasingly facilitated. Under standoffs and reversals, however, increasing recruitment often favors the canopy-former at some levels of disturbance, but the understory species at other levels of disturbance. These results differ markedly from previous models of stage-dependent competition, suggesting that promotion of coexistence by ontogenetic shifts in competitive ability depends upon the mechanisms by which competition occurs in particular ecological contexts. The results also indicate that the effects of gradients in disturbance and recruitment on community structure depend fundamentally on how species compete for space.

AB Structure and regeneration of a mid-montane (2200 m a.s.l.) mixed forest codominated by evergreen (Lithocarpus cleistocarpus), deciduous (Acer flabellatum) and coniferous (Tsuga chinensis, Abies fabri, and Taxus chinensis) trees were analyzed in a 40 m x 60 m plot on Mt. Emei, Sichuan, China. Plant community structure and composition varied depending on topographic micro-habitat within the plot. Four topographic communities (topo-communities) were distinguished with dominant species corresponding to topography: (1) Abies - valley bank, (2) Acer - lower steep slope, (3) Lithocarpus - upper gentle slope, and (4) Tsuga - ridge. The coexistence mechanisms of the evergreen, deciduous, and coniferous trees were determined by identifying the regeneration process characteristic of each dominant species, as represented by their seedling dispersion patterns and seedling establishment along the topographic gradients. The saplings and seedlings of the dominants were distributed differently according to the topography: Lithocarpus under the canopy of parent trees and in gaps of the upper gentle slope and ridge, Acer mainly in both well-lit and shady sites on the lower steep slope and on fallen logs, Abies on the valley bank but only in well-lit sites, Tsuga on the ridge, Taxus mostly on rock and well-lit sites on the slopes. Distribution of surviving saplings and seedlings was also related to the species of nearby canopy trees. We suggest that Lithocarpus, Tsuga and Acer tend to be self-replacing in their own topographic habitats, and Abies survives as a fugitive by occupying occasional suitable gaps. The variation in soil conditions, particularly nutrients, with topography affected seedling establishment and the growth of trees. The successional change of quantitative species composition, as predicted by the Markovian model, shows the mixed forest to be in a sustained climax stage.

AB From a scientific point of view, the Juan Fernandez islands contain one of the most interesting floras of the planet. Although protected as a National Park and a World Biosphere Reserve, 400 years of human interference have left deep traces in the native plant communities. Repeated burning, overexploitation of species, and the introduction of animal and plant plagues have taken 75% of the endemic vascular flora to the verge of extinction. In 1997, Chile's national forest service (Corporacion Nacional Forestal, CONAF) started an ambitious project, whose objective is the recovery of this highly complex ecosystem with a socio-ecological focus. Juan Fernandez makes an interesting case, as the local people (600 persons) practically live within the park, therefore impeding the exclusion of the people from any conservation program. Secondly, the relatively small size of the archipelago (100 km(2)) permits the observation of the effects of whatever modification in the ecosystem on small scales in time and space. Thirdly, the native and introduced biota are interrelated in such a way that human-caused changes in one species population may provoke unexpected results amongst other, non-target species. The project mainly deals with the eradication or control of some animal and plant plagues, the active conservation and restoration of the flora and the inclusion of the local people in conservation planning. This article presents the park's general problems, the strategy proposed to resolve them as well as some preliminary results. This project shows the complexity of the conservation activities in practice, with diverse and complex interrelations and gaps in ecological knowledge. In this respect, the project may well serve as a model for similar programs in other places.

AB Morphological and stomatal responses of Norway spruce (Picea abies) foliage to light availability were studied in respect to shoot age. Needle minor diameter (D-1, anatomical width), major diameter (D-2, anatomical thickness), dry weight (M). and tissue density index (I-D) increased. and needle flatness (Fl) and specific leaf area (SLA) decreased with foliage age, while shade foliage demonstrated higher morphological plasticity as compared to sun foliage. Needle minor diameter, dry weight, and the ratio of total to projected leaf area increased. acid needle flatness and specific leaf area decreased with daily average photosynthetic photon flux density (Q(D)). The current-year foliage exhibited the highest variation with irradiance, while the morphological plasticity decreased with needle ageing. The morphological characteristics of needles were independent of irradiance if Q(D) was above 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). D-1 was the only linear needle characteristic which significantly changed with light availability within a canopy, and thus determined needle flatness. SLA. as well as the ratio of total to projected leaf are,? (TLA:PLA). Needle flatness was a characteristic responding most sensitively to the photosynthetic photon flux density, R-2 was 0.68, 0.44. and 0.49 for the current-year, 1-year-old, and 2-year-old foliage, respectively. TLA/PLA ranged from 2.2 to 4.0 depending on D-1. Variation in SLA in response to light availability can be attributed to changes both in needle shape acid tissue density. Stomatal responses to photosynthetic photon flux density (Q(P)) depended on foliage type (sun or shade) and age. Sun needles demonstrated higher daily maximum leaf conductances to water vapour compared to shade needles. The shade needles responded more sensitively to changes in Q(P) at drawn and sunset than the sun needles, while older needles of both foliage types exhibited Faster stomatal responses. The light-saturation of leaf conductance (g(L)) was achieved by 20 mu mol m (2) s(1) for shads foliage, and approximately by 50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for sun foliage. As a rule. g(L) changed in response to irradiance faster in the evening, i.e, at decreasing irradiance. Stomata were not usually completely closed in the dark before sunrise and after sunset, the phenomenon being more pronounced in older shoots and sun needles. Nightly water losses from spruce foliage are attributable primarily to older shoots, and are related to age-dependent changes in stomatal responsiveness. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Growth, photosynthesis and carbon allocation pattern were studied in four dry afromontane forest tree species (Olea europea subspecies cuspidata, Podocarpus falcatus, Hagenia abyssinica and Juniperus procera) under varied light regimes in a greenhouse. The objective of the study was to assess the potential of the species for growth under forest canopies and to identify their habitat preferences. The light regimes were created using shade cloth and the) corresponded with deep forest understoreys (2% of the light in the open gap); moderate shade (10%), slight shade as is found in edges of forest gaps (20%) and 100% representing open gaps. Seedling biomass was significantly influenced by light regimes for all species as were total leaf area and relative growth rate. H. abyssinica had the highest growth rate but the lowest survival rate in shade. There was a consistent trend for higher specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) at lower growth light regimes in O. europea and P. falcatus. O. europea and P. falcatus had similar allocation patterns whereby between 20-40% of the total biomass uas allocated to stem, 20-30% to roots and 50-60% to leaves. In H. abyssinica up to 80% was allocated to leaves and only a small percentage to stem and to roots.
   Within species there were significant differences in the light saturated rate of photosynthesis (A(max)) per unit area among the plants grown at the lowest light level and in the open. For plants grown in the open there were ver): little among species differences in A,,,, per unit area. However, there were significant differences in the ii,,, of the different species grown at the lowest light level. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements indicated that open-grown P. falcatus and O. europea experienced moderate photoinhibition. From the growth and photosynthesis results P. falcatus and O. europea appeared to be non-pioneer, shade-tolerant species, while J. procera and to a larger extent H. abyssinica showed pioneer, light-demanding characteristics. The results ar e discussed in terms of the occurrence of the species in the mosaic climaxes of afromontane forests.

   DISPERSAL; ESCAPE; PREDATION; HYPOTHESIS; PATHOGENS; DIVERSITY
AB According to the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, seedling recruitment around tropical trees is more likely away from parent trees because of density- or distance-dependent predation or pathogen attack on seeds and seedlings. This was expected to lead to a more regular distribution of conspecific adults than would be expected by chance, and to favour coexistence. We first show theoretically that, even if yearly survival increases only slightly with distance to parent trees, an outward shift of seedling recruitment curves with time is very likely simply because seedlings live more than one year before recruiting to the juvenile stage. We tested this hypothesis for a humid savanna, dioecious palm tree, Borassus aethiopum, for which three discrete stages were defined by clear morphological traits. We found that (1) individuals of the second seedling stage are found on average further from their mother than individuals of the first seedling stage, and juveniles are found even further away (relative outward shifts between the three successive stages), and that (2) the older a female is, the further away its seedlings are (temporal outward shifts of distributions of seedlings). Both yearly recruitment (transition between two stages) and survival of seedlings are distance dependent and not density dependent. A matrix population model was used to demonstrate that, during the reproductive part of female palm life cycle, the cumulative effects of these distance-dependent variations in yearly recruitment and survival rates are sufficient to explain qualitatively the observed outward shifts.

   PREDATION; DISTANCE; DYNAMICS; RODENTS; FORESTS
AB It has long been argued that seed dispersal enhances recruitment in tropical trees by allowing offspring to 'escape' strong density/distance-dependent attack by insects, pathogens and rodents. Here we examined the effects of canopy openness and parent-offspring distance upon the frequency and timing of Chlorocardium rodiei seed attack and germination within a 15-ha plot of Guyanan tropical rain forest. Seeds were artificially dispersed beneath parent tries, in the understorey away from trees and in gaps. Analysing our data from an 85-week period of regular monitoring, we found that the main spatial gradients, canopy openness and distance to nearest adult conspecific, do not lead to differences in the final number of seeds attacked by infesting scolytid beetles or rodents, The timing of beetle attack, however, varied along the distance gradient and this difference affords seeds at further distances a 'window' in which to germinate and produce a seedling before attack. Canopy openness was not a good predictor of rooting success, but distance was strongly associated with root and shoot formation success and the mean time to shoot formation. There was a strong negative effect of distance on the likelihood of a seed being colonised by scolytid beetles prior to removal by rodents and shoot failure was strongly associated with prior infestation. We believe these results bring a key point to bear on the well-established notion of distance-dependent attack on seeds in tropical rainforests, viz. that seed characteristics (size, germination syndrome) and the timing of attack may be more important in explaining patterns of early seedling recruitment than distance. Our studies suggest that advantages accrued through dispersal in species like Chlorocardium will depend heavily on the 'race' between seed germination and attack. In the case of Chlorocardium, the 'race' can be lost at considerable distances due to its prolonged dormancy and the temporal fluctuations in fruitfall and rainfall which influence attack and germination. The results presented here suggest that the lag between seed attack and germination in tropical trees can regulate the influence of parent-offspring distance on cohort recruitment at this life history stage.

ID SYMPATRIC LOWLAND GORILLAS; TROPICAL FOREST; FRUIT; DIET; CHIMPANZEES
AB Recent studies have shown that western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla Savage & Wyman) are highly frugivorous and expel in their dung viable seeds of many fruit species they consume. As part of a wider study of their role as seed dispersers in tropical rain forest, the importance of gorillas as consumers of three species of tropical tree was investigated. The species studied were Ganophyllum giganteum (Sapindaceae), Cola lizae (Sterculiaceae) and Uapaca guineensis (Euphorbiaceae). Gorillas swallowed large quantites of seeds of these species whenever they were available, and removed a considerable proportion of the crop from trees they visited. The differences in abundance and distribution of these trees, and their varied dispersal strategies influenced the quantity of seeds that was removed by gorillas. Uapaca can be seen as having a generalist fruiting strategy, with a wide range of consumers, whereas the other species are more specialist, gorillas being the principal dispersers. Compared to other consumers, this study showed that gorillas provided potentially high quality dispersal because: (i) they were reliable visitors to trees of these species; (ii) they swallowed and dispersed large numbers of seeds; (iii) they treated seeds benignly and often deposited them in sites favourable for establishment.

AB During the last 2 decades red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) trees have died at high rates in the mountains of New York and New England. Given the importance of disturbance in organizing plant communities, the impact of the decline was evaluated in terms of its effect on disturbance processes. The first step was to describe the current disturbance regime in subalpine forests across the region. Canopy gaps were the predominant mode of disturbance. Estimates of gap-phase disturbance in four old-growth sites ranged from 15% to 42% of the total forested area. Gap abundance varied between 19 and 49 gaps/ha. A constant among the sites was that dead spruce trees accounted for more of the gap area than expected considering their abundance in the canopy. In the spruce-fir forest, most gaps were small (<100 m(2)). Gaps were not shaped like simple geometric figures but rather like irregular polygons. Forty percent of the canopy gaps were created by the death of a single tree; the rest were multitree gaps. Standing dead trees were the most common damage type. It seems that decline of spruce effected a quantitative but not qualitative shift in the disturbance regime.

ID INSECTIVOROUS MAMMALS; RUSSULA; PITFALL
AB The diets and habitat preferences of three species of crocidurine shrews, Crocidura cyanea, C. fuscomurina, and C. hirta (Insectivora: Soricidae), were studied in arid areas of Namibia in March and April, 1992. Simultaneous sampling of the prey ingested and available along Foraging trails showed that, although the shrews are generalist insectivores that take most types of prey from the range available, each species selected Araneida, Chilopoda, Isoptera, and insect larvae but avoided Formicidae. The preferred prey were mostly soft-bodied with a relatively high ratio of body water to energy content, which may assist in maintenance of body water balance. The three species showed inconsistent preferences for rarer categories of prey such as Thysanura and Orthoptera, as well as for Coleoptera. Each species of shrew selected sires providing dense ground level vegetation and deep leaf litter, with the preference for cover being strongest in C. fuscomurina. Dense vegetation probably provides shelter from predators and high daytime temperatures; both C. fuscomurina and C. hirta used denser vegetation by day than by night. Each species foraged in leaf litter, perhaps increasing access to preferred types of prey. Preference for moist soil, especially in C. fuscomurina, probably also reflects increased access to preferred prey, although moist soil may also facilitate burrow construction, Because patterns of habitat and diet selection appear to be linked, future research on resource use in these shrews should be pursued most fruitfully in field experiments or captive laboratory trials.

AB We quantified the effects of position within treefall gaps, gap size, and sapling size on sapling radial increment (most recent 5 yr, using tree cores) for two species of Nothofagus (southern beech) on the South Island, New Zealand (42 degrees 13' S).
   Mean radial growth rates of the two species and characteristics of the gaps in which they occurred were similar. Based on regression analysis, stems (1.4-26 m tall) of both species grew faster in larger gaps than smaller gaps (canopy gap area range 16-528 m(2)) and larger stems grew faster than smaller ones, the latter more true of N. fusca than iV. menziesii. N. fusca grew fastest near gap center; N. menziesii grew fastest south of gap center. Smaller stems of both species grew faster south of gap center and large ones faster at, or even north of, gap center. For all size classes, the optimum location for N. menziesii growth was further south than for N. fusca. N.fusca grew faster than N. menziesii near gap center; N. menziesii grew faster than N.fusca south of gap center.
   These results are intermediate between literature predictions of best growth in gap center (based on soil moisture, soil nutrients and diffuse radiation) and best growth near the south gap edge (based on direct beam radiation and without considering shading).

AB Members of colonial plant species often occur as scattered individuals well beyond the borders of local populations. The ecological and genetical importance of these outliers to local populations and to the species as a whole have not been considered. A review of the reproductive biology of outliers and of sparse plants in general indicates that they produce fewer seeds per flower than plants within populations. Nevertheless, they successfully interbreed over large distances. I propose that outliers form large, diffuse assemblages of interbreeding plants that may fill the gaps between some local populations. These outlier assemblages may be prime sources of extraneous pollen and seeds, retard the divergence of local populations between which they reside, and form the nuclei for new populations. Outliers may receive more or less pest pressure than plants within populations. They serve as interpopulation bridges for pathogens and herbivores.

AB Relationships between canopy cover and tree regeneration were determined for various species in cove forests of the Great Smoky Mountains.  Old-growth stands were sampled with six plots covering a total area of 4.8 ha.  Each plot was subdivided into contiguous 10 x 10 m quadrats.  Canopy cover overlying each of the 480 quadrats was characterized with three different indices based on visual estimates of cover.  Influences of:  (1) overlying cover, (2) proximate openings, and (3) total area of proximate openings on quadrat regeneration densities were determined.  Most species reproducing by seed and some species reproducing by vegetative means had higher densities in quadrats with openings, but only the intolerants were highly dependent on gaps.  Tsuga canadensis, a very shade-tolerant species, was one of the few species with abundant regeneration beneath dense canopy cover.  In general, understory areas near gaps had somewhat higher regeneration densities than other areas with overlying cover.  Several shade-tolerant species showed a positive regeneration density response to canopy openings and an ability to regenerate in gaps 0.01-0.03 ha in area.  These openings were too small for intolerant species.  Many species exhibited a positive response to total size of the proximate opening(s).  A sharp increase in regeneration density with area of the opening(s) was evident at approximately 0.04 ha for the shade-intolerant species.

AB The relative importance of intraspecific trait variation (rITV) for functional diversity (FD) in plant communities is increasingly apparent, but the influence of abiotic factors on the balance between intraspecific and interspecific effects in contrasting environments is uncertain. Drawing on a novel conceptual and analytic framework, we quantified rITV as the ratio of FD associated with between-population ITV (Intra_FD) and the interspecific variation (Inter_FD) due to species turnover across sites.
   We predicted that rITV would increase with environmental harshness as a result of decreasing interspecific variation and concomitant increases in between-population ITV. We empirically tested this prediction in a comparison of rITV for five traits (mature plant height, SLA, leaf dry matter content and the foliar concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus (P)) characterizing species in Tibetan alpine meadow communities from contrasting environmental regimes.
   We found that across sites: (a) rITV for all five traits increased with environmental harshness not only through decreasing Inter_FD but also through increasing Intra_FD; (b) increases in rITV were mostly attributable to declines in soil resources, especially soil P, with lower soil P significantly associated with lower Inter_FD but higher Intra_FD for most traits; and (c) although neither Intra_FD nor Inter_FD was significantly impacted by species richness for any traits, a higher rITV for SLA was significantly associated with low species richness.
   Taken together, these results support our hypothesis that the functional significance of ITV in plant communities increases with environmental harshness. Moreover, in the Tibetan alpine meadows we studied, the opposing intraspecific and interspecific responses along a gradient of P availability appear to act as a buffering mechanism stabilizing the functional structure of communities on P deficient soils. Our novel conceptual and analytical framework provides a template for evaluating the generality of this favourable mismatch between intraspecific and interspecific responses in FD along environmental gradients.

AB Fires shape the biogeochemistry and functioning of many ecosystems, and fire frequencies are changing across much of the globe. Frequent fires can change soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage by altering the quantity and chemistry of plant inputs through changes in plant biomass and composition as well as altering decomposition of soil organic matter. How decomposition rates change with shifting inputs remains uncertain because most studies focus on the effects of single fires, where transient responses may not reflect responses to decadal changes in burning frequencies. Here, we sampled seven sites exposed to different fire frequencies. In four of the sites, we intensively sampled both soils and plant communities across four ecosystems in North America and Africa spanning tropical savanna, temperate coniferous savanna, temperate broadleaf savanna, and temperate coniferous forest ecosystems. Each site contained multiple plots burned frequently for 33-61 years and nearby plots that had remained unburned over the same period replicated at the landscape scale. Across all sites, repeatedly burned plots had 25-185% lower bulk soil C and N concentrations but also 2-10-fold lower potential decomposition of organic matter compared to unburned sites. Soil C and N concentrations and extracellular enzyme activities declined with frequent fire because fire reduced both plant biomass inputs into soils and dampened the localized enrichment effect of tree canopies. Examination of soil extracellular enzyme activities revealed that fire decreased the potential turnover of organic matter in the forms of cellulose, starch, and chitin (P < 0.0001) but not polyphenol and lignin (P = 0.09), suggesting a shift in soil C and N cycling. Inclusion of delta C-13 data from three additional savanna sites (19-60 years of altered fire frequencies) showed that soil C losses were largest in sites where estimated tree inputs into soils declined the most (r(2) = 0.91, P < 0.01). In conclusion, repeated burning reduced C and N storage, consistent with previous studies, but fire also reduced potential decomposition, likely contributing to slower C and N cycling. Trees were important in shaping soil C and N responses across sites, but the magnitude of tree effects differed and depended on how tree biomass inputs into soil responded to fire.

AB Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) is an increasing global problem that, despite being widely recognized in terrestrial systems, has been studied much less in marine habitats. In this study we investigated the effect of ALAN on behavioral and physiological traits of Concholepas concholepas, an important keystone species of the south-eastern Pacific coast. We used juveniles collected in intertidal habitats that had not previously been exposed to ALAN. In the laboratory we exposed them to two treatments: darkness and white LED ( Lighting Emitting Diodes) to test for the impacts of ALAN on prey-searching behavior, self-righting time and metabolism. In the field, the distribution of juveniles was observed during daylight-hours to determine whether C. concholepas preferred shaded or illuminated microhabitats. Moreover, we compared the abundance of juveniles collected during day- and night-time hours. The laboratory experiments demonstrated that juveniles of C. concholepas seek out and choose their prey more efficiently in darkened areas. White LED illuminated conditions increased righting times and metabolism. Field surveys indicated that, during daylight hours, juveniles were more abundant in shaded micro-habitats than in illuminated ones. However, during darkness hours, individuals were not seen to aggregate in any particular microhabitats. We conclude that the exposure to ALAN might disrupt important behavioral and physiological traits of small juveniles in this species which, as a mechanism to avoid visual predators, are mainly active at night. It follows that ALAN in coastal areas might modify the entire community structure of intertidal habitats by altering the behavior of this keystone species. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Trees can be associated with dozens of fungi helping them to acquire resources from forest soils. The most widespread mutualistic association in boreal and temperate forests is the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. This symbiosis involves mushroom-forming fungi of basidiomycota, ascomycota, and some zygomycota clades and the roots of woody plant species, including oaks, poplars or pines. Although the impact of this association on ecosystem production and tree nutrition is investigated for about a century, our understanding on the molecular mechanisms that control water and nutrient fluxes between plant and fungal partners is still limited. Here, we review the recent knowledge on the ectomycorrhizal contribution to tree nutrition. We specifically highlight the molecular mechanisms driving the acquisition, translocation and release of water and nutrients in ectomycorrhizal systems. We particularly focus on the transport of macronutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur and calcium, micronutrients, and water by the symbiotic partner. We also provide background on the evolution, diversity, and importance of this symbiosis, identify knowledge gaps, and propose future research directions.

AB The extreme diversity of dispersal strategies in ants is unique among terrestrial animals. The nature of ant colonies as social, perennial, and sessile superorganisms is the basis for understanding this diversity, together with the inclusive-fitness framework for social evolution. We review ant dispersal strategies, with the aim of identifying future research directions on ant dispersal and its evolution. We list ultimate and proximate determinants of dispersal traits and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of dispersal for population structures and dynamics, as well as species communities. We outline the eco-evolutionary feedbacks between the multitude of traits affecting dispersal evolution and the likely evolutionary routes and ecological drivers in transitions among the diverse ant dispersal strategies. We conclude by presenting a research framework to fill the gaps in current knowledge, including comparative studies of colony life histories and population structures and theoretical models of the eco-evolutionary dynamics affecting dispersal, in an inclusive-fitness framework.

AB Biological diversity depends on the interplay between evolutionary diversification and ecological mechanisms allowing species to coexist. Current research increasingly integrates ecology and evolution over a range of timescales, but our common conceptual framework for understanding species coexistence requires better incorporation of evolutionary processes. Here, we focus on the idea of evolutionarily stable communities (ESCs), which are theoretical endpoints of evolution in a community context. We use ESCs as a unifying framework to highlight some important but under-appreciated theoretical results, and we review empirical research relevant to these theoretical predictions. We explain how, in addition to generating diversity, evolution can also limit diversity by reducing the effectiveness of coexistence mechanisms. The coevolving traits of competing species may either diverge or converge, depending on whether the number of species in the community is low (undersaturated) or high (oversaturated) relative to the ESC. Competition in oversaturated communities can lead to extinction or neutrally coexisting, ecologically equivalent species. It is critical to consider trait evolution when investigating fundamental ecological questions like the strength of different coexistence mechanisms, the feasibility of ecologically equivalent species, and the interpretation of different patterns of trait dispersion.

AB Urbanization fragments, isolates or eliminates natural habitats, and changes the structure and composition of assemblages living in the remaining natural fragments. Knowing assembly rules is necessary to support and/or maintain biodiversity in urban habitats. We hypothesized that forest communities in rural sites are organized by environmental filtering, but this may be changed by urbanization, and in the suburban and urban forest fragments replaced by randomly organized assemblages, influenced by the colonization of species from the surrounding matrix. Evaluating simultaneously the functional and phylogenetic relationships of co-existing species, we showed that at the rural sites, co-existing ground beetle species were functionally and phylogenetically more similar than expected by chance, indicating that environmental filtering was the likely process structuring these communities. Contrary to this, in urban and suburban sites, the co-occurring species were functionally and phylogenetically not different from the null model, indicating randomly structured assemblages. According to our findings, changes in environmental and habitat characteristics accompanied by urbanization lead to assemblages of randomly colonized species from the surrounding matrix, threatening proper ecosystem functioning. To reassemble stochastically assembled species of urban and suburban fragments to structured, properly functioning communities, appropriate management strategies are needed which simultaneously consider recreational, economic and conservation criteria.

AB Many of the sustainability concerns of bioenergy are related to direct or indirect land use change (LUC) resulting from bioenergy feedstock production. The environmental and socio-economic impacts of LUC highly depend on the site-specific biophysical and socio-economic conditions. The objective of this study is to spatiotemporally assess the potential LUC dynamics resulting from an increased biofuel demand, the related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the potential effect of LUC mitigation measures. This assessment is demonstrated for LUC dynamics in Brazil towards 2030, considering an increase in the global demand for bioethanol as well as other agricultural commodities. The potential effects of three LUC mitigation measures (increased agricultural productivity, shift to second-generation ethanol, and strict conservation policies) are evaluated by using a scenario approach. The novel modelling framework developed consists of the global Computable General Equilibrium model MAGNET, the spatiotemporal land use allocation model PLUC, and a GIS-based carbon module. The modelling simulations illustrate where LUC as a result of an increased global ethanol demand (+26x10(9)L ethanol production in Brazil) is likely to occur. When no measures are taken, sugar cane production is projected to expand mostly at the expense of agricultural land which subsequently leads to the loss of natural vegetation (natural forest and grass and shrubland) in the Cerrado and Amazon. The related losses of above and below ground biomass and soil organic carbon result in the average emission of 26gCO(2-)eq/MJbioethanol. All LUC mitigation measures show potential to reduce the loss of natural vegetation (18%-96%) as well as the LUC-related GHG emissions (7%-60%). Although there are several uncertainties regarding the exact location and magnitude of LUC and related GHG emissions, this study shows that the implementation of LUC mitigation measures could have a substantial contribution to the reduction of LUC-related emissions of bioethanol. However, an integrated approach targeting all land uses is required to obtain substantial and sustained LUC-related GHG emission reductions in general.

AB Many coastal habitats are actually replaced with hard infrastructures which alter the taxonomic/functional structure of natural ecosystems worldwide. Few information about habitat loss and species composition in South American coasts are available compared with other coasts. Here, I examine the distribution and identity of coastal artificial infrastructures, especially artificial breakwaters, present along the coast of Chile and the proportion of natural habitat loss derived from their construction. Differences in species taxonomic/functional composition in artificial breakwaters and natural habitats present in northern Chile are also examined. I also propose/discuss opportunities for coastal planning based on habitat rehabilitation and ecological engineering in Chile, which could guide future marine infrastructures construction. An important proportion of natural habitat has been replaced by artificial coastal defences along the coast of Chile, accounting for about 200 km of total coastal length. Given their specific uses and functions, artificial granite breakwaters are one of the most important coastal infrastructures present in Chile (62% of the total of artificial breakwaters present). Differences in taxonomic/functional structure between artificial breakwaters and natural adjacent habitats are significant, and appear related to contrasting spatial heterogeneity. Artificial infrastructures like granite breakwaters can facilitate presence of native and non-native species, which live in the marine-terrestrial interphase (crabs, rats). The present study highlights how the recent proliferation of coastal artificial infrastructures is replacing important natural habitats in Chile, and how the taxonomic/functional structure of coastal ecosystems can be negatively impacted. Furthermore, this study showed how artificial infrastructures can have direct consequences for human-health security and specific guidelines can be conducted to buffer impacts on ecosystem structure to match social livelihood and wellness.

AB Biotic resistance may influence invasion success; however, the relative roles of species richness, functional or phylogenetic distance in predicting invasion success are not fully understood. We used biomass fraction of Chromolaena odorata, an invasive species in tropical and subtropical areas, as a measure of invasion success' in a series of artificial communities varying in species richness. Communities were constructed using species from Mexico (native range) or China (non-native range). We found strong evidence of biotic resistance: species richness and community biomass were negatively related with invasion success; invader biomass was greater in plant communities from China than from Mexico. Harvesting time had a greater effect on invasion success in plant communities from China than on those from Mexico. Functional and phylogenetic distances both correlated with invasion success and more functionally distant communities were more easily invaded. The effects of plant-soil fungi and plant allelochemical interactions on invasion success were species-specific.

AB The success of conservation interventions often depends on the multifaceted and sometimes competing interests and motivations that lead local people to sustainably manage natural resources in the first place. Yet despite an extensive literature exploring the effects of conservation on human livelihoods, there is a lack of robust evidence about which type of conservation intervention works, for whom, and how. This is partly because the social impacts of conservation interventions often affect multiple aspects of human well-being, with changes taking place over long periods during which unintended feedbacks can occur. This paper assesses the medium-term impacts of Protected Areas (PAs) and of three Payment for Environmental Services (PES) projects on three socio-economic indicators across 16 villages in Northern Cambodia. We present a multi-period evaluation including three panel surveys over six years from villages inside and outside PAs to clarify the mechanisms through which social effects of conservation take place and how this translates into the development pathways adopted by households. While livelihood improvements were recorded across all villages, we found that PAs slightly reduce households' socio-economic status, though does not impede their development. PAs also protect traditional livelihoods. Participants in one of the three PES projects recorded higher economic status and agricultural productivity than non-participants, suggesting that there can be important social co-benefits to conservation interventions when programs are well-designed to respond to local contexts.

AB Aim Habitat loss and fragmentation are considered the main drivers of species population declines and extinctions in the world. The large-scale replacement of natural habitats with human-modified habitats, such as the replacement of forests with agricultural and livestock farming areas, creates a scenario where natural habitat patches are immersed in an inhospitable land use matrix. We sought to evaluate how forest fragments (FFs) are influenced by the different surrounding landscape components, where we assessed how agricultural matrices that differ in structure and seasonality affect the structure of FFs and their amphibian assemblages.
   Location Atlantic Forest, Brazil.
   Methods Using diverse methods including satellite imagery, historical land use and field data, we evaluated the effects of representative agricultural matrices on the structure of FFs and their amphibian composition, species richness and abundance.
   Results Our results suggest that the structure of FFs and amphibian composition, species richness and individual abundance are intimately linked to the type of matrix and its proportion around FFs. The nature of the matrix is more likely to affect species richness, individual abundance and composition of amphibian assemblages than FF size, reducing the species-area relationship in FFs. There is strong support for the hypothesis that certain agricultural matrices facilitate FF exposure to the elements and a decrease in forest integrity within the fragment, which is reflected in a loss of strict forest inhabitants. Those matrices that allow for a greater exposure of FFs also appear to favour their occupation by habitat generalists.
   Main conclusions Surrounding matrices affect the structure and dynamics of forest remnants and should therefore be considered in management plans of severely fragmented landscapes. The influence of the land matrix should be urgently assessed, as it has effects on species occurrences and distribution. This is especially relevant considering the increasing deforestation rates in biodiversity hotspots world-wide.

AB Intensive cropland agriculture commonly increases streamwater solute concentrations and export from small watersheds. In recent decades, the lowland tropics have become the world's largest and most important region of cropland expansion. Although the effects of intensive cropland agriculture on streamwater chemistry and watershed export have been widely studied in temperate regions, their effects in tropical regions are poorly understood. We sampled seven headwater streams draining watersheds in forest (n = 3) or soybeans (n = 4) to examine the effects of soybean cropping on stream solute concentrations and watershed export in a region of rapid soybean expansion in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. We measured stream flows and concentrations of NO3-, PO43-, SO42-, Cl-, NH4+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Al3+, Fe3+, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) biweekly to monthly to determine solute-export. We also measured stormflows and stormflow solute concentrations in a subset of watersheds (two forest, two soybean) during two/three storms, and solutes and delta O-18 in groundwater, rainwater, and throughfall to characterize watershed flowpaths. Concentrations of all solutes except K+ varied seasonally in streamwater, but only Fe3+ concentrations differed between land uses. The highest streamwater and rainwater solute concentrations occurred during the peak season of wildfires in Mato Grosso, suggesting that regional changes in atmospheric-composition and deposition influence seasonal stream solute concentrations. Despite no concentration differences between forest and soybean land uses, annual export of NH4+, PO43-, Ca2+, Fe3+, Na+, SO42-, DOC, and TSS were significantly higher from soybean than forest watersheds (5.6-fold mean increase). This increase largely reflected a 4.3-fold increase in water export from soybean watersheds. Despite this increase, total solute export per unit watershed area (i. e., yield) remained low for all watersheds (< 1 kg NO3- N . ha(-1) .yr(-1), < 2.1 kg NH4+-N.ha(-1).yr(-1), < 0.2 kg PO43--P .ha(-1) . yr(-1), < 1.5 kg Ca2+.ha(-1).yr(-1)). Responses of both streamflows and solute concentrations to crop agriculture appear to be controlled by high soil hydraulic conductivity, groundwater-dominated hydrologic flowpaths on deep soils, and the absence of nitrogen fertilization. To date, these factors have buffered streams from the large increases in solute concentrations that often accompany intensive croplands in other locations.

AB QuestionsDo functional traits explain individual tree species' responses to environmental filters and dispersal limitations following stand-replacing fire? Can post-fire conditions initiate alternate trajectories of community assembly?
   LocationGlacier National Park, Montana, USA.
   MethodsWe characterized the species composition of tree re-establishment following nine recent fires in the lower subalpine zone of Glacier National Park, a region with multiple co-dominant tree species that has experienced extensive fire in recent decades. We used GLMMs to describe individual species' responses to spatial and temporal heterogeneity of post-fire conditions and seed availability, and used multivariate approaches to examine whether post-fire conditions can initiate alternate trajectories of forest community assembly.
   ResultsPost-fire regeneration responses were strongly species-dependent and consistent with functional trait differences. We found that there was a brief opportunity for establishment during the first several years after fire, during which tree recruitment for all species was contingent upon the availability of nearby seeds and the occurrence of favourable weather conditions. There was a remarkable amount of compositional change following fire, and the majority of our study sites transitioned from a mixed forest to a tree assemblage dominated by a single species.
   ConclusionsDifferential species-specific responses to climate and disturbance can initiate alternate trajectories of community assembly, triggering substantial changes in forest composition. The composition of post-fire tree assemblages reflects the differential responses of individual species to climate and disturbance, providing support for the interacting role of dispersal and environmental filtering in shaping post-disturbance communities and highlighting the importance of incorporating functional traits into predictive models of ecosystem dynamics.

AB The Forest and Landscape Restoration movement has emerged as an approach to reconcile biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services provisioning and human well-being in degraded landscapes, but little is known so far about the potential of different reforestation methods to achieve these objectives. Based on this gap, we assessed the ecological outcomes and local livelihood benefits of community-managed agroforests and second growth forests to assist natural regeneration in the coastal Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We investigated and compared agroforests and secondary forests according to their structure and floristic composition in 51 circular plots of 314 m(2), their role in supporting local livelihoods (45 semi-structured interviews) and the use and cultural importance of plant species (61 interviews). Agroforests and, more remarkably, managed secondary forests (1) re-established a well-developed forest structure, with a higher density of tree-sized individuals and similar basal area compared to nearby old growth forests; (2) were composed by a rich array of native species, including five threatened species, but had lower species richness than old growth remnants; and (3) improved local livelihoods by supplying market valuable and culturally important plants, including 231 native ethnospecies. Overall, local production systems showed remarkable potential to engage smallholders of developing tropical countries in Forest and Landscape Restoration and contribute to achieve its overall goals. We advocate the promotion of these systems as effective Forest and Landscape Restoration approaches in multi-scale programs and policies.

AB The future of biodiversity in Asia is increasingly dependent on networks of effective protected areas. Three wildlife sanctuaries of the Bangladesh Sundarbans are typical examples of protected areas where detection and monitoring of threats is difficult due to low densities of patrol staff and low frequency of patrolling relative to the area that requires monitoring. The aim of this study was to use camera traps to quantify: 1) the levels of different types of illegal human activities (IHA), 2) spatio-temporal variation in illegal human activities, and 3) what proportion of camera trap records can be used to identify perpetrators. Each photograph was categorized as either illegal human activity (IHA) or legal human activity (LHA) based on interpretation of the particular human activity and equipment observed in photograph. For IHA, infraction type was based on the Bangladesh Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act 2012. A total of 914 unique human activity events were recorded (872 IHA and 42 LHA) in camera trap photos over a total of 1039 trap nights. The best model suggests that during spring tide 91% of camera trapped locations in the West Sanctuary had IHA occurring in them during the survey period, while 84% and 74% locations had IHA in the South Sanctuary and East Sanctuary respectively. Camera trapping in remote areas can potentially help protected area managers to increase rates of detection of IHA in their conservation landscapes and increase rates of arrests and prosecutions by providing appropriate supporting evidence.

AB Microbial metabolism drives our planet's biogeochemistry and plays a central role in industrial processes. Molecular profiling in bioreactors has revealed that microbial community composition can be highly variable while maintaining constant functional performance. Furthermore, following perturbation bioreactor performance typically recovers rapidly, while community composition slowly returns to its original state. Despite its practical relevance, we still lack an understanding of the mechanisms causing the discrepancy between functional and compositional stability of microbial communities. Using a mathematical model for microbial competition, as well as simulations of a model for a nitrifying bioreactor, we explain these observations on grounds of slow non-equilibrium dynamics eventually leading to competitive exclusion. In the presence of several competing strains, metabolic niches are rapidly occupied by opportunistic populations, while subsequent species turnover and the eventual dominance of top competitors proceeds at a much slower rate. Hence, functional redundancy causes a separation of the time scales characterizing the functional and compositional stabilization of microbial communities. This effect becomes stronger with increasing richness because greater similarities between top competitors lead to longer transient population dynamics.

AB The dynamics of structured plant populations in variable environments can be decomposed into the asymptotic' growth contributed by vital rates, and transient' growth caused by deviation from stable stage structure. We apply this framework to a large, global data base of longitudinal studies of projection matrix models for plant populations. We ask, what is the relative contribution of transient boom and bust to the dynamic trajectories of plant populations in stochastic environments? Is this contribution patterned by phylogeny, growth form or the number of life stages per population and per species? We show that transients contribute nearly 50% or more to the resulting trajectories, depending on whether transient and stable contributions are partitioned according to their absolute or net contribution to population dynamics. Both transient contributions and asymptotic contributions are influenced heavily by the number of life stages modelled. We discuss whether the drivers of transients should be considered real ecological phenomena, or artefacts of study design and modelling strategy. We find no evidence for phylogenetic signal in the contribution of transients to stochastic growth, nor clear patterns related to growth form. We find a surprising tendency for plant populations to boom rather than bust in response to temporal changes in vital rates and that stochastic growth rates increase with increasing tendency to boom.Synthesis. Transient dynamics contribute significantly to stochastic population dynamics but are often overlooked in ecological and evolutionary studies that employ stochastic analyses. Better understanding of transient responses to fluctuating population structure will yield better management strategies for plant populations, and better grasp of evolutionary dynamics in the real world.

AB 1. Spatial statistics are widely used in studies of ecological processes in plant communities, especially to provide evidence of neutral or non-neutral mechanisms that might support species coexistence. The contribution of such statistics has been substantial, but their ability to identify any links between underlying processes and emergent patterns is not certain.
   2. We investigate the ability of a number of spatial statistics to distinguish theorized mechanisms of species coexistence (spatial and temporal niche differentiation, neutrality, the Janzen-Connell effect and heteromyopia) in a simulated plant community.
   3. We find that individual statistics differ substantially in their sensitivity to these mechanisms, with those based on nearest neighbour species identities being the most sensitive. These differences are largely robust to changes in the strength of the modelled mechanisms when simulated independently and in combination. The spatial signal of niche differentiation is always distinct in simulations that combine mechanisms.
   4. Synthesis. We describe full spatial signals of modelled coexistence mechanisms that are observed consistently across statistics and simulated strengths and combinations of mechanisms, and identify a set of spatial statistics that holds particular promise for empirical studies designed to investigate mechanisms of these kinds.

AB Niche and neutral theories emphasize different processes contributing to the maintenance of species diversity. In this study, we calculated the local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) of every cell, using variation partitioning in combination with spatial distance and environmental variables of the 25-ha Badagongshan plot (BDGS), to determine the contribution of environmentally-related variation versus pure spatial variation. We used topography and soil characteristics as environmental variables, distance-based Moran's eigenvectors maps (dbMEM) to describe spatial relationships among cells and redundancy analysis (RDA) to apportion the variation in beta diversity into three components: pure environmental, spatially-structured environmental, and pure spatial. Results showed LCBD values were negatively related to number of common species and positively related to number of rare species. Environment and space jointly explained similar to 60% of the variation in species composition; soil variables alone explained 21.6%, slightly more than the topographic variables that explained 15.7%; topography and soil together explained 27%, slightly inferior to spatial variables that explained 34%. The BDGS forest was controlled both by the spatial and environmental variables, and the results were consistent across different life forms and life stages.

AB Aim: Community assembly theory predicts that niche differentiation promotes the spatial clustering of functionally dissimilar species, whereas habitat filtering has the converse effect. We used these predictions to assess the relative effects of habitat filtering and niche differentiation on recruit community assembly over spatial (5- and 30-m neighbourhoods) and temporal (20-yr) scales in the Forest Dynamics Plot at Barro Colorado Island.
   Location: Barro Colorado Island, Panama.
   Methods: We integrated data on the spatial patterns of >= 1 cm DBH (diameter at 1.3 m above ground) recruits with data on seven functional traits for 64 species. First, we quantified the interspecific association patterns of all species pairs i and j using the K-function K-ij(r) and the nearest-neighbour distribution function D-ij(r). Second, for those pairs with significant spatial associations, we calculated an index of interspecific spatial association using the results of these two summary statistics. Finally, we examined the relationship between interspecific spatial association and trait similarity using simple and partial Mantel tests.
   Results: In all censuses, almost one-half of species pairs had no spatial associations, but for pairs that were significantly spatially associated, positive relationships between trait similarity and spatial association occurred in 5-m and 30-m neighbourhoods, whereas significant negative relationships only appeared in 5-m neighbourhoods. This suggests that habitat filtering was more important than niche differentiation in assembling recruit communities at 5- and 30-m scales. Habitat filtering mainly acted upon traits related to topographic habitat preferences and dispersal mode, whereas spatial association was inversely related to similarity in terms of wood specific gravity and shade tolerance.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that both stochastic and deterministic processes operate in species-rich ecological communities, but the role of habitat filtering and niche differentiation as determinants of community assembly vary over spatial and temporal scales. Species co-occurrence was driven by habitat filtering at small and large scales, but also by a combination of niche differentiation and weaker-competitor exclusion effects at small scales. Temporal variations in the importance of habitat filtering and niche differentiation could be related to the occurrence of disturbances such as tree falls. Our results emphasize the role of trait-based processes in plant community assembly.

AB Similar environmental driving forces can produce similarity among geographically distant ecosystems. Coastal oceanic upwelling, for example, has been associated with elevated biomass and abundance patterns of certain functional groups, e.g., corticated macroalgae. In the upwelling system of Northern Chile, we examined measures of intertidal macrobenthic composition, structure and trophic ecology across eighteen shores varying in their proximity to two coastal upwelling centres, in a hierarchical sampling design (spatial scales of >1 and >10 km). The influence of coastal upwelling on intertidal communities was confirmed by the stable isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of consumers, including a dominant suspension feeder, grazers, and their putative resources of POM, epilithic biofilm, and macroalgae. We highlight the utility of muscle delta N-15 from the suspension feeding mussel, Perumytilus purpuratus, as a proxy for upwelling, supported by satellite data and previous studies. Where possible, we used corrections for broader-scale trends, spatial autocorrelation, ontogenetic dietary shifts and spatial baseline isotopic variation prior to analysis. Our results showed macroalgal assemblage composition, and benthic consumer assemblage structure, varied significantly with the intertidal influence of coastal upwelling, especially contrasting bays and coastal headlands. Coastal topography also separated differences in consumer resource use. This suggested that coastal upwelling, itself driven by coastline topography, influences intertidal communities by advecting nearshore phytoplankton populations offshore and cooling coastal water temperatures. We recommend the isotopic values of benthic organisms, specifically long-lived suspension feeders, as in situ alternatives to offshore measurements of upwelling influence.

AB Growth of secondary forest (capoeira) is an important factor in absorption of carbon from the atmosphere. Estimates of this absorption vary greatly, in large part due to the effect of different land-use histories on the estimates available in the literature. We relate land-use history to aboveground biomass accumulation of secondary vegetation in plots on land that had been used for agriculture (unmechanized manioc and maize) and for pasture in small rural properties in the Taruma-Mirim settlement near Manaus in central Amazonia, Brazil. We evaluated influence of (a) age of the second growth vegetation, (b) time of use as agriculture or pasture and (c) number of times the area was burned. Biomass data were obtained by destructive sampling of all plants with diameter at breast height >1 cm in 24 parcels of secondary vegetation ranging from 1 to 15 years of age in abandoned pasture (n = 9) and agriculture (n = 15). As compared to secondary vegetation in abandoned agricultural fields, vegetation in abandoned cattle pasture (the predominant use history for Amazonian secondary vegetation) grows 38% more slowly to age 6 years. Number of burns also negatively affects biomass recovery. Applying the growth rates we measured to the secondary forests reported in Brazil's Second National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change suggests that carbon uptake by this vegetation is overestimated by a factor of four in the report.

AB General patterns of forest dynamics and productivity in the Andes Mountains are poorly characterized. Here we present the first large-scale study of Andean forest dynamics using a set of 63 permanent forest plots assembled over the past two decades. In the North-Central Andes tree turnover (mortality and recruitment) and tree growth declined with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature. In addition, basal area increased in Lower Montane Moist Forests but did not change in Higher Montane Humid Forests. However, at higher elevations the lack of net basal area change and excess of mortality over recruitment suggests negative environmental impacts. In North-Western Argentina, forest dynamics appear to be influenced by land use history in addition to environmental variation. Taken together, our results indicate that combinations of abiotic and biotic factors that vary across elevation gradients are important determinants of tree turnover and productivity in the Andes. More extensive and longer-term monitoring and analyses of forest dynamics in permanent plots will be necessary to understand how demographic processes and woody biomass are responding to changing environmental conditions along elevation gradients through this century.

AB A central tenet of forest ecology is that succession and regeneration dynamics are driven by an interspecific trade-off between juvenile growth rates in high light and shade tolerance. There is evidence, however, that a single trade-off axis may fail to explain the dynamics of mixed conifer-angiosperm rain forests in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in New Zealand.
   We tested for growth vs. shade tolerance trade-offs by measuring juvenile growth of five podocarps and five broadleaved canopy angiosperms across a wide range of light environments in a New Zealand warm-temperate rain forest. The light compensation point of growth was used as a measure of species light requirements, which we then compared with height growth in 10% light, approximating the environments encountered beneath small treefall gaps.
   Despite considerable overlap between the ranges of both growth rates and compensation points found in the two lineages, major axis tests showed that the growth vs. shade tolerance trade-off differed significantly between podocarp and angiosperm species. At a common compensation point, angiosperms were faster growing than podocarps in 10% light. However, juveniles of these angiosperm species were notably scarce in the more open environments associated with forest margins.
   Synthesis.A conifer-angiosperm divergence in the growth vs. shade tolerance trade-off may explain long-standing problems of the dynamics of these forests. Although juveniles of most lowland podocarps can tolerate considerable shade, the more vigorous response of broadleaved angiosperms to small canopy openings enables them to out-compete podocarps in old-growth stands. The greater abundance of podocarp juveniles on forest margins cannot be attributed to them out-competing angiosperm species where light is abundant and is likely to reflect superior resistance to frost and/or drought. The drivers of the dynamics of New Zealand's podocarp-broadleaved forests therefore differ appreciably from those ascribed to tropical and north-temperate forests.

AB New approaches to human-environment interactions are beginning to move beyond a narrow focus on individuals and simple (patch-level) predatory or competitive interactions. These approaches link nonequilibrium theory from community and landscape ecology with theories of individual decision making from behavioral ecology to explore new ways of approaching complex issues of diachronic change in behavior, subsistence, and social institutions. I provide an overview of two such approaches, one to understand long-term hunting sustainability among mixed forager-horticulturalists in the wet tropics and the other to understand how foragers act as ecosystem engineers in a dry perennial grassland in Australia. I conclude by describing the implications of new approaches that incorporate anthropogenic "intermediate" disturbance (an emergent property of human-environment interaction) as a force shaping environments through time and space, and in so doing patterning the sustainability of subsistence, ways of sharing, ownership norms, and even structures of gendered production.

AB Ants represent a widespread and functionally diverse taxonomic group that are both sensitive to land management and serve as important regulators of key soil processes. Building upon this idea, we sought to understand the impacts of agricultural management on ant communities in the Orinoco River Basin of eastern Colombia and to identify species that could be used as indicators of soil-based ecosystem services. Ants were collected and identified from the soil and litter layer within 75 fields (nine TSBF subsamples along a transect in each field) divided among five common agricultural land uses in the region: 1) annual crops (maize, soy and rice), 2) rubber plantations, 3) oil palm plantations, 4) improved pastures (based on Brachiaria spp.), and 5) semi-natural savannas. As expected, land management was found to greatly influence ant communities. Improved pastures showed the highest species richness (6.9 species per transect) and semi-natural savanna the greatest abundance of ants (145 individuals per transect). Within each of these fields a suite of soil and agroecosystem characteristics were measured and combined into synthetic indicators of five soil-based ecosystem services: 1) nutrient provision, 2) water storage and regulation, 3) maintenance of soil structure, 4) climate regulation services and 5) soil biodiversity and biological activity. Ant species were then associated with these synthetic indicators using the IndVal method to identify indicator species for each of the five consolidated ecosystem services measured. In total, 14 indicator species were identified and found to be significantly associated with either the high or low provision of each of the five services. The development of such bioindicators offers a rapid and relatively inexpensive tool to facilitate land management and policy decisions in this biologically diverse and rapidly changing region of Colombia.

AB Recent investigations have highlighted the dependence of Mediterranean forest production on spring rainfall. The current work introduces the concept of the start of the dry season (SDS) and performs a three-step analysis to determine the effect of SDS on Mediterranean forest production.
   Seven forest zones of Tuscany (Central Italy), which present differently pronounced Mediterranean features, are considered. First, a statistical analysis investigates the influence of spring water budget on forest Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) inter-annual variations during July August. The analysis is then extended to assess the impact of inter-annual SDS variability on forest gross primary production (GPP) simulated by a NDVI driven parametric model, modified C-Fix. These simulations lead to rank the considered forest types according to the relevance of SDS in regulating inter-annual GPP variations. The application of similar statistical analyses to detrended tree ring-width time series of typical Tuscany forests confirms the existence of an eco-climatic gradient in the functional relevance of SDS. The influence of SDS on tree growth is attenuated moving from Mediterranean arid to temperate humid environments. These findings are examined and interpreted from an eco-physiological viewpoint taking into consideration the peculiarity of Mediterranean forest ecosystems. Next, relevant implications are discussed in view of the possible consequences of ongoing climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cardiac activity (Arrhenius breakpoint temperatures and Q10 relationships) and heat shock response (hsp70 expression) were measured in the congeneric limpets Patella rustica, P. caerulea and P. ulyssiponensis in order to test the relationship between their vertical distribution and physiological thermal tolerance. These species exhibit different vertical distributions along Mediterranean shores and despite the narrow tidal range in the Mediterranean, they experience different environmental conditions and consequently had specific thermal windows. Cardiac activity of the upper zoned P. rustica was maintained at higher temperatures than its mid- or low shore counterparts, P. caerulea and P. ulyssiponensis. P. rustica had the highest Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (37.9 +/- 2.1 degrees C, mean +/- SD), followed by P. caerulea (35.9 +/- 2.6 degrees C), and finally the low-zoned P. ulyssiponensg (32.2 +/- 23 degrees C). The same pattern was found for Q10 relationships. Expression of hsp70 increased at 34 degrees C and kept increasing with temperature in P. rustica. In P. caerulea, expression reached a maximum at 36 degrees C and decreased at 38 degrees C, suggesting that hsp70 expression in P. rustica provides a more efficient defence against thermal stress than in P. caerulea. As summer environmental temperatures in the Mediterranean regularly reach 35 to 38 degrees C, performances of these limpets suggest that they are already living at the edges of their thermal window, and further temperature changes may have large-scale consequences for these keystone species.

AB The degree of stability of the Cerrado following burning is widely discussed in literature. However, little is known about the effects of fire on the resilience of savanna formations from rocky outcrops, known as "cerrado rupestre". We tested the hypothesis that floristic, structural, and dynamics parameters of a tree-shrub cerrado rupestre community have high stability following fire. We sampled the woody vegetation (plants with trunk diameter equal or larger than 3 cm as measured 30 cm above ground) in ten 20m Chi 50m plots before (2008) and after (2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012) an accidental burning in September 2008. Species richness and composition did not change. However, plant density and basal area were reduced after the fire, but began to increase in the second year after the fire. Recruitment rate was higher than mortality. Basal areal and half-life also increased, while time of duplication decreased. The community recovered relatively well from the fire, presenting high resilience to burning. However, it seemed not to have attained a complete restoration to the state prior to the fire after four years. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In central Amazonia, previous low intensity land use engenders succession dominated by Cecropia spp. which proceeds at high rates; however, at higher intensity of use succession is arrested and dominated by Vismia spp. over the long-term. Factors driving these two successional pathways are unknown.
   Aims: We aimed to elucidate seedling growth under the two alternative successional pathways.
   Methods: We experimentally determined the effects of successional age and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) on relative height growth (RHG) of nine species of shade-tolerant tree seedlings in secondary forests dominated by Cecropia and Vismia, varying in age from 1-20 years.
   Results: In Cecropia-dominated successions, seedling RHG decreased with increasing successional age and with associated decreasing PAR. In Vismia-dominated successions, RHG was independent of successional age and PAR, and PAR did not change with successional age, being always higher than in Cecropia stands. The RHG of seedlings was lower in Vismia-than in Cecropia-dominated stands for similar PAR levels.
   Conclusions: Successional age and light availability affect seedlings growth differently in the two successional pathways. Unlike in Cecropia-dominated successions, in Vismia-dominated secondary forests seedling growth is limited by factors other than light. In a scenario of increasing land use intensity, constraints to seedling development in secondary forests can reduce species diversity in human-altered landscapes.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have received considerable attention as a promising approach for correcting environmental externalities. Frequent shortcomings or outright lack of performance assessments of environmental interventions in general and PES projects in particular have resulted in recommendations for "optimal" PES designs. Conditionality-paying service providers only if services or proxy inputs are delivered-and targeting-allocating payments based on service gains, provision costs or both-are central to such recommendations. We argue that a) true economic optimality is an unattainable PES objective and improving PES cost-effectiveness is a more realistic aspiration, and that b) current PES programs actually prevent cost-effectiveness analyses because they lack appropriate ecosystem service definitions and thus output measurements. We review the effects of conditionality on service flows and provide a framework for identifying the cost-effective level of conditionality stringency. We identify key analytical methods, data and analysis tools required to improve the cost-effectiveness of PES-or any ecosystem service-projects. Needed analytical concepts, metrics, and monitoring and modeling approaches often are sufficiently available for PES design to begin incorporating them. What is missing is their coherent application. Improving spatial-analytical and monitoring capacities should allow gradual implementation of modifications needed to improve PES cost-effectiveness. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Although 'shade tolerance' has featured prominently in the vocabulary of foresters and ecologists for a century, we have yet to agree on a standardized method for quantifying this elusive property. The 'whole-plant compensation point', interpolated from stem growth measurements across a wide range of light environments, has been proposed as a simple, robust measure of species shade tolerance. Others have argued that shade tolerance is primarily a function of differential ability to survive periods of slow growth ('suppression'), implying that measurements of survival are vital.
   2. We measured growth of juveniles (500-1000mm tall) of five evergreen trees over 12months in a cool-temperate rain forest in New Zealand, to determine whether whole-plant compensation points predicted species differences in occupancy of understorey light environments, which were quantified using hemispherical photography.
   3. The five species encompassed 3.5-fold variation in whole-plant compensation points. Compensation points of most species fell within the first quartile of the distribution of light environments occupied by juveniles; they were also correlated with low-light mortality rates of juveniles, estimated from permanent plot data archived in the National Vegetation Survey Databank. Compensation points were also significantly positively correlated with height growth rates in high light, confirming the presence of the growth vs. shade tolerance trade-off detected in many other forest tree assemblages.
   4. Results show that, in temperate evergreen forests, the whole-plant compensation point distinguishes reliably between species of differing shade tolerance. Excepting situations involving parameterization of demographic models, shade tolerance can therefore be assessed without survival measurements. However, estimating whole-plant compensation points may prove more difficult in deciduous forests, where seasonal variation in understorey light transmission poses additional challenges.

AB Ant mounds often occur at high densities in marsh wetlands. However, little information is available regarding their impacts on soil nutrient pools in these ecosystems. We studied C-org, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), NO3- and NH4+ concentrations in above-ground ant mounds and in soils under mounds for three ant species (Lasius flavus, Lasius niger and Formica candida), and estimated their contribution to the total soil nutrient pools in a marsh wetland. Ant impacts were greatest in above-ground soils. All measured nutrient concentrations in above-ground mounds were significantly higher than the average values in reference soils (upper 25 cm). However, except for DOC, no significant differences for nutrient concentrations existed between soils under mounds and reference soils. The impacts of ant mounds on soil C and nutrient concentrations varied by ant species. L. niger above-ground mounds stored less C-org, TN and NO3- than F. candida and L. flavus mounds, or reference soils. At the ecosystem scale, soils in above-ground mounds and under ant mounds all contained less C-org per hectare than the reference soils. Total amounts in nutrient pools from mounds of the three ant species comprised from 5.3% to 7.6% of the total in natural marsh soils. More importantly, ant mounds increased the spatial heterogeneity of nutrient pools. Thus, ant mounds can be important to a fully integrated understanding of the structure and function of wetland nutrient cycles and balances. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Brazil is one of the leading producers of soybeans and other annual crops, and in several regions landowners are required by law to maintain 20 % of their lands with natural vegetation (i.e. as "legal reserves"). However, there is a growing concern that some of these reserves will be subject to increased levels of disturbance or even be lost as a result of the ongoing legislation reforms. In this sense, studies that evaluate the conservation potential of retaining natural habitats within agricultural areas are of great importance. We assessed the efficiency with which remnants of natural vegetation conserve the native ant fauna in a context of intensive agriculture. We compared the structure of ground-dwelling ant assemblages between crop fields and reserves located in different farms. Ant species richness was much higher in the reserves than in the crops, and this pattern was consistent in spite of variations in the type of crop planted in each field, and in the size (39-149 ha) and vegetation (open or closed savanna) of the reserves. From 41.4 to 76.4 % of all species recorded within each farm were exclusively found in the reserves. Differences in species composition were strong not only because the reserves had much more species, but also because the species that were present in both habitats showed contrasting patterns of abundance in each habitat. Overall, our results highlight that even small remnants of natural vegetation can have a significant potential to maintain a higher diversity of ants within an agriculturally dominated landscape.

AB This study is aimed to understand responses in growth rhythm to different climatic conditions of the widespread deciduous species Cedrela odorata. Our own research was conducted in Nova Iguacu. Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil) and compared with literature data from Aripuana. Mato Grosso State, Brazil), Manaus. Amazonas State, Brazil) and Barinas. Barinas State, Venezuela). Growth periodicity was evaluated through leaf phenological behavior and radial growth. In Nova Iguacu, leaf phenology was monitored monthly and radial growth was evaluated by cambial histological analysis of samples collected in wet and dry seasons. In the other sites, the authors evaluated the growth rhythm by dendrometer bands. Growth always occurs in the wet season, even when there is no water deficit during the dry season. Thus, the species is considered conservative concerning the maintenance of growth seasonality. Nevertheless, C. odorata was able to change its growth period, following local seasonality of its different growth sites. Therefore we suggest caution when performing climate analysis from a chronology using trees that grow in different periods of the year.

AB The Amazon continues to lose its natural vegetation, and Brazil, in particular, has a distinct agricultural frontier. We highlight the role of surveillance in reducing deforestation rates in the region. This paper lists the characteristics of the current agrarian structure and the surveillance information from Brazilian Institute of Environment and Natural Resources (IBAMA) with the current deforestation standards in the Amazonian municipalities. In addition, we investigate the relationship between the new areas of deforestation and the low level of agrarian technology in those areas. To do this, we used public deforestation data from the second half of the last decade (2005-2009). We also used agricultural census data to create an index of level of agrarian technology. Based on level of agrarian technology index it was possible to conclude that areas where agriculture and livestock have low level of agrarian technology coincide with the areas of highest deforestation in the Amazon. We found that agrarian structure guided the Amazonian deforestation at the end of this decade, as in previous decades. The maintenance of Agrarian structure in the region over the past 10 years makes us hypothesize that factors such as surveillance may determine decreases in deforestation rates. We showed that embargoed areas due to illegal deforestation occur in the critical areas of deforestation in Amazon, although do not get a clear any decrease in those deforestation rates caused by it. Possibly due to the time lag between recent changes in IBAMA surveillance approach and the society perception of the costs associated to illegal deforestation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB When ecological models are used to guide conservation decisions, these models should be based upon substantial data and should be applied at appropriate spatial scales. Yet, ecologists are usually faced with scarce data and must often make subjective choices about scale. To handle limited data, the use of expert panels to parameterize models has become common. However, few studies evaluate the success of expert panels in improving models. In this study. I examine a recent resistant kernel model designed to prioritize amphibian breeding habitat for conservation. I compare the predictive ability of the model as originally parameterized by an expert panel to the predictive ability of simpler models. I optimize parameter values for spatial scale and landscape resistance using 896 ponds from 5 studies of spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. In predicting amphibian distributions, models examined in this study that relied upon expert-derived resistance values performed worse than null models with uninformative resistance values. The failure of the resistant kernel model offers support for the use of simple models in the face of complex ecological problems. The best scale for measuring upland habitat in these models was in the range of 1000-3000 m, an order of magnitude larger than the salamander migration scale previously proposed for wetland buffer zones.

AB In this study alpha and beta diversity patterns of five leaf litter arthropod groups (ants, predatory ants, oribatid mites, spiders and other arachnids) were described and compared in 39 sampling patches of a transformed landscape in southwestern Colombia, that represented five vegetation types: secondary forest, riparian forest, giant bamboo forest, pasture and sugarcane crop. It was also assessed whether some taxa could be used as diversity surrogates. A total of 6,765 individuals grouped in 290 morphospecies were collected. Species richness in all groups was lower in highly transformed vegetation types (pasture, sugarcane crop) than in native ones (forests). In contrast, there were no clear tendencies of beta diversity among vegetation types. Considering sampling patches, 0.1-42% of the variation in alpha diversity of one taxonomic group could be explained from the alpha diversity of another, and 0.2-33% of the variation of beta diversity of a given taxon was explained by that in other groups. Contrary to recent findings, we concluded that patterns of alpha diversity are more congruent than patterns of beta diversity. This fact could be attributed to a sampling effect that promotes congruence in alpha diversity and to a lack of a clear regional ecological gradient that could promote congruent patterns of beta diversity. We did not find evidence for an ideal diversity surrogate although diversity patterns of predatory ants had the greatest congruencies. These results support earlier multi-taxon evaluations in that conservation planning should not be based on only one leaf litter arthropod group.

AB Theoretical and empirical evidence exists for a positive relationship between environmental heterogeneity and species diversity. Alpine plant communities can exhibit exceptional diversity at a fine scale, which niche theory would suggest is the result of fine scale spatial heterogeneity of the environment. To test if species diversity of alpine plants is driven by environmental heterogeneity, we sampled vascular plant species composition, microtopography, and ground cover within 1 m(2) plots with and without solifluction forms in Glacier National Park, MT. We analyzed the relationship between microtopographic heterogeneity and species richness at the plot and sub-plot scale with linear and quantile regression, respectively. Species richness does not differ between the plots varying in cover type. Species richness is negatively related to the fractal dimension (D) of the ground surface and non-vegetated ground cover within 1 m(2) plots. At a finer scale, the standard deviation of elevation and slope appear to impose a limit on species richness such that more variable sub-plots have lower species richness. Contrary to our expectations, microtopographic heterogeneity does not promote the diversity of alpine plants. The negative relationship between topographic heterogeneity and species richness is contrary to the theoretical prediction that environmental heterogeneity generally results in greater species diversity. It is possible that microtopographic variability represents a measure of soil disturbance, which would be expected to have a negative effect on species diversity in alpine tundra due to its low productivity.

AB This paper aims to show the relevance of past ecological records, at centennial to millennial timescales, for community ecological principles and theory, mainly in relation to temporal dynamics and the origin of present-day community patterns. The underlying assumption is that ecological time is a continuum and the ecological understanding of the present biosphere needs inputs from multilevel timescales. In particular, the so-called Q-time, embracing the Quaternary (the last 2.6 million years), is proposed as a key time period to understand present-day patterns and the underlying causal processes, as for example the latitudinal diversity gradient, the relationship between species richness and stability, the equilibrium/non-equilibrium conditions between communities and the environment, the main trends and clues on the origin of present-day species and the communities they form, the community succession under changing environmental conditions, or the nature (individual vs collective) of such biotic responses, among others. In this temporal context, neoecological studies and modeling, based on short-term evidence and calibration/validation data sets, are viewed as an important source for hypotheses to be tested with long-term ecological (i.e., palaeoecological) and molecular phylogenetic studies. The considerations around these topics provide valuable insights to address the potential future state of modern communities under the predicted global change, which would be useful to propose suitable conservation strategies. It is hoped that this paper will promote constructive discussions leading to a more close collaboration between neoecologists and palaeoecologists, in the way towards the natural convergence of both into one single, time-independent, discipline as is (or should be) ecology. As this paper has been conceived for both neo- and palaeoecologists, the message is twofold: to neoecologists, care about time; to palaeoecologists, care about ecology.

Here we identified the thermal tolerances of 16 common ant species of the Northeastern United States and determined relationships between body size, desiccation, and thermal tolerance among species. We hypothesized that maximum heat tolerances of these species would differ and be related to body size and capacity to resist desiccation. We identified four distinct groups of species belonging to one of three subfamilies, Dolichoderinae, Formicinae, or Myrmicinae, with different maximum thermal tolerances. Group "a" had a mean thermal tolerance of approximately 43A degrees C (+/- 1A degrees C), group "b" had a mean thermal tolerance of 40A degrees C (+/- 1A degrees C), group "c" had a mean thermal tolerance of 38A degrees C (+/- 0A degrees C), and group "d" had a mean thermal tolerance of 36A degrees C (+/- 0A degrees C). Groups "a" and "d" consisted of a single species (in the subfamilies Myrmicinae and Formicinae, respectively), while groups "b" and "c" were a mix of species in the subfamilies Myrmicinae, Formicinae, and Dolichoderinae. In the subfamily Formicinae, thermal tolerance increased with body size and critical water content, a metric of desiccation tolerance. In contrast, in the subfamily Myrmicinae, higher thermal tolerance was correlated with intermediate body size and lower critical water content. These findings suggest that the two dominant subfamilies in Northeastern deciduous forests have different relationships between body size, capacity to tolerate desiccation, and thermal tolerances across species. This variation in thermal tolerance suggests that climatic change may impact species differently.

AB Livelihoods of people living in many protected areas (PAs) around the world are in conflict with biodiversity conservation. In Mexico, the decrees of creation of biosphere reserves state that rural communities with the right to use buffer zones must avoid deforestation and their land uses must become sustainable, a task which is not easily accomplished. The objectives of this paper are: (a) to analyze the conflict between people's livelihoods and ecosystem protection in the PAs of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas (SMC), paying special attention to the rates and causes of deforestation and (b) to review policy options to ensure forest and ecosystem conservation in these PAs, including the existing payments for environmental services system and improvements thereof as well as options for sustainable land management. We found that the three largest PAs in the SMC are still largely forested, and deforestation rates have decreased since 2000. Cases of forest conversion are located in specific zones and are related to agrarian and political conflicts as well as growing economic inequality and population numbers. These problems could cause an increase in forest loss in the near future. Payments for environmental services and access to carbon markets are identified as options to ensure forest permanence but still face problems. Challenges for the future are to integrate these incentive mechanisms with sustainable land management and a stronger involvement of land holders in conservation.

AB This paper uses data from a 2003 rural survey to examine the determinants of household provision of environmental services under China's Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP), the largest payments for environmental services program in the developing world. The paper examines the determinants of plot-level survival rates of program-planted trees and grasses. It finds that household rights over retired land as well as autonomy in program decision-making (which we argue on the basis of supportive evidence are plausibly exogenous to post-retirement outcomes) have important and potentially countervailing impacts on the provision of environmental services targeted by the program. Households permitted to select what to plant obtain better program outcomes, but do not make the choices that the government would like them to, while those permitted to decide what land to retire perform worse. The analysis also finds that households more vested and experienced in agriculture and with less exposure to off-farm labor markets fare better in managing their planted trees. Significant learning-by-doing effects are also evident, suggesting that greater technical support to farmers could improve outcomes and lower program costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Mbau forest covers much of the Congo, and shifts in its composition could have a large impact on the African tropics. The Ituri forest in east Congo is near a boundary between the monodominant mbau type and non-mbau mixed forest, and two 20-ha censuses of trees >= 1 cm diameter were carried out over 12 y to monitor forest change. Based on published diameter allometry, mbau forest had 535 Mg ha(-1) biomass above ground and gained 1.1 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). Mixed forest had 399 Mg ha(-1) and gained 3 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). The mbau tree (Gilbertiodendron dewevrei) increased its share of biomass from 4.1% to 4.4% in mixed forest; other common species also increased. Sapling density declined at both sites, likely because increased biomass meant shadier understorey, but the mbau tree increased in sapling density, suggesting it will become more important in the future. Tree mortality and growth rates were low relative to other tropical forests, especially in the mbau plots. Shifting toward G. dewevrei would represent a large gain in carbon in the mixed forest, but mbau is presently more important as a high-carbon stock: biomass lost during forest harvest could not recuperate for centuries due to slow community dynamics.

AB The main objectives were to study the effect of gap size and canopy openness on the natural regeneration dynamics considering the parameters of sapling growth, recruitment, mortality, density, species composition and above-ground biomass accumulation. The study was carried out in 32 artificial gaps with sizes varying from 100 to 1200 m(2) and canopy openness from 10 to 45%, from the second to the twelfth year after gap creation. The gap size was measured using the vertical projection of the tree crowns on the ground (Brokaw's definition), and the canopy openness measurement by hemispherical photography. In the first five years, mean sapling growth (0.54 cm year(-1)), mortality (3.9% year(-1)) and AGB (26.2 Mg ha(-1) or 8.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) were significantly higher in the gaps than in the forest understorey (0.17 cm year(-1), 1.5%year(-1) and 0.59 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) respectively) and positively correlated with gap size and canopy openness. In the same period, recruitment was also significantly higher in the gaps (5.8% year-1) than in the forest understorey (0.4% year(-1)) but decreased with gap size and negatively correlated with canopy openness. In the first five years, the relative density of pioneer species was higher in the gaps but not significantly correlated with gap size or canopy openness. AGB increased linearly since canopy opening, and twelve years after gap creation it was still higher in larger (121.2 Mg ha(-1) or 10.1 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) rather than smaller (62.5 ha(-1) or 5.2 ha(-1) year(-1)) gaps. Twelve years after gap creation there were no significant differences in the parameters of sapling growth, recruitment, and mortality which could be attributed to the original gap size and canopy openness.

AB The analysis of tree rings in the tropics is less straightforward than in temperate areas with a demarcated unfavourable winter season. But especially in mangroves, the highly dynamic intertidal environment and the overriding ecological drivers therein have been a reason for questioning the existence of growth rings. This study aimed at casting light on growth rings in mangroves. In six mangrove species growing in Gazi Bay, Kenya (Sonneratia alba, Heritiera littoralis, Ceriops tagal, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Xylocarpus granatum and Lumnitzera racemosa), the occurrence of growth rings was examined. Growth rate of each species was determined based on a 1-year period using the cambial marking technique. The effect of climate was furthermore considered by comparing the results with a number of wood samples originating from contrasting climatic regions. We can conclude that for growth rings to appear in mangroves more than one condition has to be fulfilled, making general statements impossible and explaining the prevalent uncertainty. Climatic conditions that result in a range of soil water salinity experienced over the year are a prerequisite for the formation of growth rings. For species with an anatomy characterized by indistinct ring boundaries, this should be combined with a growth rate of at least 0.3 mm/year. The use of growth rings for age or growth rate determinations should thus be evaluated on a case by case basis.

AB P>1. Many of the global losses of amphibians are believed to be caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Hence, determining its present and future environmental suitability should help to inform management and surveillance of this pathogen and curtail the amphibian biodiversity crisis.
   2. In this issue of Journal of Applied Ecology, Murray et al. (2010) offer an important step in this direction by providing a species distribution model that projects the environmental suitability of Bd across Australia and predicts locations of chytridiomycosis and amphibian declines. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis presence was predicted by diurnal temperature range (a measure of temperature variability) and mean precipitation. Human population density, a positive predictor of Bd, accounted for the most variation when removed from the statistical model.
   3. This work represents an invaluable case study and has great potential for managing chytridiomycosis and associated amphibian declines, but its value in practice will depend on how well managers understand the limitations of species distribution models.
   4.Synthesis and applications. To improve the management of chytridiomycosis, amphibian-chytrid research should attempt to understand how humans may affect the distribution of Bd, how climatic means and variances affect Bd transmission, how much variation in the distribution of Bd is unique to and shared among climate, human, and other factors, whether human-related factors and climate statistically interact, and how these potentially correlated factors and any interactions affect the predictability of species distribution models. In response to the swift spread of Bd and our rapidly changing planet, we encourage the application of Bd distribution models to other regions of the globe and predictions of Bd's distribution under future climate change scenarios.

AB Forest fragmentation can negatively affect tropical epiphyte diversity, but the processes leading to such impoverishment are insufficiently understood. Due to a lack of experimental studies, the relative influence of dispersal constraints vs. growth conditions remains particularly controversial. This paper addresses the fate of late juvenile and adult vascular epiphytes in response to severe forest disturbance in montane southern Ecuador. Plant growth and survival on trunks and lower branches of isolated remnant trees was studied for the first three years following clear-cutting. Overall epiphyte mortality was substantially increased on remnant trees (72% over 3 years) relative to undisturbed forest (11%). Mortality on remnant trees was higher during the first year (52%) than during the second (20%) and third year (26%). Pteridophytes and dicots suffered higher losses than monocots. Plants surviving on remnant trees generally showed a marked negative growth regarding maximum leaf length, whereas the annual increment in leaf number varied more strongly among taxa (families). The present study provides the first field-experimental evidence for the adverse effects of forest disturbance on the performance of later, well-established life stages of vascular epiphytes. The results suggest that growth conditions may often be a more important predictor of epiphyte diversity in disturbed habitats than dispersal constraints. Similar plant responses can be expected to occur along forest edges. Therefore, the retention of scattered green trees, narrow strips or small fragments of forest are unlikely to be sufficient management tools for the conservation of epiphyte diversity in tropical landscapes.

AB To assess the impact of habitat fragmentation on tropical avian communities, we sampled lowland forest birds on six land-bridge islands and two mainland forest sites in Lake Kenyir, Peninsular Malaysia using timed point counts, hypothesizing that insectivorous birds are the worst affected guild. We used an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the effects of area, isolation, primary dietary guild (omnivore, frugivore and insectivore) and their interactions in predicting species richness, abundance and diversity. Our analysis showed that a model that considered the effects of area, dietary guild and their interaction best explained observed patterns of species richness. But a model considering both area and dietary guild best explained the variation in abundance. Notably, insectivorous birds were singled out as the dietary guild most sensitive to fragmentation, followed by frugivorous and omnivorous birds and hence provide support for our hypothesis. Assemblages of insectivorous birds were clearly depauperate on anthropogenic forest islands in Lake Kenyir and are consistent with forest fragmentation studies in the Neotropics. Given their specialized foraging ecology and diversity, conservation of intact communities of insectivorous bird guilds in Malaysia will be critical for maintaining predator-prey interactions in lowland tropical forests.

AB P>1. We quantified production and consumption of stream-dwelling tadpoles and insect grazers in a headwater stream in the Panamanian uplands for 2 years to assess their effects on basal resources and energy fluxes. At the onset of our study, this region had healthy, diverse amphibian populations, but a catastrophic disease-driven decline began in September 2004, which greatly reduced amphibian populations.
   2. Insect grazer production was 348 mg ash-free dry mass (AFDM) m-2 year-1 during the first year of the study and increased slightly to 402 mg AFDM m-2 year-1 during the second year.
   3. Prior to amphibian declines, resource consumption by grazers (tadpoles and insects) was estimated at 2.9 g AFDM m-2 year-1 of algal primary production, which was nearly twice the estimated amount available. Insect grazers alone accounted for c. 81% of total primary consumption. During the initial stages of the declines, consumption remained at c. 2.9 g AFDM m-2 year-1, but only 35% of the available resource was being consumed and insect grazers accounted for c. 94% of total consumption.
   4. Production and resource consumption of some insect grazers increased during the second year, as tadpoles declined, indicating a potential for functional redundancy in this system. However, other insect grazer taxa declined or did not respond to tadpole losses, suggesting a potential for facilitation between tadpoles and some insects; differential responses among taxa resulted in the lack of a response by insect grazers as a whole.
   5. Our results suggest that before massive population declines, tadpoles exerted strong top-down control on algal production and interacted in a variety of ways with other primary consumers.
   6. As amphibian populations continue to decline around the globe, changes in the structure and function of freshwater habitats should be expected. Although our study was focused on tropical headwater streams, our results suggest that these losses of consumer diversity could influence other aquatic systems as well and may even reach to adjacent terrestrial environments.

AB Human-impacted forests are increasing in extent due to widespread regrowth of secondary forests on abandoned lands. The degree and speed of recovery from human disturbance in these forests will determine their value in terms of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem function. In areas subject to periodic, severe natural disturbances, such as hurricanes, it has been hypothesized that human and natural disturbance may interact to either erase or preserve land use legacies. To increase understanding of how interactions between human and natural disturbance influence forest regeneration and recovery, we monitored seedlings in a human-and hurricane-impacted forest in northeastern Puerto Rico over a; 10-yr period and compared seedling composition and dynamics in areas that had experienced high-and low-intensity human disturbance during the first half of the 20th century. We found that land use history significantly affected the composition and diversity of the seedling layer and altered patterns of canopy openness and seedling dynamics following hurricane disturbance. The area that had been subject to high-intensity land use supported a higher density, but lower diversity, of species. In both land use history categories, the seedling layer was dominated by the same two species, Prestoea acuminata var. montana and Guarea guidonia. However, seedlings of secondary-successional species tended to be more abundant in the high-intensity land use area, while late-successional species were more abundant in the low-intensity area, consistent with patterns of adult tree distributions. Seedlings of secondary-forest species showed greater increases in growth and survival following hurricane disturbance compared to late-successional species, providing support for the hypothesis that hurricanes help preserve the signature of land use history. However, the increased performance of secondary-forest species occurred predominantly in the low-intensity land use area, suggesting that hurricanes act to homogenize differences in species composition between areas with differing land use histories by increasing secondary-forest species regeneration in areas that experienced little direct human disturbance. Our results suggest that, through effects on seedling dynamics, hurricanes may extend the signature of land use history beyond the average recovery time of forests not subject to intense natural disturbance events.

AB The vertical distribution of the richness, abundance, and composition of epiphytic bryophytes was studied in a matrix of fragmented habitats in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest of the Murici Ecological Station (9A degrees 11'05aEuro(3)aEuro"9A degrees 16'48aEuro(3)A S, 35A degrees 45'20aEuro(3)aEuro"35A degrees 55'12aEuro(3)A W), northeastern Brazil. The aim was to compare the horizontal (between sites) and vertical (between phorophyte heights) turnover to test a hypothesis based on niche width vulnerability. There was a highly significant decreasing of richness accompanying the loss of habitat, and the most conserved fragment housed a total richness more than 10 times higher than the less conserved fragment. Epiphytes failed to colonize lower trunks (2.1-10 m) and higher zones in most of the non-conserved fragments; they were restricted to the base (0-2 m) and displayed a clear altered floristic composition. The species with restricted ecological amplitudes such as sun and shade tolerant taxa were more negatively affected by habitat loss than generalists. Although the mean richness of generalists decreased in non conserved fragments, the proportional contribution of this guild increased, proving that these taxa are the ones which persist in disturbed sites. The forest fragments capable of harboring rich epiphyte flora in the area studied are over 300 ha in size, which is far from being a common size among Brazilian Atlantic rainforest fragments. Hence, our results highlight the need of conserving the few large remnants in this ecosystem.

AB The Kyoto Protocol created a framework of responsibilities and mechanisms to mitigate climate change by reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. The Protocol stipulates accounting and reporting of GHG emissions and removals, such as energy use, industrial processes, agriculture, waste and net emissions resulting from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities. Emissions reported according to the rules set by the Kyoto Protocol do not include GHG emissions outside a country's boundaries resulting from the production of imported goods or services. As a result, GHG accounts constructed according to the Kyoto Protocol reflect the GHG emissions resulting from the production system of a country, but not all the emissions resulting from the consumption of goods and services within the country. However. as previous studies demonstrate, a country's emission balance changes remarkably if emissions related to goods or services imported and exported are taken into account. Here, we go beyond the aforementioned studies which mainly focus on GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion. We assess, in a first-order approach, upstream emissions that result from LULUC activities outside a country while the produced goods are consumed within the country. In our study we focus on Austria's livestock system to elucidate the difference between production and consumption-related emissions accounting approaches. We study direct and 'hidden' (embodied) GHG emissions associated with Austria's bilateral trade in livestock and livestock-related products, based on the integration of full carbon accounting (FCA) and life cycle analysis (LCA).

AB Dung beetles are a functionally important component of most terrestrial ecosystems. but communities change with habitat disturbance and deforestation. In this study, we tested if dung beetle ensembles on dung of introduced cattle and of the endemic anoa, a small buffalo. are affected differentially by habitat disturbance. Therefore, we exposed 10 pitfall traps, five baited with anoa and live baited with cattle dung, per site in six habitat types ranging from natural and selectively logged rain forest to three types of agroforestry system (characterized by different management intensity) and open areas (n = 4 replicate sites per habitat type) at the margin of Lore Lindu National Park. Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. We found 28 species. 43%, of which were endemic to Sulawesi. Species richness. abundance and biomass declined from natural forest towards open area. Large-bodied species appeared to be more sensitive to habitat disturbance and the ratio of large to small-sized dung beetles declined with land-use intensity. Although selectively logged forest and cocoa agroforestry systems had lower species richness compared with natural forest. they appeared to maintain it high portion of species originally inhabiting forest sites. The similarity of dung beetle ensembles recorded at forest and agroforestry sites reflects the high similarity of some habitat variables (e.g. vegetation structure and microclimate) between both habitat types compared with open areas. Species richness and abundances as well as species Composition, Which was characterized by decreases in mean body size. changed with land-use intensity. indicating that, dung type is less important than habitat type for determining ensemble structure of these Indonesian dung beetles.

AB The sampling efficiency of pitfall traps and Winkler litter extraction in northern deciduous forests was compared using ants. Both techniques are among the most common methods used to measure the diversity of organisms active on the forest floor. During 2005-2006, 90 Winkler and 180 pitfall trap samples from urban forest fragments in northeastern Ohio obtained 9,203 ants representing 31 species. Winklers captured all 31 species, whereas pitfall traps collected a total of 24 species. Winkler samples accumulated species more rapidly than did pitfall traps and had greater total species richness and higher abundance of ants recorded. Consistent with other studies, Winkler sampling was found to catch a greater number of smaller ants, whereas pitfall trapping caught a greater number of large-bodied ants. According to estimates of expected species richness, the combination of the two sampling techniques allowed for the collection of approximate to 90% of the ants expected in the surveyed area. Site variation had little effect on the inherent differences in sampling efficacy between the two methods. Either technique adequately collected samples for broad comparisons and documentation of the more typical and representative ant fauna, but Winkler extraction exhibited the advantage of a more complete inventory. The application of both techniques should be considered if the aims of a study require estimation of community properties, such as relative abundance.

AB Current ex situ collections of the wild rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis were gathered more than 25 years ago mainly from populations in Southwest Amazonia. Information regarding the structure of genetic diversity among these populations is fragmented and needs refinement. Having analyzed polymorphisms at 15 microsatellites loci throughout the Hevea genome, we report on the genetic diversity of 307 clonally propagated individuals from 19 different collection points. All analyzed loci were highly polymorphic, averaging 21.7 alleles per locus, and displayed heterozygote deficiency. Differentiation among populations was analyzed on a subsample of 220 individuals from 14 populations. The overall F (ST) is 0.12; although low, this value is significant and suggests moderate differentiation. Mato Grosso (Brazil) populations were genetically more distant from all other populations. A highly significant correlation between genetic and geographical distances over the whole area under study was shown by the Mantel test. The Bayesian algorithm used by STRUCTURE software allowed for the identification of three population clusters that match the boundaries of hydrographical basins of the main Amazon River tributaries. Differentiation among populations could therefore be jointly explained by both geographical location within the hydrographical Amazon network and by isolation by distance among populations belonging to distinct catchments. It is likely that some of these populations no longer exist due to severe deforestation. We provide suggestions to improve genetic resource management and sampling strategy in natural populations of H. brasiliensis.

AB The Afromontane forests of northern Ethiopia have been degraded and fragmented for centuries. Recently, efforts have been made to restore these forests by protecting them from livestock interference. In this study, the natural regeneration of Juniperus procera Hochst. ex Endl. and Olea europaea L. subsp cuspidata (Wall. ex G. Don) Cif. is investigated under protected conditions after 3 years of enclosure and under open management systems in a dry Afromontane forest in northern Ethiopia. Data on the floristic and structural compositions of the vascular plants were collected using 32 randomly selected plots (20 m 3 20 m), while nested plots (10 m 3 10 m) were used to investigate the seedling bank at the protected and adjacent open sites. The results reveal that there was a significantly higher regeneration of O. europaea on the protected site than on the open site (P = 0.01). However, there was no significant difference between the 2 sites for J. procera (P = 0.16). Thus, protecting the degraded forest in northern Ethiopia seems to be an appropriate management option for the regeneration of O. europaea. The regeneration status of J. procera at both sites is poor, which indicates that protecting the forest from livestock and human disturbance is unlikely to lead to regeneration of this species. Further investigation of other factors that hinder the regeneration of J. procera is therefore recommended.

AB Environmental features associated with the distribution of grass species are poorly known in tropical savannas, particularly at smaller spatial scales. The present study aimed to determine the relative influence of 11 environmental characteristics on grass-species composition in a savanna woodland in northern Australia. Environmental characteristics relating to woody-vegetation structure and soil, plus the long-term (14-year). re frequency, were documented along an environmental gradient and compared with grass-species composition. Differences in grass-species composition, as well as richness and evenness, were related to differences in vegetation structure and edaphic characteristics. In particular, grass-species composition was most strongly related to plant-available moisture, the density of woody plants in the midstorey (2.0-9.99 m height), and canopy and litter cover. Grass-species richness and evenness were extremely low in areas where midstorey density, canopy cover and litter cover were high, and where soil moisture content in the root zone of grasses was low. Differences in. re frequency also influenced grass-species composition, with areas that had experienced lower. re frequency during the previous 14 years having lower density of the annual grass Sorghum intrans (F. Muell. ex Benth.) and the perennial grass Heteropogon triticeus (R. Br.) Stapf, and increased dominance of the perennial Eriachne triseta Nees ex Steud. The results of the present study demonstrate a complex interplay between bottom-up environmental factors and top-down processes such as. re, as determinants of grass-species composition in tropical savannas.

AB To better understand the requirement of light and soil water conditions in the invasion sites of two invasive weeds, Mikania micrantha and Chromolaena odorata, we investigated their structural and physiological traits in response to nine combined treatments of light [full, medium and low irradiance (LI)] and soil water (full, medium and low field water content) conditions in three glasshouses. Under the same light conditions, most variables for both species did not vary significantly among different water treatments. Irrespective of water treatment, both species showed significant decreases in maximum light saturated photosynthetic rate (P (max)), photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency, and relative growth rate under LI relative to full irradiance; specific leaf area, however, increased significantly from full to LI though leaf area decreased significantly, indicating that limited light availability under extreme shade was the critical factor restricting the growth of both species. Our results also indicated that M. micrantha performed best under a high light and full soil water combination, while C. odorata was more efficient in growth under a high light and medium soil water combination.

   PREDATION; TREE; ESTABLISHMENT; DISTRIBUTIONS; CONSEQUENCES
AB The influence of keystone consumers on community structure is frequently context-dependent; the same species plays a central organising role in some situations, but not others. On Christmas Island, in the Indian Ocean, a single species of omnivorous land crab, Gecarcoidea natalis, dominates the forest floor across intact rainforest. We hypothesised that this consumer plays a key role in regulating seedling recruitment and in controlling litter dynamics on the island, independent of the type of vegetation in which it occurred. To test this hypothesis, we conducted crab exclusion experiments in two forest types on the island and followed the dynamics of seedling recruitment and litter processing for six years. To determine if these effects were likely to be general across the island, we compared land crab densities and seedling abundance and diversity at ten sites across island rainforest. Surveys across island rainforest showed that seedlings of species susceptible to predation by land crabs are consistently rare. Abundance and diversity of these species were negatively correlated to red crab abundance. Although red land crabs may be important determinants of seedling recruitment to the overstorey, differences in overstorey and seedling composition at the sites suggests that recruitment of vulnerable trees still occurs at a temporal scale exceeding that of this study. These "windows" of recruitment may be related to infrequent events that reduce the effects of land crabs. Our results suggest that unlike the context dependence of most keystone consumers in continental systems, a single consumer, the red land crab, consistently controls the dynamics of seedling recruitment across this island rainforest.

AB Plantations and secondary forests are becoming dominant components of many tropical forest landscapes. Yet we have an insufficient understanding of the value of these habitats for biodiversity conservation, and almost none for most anthropods in species-rich tropical forests. We sampled epigeie arachnids (Amblypygi, Araneae, Opiliones, Scorpiones, and Uropygi) in primary, secondary (14-19 years), and Eucalyptus plantation (4-5 years) forests in the Jari region of northeastern Brazilian Amazonia. We sampled five independent sites in each forest type between January and June 2005, collecting a total of 4824 individuals (31777 adults, 112 species), including 1864 adults (75 species) in Eucalyptus, 776 (60) in secondary forest, and 536 (72) in primary forest. We compared species richness, species-abundance distributions, and community structure, between the three forest types and identified the species that were characteristic of each forest type. Rarefaction analyses showed that undisturbed primary forest harbored significantly more species and a similar overall abundance as second-growth forest: while levels of species richness were similar between secondary forest and Eucalyptus. The species composition and abundance structure of arachnid assemblages was distinct in all three forest types. Considering all species sampled. 19% were only sampled in primary forest, 4% in secondary forest, and 19% in Eucalyptus. Most species sampled in plantation forests are known to be wide-randing habitat generalists. Our data indicate that regenerating forests are not biological deserts (57% and 56% of species sampled in primary forest were also captured in secondary and plantation forests respectively) and can, therefore, help mitigate some of the negative effects of deforestation for epigeic arachnids. However, these replacement habitats do not provide a substitute for primary forest and may fail to conserve many of those species most at risk from extinction.

AB Many theories of consumer control of communities have come from studies conducted in relatively benign, temperate zone rocky intertidal systems. Here, we examine gastropod grazing and the maintenance of bare space on a dry, wind-swept rocky shore of Patagonia, Argentina. Two limpet species are the primary intertidal grazers. Siphonaria lessoni dominates mid and high intertidal zones, while Nacella magellanica dominates the lower zone. In all zones, limpet densities are positively correlated with bare space and the occurrence of cracks. Tethering experiments revealed that: (1) physical stress sets the upper distribution limit of both limpets, (2) predators, such as oyster catchers, regulate Nacella populations and may restrict them to cracks and vertical surfaces, and (3) desiccation stress appears to drive similar crack distribution patterns of Siphonaria in the upper intertidal. Experimental removal of limpets in each intertidal zone indicated that limpets have: (1) no detectable effect in the high intertidal where physical forces dominate community organization, (2) weak impacts at mid-elevations as grazing only limited the abundance of fleshy algae with physical forces again dominating community structure, and (3) relatively stronger, but still weak impacts in the low zone. These results suggest that grazing impacts on Argentine rocky shores are weak in comparison to the physical stresses (e.g. high winds, low humidity) that largely determine structure in this system. The dominance of physical forcing in this system occurs despite having similar grazer densities to other temperate, but comparatively wet, rocky shorelines (e.g. British Isles) where top-down control is strong.

AB Question: Does overyielding of tree species mixtures in vertically strati. ed forests depend on complementary light use?
   Location: Andes of south-central Chile.
   Methods: Basal area data were obtained from 80 circular plots distributed regularly throughout old-growth stands with an emergent Nothofagus dombeyi tier over a canopy composed mainly of Laureliopsis philippiana and Saxegothaea conspicua. Radial growth was measured from cores obtained from trees at the centre of each plot. The effects of competition on growth were evaluated through a competition index (CI) based on distances to and diameters of the two nearest neighbours.
   Results: Overall, basal area of the canopy species was only weakly affected by the number of N. dombeyi per plot, and with basal area of N. dombeyi. However, the two main canopy species responded differently: whereas basal area of S. conspicua was negatively correlated with that of N. dombeyi, that of L. philippiana showed no response. Radial growth of S. conspicua was negatively correlated with CI calculated from canopy trees and more weakly so from emergent N. dombeyi. In contrast, radial growth of L. philippiana was not affected by competition with either canopy or emergent neighbours.
   Conclusions: Results indicate that emergent N. dombeyi tend to depress growth and basal area of S. conspicua, but not of the more shade-tolerant L. philippiana. This supports the proposal that enhancement of wood production in stratified mixtures will be greatest when component species have strongly contrasting light use traits.

AB The effect of three ant species (Lasius flavus, Formica spp., Tetramorium caespitum) on soil seed bank formation was studied in temperate mountain grassland. Seed removal experiments, analysis of soil seed content and seed survival experiments were carried out to evaluate the influence of ground ants on the seed fate. In the seed removal experiment seeds of 16 species, including 5 species with elaiosome-bearing seeds (myrmecochores), were exposed and their removal followed for 39 h. On average, ants removed 63.8% of myrmecochorous seeds and 10.9% of seeds without adaptation to ant dispersal. Analysis of soil seed content revealed that myrmecochores, in spite of expectations that they would accumulate in nests of seed dispersing ants, were most abundant in the soil of control plots. Evidence on seed relocation to the ant nests was obtained from a comparison of mounds of seed dispersing and seed non-dispersing ant species, as more seeds were found in the mounds of Formica spp. and Tetramorium caespitum (seed dispersers) in comparison with the mounds of Lasius favus (non-disperser).
   The soil seed bank of the compared microhabitats (control plots and mounds of 3 ant species) differed in their species composition, seed abundance and vertical distribution. The most distinct qualitative differences were between seed flora of control plots and mounds of Tetramorium caespitum. Control plots had approximately 30,000 propagules per m, which was double the number of seeds found in the ant mounds. In control plots, abundance and diversity of seeds steeply declined with depth; this trend was not observed in the mounds probably due to bioturbation. In the seed survival experiment, more seeds (2 out of 3 species) survived in control plots, which may also contribute to the higher seed abundance in this microhabitat.
   This study showed that seed relocation by ants does not contribute significantly to seed bank build-up at this study site. Ants may, however, increase the regeneration success of myrmecochores, mainly by dispersal for distance and placement in a larger spectrum of microsites, in contrast to species not adapted for myrmecochory.

AB This study was designed to evaluate the effect of interference and exploitation competition in shell partitioning between two hermit crab species (Pagurus criniticornis and Clibanarius antillensis). Field samples revealed that shells of the gastropod Cerithium atratum were the main resource used by both hermit crab species and that Pagurus used eroded or damaged shells in higher frequency than Clibanarius. The exploitative ability of each species was compared between species in the laboratory using dead gastropod (Cerithium) baits to simulate predation events and signalize newly available shells to hermit crabs. Pagurus reached the baits more rapidly than Clibanarius, but this higher exploitative ability did not explain shell utilization patterns in nature. Another experiment evaluated the dominance hierarchy between these two hermit crab species and revealed that Clibanarius was able to outcompete Pagurus for higher quality shells in agonistic encounters. This higher interference competitive ability of Clibanarius in relation to Pagurus may explain field observations. Nevertheless, Pagurus may be responsible to enhance shell availability to other hermit crab species that have lower ability to find and use newly available shells. Differently, the poorer condition of shells used by Pagurus, the higher ability of this species to attend gastropod predation events and its higher consumption rate by shell-breaking crabs (Menippe nodifrons) may increase its predation risks, thus revealing the disadvantages of such an exploitative competitive strategy for hermit crabs.

AB Plant colonization is essential to maintain diversity in fragmented ecosystems, but there is little experimental information on this process. We used experimental seed and seedling transplantation to evaluate the ability of the seed of tree species to become established in Southern Ontario forest fragments not containing the species. Carya cordiformis (Wang.) K. Koch, Betula alleghaniensis Britton, Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. and Juglans nigra L. were introduced into the interiors of (1) woodlots not containing members of their species (uncolonized woodlots), (2) woodlots containing conspecifics (colonized woodlots), and (3) well-illuminated sites at the edges of the uncolonized woodlots. With these data, we evaluated the probabilities of seedling colonization by the species and tested the predictions that survival rates are higher in uncolonized woodlots due to escape from host-specific predators and pathogens (Escape hypothesis), and colonization is promoted by seed arrival in well-illuminated sites at forest edges (Edge hypothesis). Both predictions were supported for a subset of the species, indicating two factors that may facilitate colonization. However, the influence of these factors occurred mainly after the second year of seedling establishment and overall survivorship was low due to high rates of mortality among seeds, germinating and first year seedlings. Probabilities of fourth year seedling establishment in uncolonized woodlots were <1% of incoming seed for three of the four species. Successful colonization of these species will depend on relatively large seed inputs to fragments. A previous study indicated that dispersal to and establishment in fragments >150-175 m from a seed source occurs at a rate of less than I seedling/ha over a 4-11-year period. Therefore, management intervention such as seedling transplantation may be necessary to maintain eastern deciduous tree species in fragmented forests. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Our study aimed at identifying mechanisms that permit the long-term persistence of Sarcopoterium spinosum, a dwarf-shrub that dominates large areas of hilly landscape in eastern Mediterranean countries. Data were obtained from 16 1x 1 m quadrats distributed among well-established S. spinosum communities in Israel that had not been burned or otherwise disturbed for well over 20 years. We sampled three communities that represent different climatic and habitat conditions and analysed the growth rings in the root crowns of 604 uprooted plants, to determine the age structures of the sampled stands. Many older 'shrubs' that appeared to be individual plants were in fact clusters of ramets with their root crowns concentrated in a very small area. The morphology of these ramets indicates that they arose by rooting of peripheral stems. Seedlings and young plants were rare. Ramets seldom exceeded 17 years of age, although a few were 18-21 years old and one had 34 growth rings. The average ramet age on the different sites varied between 9 and 11 years. The ramets appeared to separate from the mother plant when they were older than 7 years, after which they had an estimated average half-life of ca. 2.8 years. Young shrubs grew rapidly in height, but their basal cover was low; it increased when they were much older, presumably as the older plants died. Consequently, three or four cohorts of older ramets between 12 and 17 years old often dominated stand cover. The continuing profuse production of seeds even where seedling recruitment is normally rare could be related to the relatively short average life-span of the ramets. We conclude that where resources are irregularly distributed and establishment sites are fully occupied by perennial species, localised phalanx-type clonal proliferation can reduce the risk of genet extinction. On favourable sites this strategy confers upon S. spinosum genets the tenacity required to hold off replacement by other species and to dominate large areas of the landscape for much longer than the average life span of individual ramets.

We present the first quantitative estimates of extinction rate in a complete Neotropical flora based on historical plant-collection records, quantitative measurements of forest loss and plant diversity, and the conservation status of endemic plant species in Ecuador. Our analyses suggest that 19-46 endemic plant species have gone extinct in Ecuador over the last 250 years, mostly because of habitat loss, and therefore are now globally extinct. An additional 282 species, nearly 7% of Ecuador's endemic flora, qualify as critically endangered. We found evidence of impending large-scale plant extinctions in the country's coastal and Andean forests, but little extinction and low potential for extinction in the Amazonian lowlands.

TI Illicit crops and bird conservation priorities in Colombia
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DIVERSITY; HOTSPOTS
AB Over the last 5 years the amount of land in Colombia planted in illicit crops, such as coca and poppy, has grown an average of 21% per year and may account for half the total area deforested in 1998. I conducted a geographic analysis of the distribution of illicit crops relative to standing forests and areas of conservation priority for birds. Municipalities where illicit crops have been detected were overlaid on a forest-cover map of Colombia and two types of conservation priorities for birds were plotted: distributions of threatened species and minimum-area sets for conservation of all species. The sites of the highest conservation priority affected by illicit crops were in the southern Andes, the northern West Andes and adjacent Darien lowlands, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Serrania del Perija, and the Serrania de San Lucas. The largest forested areas threatened by illicit crops were in Amazonia and the Amazonian foothills of the East Andes, sites of low conservation priority. Given current trends in the expansion of illicit crops and the narrow endemicity of some bird species, the conversion of forests for illicit-crop cultivation may result in the extirpation of several bird species from affected regions. To impede this, those involved in illicit-crop eradication and alternative development should give high priority to the protection of existing forest reserves and parks from the planting of illicit crops. Such efforts should also extend to areas proposed for conservation based on the diversity of threatened and endemic birds that are currently unprotected. The conservation of threatened and endemic birds in Colombian forests may hinge on successfully curbing incentives for deforestation, including the international trade in illicit drugs.

AB The seed dispersal system formed by the fleshy-fruited shrub Viburnum tinus L. (Caprifoliaceae) and the bird Erithacus rubecula L. is known to occur in both the Mediterranean basin and the laurel forest of the Canary Islands. The latter is invaded by the ship rat Rattus rattus L. This situation allows (1) the comparison of oceanic island and mainland situations for the bird-plant interaction, and (2) quantification of the possible effects of an invading species on the plant, and thus on the whole seed dispersal system. Fruit removal by birds and rats was studied for V. tinus in a laurel forest of Tenerife during a fruiting season to assess patterns of disperser and predator's use of the plant. Fruits were persistent in time and spontaneous fruit loss rate was low. It was exploited by a reduced frugivorous community. Its fruits were dispersed almost exclusively by E. rubecula at extremely low rates, whereas R. rattus rapidly predated the bulk of the crops. Fruit removal by E. rubecula was influenced by vegetation structure and fruit crop size ( higher removal rates from gaps or sparse and low canopy patches, and from larger fruit displays). Fruit predation by R. rattus was not related to microhabitat or individual plant traits. Fruit removal by R. rattus had no apparent influence on the pattern of bird frugivory. However, later in the fruiting season, heavy fruit depletion by rats restrained fruit availability for birds. The mainland (Mediterranean) V. tinus-E. rubecula dispersal system is strikingly different from this island counterpart in: (1) the virtual irrelevance of rodent seed predation, and (2) the comparatively high incidence of bird frugivory by the exclusive seed disperser, E. rubecula.

AB Regeneration of the dominant ectomycorrhizal tree Microberlinia bisulcata in groves in Korup, Central Africa, is very poor. The hypothesis was tested that this species is more shade intolerant than other co-occurring species.
   In two 1-yr trials, each with M. bisulcata and four other species at a nursery close to Korup, growth was measured under five PAR levels, with +/- added P and +/- watering in the dry season. In parallel experiments the effects of PAR with two R : FR ratios were investigated.
   Increasing PAR had a consistent effect on the rates of increase in plant mass and on changes in the other variables. Doubling soil P, watering and halving the R : FR ratio had almost no effect. However, across species, mass at low PAR and relative growth rate related positively and negatively, respectively, to seed mass.
   One contributing factor for the poor recruitment of M. bisulcata is therefore its low survival and slow growth at low PAR, due to its small seed size. The two codominant ectomycorrhizal grove species of Tetraberlinia, with larger seeds, were less affected by low PAR. (C) New Phytologist (2001) 151: 271-289.

AB Remedies for reduction in primate numbers following rainforest habitat disturbance must incorporate understanding of how disturbance affects population biology. Between July 1996 and July 1998, I captured 31 adult male grey cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) from groups occupying logged and unlogged forest in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Captured males were weighed, measured, fitted with radiocollars, and radiotracked three to five times a week. Males from groups in the unlogged forest were significantly heavier then males from the logged forest. Males that immigrated into the study groups were significantly lighter than resident males in unlogged forest, but they did not differ in mass from males in logged forest. I tested hypotheses that these differences were due to differences in age, skeletal size, and tissue mass. Results support the hypothesis that differences are due to differences in tissue mass. Results of further tests showed that differences in tissue mass were explained more by differences in habitat type than by rates of male turnover. There was no evidence to suggest that the differences in tissue mass were related to differences in costs of travel, crowding, or seasonal variation in habitat quality. My results suggest that selective logging may affect primate biomass, although these changes may or may not be reflected in estimates of primate density.

AB Evidence is presented for the importance of western lowland gorillas as seed dispersers in the Lope Reserve, Gabon. The survival and growth of seedlings of three tree species, growing from dung deposited at gorilla nest sites, were monitored for up to 2 y after deposition. A comparison was made between this and seeds (i) deposited in dung on gorilla feeding trails, (ii) dropped (spat out) under conspecific canopies, and (iii) scatter-dispersed (spat out) by other consumers away from conspecific trees but under intact forest canopy. The highest survival and the best performance of seedlings was always at a gorilla nest site, although not every site was favourable for survival or growth. Seedling performance was related to the surrounding vegetation conditions: better performance was observed in seedling clumps with less vegetation cover. Gorillas at Lope apparently provide high quality seed dispersal for these species, not just because they consume large quantities of seeds, but because the pattern of seed deposition, especially in nest sites, can result in the enhanced survival and growth of seedlings.

AB The roles of physical factors and herbivory in structuring the early development of algal assemblages were investigated on a seasonal, tropical rocky shore in Hong Kong. Physical stress was manipulated by irrigating areas with filtered seawater, whilst herbivore access was controlled using fences. Algal colonisation was monitored at 2 tidal heights (high- and lowshore), once in the cool and dry season and once in the hot and wet season. Dry areas were only colonised in the lowshore and, even when herbivores were excluded, dry highshore areas never developed a macroalgal cover. Algal assemblages did, however, develop in highshore irrigated areas, where, in the presence of herbivores, encrusting algae (e.g. Hapalospongidion gelatinosum and coralline crusts) developed. In areas excluding herbivores, ephemeral erect algae (e.g. Ulva spp.) developed. All lowshore treatments developed algal assemblages. In the hot season, after an initial phase of erect algae, encrusting algae developed where herbivores had access, whereas, in the cool season, erect Corallina spp, dominated these treatments. In herbivore exclusions, erect ephemeral algae developed in the hot season with a sparse cover of encrusting algae (Ralfsia expansa and coralline crusts) whilst, in the cool season, a cover of Corallina spp, and erect ephemeral algae became abundant. When irrigation was terminated, erect algal cover decreased dramatically in each season in the highshore, although encrusting algae persisted at reduced cover. In lowshore areas, algal cover decreased marginally when irrigation was terminated and only during the hot season. The timing (i.e, hot or cool season) of liberation of rock space was, therefore, important for the development of algal assemblages. In lowshore areas, assemblages dominated by encrusting algae typical of rocky shores in Hong Kong developed only in the presence of herbivores and only during the hot season. During the cool season, Corallina spp. became dominant, while exclusion of herbivores (during either season) resulted in the development of ephemeral, erect algal assemblages.

AB Gastropod recycling at a rocky intertidal flat in the Northern Bay of Safaga (Red Sea, Egypt) is a process of increasing encrustation, changing secondary inhabitants, and probably decreasing shell strength. Encrustation by coralline red algae starts in the living gastropods, with the aperture area staying free of epigrowth. The dead gastropod shells are colonized by hermit crabs, tend to be more heavily encrusted and show encrustation of the aperture. This justifies the description 'pagurized' and the conclusion that coralline red algae produce the same pagurization features as predominantly suspension-feeding invertebrates. After the shells are abandoned by inhabitants that carry them around, further growth of coralline algae leads to rhodoliths, which are sometimes colonized by stomatopods. Secondary inhabitants therefore influence not only the taphocoenoses of gastropods but also the formation of rhodoliths.

AB A multi-scaled forest model (ZELIG) which spatially embeds patch-scale processes into a larger landscape was linked with a 3-D insolation routine to simulate the effects of latitudinal variation in solar radiation on the growth and spatial patterns of idealized early successional, shade-intolerant and late successional, shade-tolerant species. At the individual tree level, average tree height increased for the shade-intolerant species with decreasing latitude as steep angled direct-beam radiation more readily penetrated narrow canopy gaps. This yielded an increase in interspecific competition and intraspecific competition among shade-intolerant trees. Consequently, though stem density dropped, basal area of shade-intolerant species increased as growth increased with decreasing latitude. Conversely, basal area for the shade-tolerant species increased with increasing latitude as stem density increased as the proportion of diffuse radiation increased.
   In terms of spatial pattern, the combined models produced non-random, anisotropic patterns which changed over the course of succession and were different for the shade-intolerant and tolerant species. However, differences in spatial patterns for the tropical, temperate, and boreal solar regimes were inexplicable. Shade-tolerant species consistently exhibited negative autocorrelation on adjacent grid cells (10-20 m away) during early successional stages and later stages after species replacement. Auto-correlation of shade-intolerant species shifted from negative to positive at this scale as its role changed from canopy dominant to gap colonizer. At scales > 20 m, whether or not a specific direction/distance autocorrelation value was positive or negative and significant or not significant was highly variable for both species and was attributed to stochastic properties (i.e., birth and mortality) of the model.

AB Orientation of the striped legged hermit crab Clibanarius vittatus (Bosc) to black horizontal areas of different sizes was studied in a circular arena. Crabs were tested either in the presence or absence of chemicals that signal the potential availability of a gastropod shell. The chemical cue was generated by freezing and thawing muscle tissue from the gastropod Busycon carica Gmelin. Upon pre-experimental exposure to the chemical cue, crabs could be differentiated into two categories: those showing investigative interest in gastropod shells (Investigating), and those with no evident interest (Non-Investigating). The chemicals stimulated increased activity in the Investigating groups but not in the Non-Investigating groups. Clibanarius vittatus exhibited a uniform circular distribution when exposed to an all white horizon, independently of the presence of the chemical cue. Both crab categories showed little interest in black sectors subtending angles of 5, 10, 20 and 30-degrees when the chemical cue was not present in the experimental arena. However, Investigating crabs were attracted to these sectors in the presence of the chemical cue. This response ceased once the dark sector exceeded almost-equal-to 40-degrees in size and both groups showed an avoidance response, with increasing number of crabs moving towards the white section of the arena as the dark sector increased in size. The attraction towards the small black sectors was interpreted as a shell investigating response, for which the visual cue seems to be activated by the chemical cue. The avoidance of increasingly larger black sectors was interpreted as predator avoidance reaction, which was not affected by the chemical cue. These interpretations were verified as Investigating crabs were attracted to a gastropod shell and both groups generally avoided a large blue crab.

AB Deforestation causes diverse and profound consequences for the environment and species. Direct or indirect effects can be related to climate change, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, floods, landslides, etc. As such a significant process, timely and continuous monitoring of forest dynamics is important, to constantly follow existing policies and develop new mitigation measures. The present work had the aim of mapping and monitoring the forest change from 2000 to 2019 and of simulating the future forest development of a rainforest region located in the Para state, Brazil. The land cover dynamics were mapped at five-year intervals based on a supervised classification model deployed on the cloud processing platform Google Earth Engine. Besides the benefits of reduced computational time, the service is coupled with a vast data catalogue providing useful access to global products, such as multispectral images of the missions Landsat five, seven, eight and Sentinel-2. The validation procedures were done through photointerpretation of high-resolution panchromatic images obtained from CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite). The more than satisfactory results allowed an estimation of peak deforestation rates for the period 2000-2006; for the period 2006-2015, a significant decrease and stabilization, followed by a slight increase till 2019. Based on the derived trends a forest dynamics was simulated for the period 2019-2028, estimating a decrease in the deforestation rate. These results demonstrate that such a fusion of satellite observations, machine learning, and cloud processing, benefits the analysis of the forest dynamics and can provide useful information for the development of forest policies.

AB Soil aggregation and its effects on soil C storage have been addressed in thousands of research articles over the last 40 years. Research has been mostly focused on the resistance of aggregates to mechanical disruption and the role of organic matter in aggregate stabilization. On the other hand, relatively little attention has been paid to identifying the microbial, plant root and macro-invertebrate actors and physical processes that continuously create and destroy aggregates. The sum and dynamics of these processes determines the ability of soils to store and conserve C. Understanding the interactions between aggregation dynamics and C transformations in soils therefore requires a precise identification of the agents that produce aggregates and knowledge of the rates of formation and persistence in the pools thus identified.
   We propose to separate macro-aggregated components of different, physicogenic and biogenic origins from non-macro-aggregated soil on a morphological basis, using a simple visual technique. The specific biological or physico-chemical agent which produced each individual macro-aggregate can then be determined using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). A general description of the distribution and quality of organic matter among the different groups of macro-aggregates can be made. Simple soil re-aggregation or dis-aggregation tests conducted in field conditions further measure the production of different macro-aggregates with time and their mean residence times in the studied soil. Respirometry measurements on each recognized category of macro-aggregates evaluate the respective C losses through respiration. The methods described here will allow the dominant pathways of C flow at a given site to be characterized and possible management options to increase C storage identified. We finally discuss the different assumptions made to build this simple model and offer ways to test the methodology under field conditions.

AB Whereas most work to understand impacts of humans on biodiversity on coastal areas has focused on large, conspicuous organisms, we highlight effects of tourist access on the diversity of microscopic marine animals (meiofauna). We used a DNA metabarcoding approach with an iterative and phylogeny-based approach for the taxonomic assignment of meiofauna and relate diversity patterns to the numbers of tourists accessing sandy beaches on an otherwise un-impacted island National Park. Tourist frequentation, independently of differences in sediment granulometry, beach length, and other potential confounding factors, affected meiofaunal diversity in the shallow "swash" zone right at the mean water mark; the impacts declined with water depth (up to 2 m). The indicated negative effect on meiofauna may have a consequence on all the biota including the higher trophic levels. Thus, we claim that it is important to consider restricting access to beaches in touristic areas, in order to preserve biodiversity.
   Martinez et al. use DNA metabarcoding and a phylogeny-based approach to demonstrate the effects of tourist access on meiofauna diversity of beaches in Asinara National Park. Their results show that tourist frequentation decreases meiofaunal diversity at the shallow "swash" zone, and can be used to inform tourist access and management of beaches.

AB Less than half of the original two million square kilometers of the Cerrado vegetation remains standing, and there are still many uncertainties as to how to conserve and prioritize remaining areas effectively. A key limitation is the continuing lack of geographically-extensive evaluation of ecosystem-level properties across the biome. Here we sought to address this gap by comparing the woody vegetation of the typical cerrado of the Cerrado-Amazonia Transition with that of the core area of the Cerrado in terms of both tree diversity and vegetation biomass. We used 21 one-hectare plots in the transition and 18 in the core to compare key structural parameters (tree height, basal area, and above-ground biomass), and diversity metrics between the regions. We also evaluated the effects of temperature and precipitation on biomass, as well as explored the species diversity versus biomass relationship. We found, for the first time, both that the typical cerrado at the transition holds substantially more biomass than at the core, and that higher temperature and greater precipitation can explain this difference. By contrast, plot-level alpha diversity was almost identical in the two regions. Finally, contrary to some theoretical expectations, we found no positive relationship between species diversity and biomass for the Cerrado woody vegetation. This has implications for the development of effective conservation measures, given that areas with high biomass and importance for the compensation of greenhouse gas emissions are often not those with the greatest diversity.

AB Persistent ecological and socio-economic impacts from the expansion of industrial monocultures in the tropics have raised land use sustainability to the top of the environmental policy agenda. As major crops such as soy continue to experience growing market demand and threaten both natural ecosystems and traditional populations, a number of multi-stakeholder governance initiatives have been established around agricultural commodity chains or key landscapes. Effectiveness in curbing unsustainable land use, however, remains limited. In this context, innovative initiatives have blurred the lines to combine both supply chain and landscape governance. We analyze such arrangements-here conceptualized as commodity-centric landscape governance (CCLG)-with an in-depth case study of the Cerrado Working Group, a multi-stakeholder initiative led by civil society and the soy agribusiness to address land use change in that savanna landscape in Brazil. The paper examines how that initiative has come about, its agenda, as well as usually underexposed political dimensions using agenda-setting theory. The research is based on extensive fieldwork in Brazil, with data collected through document analysis and 56 key-informant interviews. The findings suggest that a sustainable development agenda for the Cerrado has been substantially narrowed to become mostly one of conversion-free soy supply, serving more the interests of that agroindustry and its consumers than those of the landscape's most vulnerable stakeholders, such as local communities. While the Cerrado Working Group has importantly broadened the policy scope beyond commodity certification, its limited inclusiveness and a skewed agenda have led to instruments that target only soy farmers as beneficiaries. We conclude that, although effective for targeting conversion drivers, CCLG can crystallize and reinforce existing land use patterns by granting disproportionate power to dominant stakeholders, thus limiting the agenda to incremental changes. As a consequence, distant demand-side actors may exert greater governance authority than the landscape's own population. If embodying norms of inclusiveness and equitable participation, CCLG may serve as an entry point, but it does not per se replace inclusive land-use planning and integrated landscape governance.

AB Although savannas are fire-adapted ecosystems, prescribing fire for biodiversity conservation remains controversial at least in some regions where savannas occur. Faced with uncertainty, many decision makers and even scientists are still reluctant to prescribe fire for conservation purposes in fire-prone ecosystems, invoking the precautionary principle. Knowledge gaps on the ideal fire regime, such as how and when to burn, and especially the fear of biodiversity losses, are among the main arguments against fire management applied to remnants of native savanna vegetation. To inform this debate, we assessed the impact of prescribed fires on diversity of plants (different growth forms), ants, frogs, lizards, birds, and small mammals, in savannas and grasslands of the Brazilian Cerrado. We assessed the existing species richness, composition, and abundance in areas subjected to long periods of fire suppression and compared to that observed over a short period after prescribed dry-season fires, within each group of plants and animals. Whenever possible, we carried out separate analyses for grassland and savanna. Burning did not significantly reduce species richness of any of the groups analyzed, but had a positive effect on richness of graminoids in grassland. When analyzed at the species level, abundance of most animal groups did not show consistent responses to fire, except for a decrease in some frog populations in grasslands. Forbs, graminoids, and subshrubs increased in abundance after fire in grassland areas, though in savanna areas, abundance of forbs, and subshrubs tended to decline after fire. Species composition changed little in response to fire as indicated by low levels of dissimilarity between burned and unburned areas. These results confirm the high resilience of Cerrado biota to fire, as expected for savanna ecosystems in general. Besides, we demonstrate here that the risk of biodiversity losses cannot justify the objections to the use of prescribed fire for conservation purposes in the Cerrado.

AB Clearance and perturbation of Amazonian forests are one of the greatest threats to tropical biodiversity conservation of our times. A better understanding of how soil communities respond to Amazonian deforestation is crucially needed to inform policy interventions that effectively protect biodiversity and the essential ecosystem services it provides. We assessed the impact of deforestation and ecosystem conversion to arable land on Amazonian soil biodiversity through a meta-analysis. We analyzed 274 pairwise comparisons of soil biodiversity in Amazonian primary forests and sites under different stages of deforestation and land-use conversion: disturbed (wildfire and selective logging) and slash-and-burnt forests, pastures, and cropping systems. Overall, 60% and 51% of responses of soil macrofauna and microbial community attributes (i.e., abundance, biomass, richness, and diversity indexes) to deforestation were negative, respectively. We found few studies on mesofauna (e.g., microarthropods) and microfauna (e.g., protozoa and nematodes), so those groups could not be analyzed. Macrofauna abundance and biomass were more vulnerable to the displacement of forests by pastures than by agricultural fields, whereas microbes showed the opposite pattern. Effects of Amazonian deforestation on macrofauna were more detrimental at sites with mean annual precipitation >1900 mm, and higher losses of microbes occurred in highly acidic soils (pH < 4.5). Limited geographic coverage, omission of meso- and microfauna, and low taxonomic resolution were main factors impairing generalizations from the data set. Few studies assessed the impacts of within-forest disturbance (wildfires and selective logging) on soil species in Amazonia, where logging operations rapidly expand across public lands and more frequent severe dry seasons are increasing the prevalence of wildfires.

AB Like all interactions, the success of cross-discipline collaborations relies on effective communication. Ecology offers theoretical frameworks and lexicons to study microbiomes. Yet some of the terms and concepts borrowed from ecology are being used discordantly by microbiome studies from their traditional definitions. Here we define some of the ecological terms and concepts as they are used in ecology and the study of microbiomes. Where applicable, we have provided the historical context of the terms, highlighted examples from microbiome studies, and considered the research methods involved. We divided these concepts into four sections: Biomes, Diversity, Symbiosis, and Succession. Biomes encompass the interactions within the biotic and abiotic features of an environment. This extends to the term "microbiome," derived from "biome," and includes an environment and all the microbes within it. Diversity encompasses patterns of species richness, abundance, and biogeography, all of which are important to understanding the distribution of microbiomes. Symbiosis emphasizes the relationships between organisms within a community. Symbioses are often misunderstood to be synonymous with mutualism. We discard that implication, in favor of a broader, more historically accurate definition which spans the continuum from parasitism to mutualism. Succession includes classical succession, alternative stable states, community assembly frameworks, and r/K-selection. Our hope is that as microbiome researchers continue to apply ecological terms, and as ecologists continue to gain interest in microbiomes, each will do so in a way that enables cross-talk between them. We recommend initiating these collaborations by using a common lexicon, from which new concepts can emerge.

AB The frequency and intensity of drought events have increased during the recent decades, particularly in the tropics. Yet, the growth and physiological responses of many tropical tree species to drought are still inadequately understood. We studied the drought resilience of two functionally different canopy tree species (Chukrasia tabularis and Toone ciliate) from a moist tropical forest in Bangladesh during two extreme drought events (1984 and 1999). We quantified four resilience components (resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience) of both species to infer drought tolerance of selected trees. Tree radial growth dropped by 44-56% in the drought years, varying with species and drought events. Two species showed no differences in their drought resistance during any of the drought events. However, C. tabularis showed higher recovery and resilience than T. ciliate after the 1999 drought event. T. ciliate showed higher resilience after the 1984 drought event. Linear mixed effect model (LMEM) revealed that growth rates in the two years before and after the drought events had a dominant role in drought responses over tree age, height, diameter, basal area increment and crown exposure, although crown exposure had significant influence on the resistance and the resilience of light demanding T. ciliate. We conclude that diffuse porous and intermediate shade tolerant C. tabularis is more drought tolerant than the ring-porous and light demanding T. ciliate. Since both study species are widely used as plantation species throughout the tropics, our results have important implications for forest managers to take decision on species suitability for plantation programs and to adopt forest management to future climate change conditions.

AB Microclimate within forests influences ecosystem fluxes and demographic rates. Anthropogenic disturbances, such as selective logging can affect within-forest microclimate through effects on forest structure, leading to indirect effects on forests beyond the immediate impact of logging. However, the scope and predictability of these effects remains poorly understood. Here we use a microclimate thermal proxy (sensitive to radiative, convective, and conductive heat fluxes) measured at the forest floor in three 1-ha forest plots spanning a logging intensity gradient in Malaysian Borneo. We show (1) that thermal proxy ranges and spatiotemporal heterogeneity are doubled between old growth and heavily logged forests, with extremes often exceeding 45 degrees C, (2) that nearby weather station air temperatures provide estimates of maximum thermal proxy values that are biased down by 5-10 degrees C, and (3) that lower canopy density, higher canopy height, and higher biomass removal are associated with higher maximum temperatures. Thus, logged forests are less buffered from regional climate change than old growth forests, and experience much higher microclimate extremes and heterogeneity. Better predicting the linkages between regional climate and its effects on within-forest microclimate will be critical for understanding the wide range of conditions experienced within tropical forests.

AB Functional traits and functional diversity measures are increasingly being used to examine land use effects on biodiversity and community assembly rules. Morphological traits are often used directly as functional traits. However, behavioral characteristics are more difficult to measure. Establishing methods to derive behavioral traits from morphological measurements is necessary to facilitate their inclusion in functional diversity analyses. We collected morphometric data from over 1,700 individuals of 12 species of dung beetle to establish whether morphological measurements can be used as predictors of behavioral traits. We also compared morphology among individuals collected from different land uses (primary forest, logged forest, and oil palm plantation) to identify whether intraspecific differences in morphology vary among land use types. We show that leg and eye measurements can be used to predict dung beetle nesting behavior and period of activity and we used this information to confirm the previously unresolved nesting behavior for Synapsis ritsemae. We found intraspecific differences in morphological traits across different land use types. Phenotypic plasticity was found for traits associated with dispersal (wing aspect ratio and wing loading) and reproductive capacity (abdomen size). The ability to predict behavioral functional traits from morphology is useful where the behavior of individuals cannot be directly observed, especially in tropical environments where the ecology of many species is poorly understood. In addition, we provide evidence that land use change can cause phenotypic plasticity in tropical dung beetle species. Our results reinforce recent calls for intraspecific variation in traits to receive more attention within community ecology.

AB Ants accumulate heavy metals and respond to pollution with modification in species composition, community structure, altered behaviour and immunity. However, the levels of heavy metals in ants' nests and explicit individual-level responses towards heavy metals have not been revealed. We found that red wood ants Formica lugubris accumulate high and correlated values of such heavy metals as Al, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn both in ants and nest material near cobalt smelter in Finland. Relative differences in metal concentrations were higher in nests than in ants. The highest values were obtained for elements such as Co (36.6), Zn (14.9), Cd (9.7), Pb (8.5), Cu (7.4), Ni (6.4), As (4.7), Cr (2.9) and Fe (2.4) in nest material, and Co (32.7), Cd (6.3), Pb (6), Fe (2.8), Ni (2.9) and Zn (2.1) in ants. In industrial and reference areas, ants have no differences in size, but differed in dry and residual body mass. In polluted areas, E lugubris had less melanised heads, but not thoraxes. The sensitivity of cuticular colouration in red wood ants subjected to heavy metal pollution might be related to metal-binding properties of melanins. The overall results are useful for the improvement of biomonitoring techniques using ants as indicators of industrial contamination and for further discovery of novel ecotoxicological biomarkers.

AB The composition of the soil microbiome is influenced by environmental (abiotic) variables and biological interactions (biotic factors). To determine whether the aboveground vegetation and soil physicochemical properties were the main determinant of beta-diversity and biological interaction of soil microbial community, we sampled soils from the temperate coniferous forest and grassland. Clustering of operational taxonomic units was conducted using 16S rRNA gene. We found that the microbial composition of the rhizospheres, in which root exudates influence the microbial environment, show lower alpha-diversity than that of nonroot soils. The nonsignificant rhizosphere effect suggested other undetermined factors or stochastic processes accounted for microbial diversity in the rhizosphere. More significant microbe-microbe interactions were observed in forest and rhizosphere soils relative to the grassland soils. The elevated number of positive correlations for relative abundances in forest soil implied beneficial associations being common among bacteria, in particular within the rhizosphere environment. The particular soil properties generated by root exudates also alter the physicochemical properties of soil such as K and pH value, and might in turn favor the adoption of teamwork-cooperation strategies for microbe-microbe interactions, represented as large clusters of positive associations among bacterial taxa. Specific biological interactions differentiated the microbiomes within forest soils. Thus, the environmental selection pressure of aboveground vegetation accounts for differences between soil microbiomes while biotic factors are responsible for fine-scale differences of the microbial community in forest soils.

AB Fire has shaped plant evolution and biogeochemical cycles for millions of years in savanna ecosystems, but changes in natural fire regimes promoted by human land use threaten contemporary conservation efforts. In protected areas in the Brazilian savannas (Cerrado), the predominant management policy is fire suppression, reflecting a cultural heritage which considers that fire always has a negative impact on biodiversity. Here we compare resultant fire-regimes in Canastra National Park (CNP), southeast Brazil, associated with areas under and without fire suppression management, based on a 16-year Landsat imagery record. In open grasslands of the Canastra plateau (CP), firefighting is undertaken under government-sanctioned regulation, whereas in the Babilonia sector, non-sanctioned fire management is undertaken by small farmers to promote cattle grazing and cropping. Fire regimes in the Canastra sector are characterized by few, very large, late dry season wildfires recurring at intervals of two years. Fire regimes in lowlands of the Babilonia sector are characterized by many small-scale, starting at the beginning of the dry season (EDS). In Babilonia uplands fire regimes are characterized by higher frequencies of large fires. The study illustrates major challenges for managing fire-prone areas in conflict-of interest regions. We suggest that management planning in CNP needs to effectively address: i) managing conflicts between CNP managers and local communities; and ii) fire management practices in order to achieve more ecologically sustainable fire regimes. The study has broader implications for conservation management in fire-prone savannas in South America generally. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biodiversity is well studied in ecology and the concept has been developed to include traits of species, rather than solely taxonomy, to better reflect the functional diversity of a system. The deep sea provides a natural environmental gradient within which to study changes in different diversity metrics, but traits of deep-sea fish are not widely known, hampering the application of functional diversity to this globally important system. We used morphological traits to determine the functional richness and functional divergence of demersal fish assemblages along the continental slope in the Northeast Atlantic, at depths of 300-2,000 m. We compared these metrics to size diversity based on individual body size and species richness. Functional richness and size diversity showed similar patterns, with the highest diversity at intermediate depths; functional divergence showed the opposite pattern, with the highest values at the shallowest and deepest parts of the study site. Species richness increased with depth. The functional implications of these patterns were deduced by examining depth-related changes in morphological traits and the dominance of feeding guilds as illustrated by stable isotope analyses. The patterns in diversity and the variation in certain morphological traits can potentially be explained by changes in the relative dominance of pelagic and benthic feeding guilds. All measures of diversity examined here suggest that the deep areas of the continental slope may be equally or more diverse than assemblages just beyond the continental shelf.

AB Seed-dispersal ecology in tropical montane forests (TMF) differs in some predictable ways from tropical lowland forests (TLF). Environmental, biogeographic and biotic factors together shape dispersal syndromes which in turn influence forest structure and community composition. Data on diaspore traits along five elevational gradients from forests in Thailand, the Philippines, Tanzania, Malawi and Nigeria showed that diaspore size decreases with increasing altitude, fleshy fruits remain the most common fruit type but the relative proportion of wind-dispersed diaspores increases with altitude. Probably corresponding to diaspore size decreasing with increasing elevation, we also provide evidence that avian body size and gape width decrease with increasing altitude. Among other notable changes in the frugivorous fauna across elevational gradients, we found quantitative evidence illustrating that the proportion of bird versus mammalian frugivores increases with altitude, while TMF primates decrease in diversity and density, and switch diets to include less fruit and more leaf proportionately. A paucity of studies on dispersal distance and seed shadows, the dispersal/predation balance and density-dependent mortality thwart much-needed conclusive comparisons of seed dispersal ecology between TMF and TLF, especially from understudied Asian forests. We examine the available evidence, reveal knowledge gaps and recommend research to enhance our understanding of seed dispersal ecology in tropical forests. This review demonstrates that seed dispersal is a more deterministic and important process in tropical montane forests than has been previously appreciated.

AB Most ecosystems are subject to both natural and human disturbances that can combine to influence populations and assemblages in complex ways. Assessing the relative influences and combined impacts of natural and human disturbance is crucial for managing human uses of ecosystems against the backdrop of their natural variability. We evaluated the separate and combined influences of disturbance from storm waves and disturbance associated with human trampling of rocky shores by conducting an experiment mimicking controlled levels of trampling at sites with different wave exposures, and before and after a major storm event in central California, USA. Results show that trampling and storm waves affected the same taxa and have comparable and additive effects on rocky shore assemblages. Both disturbance types caused significant reduction in percent cover of mussels and erect macroalgae, and resulted in significant re-organization of assemblages associated with these habitat-forming taxa. A single extreme storm event caused similar percent cover losses of mussels and erect macroalgae as did 6 12 months of trampling. Contrary to a predicted synergistic effect of trampling and storm damage, we found that impacts from each disturbance combined additively. Mussel beds in wave-exposed sites are more vulnerable to trampling impacts than algal beds at protected sites. Mussels and erect macroalgae recovered within five years after trampling stopped. These results suggest that impacts from local human use can be reversed in relatively short time frames, and that cumulative impacts can be reduced by setting recreational carrying capacities more conservatively when ecosystems are already exposed to frequent and/or intense natural disturbances.

AB Ecological communities are subjected to stochasticity in the form of demographic and environmental variance. Stochastic models that contain only demographic variance (neutral models) provide close quantitative fits to observed species-abundance distributions (SADs) but substantially underestimate observed temporal species-abundance fluctuations. To provide a holistic assessment of whether models with demographic and environmental variance perform better than neutral models, the fit of both to SADs and temporal species-abundance fluctuations at the same time has to be tested quantitatively. In this study, we quantitatively test how closely a model with demographic and environmental variance reproduces total numbers of species, total abundances, SADs and temporal species-abundance fluctuations for two tropical forest tree communities, using decadal data from long-term monitoring plots and considering individuals larger than two size thresholds for each community. We find that the model can indeed closely reproduce these static and dynamic patterns of biodiversity in the two communities for the two size thresholds, with better overall fits than corresponding neutral models. Therefore, our results provide evidence that stochastic models incorporating demographic and environmental variance can simultaneously capture important static and dynamic biodiversity patterns arising in tropical forest communities.

TI Geospatial analysis of forest fragmentation in Uttara Kannada District,
   India
SO FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Landscapes consist of heterogeneous interacting dynamic elements with complex ecological, economic and cultural attributes. These complex interactions help in the sustenance of natural resources through bio-geochemical and hydrological cycling. The ecosystem functions are altered with changes in the landscape structure. Fragmentation of large contiguous forests to small and isolated forest patches either by natural phenomena or anthropogenic activities leads to drastic changes in forest patch sizes, shape, connectivity and internal heterogeneity, which restrict the movement leading to inbreeding among Meta populations with extirpation of species.
   Methods: Landscape dynamics are assessed through land use analysis by way of remote sensing data acquired at different time periods. Forest fragmentation is assessed at the pixel level through computation of two indicators, i.e., Pf (the ratio of pixels that are forested to the total non-water pixels in the window) and Pff (the proportion of all adjacent (cardinal directions only) pixel pairs that include at least one forest pixel, for which both pixels are forested).
   Results: Uttara Kannada District has the distinction of having the highest forest cover in Karnataka State, India. This region has been experiencing changes in its forest cover and consequent alterations in functional abilities of its ecosystem. Temporal land use analyses show the trend of deforestation, evident from the reduction of evergreen semi evergreen forest cover from 57.31 % (1979) to 32.08 % (2013) Forest fragmentation at the landscape level shows a decline of interior forests 64.42 % (1979) to 25.62 % (2013) and transition of non-forest categories such as crop land, plantations and built-up areas, amounting now to 47.29 %. PCA prioritized geophysical and socio variables responsible for changes in the landscape structure at local levels.
   Conclusion: Terrestrial forest ecosystems in Uttara Kannada District of Central Western Ghats have been experiencing threats due to deforestation with land use changes and fragmentation of contiguous forests, as is evident from the decline of interior forests and consequent increases in patch, transitional, edge and perforated forests. Interior or intact forest cover in this ecologically fragile region is now 25.62 %. Considering the accelerating rates of forest fragmentation in recent times, the focus should be on reforestation and regeneration of natural vegetation to sustain food and water security and the livelihood of local populations. This requires innovation with holistic approaches in the management of forests by involving all local stakeholders to minimize the encroachment of forests, and improvements in regeneration.

AB Fragment size, isolation, and matrix properties have received considerable attention as predictors of species richness, abundance, and composition in habitat patches. However, measurements of habitat attributes or habitat quality are more directly related to the proximate effects of habitat fragmentation and may be more determinant of assemblages than traditional explanatory variables at local scales. We determine how habitat structure in fragments-a measure of habitat quality-compares to fragment size, isolation, and matrix properties as determinants of richness, abundance, and composition of non-volant small mammals in a fragmented landscape of Atlantic Forest. Small mammals were surveyed once in 25 fragments in the Macacu River watershed, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 1999 to 2001 and 2005 to 2009. A total of 83 candidate models were formulated and compared by Akaike Information Criteria. Habitat structure was one of the main determinants of small mammal assemblages in fragments, as important as fragment isolation for species composition and climatic season for species richness. Rodents were more abundant in fragments with increased overstory and understory vegetation density and more fallen logs. The contrary pattern was found for overall species richness and for species of terrestrial habit, which were more abundant in fragments with more open forest: decreased overstory and understory vegetation density and less fallen logs. Habitat quality in fragments may be a more important determinant of assemblages of small mammals and other vertebrates than previously considered in landscape and land use studies.

AB The boreal forest of Alberta, Canada, is under pressure from a rapid expansion of the wildland-human interface driven by natural resources exploitation. The specific impact of these changes on area burned remains poorly understood. We addressed this issue by modelling area burned for the 1980-2010 period using variables accounting for various anthropogenic effects. We hypothesise that an ecological frontier exists in the areas of intermediate to low human influence in northern Alberta, which implies a new influx of human-caused ignitions coinciding with continuous flammable vegetation, hence promoting area burned. Using a statistical control approach, we assessed the importance of each anthropogenic variable by adding them to a biophysical regression model. Our results show that there is a diversity of responses of area burned to the different anthropogenic factors considered. Distance to the transportation network, human footprint and density of the energy network significantly improved the model predictions. The area burned in the ecological frontier showed clusters of higher predictions by anthropogenic models, which supports our hypothesis of an ecological frontier and suggests that human and natural ignitions have an additive, albeit temporary, effect on landscape fire susceptibility.

AB Seedlings are vulnerable to many kinds of fatal abiotic and biotic agents, and examining the causes of seedling dynamics can help understand mechanisms of species coexistence. To disentangle the relative importance of neighborhood densities, habitat factors and phylogenetic relatedness on focal seedling survival, we monitored the survival of 5306 seedlings of 104 species > 15 months. We address the following questions: (i) How do neighborhood densities, habitat variables and phylogenetic relatedness affect seedling survival? What is the relative importance of conspecific densities, habitat variables and phylogenetic relatedness to seedling survival? (ii) Does the importance of the neighborhood densities, habitat variables and phylogenetic relatedness vary among growth forms, leaf habits or dispersal modes? Specially, does the conspecific negative density dependence inhibit tree and deciduous seedlings more compared with shrub and evergreen species? Does density dependence affect the wind and animal-dispersed species equally?
   We established 135 census stations to monitor seedling dynamics in a 25-ha subtropical forest plot in central China. Conspecific and heterospecific seedling density in the 1-m(2) seedling plot and adult basal area within a 20-m radius provided neighborhood density variables. Mean elevation, convexity and aspect of every 5- x 5-m grid with seedling plots were used to quantify habitat characteristics. We calculated the relative average phylodiversity between focal seedling and heterospecific neighbors to quantify the species relatedness in the neighborhood. Eight candidate generalized linear mixed models with binominal error distribution were used to compare the relative importance of these variables to seedling survival. Akaike's information criteria were used to identify the most parsimonious models.
   At the community level, both the neighborhood densities and phylogenetic relatedness were important to seedling survival. We found negative effects of increasing conspecific seedlings, which suggested the existence of species-specific density-dependent mortality. Phylodiversity of heterospecific neighbors was negatively related to survival of focal seedlings, indicating similar habitat preference shared among phylogenetically closely related species may drive seedling survival. The relative importance of neighborhood densities, habitat variables and phylogenetic relatedness varied among ecological guilds. Conspecific densities had significant negative effect for deciduous and wind-dispersed species, and marginally significant for tree seedlings > 10cm tall and animal-dispersed species. Habitat variables had limited effects on seedling survival, and only elevation was related to the survival of evergreen species in the best-fit model. We conclude that both negative density-dependent mortality and habitat preference reflected by the phylogenetic relatedness shape the species coexistence at seedling stage in this forest.

AB Negative density dependence (NDD) and niche partitioning have been perceived as important mechanisms for the maintenance of species diversity. However, little is known about their relative contributions to seedling survival. We examined the effects of biotic and abiotic neighborhoods and the variations of biotic neighborhoods among species using survival data for 7503 seedlings belonging to 22 woody species over a period of 2years in three different forest types, a half-mature forest (HF), a mature forest (MF), and an old-growth forest (OGF), each of these representing a specific successional stage in a temperate forest ecosystem in northeastern China. We found a convincing evidence for the existence of NDD in temperate forest ecosystems. The biotic and abiotic variables affecting seedlings survival change with successional stage, seedling size, and age. The strength of NDD for the smaller (<20cm in height) and younger seedlings (1-2years) as well as all seedlings combined varies significantly among species. We found no evidence that a community compensatory trend (CCT) existed in our study area. The results of this study demonstrate that the relative importance of NDD and habitat niche partitioning in driving seedling survival varies with seedling size and age and that the biotic and abiotic factors affecting seedlings survival change with successional stage.

AB Interactions among neighboring individuals influence plant performance and should create spatial patterns in local community structure. In order to assess the role of large trees in generating spatial patterns in local species richness, we used the individual species-area relationship (ISAR) to evaluate the species richness of trees of different size classes (and dead trees) in circular neighborhoods with varying radius around large trees of different focal species. To reveal signals of species interactions, we compared the ISAR function of the individuals of focal species with that of randomly selected nearby locations. We expected that large trees should strongly affect the community structure of smaller trees in their neighborhood, but that these effects should fade away with increasing size class. Unexpectedly, we found that only few focal species showed signals of species interactions with trees of the different size classes and that this was less likely for less abundant focal species. However, the few and relatively weak departures from independence were consistent with expectations of the effect of competition for space and the dispersal syndrome on spatial patterns. A noisy signal of competition for space found for large trees built up gradually with increasing life stage; it was not yet present for large saplings but detectable for intermediates. Additionally, focal species with animal-dispersed seeds showed higher species richness in their neighborhood than those with gravity- and gyration-dispersed seeds. Our analysis across the entire ontogeny from recruits to large trees supports the hypothesis that stochastic effects dilute deterministic species interactions in highly diverse communities. Stochastic dilution is a consequence of the stochastic geometry of biodiversity in species-rich communities where the identities of the nearest neighbors of a given plant are largely unpredictable. While the outcome of local species interactions is governed for each plant by deterministic fitness and niche differences, the large variability of competitors causes also a large variability in the outcomes of interactions and does not allow for strong directed responses at the species level. Collectively, our results highlight the critical effect of the stochastic geometry of biodiversity in structuring local spatial patterns of tropical forest diversity.

AB In tropical forests light and water availability are the most important factors for seedling growth and survival but an increasing frequency of drought may affect tree regeneration. One central question is whether drought and shade have interactive effects on seedling growth and survival. Here, we present results of a greenhouse experiment, in which seedlings of 10 Ghanaian tree species were exposed to combinations of strong seasonal drought (continuous watering versus withholding water for nine weeks) and shade (5% irradiance versus 20% irradiance). We evaluated the effects of drought and shade on seedling survival and growth and plasticity of 11 underlying traits related to biomass allocation, morphology and physiology. Seedling survival under dry conditions was higher in shade than in high light, thus providing support for the "facilitation hypothesis" that shade enhances plant performance through improved microclimatic conditions, and rejecting the trade-off hypothesis that drought should have stronger impact in shade because of reduced root investment. Shaded plants had low biomass fraction in roots, in line with the trade-off hypothesis, but they compensated for this with a higher specific root length (i.e., root length per unit root mass), resulting in a similar root length per plant mass and, hence, similar water uptake capacity as high-light plants. The majority (60%) of traits studied responded independently to drought and shade, indicating that within species shade-and drought tolerances are not in trade-off, but largely uncoupled. When individual species responses were analysed, then for most of the traits only one to three species showed significant interactive effects between drought and shade. The uncoupled response of most species to drought and shade should provide ample opportunity for niche differentiation and species coexistence under a range of water and light conditions. Overall our greenhouse results suggest that, in the absence of root competition shaded tropical forest tree seedlings may be able to survive prolonged drought.

AB QuestionRecent research in boreal forest suggests that an open matrix' model may be more appropriate than the traditional model of spatially discrete gap dynamics for describing forest disturbance and regeneration, but what is the evidence from temperate broad-leaved deciduous forests concerning the prevalence of these alternative models?
   LocationSemi-natural temperate broad-leaved deciduous forest in southern England.
   MethodsMulti-temporal LiDAR data were used to monitor the changes in tree canopy height and canopy gaps over a 10-yr period for a 130-ha area of forest. Gap dynamics were characterized by quantifying gap creation, expansion, contraction and closure. By identifying the types and rates of canopy height transitions, areas of gap contraction and closure were attributed to the processes of lateral crown growth or vertical regeneration.
   ResultsAcross the study site there was a zonation in canopy and gap properties and their dynamics. Many areas of the forest had the characteristics of open wood-pasture dominated by large, complex gaps being maintained under a regime of chronic disturbance. In these areas, several characteristics of the gap dynamics indicated that regeneration was restricted and this may be attributable to spatially-focused overgrazing by large herbivores. In contrast, other areas were characterized by high, closed canopy forest with small, discrete gaps where gap creation and infill were balanced.
   ConclusionsAt the landscape-scale broad-leaved deciduous forests contain a spatial mosaic of zones, which conform to different models of disturbance and regeneration dynamics; discrete gap dynamics and open matrix regimes are juxtaposed. It is now important to elucidate the abiotic factors and biotic interactions that determine the spatio-temporal distribution of the different regimes and to examine whether such a regime mosaic' model is applicable in other forest types.

AB 1. Epigeic ants are functionally important arthropods in tropical and subtropical forests, particularly by acting as predators. High predation pressure has been hypothesised to be a mechanism facilitating high diversity across trophic levels. 2. In this study, standardised pitfall traps were used in a highly diverse subtropical forest to test if and how ant species richness is related to tree species richness and a comprehensive set of other environmental variables such as successional age, soil properties or elevation. 3. A total of 13 441 ant individuals belonging to 3839 species occurrences and 71 species were collected, of which 26 species were exclusive predators and 45 species were omnivores. 4. Occurrence and species richness of total and omnivore ants were positively related to soil pH. Predator ant occurrence was unrelated to all environmental variables tested. 5. The species richness of predator ants increased with tree species richness but decreased with leaf functional diversity and shrub cover. Elevation negatively influenced only total ant species richness. 6. The evenness of predators increased with tree species richness, while the evenness of all ants decreased with shrub cover. Omnivore ant evenness decreased with tree evenness, but increased with successional age. 7. The results highlight the value of diverse forests in maintaining species richness and community evenness of a functionally important predator group. Moreover, the results stress the importance of analysing trophic groups separately when investigating biodiversity effects.

AB Coral guard-crabs in the genus Trapezia are well-documented defenders of their pocilloporid coral hosts against coral predators such as the Crown-of-Thorns seastar (Acanthaster planci complex). The objectives of this study were to examine the protective services of six species of Trapezia against corallivory, and the extent of functional diversity among these Trapezia species.
   Studies conducted in Mo'orea, French Polynesia showed the Trapezia-coral mutualism protected the host corals from multiple predators through functional diversity in the assemblage of crab symbionts. Species differed in their defensive efficacy, but species within similar size classes shared similar abilities. Smallersize Trapezia species, which were previously thought to be ineffective guards, play important defensive roles against small corallivores.
   We also measured the benefits of this mutualism to corals in the midst of an Acanthaster outbreak that reduced the live coral cover on the fore reef to less than 4%. The mutualism may positively affect the reef coral demography and potential for recovery during adverse predation events through shelter of multiple species of small corals near the host coral. Our results show that while functional diversity is supported within the genus, some Trapezia species may be functionally equivalent within the same size class, decreasing the threat of gaps in coral protection caused by absence or replacement of any single Trapezia species.

AB Forest ecosystems have been widely fragmented by human land use, inducing significant microclimatic and biological changes at the forest edge. If we are to rigorously assess the ecological impacts of habitat fragmentation, there is a need to effectively quantify the amount of edge habitat within a landscape, and to allow this to be modelled for individual species and processes. Edge effect may extend only a few metres or as far as several kilometres, depending on the species or process in question. Therefore, rather than attempting to quantify the amount of edge habitat by using a fixed, case-specific distance to distinguish between edge and core, the area of habitat within continuously-varying distances from the forest edge is of greater utility. We quantified the degree of fragmentation of forests in England, where forests cover 10 % of the land area. We calculated the distance from within the forest patches to the nearest edge (forest vs. non-forest) and other landscape indices, such as mean patch size, edge density and distance to the nearest neighbour. Of the total forest area, 37 % was within 30 m and 74 % within 100 m of the nearest edge. This highlights that, in fragmented landscapes, the habitats close to the edge form a considerable proportion of the total habitat area. We then show how these edge estimates can be combined with ecological response functions, to allow us to generate biologically meaningful estimates of the impacts of fragmentation at a landscape scale.

AB In this study, we determined the driving key factor determining variability in bacterial community structures in soils at two unvegetated alpine glacier forefields with different bedrock geology (calcareous and siliceous). We further assessed the resistance and resilience capacities of the bacterial communities through reciprocal soil transplantations. Sterilized and unsterilized soils were incubated locally (home') or transplanted (away') for 15 months (July 2011-October 2012) and sampled regularly during the snow-free seasons. Changes in bacterial community structures were determined through fingerprinting of the 16S rRNA gene and correlated with several environmental factors. This study demonstrates that bacterial community structures at our field sites were shaped by distinct mineralogical soil properties. Soil moisture and pH appeared to not be the major driving key factors. Calcareous soil was more selective to bacteria, thus diversity was higher in siliceous soils as a positive effect of its more diverse mineralogical composition. Bacterial community in the calcareous soil exhibited stronger resistance to transplantation than the community in the siliceous soil. In fact, siliceous soil was more easily invaded by extrinsic taxa. Bacterial communities of both soil types were equally resilient at home, although different resilience patterns were observed between calcareous and siliceous soils incubated away.

AB Aims
   Increasing anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition has been claimed to induce changes in species composition and community dynamics. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to examine the effect of increased N availability on growth and functional attributes of seedlings of five tree species with different life history characteristics under varying irradiances. The following questions have been addressed: (i) how do the pioneer and non-pioneer species respond in absolute growth and relative growth rate (RGR) to the interaction of light and nitrogen? (ii) how does the interaction between irradiance and nitrogen availability modulate growth attributes (i.e. functional attributes)? (iii) is there any variation in growth responses between leguminous and non-leguminous species along the light and nitrogen gradients?
   Methods
   Seedlings of five tree species (Acacia catechu, Bridelia retusa, Dalbergia sissoo, Lagerstroemia parviflora and Terminalia arjuna) were subjected to twelve combinations of irradiance and N levels. Various growth traits, including height (HT), basal area (BA), whole plant dry biomass (M-D), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf area ratio (LAR), net assimilation rate (NAR), RGR, biomass fractions, root-to-shoot ratio (R: S) and leaf nitrogen content, were studied to analyse intra-and inter-specific responses to interacting light and N gradients.
   Important Findings
   Significant interactions for irradiance and N availability for majority of growth attributes indicates that growth and biomass allocation of seedlings were more responsive to N availability under high irradiance. However, species responded differentially to N addition and they did not follow successional status. Slow growers (B. retusa, a shade-tolerant species and L. parviflora, a light demander) exhibited greater response to N enrichment than the fast growers (A. catechu, D. sissoo and T. arjuna). However, N-mediated increment in growth traits was greater in non-legumes (B. retusa, L. parviflora and T. arjuna) compared with that of legumes (A. catechu and D. sissoo). Allocation of biomass to root was strongly suppressed at the highest N supply across species; however, at high irradiance and high N availability, a greater suppression in R: S ratio was observed for B. retusa. NAR was a stronger determinant of RGR relative to LAR, suggesting its prominent role in increased RGR along increasing irradiances. Overall, a higher growth response of slow-growing species to elevated N levels, particularly the non-pioneers (B. retusa and L. parviflora) suggests that future N deposition may lead to perturbations in competition hierarchies and species composition, ultimately affecting community dynamics in nutrient-poor tropical dry forests.

AB Cambodia has 57% forest cover, the second highest in the Greater Mekong region, and a high deforestation rate (1.2%/year, 2005-2010). Community forestry (CF) has been proposed as a way to reduce deforestation and support livelihoods through local management of forests. CF is expanding rapidly in Cambodia. The National Forests Program aims to designate one million hectares of forest to CF by 2030. However, the effectiveness of CF in conservation is not clear due to a global lack of controlled comparisons, multiple meanings of CF, and the context-specific nature of CF implementation. We assessed the effectiveness of CF by comparing 9 CF sites with paired controls in state production forest in the area of Prey Long forest, Cambodia. We assessed forest condition in 18-20 randomly placed variable-radius plots and fixed-area regeneration plots. We surveyed 10% of households in each of the 9 CF villages to determine the proportion that used forest products, as a measure of household dependence on the forest. CF sites had fewer signs of anthropogenic damage (cut stems, stumps, and burned trees), higher aboveground biomass, more regenerating stems, and reduced canopy openness than control areas. Abundance of economically valuable species, however, was higher in control sites. We used survey results and geographic parameters to model factors affecting CF outcomes. Interaction between management type, CF or control, and forest dependence indicated that CF was more effective in cases where the community relied on forest products for subsistence use and income. Efectividad de la Silvicultura Comunal en el Bosque Prey Long, Camboya
   Resumen Camboya tiene una cobertura forestal de 57%, la segunda mas grande en la region Mayor del Mekong, y una tasa de deforestacion alta (1.2% y(-1), 2005-2010). La silvicultura comunal (SC) se ha propuesto como una forma de reducir la deforestacion y apoyar los medios de vida a traves del manejo local de los bosques. La silvicultura forestal esta expandiendose rapidamente en Camboya. El Programa Nacional de Bosques busca designar un millon de hectareas de bosque para la SC para 2030. Sin embargo, la efectividad de la SC en la conservacion no esta clara debido a la falta global de comparaciones controladas, los significados multiples de SC y la naturaleza de contexto especifico de la implementacion de SC. Estudiamos la efectividad de la SC al comparar nueve sitios de SC con controles pareados en bosques de produccion estatal en el area del bosque Prey Long, Camboya. Estudiamos las condiciones forestales en 18-20 parcelas colocadas al azar y con radios variables y en parcelas con un area fija de regeneracion. Encuestamos el 10% de las casas en cada una de las nueve aldeas de SC para determinar la proporcion que usa productos forestales como medida de casas con dependencia del bosque. Los sitios de bosque comunal tuvieron menos indicadores de dano antropogenico (tallos cortados, tocones de arboles, arboles quemados), una biomasa superficial mayor, mas tallos regenerativos y una abertura reducida del dosel que en las areas de control. Usamos los resultados de las encuestas y parametros geograficos para modelar los factores que afectan los resultados de la SC. La interaccion entre el tipo de manejo, SC o control, y la dependencia del bosque indico que la SC es mas efectiva en casos donde la comunidad depende de productos forestales para subsistir y generar ingresos.

AB General principles that shape community structure can be described based on a functional trait approach grounded on predictive models; increased attention has been paid to factors accounting for the functional diversity of species assemblages and its association with species richness along environmental gradients. We analyze here the interaction between leaf-litter ant species richness, the local communities' morphological structure and fundamental niche within the context of a northeast-southeast latitudinal gradient in one of the world's most species-rich ecosystems, the Atlantic Forest, representing 2,700 km of tropical rainforest along almost 20 degrees of latitude in eastern Brazil. Our results are consistent with an ecosystem-wide pattern in communities' structure, with relatively high species turnover but functionally analogous leaflitter ant communities' organization. Our results suggest directional shifts in the morphological space along the environmental gradient from overdispersed to aggregated (from North to South), suggesting that primary productivity and environmental heterogeneity (altitude, temperature and precipitation in the case) determine the distribution of traits and regulate the assembly rules, shaping local leaf-litter ant communities. Contrary to the expected and most common pattern along latitudinal gradients, the Atlantic Forest leaf litter ant communities show an inverse pattern in richness, that is, richer communities in higher than in lower latitudes. The morphological specialization of communities showed more morphologically distinct communities at low latitudes and species redundancy at high latitudes. We claim that an inverse latitudinal gradient in primary productivity and environmental heterogeneity across the Atlantic forest may affect morphological diversity and species richness, enhancing species coexistence mechanisms, and producing thus the observed patterns. We suggest that a functional framework based on flexible enough traits should be pursued to allow comparisons at local, regional and global levels.

AB Globally, relatively low-contrast matrices are being converted to high-contrast through increases in land uses such as surface mining. Such conversion affects biodiversity not only at the impact site, but also potentially in adjacent remnant habitat, particularly for habitat types such as tropical rainforest. We investigated how the species richness of different functional groups of tropical rainforest birds varied in remnant rainforest patches embedded in two matrix types (mining vs. agricultural) at two distances to forest edge in fragmented Upper Guinean rainforest landscapes of southwest Ghana. We hypothesized that rainforest adjacent to high-contrast surface mining would support a relatively lower richness of forest-dependent birds than that adjacent to a lower-contrast agricultural matrix. Data from six point counts at each of 32 study sites were used to estimate species richness within ten avian functional groups based on (a) habitat preference (forest specialists, generalists, forest visitors, open country species); and (b) food preference (carnivores, frugivores, omnivores, nectarivores, insectivores and granivores). Species richness of each group was modelled as a function of adjacent matrix type, distance to patch edge and site-level vegetation characteristics using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Forest specialists and frugivores were most strongly negatively affected by adjacent mining, irrespective of distance to forest edge. Forest visitors were more common in forests adjacent to agriculture than mining, and they preferred edges to interior habitats. Forest specialist and frugivore richness also correlated positively with the density of large trees. This effect of a high-contrast matrix on forest birds suggests that even with no additional forest loss, increased surface mining in the Upper Guinea region is likely to result in population declines in forest-dependent birds. Preserving biodiversity in forest landscapes will require management of matrix quality. The widespread trend of increasing patch-matrix contrast from land use change in the matrix is likely to result in negative consequences for biodiversity in fragmented tropical forest landscapes.

AB This study investigated the importance of variations in environmental factors affecting the abundance patterns of decapods on the southeastern Brazilian coast. Sampling was carried out monthly from January 1998 through December 1999 in Ubatumirim and Mar Virado, Ubatuba region, using a commercial shrimp fishing boat equipped with double-rig nets. Six areas adjacent to rocky shores were chosen. Bottom-water samples were collected using a Nansen bottle, to measure the temperature and salinity. Sediment samples were also obtained by means of a Van Veen grab, for determination of texture and organic-matter content. The association of environmental factors with species abundance was evaluated by Canonical Correspondence Analysis (alpha = 0.05). Forty-one species of Decapoda were used in the multivariate analysis. The analysis indicated that sediment texture (phi) and bottom temperature were the main factors correlated (p < 0.05) with the spatial and temporal abundance of the species. Considering the study region as faunal transition zone, including a mixture of species of both tropical and subantarctic origin, the species responded differently to environmental factors, mainly temperature. It is conceivable that the decapods adjust their distribution according to their intrinsic physiological limitations, possibly as a result of the available resources.

ID FOREST CONSERVATION; EFFICIENCY; TRANSITIONS
AB In the growing literature on "payments for environmental services" schemes, so far not much attention has been paid to their institutional dimensions when assessing their performance; this is especially true of the Costa Rican case. This paper provides an analysis of the institutional performance of the Costa Rican Payment for Environmental Services Program (PESP). While recognizing its low additionality, our analysis highlights its positive long-term and indirect environmental impacts via the discontinuation of agriculture and institutional interplays. It also recognizes social impact as a secondary objective of the program, concluding that its current social performance is poor. However, it concludes that the program has higher sustainability, due to its strong legitimacy, than Coasean analyses suggest by focusing solely on its financing. Our analysis shows the risks and limitations of Coasean recommendations that focus on improving PESP cost-effectiveness. It proposes instead to strengthen the program's strategic management, to give more importance to other modalities than the forest protection one and to improve other institutions of the forest sector. This includes stricter enforcement of the law prohibiting deforestation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Discourses regarding the development of the Amazon region highlight the importance of the local cultures, local knowledge and participation of smallholders, such as indigenous people, traditional communities and small-scale colonists. Current policies, however, still pursue a development model that is oriented towards global commodity markets and the capacity of well-qualified entrepreneurs with the capital required for large-scale investments, despite a growing consensus on its ecological incompatibilities, social limitations and economic risks. Decision makers from both governmental and non-governmental organisations widely disregard the possibility that smallholders could more actively contribute to rural development. Instead, the production practices of smallholders and their modes of social organisation are perceived as obsolete and inefficient. By presenting examples from the region, this paper argues that smallholders have the potential to manage production systems that maintain environmental stability while effectively contributing to local well-being. Therefore, the paper advocates to more effectively using local capacities for the development of rural Amazon through the promotion of small-scale production systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Although pollen limitation of reproduction (PL) has been widely studied, our understanding of its occurrence in tropical communities, especially for bird-pollinated plants, is underdeveloped. In addition, inclusion of both quantity and quality aspects in studies of PL are generally lacking. Within hummingbird-pollinated plants, a prediction was made for higher PL for the quality than quantity aspects and a minor effect of temporal variation because hummingbirds are constant and efficient pollen vectors but they may transfer low quality pollen.
   Field hand and open pollination experiments were conducted on 21 species in a tropical montane rain forest over 2 years. The quantity (fruit set and seeds per fruit) and quality (seed weight and germination) aspects of reproduction were assessed as the response to open pollination relative to outcross hand pollination. The relationships between the effect size of quantity and quality aspects of reproduction and predictive plant features (self-incompatibility, autogamy, density and pollinator specialization level) were assessed with phylogenetic generalized linear models.
   Just over half of all the species expressed PL for one or more response variables. On average, the severity of PL was strong for one quality variable (seed germination; 083), but insignificant for another (seed weight; 003), and low to moderate for quantity variables (031 for seeds per fruit and 039 for fruit set). There was only a minor contribution of temporal variation to PL within the studied species. Common predictors of PL, i.e. phylogenetic relatedness, self-incompatibility, autogamy, plant density and pollinator specialization level, did not adequately explain variation in PL within this community.
   Despite the measurable degree of PL within these hummingbird-pollinated plants, the causes of pollen quality and quantity insufficiency are not clear. Variables other than those tested may contribute to PL or causes of PL may vary among species and cannot adequately be accounted for when assessed from the within-community perspective.

AB The tendency of species to retain their ancestral niches may link processes that determine community assembly with biogeographic histories that span geological time scales. Biogeographic history is likely to have had a particularly strong impact on Neotropical forests because of the influence of the Great American Biotic Interchange, which followed emergence of a land connection between North and South America similar to 3 Ma. Here we examine the community structure, ancestral niches and ancestral distributions of the related, hyperdiverse woody plant genera Psychotria and Palicourea (Rubiaceae) in Panama. We find that 49% of the variation in hydraulic traits, a strong determinant of community structure, is explained by species' origins in climatically distinct biogeographic regions. Niche evolution models for a regional sample of 152 species indicate that ancestral climatic niches are associated with species' habitat distributions, and hence local community structure and composition, even millions of years after dispersal into new geographic regions.

AB In 1999, the edited volume Primate Communities presented several studies that examined broad-scale patterns of primate diversity.(1) Similar studies were being conducted on nonprimate taxa; advances in data availability and statistical approaches were allowing scientists to investigate a variety of new questions and to reexamine classical questions in novel ways. While such studies on nonprimate taxa have continued at a steady pace, they have only crept forward for primate species (Fig.1). In the intervening time, the field of macroecology (Box 1) rapidly developed and has resulted in several books and the establishment of new research institutes. We suggest that examining primate communities, especially in a macroecological context, is an important line of research for our field to embrace and an area where biological anthropologists can provide major contributions. We review the current state of research, describe new datasets and research tools, and suggest future research directions.

AB Understanding the structure and evolution of ecological communities requires an examination of the factors that influence plant-animal mutualistic interactions. These interactions are affected by factors that are both extrinsic and intrinsic to the animals We used a meta-analysis technique to examine such factors affecting the interactions between frugivorous animals and the plants they feed upon, using 3 common Neotropical frugivorous bat genera (Carollia, Sturnira, and Artibeus) as a model. We assessed whether latitude, altitude, ecoregion, and bat body size were related to the proportions of the most important plant genera in the diet of the bats. Our results show that extrinsic factors did not affect the proportion of Piper in the diet of Carollia. The proportion of Solanum in the diet of Sturnira was positively correlated with latitude and decreased in the mountain, moist, and bahia interior ecoregions. The proportion of Ficus and Cecropia in the diet of Artibeus decreased in high-elevation ecoregions and was negatively correlated with altitude. The large Artibeus species featured more Ficus and Cecropia in their diets compared to the small species of this genus. Our work demonstrates that mutualistic interaction between Neotropical bats and their core plant taxa is mediated by geographic and morphological factors.

AB Rewards for environmental service provision, couched under market-based instruments, are widely touted in Australia as a means of improving natural resource management while empowering indigenous people. We document here the views of indigenous Australians in a community in Arnhem Land about their motivations for, and ways to provide, such services. Most respondents (93%) said that they 'look after country' to fulfil cultural responsibilities. Natural resource management, they said, should be carried out communally, primarily under the direction of elders and family. Sixty percent of respondents preferred direct payments such as cash or salaried remuneration like that commonly offered in return for ranger-like activities such as feral animal/weed control, coastal surveillance and prescribed burning. Some (14%) either did not want or did not need rewards for environmental service provision. Others (19%) preferred rewards in a form that benefited their community or family rather than themselves as individuals. There was agreement that outcomes should be monitored, consistent with the principle that reward payments should be conditional on performance. We suggest that a reward system that is too narrowly defined could thwart the potential for win-win outcomes from indigenous incentive-based natural resource management but that their articulation could allow solutions to be negotiated.

AB There has been a dramatic shift in dominance from Stipa grandis communities to S. krylovii communities in the Inner Mongolia steppe of China, in recent decades due to climate change and human activity. We examined the growth and carbohydrate allocation pattern of S. grandis and S. krylovii under controlled conditions. The experimental approach involved a drought stress treatment and a simulated defoliation (clipping) treatment of both species. Growth (above ground biomass and root biomass) and carbon allocation (concentration of leaf total phenolics and pool of total non-structural carbohydrate) variables were evaluated at the end of the experiment. Responses to drought stress differed significantly between S. grandis and S. krylovii. For S. krylovii, growth and the pool of total non-structural carbohydrate were more negatively affected by drought stress, whereas concentration of total phenolics was positively affected. Drought stress reinforced responses to defoliation, and drought stress x defoliation interaction was significant for all of the variables. There was a distinct defoliation response level for growth after drought stress between the two species. For aboveground biomass, both species responded positively to drought stress, which changed from responses equivalence to S. krylovii being superior; for root biomass, the two species responded oppositely to drought stress, which changed from S. grandis being superior to S. krylovii being superior. There was a weak and reverse defoliation response level for the carbon allocation pattern after drought stress between the two species, with S. krylovii changing from superior in defense to superior in storage. These results suggested that S. grandis utilized an avoidance strategy (investment in defense compounds) and S. krylovii utilized a tolerance strategy (investment in storage for regrowth) in response to defoliation under drought stress, supporting the idea that stress-tolerant species may become the new dominant species because of their ability to re-grow after disturbance. This provided a possible explanation for the replacement of S. grandis communities from the view point of adaptive strategy.

AB 1. Both local and regional processes simultaneously control species assemblages depending on spatial habitat configuration. In dendritic networks like streams, the unique spatial arrangement of habitats produces various combinations of local habitat size and isolation. Stream invertebrate assemblages could therefore be controlled by different combinations of local and regional processes, depending on their location in the network. 2. Using quantile regression, we investigated how local habitat size, local environmental conditions and spatial isolation influenced variation in assemblage composition. Adult Trichoptera and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were represented by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination scores, as were local environmental conditions, in four headwater stream networks in New Zealand. 3. With increasing local habitat size, there was a decrease in variation in assemblage composition (NMDS scores) of both adult Trichoptera and benthic macroinvertebrates. This relationship between habitat size and assemblage variation was related to local habitat conditions at the upper limit of assemblage variability and spatial isolation at the lower limit of assemblage variability, for both adult Trichoptera and benthic assemblages, indicating joint local and regional controls on stream invertebrate assemblages. 4. The relationships between local assemblages and their neighbours, based on community similarity scores, differed between benthic macroinvertebrates and adult Trichoptera. For benthic assemblages, the larger the stream, the more similar assemblages were to neighbouring assemblages, whereas there was no consistent relationship between assemblage similarity and stream size for adult Trichoptera. This difference in structuring could be attributed to contrasting spatial influences linked to the different dispersal modes of adults and larvae. However, because adult and benthic assemblages are not independent, the influence of life stage on spatial distribution is difficult to determine (i.e. it is essentially a chicken and egg argument). 5. Overall, our approach using quantile regression to evaluate limit responses, rather than regressions on means, has highlighted the joint importance of local habitat and spatial processes in structuring stream invertebrate assemblages. Furthermore, we have provided evidence for the importance of the spatial network arrangement and interactions between life stages and dispersal processes, in structuring stream assemblages.

AB The biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus (P) in temperate forest ecosystems is poorly understood relative to nitrogen (N) cycling because of the assumption that N is the main factor that limits plant growth. This dichotomous way of understanding nutrient regimes is likely an oversimplification of these dynamic, interacting cycles within the evermore-dynamic framework of soil development. In order to better understand P cycling in temperate deciduous forests, we sought to quantify labile (resin) P flux and determine if soil shows signs of P stress. Labile P flux was quantified in nine ambient and nine elevated P plots on unglaciated eastern deciduous forests in Eastern Ohio. Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) were deployed in situ for two weeks, in the fall and the winter. Flux values were contextualized by resin P pools, N and P mineralization, and phosphatase enzyme activities determined from soil samples collected both at the time of AEM deployment and harvest. Phosphorus flux was 0.64 +/- 0.23 mu g P d(-1) (mean +/- SD) in ambient plots and 3.47 +/- 2.39 mu g P d(-1) in amended P plots. Resin P pools were 4.16 mg kg(-1) and 10.26 mg kg(-1) in the control and elevated plots, respectively. Phosphorus turnover rate increased from one week in control plots, to 3 days in elevated P plots. Results indicate mild P stress relative to N, as N was mineralized (0.84 +/- 0.18 mg N kg(-1) d(-1)) while P was immobilized (-0.22 +/- 0.09 mg P kg(-1) d(-1)). The elevated P treatment did not increase P mineralization. Phosphatase enzyme activities were significantly suppressed by 34% with P amendment. Results suggest labile P is a shallow pool, but is rapidly cycling. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In Neotropical humid forest, the majority of tree species have seeds dispersed by vertebrates. Seed deposition by vertebrates is often spatially aggregated and a low per capita survival for seeds and seedlings is predicted. However, mortality factors could be saturated by high densities. I evaluated whether recruitment of saplings of species dispersed by black and gold howlers (Alouatta caraya) in latrines is higher than at control sites: (1) below parent trees, (2) in trees not used by monkeys to sleep, (3) randomly chosen sites within the forest, and determined whether howlers may influence current floristic composition of the Parana River flooded forest. I recorded saplings several years old in the territories of five monkey groups. In total, I found four times more saplings in latrines than in the other areas, and results suggest that latrines are recruitment foci for most species, though larger samples would be required to assess this for every species. Frequency distribution of the diameter of tallest saplings of more abundant species reflected recruitment over time. I found saplings of more species growing in latrines than outside of them. Saplings higher than 1 m of two species of laurels (Ocotea diospyrifolia and Nectandra megapotamica) and one species of Myrtaceae (Eugenia punicifolia) had higher densities in latrines than below parent trees. Results suggest that mortality factors were saturated in latrines and that sapling may grow at a higher rate in latrines. In relation to the influence on floristic composition E. burkartiana, an uncommon species in the forest, could increase in abundance as consequence of seed dispersal by howlers.

AB Question: Are trait-convergence assembly patterns (TCAP) and/ or traitdivergence assembly patterns (TDAP) of tree sapling communities related to microhabitat gradients in forest patches? If so, which traits are related to such patterns? What are the niche mechanisms potentially responsible for community assembly? Location: Grassland-forest mosaic in Serra do Sudeste region, southern Brazil (ca. 30.8 S, 53.1 W). Methods: We used individual-based trait information of 1132 tree saplings in 40 plots along gradients of canopy openness and grazing intensity in forest patches in southern Brazil. We used a trait-based approach, bypassing taxonomic identification, as a first assessment of sapling community assembly in forest patches. Results: Both TCAP and TDAP indicate nichemechanisms underlying assembly of tree sapling communities. Specific leaf area (SLA), mean leaf area (LA) and relative abundance of toothed leaf margin (TLM) maximized TCAP. SLA and TLMtended to increase undermore closed canopies, whereas LA had higher values at intermediate canopy openness. SLA and LA maximized TDAP and tended to vary more in more closed canopies, whereas SLA and presence of spines, which also maximized TDAP, showed higher variation under lower grazing intensity. Conclusion: The taxon-free approach was very useful to infer niche mechanisms of tree sapling assembly in forest patches. By adopting an individual-based trait approach, we assumed that both intra-specific and intra-population trait variability were relevant for revealing assembly patterns. We highlight that the use of individual-based trait data in ametacommunity framework is an excellent way to evaluate TCAP and TDAP at themetacommunity scale, since it takes into account the entire variation of traits throughout communities.

AB Background: Over half of the world's primary forest and a quarter of the world's plant species are found in Latin America. As a result of the limited protected areas and significant degradation of terrestrial ecosystems, seed banks provide an efficient component of integrated plant conservation strategies, chiefly due to their relatively low cost and massive storage capacity for genetic resources.
   Aims: We analyse the role that ex situ seed banks play in the conservation and reintroduction of threatened species, and in supporting ecological restoration programmes in the region.
   Methods: An analysis of the second National Reports on the state of the World's Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture showed that most countries in the region had the capacity for seed conservation. Using three case studies from seed conservation programmes in Mexico, Brazilian Amazonia and Chile, together with the global Millennium Seed Bank Partnership, we review the status and potential of these initiatives for conservation of plant diversity.
   Conclusion: The collection, conservation and use of seeds from arid and semi-arid biomes is highly effective; however the higher frequency of recalcitrant seeds in humid tropical forests requires a greater investment in research to underpin large-scale seed banking. In order to safeguard native species and provide adequate diversity of seeds for habitat restoration programmes, we anticipate the need to strengthen the capacity of the region's seed banks for preservation, research and propagation of native species.

AB Fire is an important agent of disturbance in many tropical ecosystems that can potentially influence plant consumers. Nevertheless, there are few reports on whether levels of plant damage change as a result of fire. Here we present the results of a 1-yr study evaluating the effects of fire on rates of herbivory and damage by pathogens in leaves of cerrado (Brazilian savanna) tree species. Damage by leaf chewers was over two times greater in burned than in unburned trees. Levels of damage by leaf miners, leaf scrapers, galling insects, and leaf pathogens were relatively low and increased, remained the same, or even decreased as a result of fire. Nevertheless, in all three plant species studied, total herbivore damage was significantly greater in burned than in unburned trees given the preponderance of damage caused by leaf chewers compared with the other types of damage. Leaf chewers, mainly leaf-cutter ants, caterpillars, and grasshoppers, completely ate over 50 percent of the > 2000 leaves we marked in burned trees. That our results were consistent among different plant species with contrasting leaf phenologies suggests that the observed increase in herbivory is a general phenomenon in our study system. Because herbivore pressure is augmented dramatically in recently burned areas, herbivory may act synergistically with fire in influencing the structure of cerrado vegetation.

AB P>1. Changes in land use and habitat fragmentation are major drivers of global change, and studying their effects on biodiversity constitutes a major research programme. However, biodiversity is a multifaceted concept, with a functional component linking species richness to ecosystem function. Currently, the interaction between functional and taxonomic components of biodiversity under realistic scenarios of habitat degradation is poorly understood.
   2. The expected functional richness (FR)-species richness relationship (FRSR) is positive, and attenuated for functional redundancy in species-rich assemblages. Further, environmental filters are expected to flatten that association by sorting species with similar traits. Thus, analysing FRSR can inform about the response of biodiversity to environmental gradients and habitat fragmentation, and its expected functional consequences.
   3. Top predators affect ecosystem functioning through prey consumption and are particularly vulnerable to changes in land use and habitat fragmentation, being good indicators of ecosystem health and suitable models for assessing the effects of habitat fragmentation on their FR.
   4. Thus, this study analyses the functional redundancy of a vertebrate predator assemblage at temperate forest fragments in a rural landscape of Chiloe island (Chile), testing the existence of environmental filters by contrasting an empirically derived FRSR against those predicted from null models, and testing the association between biodiversity components and the structure of forest fragments.
   5. Overall, contrasts against null models indicate that regional factors determine low levels of FR and redundancy for the vertebrate predator assemblage studied, while recorded linear FRSR indicates proportional responses of the two biodiversity components to the structure of forest fragments. Further, most species were positively associated with either fragment size or shape complexity, which are highly correlated. This, and the absence of ecological filters at the single-fragment scale, rendered taxonomically and functionally richer predator assemblages at large complex-shaped fragments.
   6. These results predict strong effects of deforestation on both components of biodiversity, potentially affecting the functioning of remnants of native temperate forest ecosystems. Thus, the present study assesses general responses of functional and taxonomic components of biodiversity to a specific human-driven process.

AB Large-scale agricultural production in Brazil preferentially occupies plateaus reclaimed from areas originally covered by Cerrado (savanna). Depending on the region, a percentage of the pristine vegetation coverage must be preserved by law, resulting in the creation of fragmented legal Cerrado reserves. The geometry of these relatively small legal reserves creates new habitat edges and ecotones, whose effects on the invertebrate fauna are poorly understood. This study aimed to assess the effects of abrupt edges resulting from soy production on ground-dwelling ant assemblages in the Brazilian Cerrado. The study sites are located within the Amazon region, in the state of Maranhao, northern Brazil, but were covered by Cerrado on a relatively low plateau, irregularly inter-spaced with gallery forests along streams. We compared species richness and species composition of ground-dwelling ants along eight transects set 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 m into the sensu stricto Cerrado and 50 and 100 m into the soy field. The collecting periods covered the wet and dry seasons. Effects on ant species richness were non-significant, although composition of the assemblages was significantly affected by edge effects, which were, in part, found to be species specific. We hypothesize that edge effects are probably greater than estimated because of the shape and complexity of reserves. Consideration of edge effects in the Cerrado Biome should enable the design of appropriate reserve sizes and shapes to meet conservation goals.

AB P>1. The ability to display functional responses to shading, i.e. phenotypic changes that enhance plant performance in low light, is fundamental for plant success in forest communities. Herbivory may constrain plant functional responses to shading and this could explain the often observed lower plant tolerance of herbivore damage in the shade.
   2. We carried out a field trial and a greenhouse experiment to evaluate whether simulated herbivory (i) causes greater fitness losses in the shade, and (ii) modifies plant functional responses to shading. Changes in functional traits were measured at the biochemical, leaf, shoot and whole-plant levels, in seedlings of the light-demanding evergreen tree Aristotelia chilensis (Elaeocarpaceae), which is endemic to South American austral forests.
   3. We hypothesized that plant responses to shade would be constrained by herbivory due to within-plant limitations in resource availability and/or antagonistic interactions between responses to shade and herbivory. We further expected that this limitation would result in a greater field mortality of damaged plants in forest understory as compared to open sites.
   4. Simulated herbivory (50% defoliation) on field seedlings decreased 8-month plant survival in the shade (forest understory) but not in the sun (canopy gaps) in a temperate rainforest. Likewise, simulated herbivory in the greenhouse decreased plant growth rate and final biomass in the shade treatment but not in the sun treatment.
   5. The phenotypic responses to shading of seven traits were constrained by simulated herbivory: chlorophyll, leaf shape, leaf blade angle, petiole angle, SLA (specific leaf area), internodes length and total leaf area. A path-analysis showed that most of these constrained responses were uncorrelated to each other. Some of these results might be explained by antagonistic interactions between molecules or pathways involved in plant responses to shading and herbivory. Four functional traits exhibited greater responses to shading in damaged plants: A(max) (Photosynthetic rate), foliar carbon, shoot : root ratio and LMR (leaf mass ratio); but most of them resulted from correlated changes in SLA.
   6. The present study undertook a mechanistic approach to the often observed pattern of greater impact of herbivore damage on plant performance in low light environments. The central finding of this study is that the unraveling of herbivory-constrained plant functional responses to shading may explain the often observed greater fitness losses due to herbivory in the shade. It is also suggested that herbivory pressure is an underestimated factor in pioneer species distribution along the light gradient.

AB A central challenge in community ecology is to predict patterns of biodiversity with mechanistic models. The neutral model of biodiversity is a simple model that appears to provide parsimonious and accurate predictions of biodiversity patterns in some ecosystems, even though it ignores processes such as species interactions and niche structure. In a recent paper, we used analytical techniques to reveal why the mean predictions of the neutral model are robust to niche structure in high diversity but not low-diversity ecosystems. In the present paper, we explore this phenomenon further by generating stochastic simulated data from a spatially implicit hybrid niche-neutral model across different speciation rates. We compare the resulting patterns of species richness and abundance with the patterns expected from a pure neutral and a pure niche model. As the speciation rate in the hybrid model increases, we observe a surprisingly rapid transition from an ecosystem in which diversity is almost entirely governed by niche structure to one in which diversity is statistically indistinguishable from that of the neutral model. Because the transition is rapid, one prediction of our abstract model is that high-diversity ecosystems such as tropical forests can be approximated by one simple model-the neutral model-whereas low-diversity ecosystems such as temperate forests can be approximated by another simple model-the niche model. Ecosystems that require the hybrid model are predicted to be rare, occurring only over a narrow range of speciation rates.

AB Brazil has 109 million hectares of sustainable use reserves (SURs), most of them in Amazonia. In practical terms, SURs are being created to meet several objectives, but this process can and should be improved. The absence of a clear goal and the lack of basic social and biological information for such areas can compromise the goals, frustrate the people demanding the SURs and complicate the selection of the most adequate size, shape and category to be adopted. The data collection process used in the creation and management of protected areas is often compromised by under-funded environmental agencies, a lack of qualified human resources or the unawareness of accessible, quick, simple and inexpensive geographical methodologies able to facilitate such processes. The dissemination of tools and methods oriented to improve the management of and the decision-making process for protected areas in such adverse scenarios is necessary. Here we describe the execution of a participatory geographic information system (PGIS) to gain information on how human populations are living and using natural resources in the Maues State Forest, an SUR in Brazilian Amazonia. The PGIS allowed data acquisition for 415 families, 444 houses, 597 agricultural and animal-raising areas, 138 fishing sites, 106 hunting sites and 225 extraction sites within a short period of time (<than 20 days) and with accessible costs (<US$ 10,000). We classified and located the activities and points being used, the areas under stronger pressure and the hotspots for conservation, estimating that nearly 30% of the reserve was under direct use by its residents. We discuss the conservation implications of our findings and strongly recommend that the collection and mapping of socio-economic information should be prerequisite before the creation of any SURs in Brazilian Amazonia.

AB Ecological networks (ENs) are used to mitigate landscape-scale habitat loss, and are managed and designed to conserve regional biodiversity. In our study region in southern Africa, ENs of isolated grassland remnants are specifically set aside and managed for conservation, and are complemented by corridor-like power line servitudes which are maintained by regular mowing. Using grasshoppers, a sensitive and reliable bioindicator taxon, we determine whether ENs effectively conserve biodiversity. We used cluster analysis and variation partitioning to select the best subset of environmental variables which explained the patterns of species composition. We then compared the relative importance of environmental variables grouped by the scale of their influence: local-scale variables affected by management practices vs. landscape-scale variables affected by design of ENs. Management was consistently and significantly 2-5 times more influential than design in determining grasshopper assemblages within ENs and servitudes. Servitudes had a higher proportion of bare ground, lower proportion of tall grasses and higher abundance of grasshoppers relative to ENs. Three grasshopper species were strongly associated with servitudes and exhibited traits consistent with early colonizers. As management actions are primarily responsible for vegetation succession, the use of ENs for conservation efforts should first focus on appropriate management strategies, such as fire regime and grass height management before altering the landscape structure (e. g. increasing connectivity or enlarging patches). The conservation implications of these results are that, if ENs are managed and designed for heterogeneity and to simulate multiple successional stages, they may be beneficial for biodiversity conservation.

AB Leaf-cutting ants in the genus Atta F. (Formicidae, Attini) are among the most important pest arthropods in Central and South America, consuming more vegetation than any other animal group. Among the organisms attacking ants in nature, flies of the family Phoridae have been proposed as the most promising biocontrol agents for pest ants. Four phorid species, Apocephalus setitarsus Brown, Myrmosicarius brandaoi Disney, Myrmosicarius gonzalezae Disney, and Eibesfeldtphora trilobata Disney, were reared from ants collected at Atta vollenweideri Forel nests and off foraging trails in Santa Fe province in Argentina. E. trilobata attacked larger ants and had bigger adults than the other species, also exhibiting the longest developmental time. Correlations between size of hosts and size of adults, as well as between size of adults and developmental times, could be established only in some cases. No differences were found between the sizes of the hosts from which males and females emerged. The natural percentage of parasitism varied throughout the seasons and seemed to be influenced by the extreme drought affecting the study site. We discuss why all four species would be suitable candidates for integrating an assemblage of biocontrol agents against A. vollenweideri.

AB High deforestation rates in Amazonia have motivated considerable efforts to monitor forest changes with satellite images, but mapping forest distribution and monitoring change at a regional scale remain a challenge. This article proposes a new approach based on the integrated use of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images to rapidly map forest distribution in Rondonia, Brazil. The TM images are used to differentiate forest and non-forest areas and the MODIS images are used to extract three fraction images (vegetation, shade and soil) with linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA). A regression model is built to calibrate the MODIS-derived forest results. This approach is applied to the MODIS image in 2004 and is then transferred to other MODIS images. Compared to INPE PRODES (Brazil's Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - Programme for the Estimation of Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon) data, the errors for total forest area estimates in 2000, 2004 and 2006 are -0.97%, 0.81% and -1.92%, respectively. This research provides a promising approach for mapping fractional forest (proportion of forest cover area in a pixel) distribution at a regional scale. The major advantage is that this procedure can rapidly provide the spatial and temporal patterns of fractional forest cover distribution at a regional scale by the integrated use of MODIS images and a limited number of Landsat images.

AB The objective of this study was to compare various plant traits of native and invasive conspecifics of the tall form of Spartina alterniflora to test the genetic shift hypothesis, which predicts that due to genetic differences invasive plants may have different performance. We conducted a controlled experiment with six populations of the tall form of S. alterniflora: three transported from its introduced range in Jiangsu Province, China, and three from its native range in Georgia, USA. Plants were grown in a greenhouse and subjected to one of two levels of nitrogen availability for several months. Growth, biomass accumulation, biomass allocation, and photosynthetic and morphological traits, as well as the corresponding trait plasticities, were measured and compared between the populations. Nitrogen addition significantly affected individual traits of both invasive Jiangsu and native Georgia S. alterniflora populations, with invasive populations having stronger responses to nitrogen addition in RGR, total biomass, total leaf number (TLN), total leaf area (TLA) and maximum culm height (MxCH) than native populations according to the results of both reaction norms and the relative distance plasticity index (RDPI). Invasive S. alterniflora was more vigorous than its native conspecific as shown by greater total biomass and higher light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Pm). Several morphological traits (MxCH, UN and LAR) and most of the biomass allocation traits of invasive populations were found to differ from native populations. Our results indicated probable genetic shifts in plant traits in the introduced populations relative to the native populations of the tall form of S. alterniflora. Such genetic shifts may play a vital role in their success as invasive plants. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The response of animal communities to habitat quality and fragmentation may vary depending on microhabitat associations of species. For example, sensitivity of species to woody habitat fragmentation should increase with their degree of association with woody plants. We investigated effects of local and landscape factors on spider communities in different microhabitats within Swiss apple orchards. We expected a stronger negative effect of woody habitat fragmentation on spiders inhabiting tree canopies compared to spiders living in the meadow. The 30 orchards that we sampled varied in woody habitat amount and isolation at landscape and patch scales. Local factors included management intensity and plant diversity. Spiders associated with meadow were affected by plant diversity, but not by fragmentation. In contrast, spiders associated with canopies responded to isolation from other woody habitats. Surprisingly, we found both positive and negative effects of habitat isolation on local abundance. This indicates that differences in dispersal and/or biotic interactions shape the specific response to habitat isolation. The relative importance of local and landscape factors was in accordance with the microhabitat of the spiders. Thus, considering microhabitat associations can be important for identifying processes that would be overlooked if sampling were pooled for the whole habitat.

AB In open ecological systems, community structure can be determined by physically modulated processes such as the arrival of individuals from a regional pool and by local biological interactions. There is debate centering on whether niche differentiation and local interactions among species are necessary to explain macroscopic community patterns or whether the patterns can be generated by the neutral interplay of dispersal and stochastic demography among ecologically identical species. Here we evaluate how much of the observed spatial variation within a rocky intertidal metacommunity along 800 km of coastline can be explained by drift in the structure of recruits across 15 local sites. Our results show that large spatial changes in recruitment do not explain the observed spatial variation in adult local structure and that, in comparison with the large drift in structure of recruits, local adult communities converged to a common, although not unique, structure across the region. Although there is no unique adult community structure in the entire region, the observed variation represents only a small subset of the possible structures that would be expected from passive recruitment drift. Thus, in this diverse system our results do not support the idea that rocky intertidal metacommunities are structured by neutral mechanisms.

AB 1. As mature tropical forests disappear, secondary forests with their potential to conserve mature tropical forest species are increasingly of interest in a conservation context.
   2. We investigated the recovery of litter inhabiting beetle diversity and composition during natural forest regeneration in the coastal submontane forest of Southern Brazil, using chronosequences on two different soil types: cambisol and gleysol. Secondary forests, ranging in ages from 5 to 50 years, as well as old-growth forests were studied. Beetles were sifted from leaf litter and extracted using the Winkler technique.
   3. Young secondary forests had a very low species density and a significantly different and heterogeneous species composition compared to old-growth forests. During forest regeneration, species density greatly increased and the species composition of older secondary forests was similar to that of old-growth forests. The recovery pattern of species density and composition differed between soil types; nonetheless, they showed the same tendencies generally. Thus, mature secondary forests of about 35-50 years can be assumed to contribute substantially to the maintenance of forest beetle species.
   4. Litter quantity was not only significantly correlated with species density; but, even reflected the density pattern of both soil types. Thus, litter quantity is an important factor for maintaining or recovering high beetle densities. The composition of beetle assemblages was strongly affected by soil type. Thus, soil type should be considered in regional biodiversity monitoring and conservation actions.

AB Fire plays an important role in determining the structure of the vegetation of savannas. Consequently, frequent fires are expected to assemble closely related plant species with very similar fire-related functional traits. We assessed the influence of different fire frequencies on patterns of co-occurrence of woody species at a fine spatial scale in Brazilian savannas. We used quantile regressions to test the relationship between co-occurrence indices and both phylogenetic distances and functional differences, calculated for every possible pair of species. Our results indicated that fire changes the pattern of co-occurrence of woody plants. Functionally different Species co-occurred predominantly in a site protected from fire, whereas functionally similar species co-occurred predominantly in sites frequently burned. However, we did not find correlations between co-occurrence and phylogenetic distance of species, due probably to the random distribution of some functional traits in the phylogeny of savanna species. Thus, fire acts as an important environmental filter at fine spatial scales in Brazilian savannas, promoting functional - but not phylogenetic - Clustering of plants. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Phenotypic plasticity of the two salt marsh grasses Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis in salt marshes is crucial to their invasive ability, but the importance of phenotypic plasticity, nitrogen levels, and intraspecific competition to the success of the two species is unclear at present. Spartina alterniflora Loisel. is an extensively invasive species that has increased dramatically in distribution and abundance on the Chinese and European coasts, and has had considerable ecological impacts in the regions where it has established. Meanwhile, Phragmites australis Cav., a native salt marsh species on the east coast of China, has replaced the native S. alterniflora in many marshes along the Atlantic Coast of the US. This study determined the effects of nitrogen availability and culm density on the morphology, growth, and biomass allocation traits of Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis. A large number of morphological, growth, and biomass parameters were measured, and various derived values (culm: root ratio, specific leaf area, etc.) were calculated, along with an index of phenotypic plasticity. Nitrogen addition significantly affected growth performance and biomass allocation traits of Spartina alterniflora, and culm density significantly affected morphological characteristics in a negative way, especially for Spartina alterniflora. However, there were no significant interactions between nitrogen levels and culm density on the morphological parameters, growth performances parameters, and biomass allocation parameters of the two species. Spartina alterniflora appears to respond more strongly to nitrogen than to culm density and this pattern of phenotypic plasticity appears to offer an expedition for successful invasion and displacement of Phramites australias in China. The implication of this study is that, in response to the environmental changes that are increasing nitrogen levels, the range of Spartina alterniflora is expected to continue to expand on the east coast of China.

AB Liana-dominated forest patches constitute 15-20% of old-growth forests in the Eastern Amazon but are generally excluded from management for timber production. Here we ask if liana-dominated patches may be brought into production by clearing lianas and conducting enrichment planting (EP) of native timber species. We present growth results from 8 years of such EP trials. Rapid growth and low mortality of all species in this study suggest that EP in cleared liana patches can contribute to timber stocks in second and third harvests of managed forests. The most vigorous individuals of Parkia gigantocarpa and Schizolobium amazonicum in each enrichment site grew more than I cm diameter per year (rates were initially >2 cm yr (1)), and attained dominant canopy positions and diameters equal to those of small canopy trees in the surrounding forest within 8 years of planting (mean dbh similar to 18 cm and similar to 20 cm, respectively, at year 8). Limited data on Ceiba pentandra plantings indicate a similar trajectory for this species (dbh similar to 40 cm in 8 years) The most vigorous Swietenta macrophylla grew at least 1 cm per year in enrichment plots (mean dbh similar to 10 cm in 8 years), but take longer to attain dominant positions. Tabebuia serratifolia may take much longer to reach the canopy than other species tested (rates <1 m yr(-1)). We attribute the excellent performance to light availability; planting in intact soil with minimal compaction and abundant organic material: and low competition rates maintained by periodic thinning of competing vegetation.
   Operational, ecological, and regulation questions must be addressed before EP of liana patches can be added to the menu of silvicultural options for Amazonian forests. Enrichment planting involves ecological and financial costs and uncertainties, and techniques need refinement. We caution against authorizing this silvicultural practice on more than a pilot scale until adequate information and resources exist for effective, responsible use of this technique.

DE Ants; Camponotus; Chiroptera; Diet; Nuptial flight; Rhinopoma
ID PREY SELECTION; ECOLOGY; HABITS
AB In many ant species, nuptial flight tends to be short in time and assumed to be synchronous across a large area. Here, we report that, in the upper Jordan Valley, northern Israel, massive nuptial flights of Carpenter ants (Camponotus sp.) occur frequently throughout the summer, and their alates form up to 90% of the diet of the greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum) during this period. This fat and protein-rich diet enables female bats to lactate during summer, and the large amount of fat that both sexes accumulate may serve as an energy source for their following winter hibernation and posthibernation mating in early spring (March-April). We suggest that the annual movement of these bats to the Mediterranean region of Israel may have evolved in order to enable them to exploit the extremely nutritious forms of ant alates when the bats' energetic demands are highest.

AB We present new comparative data on early floral development of Heliconia latispatha, an ecologically and horticulturally important tropical plant within the order Zingiberales. Modification of the six members of two androecial whorls is characteristic of Zingiberales. with a reduction in number of fertile stamen from five or six in the banana families (Musaceae, Strelitziaceae, Lowiaceae, and Heliconiaceae) to one in Costaceae and Zingiberaceae and one-half in Marantaceae and Cannaceae. The remaining five infertile stamens in these later four families (the ginger families) are petaloid, and in Costaceae and Zingiberaceae fuse together to form a novel structure. the labellum. Within this developmental sequence, Heliconiaceae share with the ginger families the possession of an antisepalous staminode, a synapomorphy that has been used to place Heliconiaceae as sister to the ginger family clade. Here, we use epi-illumination light microscopy and reconstruction of serial sections to investigate the ontogeny of the Heliconia flower with emphasis on the ontogeny of the staminode. We compare floral development in Heliconia with that previously described for other species of Zingiberales. A comparison of floral structure and development across Zingiberales is presented to better understand the evolution of the flower in this charismatic group of tropical plants.

AB Question: Does shifting cultivation contribute to plant diversity in an Afrotropical semi-deciduous forest lacking large-scale natural disturbance?
   Location: Sanaimbo forest, Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast).
   Methods: We surveyed species assemblages, structural attributes of diversity, and life-history traits along a 30-year chronosequence of abandoned fields, comparatively to old-growth and selectively logged forest stands.
   Results: Patterns of species assemblages strongly changed with fallow area age, with respect to species' light requirements, suggesting niche partitioning along the successional gradient. Species richness, diversity and equitability were all increasing along this gradient. There were clear shifts in life-history traits spectra as the forest recovered, especially regarding leaf shape, lifespan and hairiness, diaspore dispersal, seed size, resprouting capacity, and life forms. Early colonization by the invasive Chromolaena odorata did not appear to impair secondary succession. Soil type influenced old-growth forest vegetation but not fallow vegetation. After 30 years of forest regrowth, plant communities exhibited endemism rates similar to those of ancient forests.
   Conclusions: Shifting cultivation appears to be a sustainable land use when small-sized fields are embedded in a forest matrix and when agriculture lasts only one to few years, preserves remnant trees, excludes fire and keeps several years between two clearing episodes. It may even contribute to the high biodiversity maintenance at the whole forest scale, by conserving the successional mosaic. However, conservation of old-growth forest patches is required for a number of climax tree species.

AB The biodiversity and distribution patterns of epiphytic hydroids were studied in kelpforests (composed of Laminaria digitata, Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta) located in an Arctic glaciated fiord (Hornsund, west Spitsbergen). In total, twenty-eight species were found colonizing algae, stones connected to holdfast, and overgrowing the surface of other animals associated with kelps. The characteristics of the algal host (e.g. algae species, age, rhizoid volume or biomass) did not show any effect upon hydroid species richness or species composition. High hydroid biodiversity was strongly dependent on microsubstrate heterogeneity. The highest biodiversity as well as frequency of hydroid occurrence were noted at a site located furthest from the glacier and characterized by the lowest sediment concentration and sedimentation rate. Sexual reproduction also seemed to be inhibited by glacier-derived disturbance. Of ten fertile species found at the 'clearest' site only two were fertile at sites under the strong influence of such perturbations. Potential physical drivers of species occurrence were linked to the activity of tidal glaciers, particularly to high loads of mineral sedimentation and iceberg scouring.

AB In this study, we used fire count datasets derived from Along Track Scanning Radiometer ( ATSR) satellite to characterize spatial patterns in fire occurrences across highly diverse geographical, vegetation and topographic gradients in the Indian region. For characterizing the spatial patterns of fire occurrences, observed fire point patterns were tested against the hypothesis of a complete spatial random (CSR) pattern using three different techniques, the quadrat analysis, nearest neighbor analysis and Ripley's K function. Hierarchical nearest neighboring technique was used to depict the 'hotspots' of fire incidents. Of the different states, highest fire counts were recorded in Madhya Pradesh (14.77%) followed by Gujarat (10.86%), Maharastra (9.92%), Mizoram (7.66%), Jharkhand (6.41%), etc. With respect to the vegetation categories, highest number of fires were recorded in agricultural regions (40.26%) followed by tropical moist deciduous vegetation (12.72), dry deciduous vegetation(11.40%), abandoned slash and burn secondary forests (9.04%), tropical montane forests (8.07%) followed by others. Analysis of fire counts based on elevation and slope range suggested that maximum number of fires occurred in low and medium elevation types and in very low to low-slope categories. Results from three different spatial techniques for spatial pattern suggested clustered pattern in fire events compared to CSR. Most importantly, results from Ripley's K statistic suggested that fire events are highly clustered at a lag-distance of 125 miles. Hierarchical nearest neighboring clustering technique identified significant clusters of fire 'hotspots' in different states in northeast and central India. The implications of these results in fire management and mitigation were discussed. Also, this study highlights the potential of spatial point pattern statistics in environmental monitoring and assessment studies with special reference to fire events in the Indian region.

AB Equalising trade-offs, such as seed mass vs. number, have been invoked to reconcile neutral theory with observed differences between species. This is an appealing explanation for the dramatic seed size variation seen within guilds of otherwise similar plants: under size-symmetric competition, where resource capture is proportional to mass, the outcome of competition should be insensitive to whether species produce many small seeds or few large ones. However, under this assumption, stochastic variation in seed rain leads to exclusion of all but the smallest-seeded species. Thus stochasticity in seed arrivals, a process that was previously thought to generate drift, instead results in deterministic competitive exclusion. A neutral outcome is possible under one special case of a more general equalising framework, where seed mass affects survival but not competition. Further exploration of the feasibility of neutral trade-offs is needed to understand the respective roles of neutrality and niche structure in community dynamics.

AB In the Atlantic Montane Rain Forest of south-eastern Brazil, a field study was carried out to describe the forest disturbance regime, analyse canopy gap composition and evaluate the influence of habitat parameters on gap tree species composition. We characterized canopy gaps considering the group of variables as follows: area, type and number of tree/branch falls, topographic position, soil coverage and surrounding canopy trees. Gap composition was assessed at species level by measuring all individuals inside gaps higher than one meter. Mean gap area of the 42 canopy gaps analysed was 71.9 +/- 9.0 m(2) (mean +/- SE). Out of the studied gaps, 35.7% were created by uprooted and by snapped trees, 16.7% by dead-standing trees and 11.9% by the fall of large branches. The disturbance regime was characterized by gap openings predominantly smaller than 150 m(2) and by spatial patterning related to topography. Ridges had smaller gaps and higher proportions of gaps created by branch falls; slopes had bigger gaps generally created by uprooting events. The more abundant and frequent species were shade tolerant and the more species-rich families found inside gaps did not differ from the forest as a whole. Pioneer species were rare and restricted to medium and large size classes. The Indicator Species Analysis and the Canonical Correspondence Analysis indicated gap area, topography and the percentage of soil cover by the genera Calathea and Ctenanthe were the predominant variables correlated with woody species distribution. So, topography emerged as an important issue not only to the gap disturbance regime, but also to gap colonization. In respect to the influence of gap processes on the Atlantic Montane Rain Forest regeneration, our results support the view that canopy gap events may not be working as promoters of community wide floristic shifts.

AB Question: Several mechanisms have been proposed that control the spatio-temporal pattern of species coexistence. Among others, the species pool hypothesis states that the large-scale species pool is an important factor in controlling small-scale species richness through filtering of species that can persist within a species assemblage on the basis of their tolerance of the abiotic environment. Because of the process of environmental filtering, co-occurring species that experience similar environmental conditions are likely to be more taxonomically similar than ecologically distant species. This is because, due to the conservatism of many species traits during evolutionary diversification, the ability of species to colonize the same ecological space is thought to depend at least partially on their taxonomic similarity. The question for this study is: Under the assumption of trait conservatism, does environmental filtering lead to nonrandom species assemblages with respect to their taxonomic structure?
   Methods: The significance of taxonomic filtering in regulating species coexistence is tested using data from 15 local species assemblages from the urban flora of Rome ( Italy). To find out whether the taxonomic structure of the selected 'local' species assemblages was significantly different from random, we used a Monte Carlo simulation in which for each local species assemblage, the actual taxonomic diversity was compared to the taxonomic diversity of 1000 virtual species lists of the same size extracted at random from a larger 'regional' species pool.
   Results: We found that in most cases the local species assemblages have a higher degree of taxonomic similarity than would be expected by chance showing a phenomenon of 'species condensation' in a small number of higher-level taxa.
   Conclusions: Our observations support the species pool hypothesis and imply that environmental filtering is an important mechanism in shaping the taxonomic structure of species assemblages. Therefore, the incorporation of taxonomic diversity into landscape and community ecology may be beneficial for a better understanding of the processes that regulate species coexistence.

AB The Earth's temperature has increased 0.6 degrees C over the last 100 years, and further climate change is predicted to potentially raise it by 3.5 degrees C over the next century. More than half of the global annual net primary production of biomass is estimated to occur in the tropics, especially tropical evergreen forest. In temperate forests, increasing temperature may extend the non-frost growing season, and thus increase the CO2 sequestration rate, but some authors have also suggested a negative impact of warming in tropical forests from decreased photosynthetic activity. Using the PL model (Ricker and del Rio 2004), we forecast growth of two Mexican tree species after climate warming. The model predicts the high-mountain species Pinus hartwegii Lindl. to decrease its expected relative growth throughout its lifetime by 10.6% as a consequence of a 0.6 degrees C temperature increase; in contrast, the tropical rainforest species Diospyros digyna Jacq. is predicted to increase its expected relative growth throughout its lifetime by 25.4%. The key factor appears to be the expected relationship between temperature and precipitation, rather than temperature alone. While one cannot expect a universal response across sites, some standing tropical rainforests such as those at Los Tuxtlas in Mexico may constitute a carbon sink in a changing climate.

AB We characterised the among species variability in leaf gas exchange and morphological traits under controlled conditions of seedlings of 22 tropical rainforest canopy species to understand the origin of the variability in leaf carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) among species with different growth and dynamic characteristics (successional gradient). Our results first suggest that these species pursue a consistent strategy in terms of. throughout their ontogeny (juveniles grown here versus canopy adult trees from the natural forest). Second, leaf Delta was negatively correlated with WUE and N, and positively correlated with g(s), but among species differences in Delta were mainly explained by differences in WUE. Finally, species belonging to different successional groups display distinct leaf functional and morphological traits. We confirmed that fast growing early successional species maximise carbon assimilation with high stomatal conductance. In contrast, fast and slow growing late successional species are both characterised by low carbon assimilation values, but by distinct stomatal conductance and leaf morphological features. Along the successional gradient, these differences result in much lower Delta for the intermediate species (i.e. fast growing late successional) as compared to the two other groups.

AB Reduced-impact logging (RIL) has many demonstrated benefits to the industrial logging operations for which they were developed. It is less clear whether these gains remain consistent in smallholder forest systems that increasingly play an important role in global conservation and that target a broader suite of outputs in their management schemes. We evaluate potential ecological consequences of five RIL components (pre-harvest inventories, harvest intensity, cutting cycles, skid trail planning, and liana cutting) when applied to small-scale operations in the Brazilian Amazon and provide suggestions for modifications to RIL guidelines for smallholder systems. Rapid assessment inventories of the entire landholding should be a part of crop tree selection to minimize inbreeding and recruitment failure. Additionally, while community-based taxonomists accurately identify species to common names, botanical samples must be verified with herbarium specimens to avoid market and ecological problems when multiple species share a single common name. We advocate that smallholder managers move beyond an emphasis on RIL guidelines, while still incorporating its basic tenets into practical application. Based on our analysis, this would include evaluating benefits of particular RIL components and assessing potential advantages that smallholders have over industrial operations. We suggest incorporating anthropogenically-generated forest patches of varying sizes and successional stages into a more formalized management system, incorporating and expanding on traditional ecological knowledge acquired over generations, and integrating enrichment plantings and tending of regeneration.

AB Antbropogenic edge effects can compromise the conservation value of mature tropical forests. To date most edge-effect research in Amazonia has concentrated on forests in relatively seasonal locations or with poor soils in the east of the basin. We present the first evaluation from the relatively richer soils of far western Amazonia on the extent to which mature forest biomass, diversity, and composition are affected by edges. In a southwestern Amazonian landscape we surveyed woody plant diversity, species composition, and biomass in 88 x 0.1 ha samples of unflooded forest that spanned a wide range in soil properties and included samples as close as 50 m and as distant as > 10 km from anthropogenic edges. We applied Mantel tests, multiple regression on distance matrices, and other multivariate techniques to identify anthropogenic effects before and after accounting for soil factors and spatial autocorrelation. The distance to the nearest edge, accesspoint, and the geographical center of the nearest community ("anthropogenic-distance effects") all had no detectable effect on tree biomass or species diversity. Anthropogenic-distance effects on tree species composition were also below the limits of detection and were negligible in comparison with natural environmental and spatial factors. Analysis of the data set's capacity to detect anthropogenic effects confirmed that the forests were not severely affected by edges, although because our study had few plots within 100 m of forest edges, our confidence in patterns in the immediate vicinity of edges is limited. It therefore appears that the conservation value of most "edge" forests in this region has not yet been compromised substantially. We caution that because this is one case study it should not be overinterpreted, but one explanation for our findings may be that western Amazonian tree species are naturally faster growing and more disturbance adapted than those farther east.

AB In order to understand the impact of habitat changes on ecosystem processes caused by increased populations of elephants, elephant dung decomposition was studied in semi-arid Botswana. Dung decomposition rates were studied with and without the presence of arthropods, using pairs of exposed dung and dung enclosed in nylon-mesh bags, respectively. Dung decomposition rates were lower in the absence of arthropods. The rates in the late wet season were higher in the scrubland than in the woodland. In the early dry season, immediately after the wet season, the rates were higher in the woodland than in the scrubland. The difference in decomposition rates between habitats was attributed to microclimatic conditions created by vegetation cover. With regard to fungal succession, Cladosporium cladosporioides and Eurotium brefeldianum occurred only in the late stages of dung decomposition whereas Talaromyces helicus, Cercophora coprophila and Sporormiella minima occurred in all the stages. Although there was no significant difference in Shannon-Weiner fungal species diversity index between habitats, seasons, dung ages and laboratory incubation periods, there were significant differences in fungal community composition between these parameters. Species richness was higher in the late wet season than in the early dry season, indicating the importance of moist conditions for a large diversity of fungal species.

AB The molecular diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi colonizing roots of Podocarpus falcatus (Thunb.) R.Br. (Podocarpaceae) in the dry Afromontane forests of Ethiopia was investigated. The nuclear gene coding for small subunit ribosomal RNA (nucSSU rDNA) was amplified from colonized roots of P. falcatus, cloned, and sequenced using AM fungal specific primers. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the glomeromycetous sequences from mycorrhizae of P. falcatus belong to the Glomeraceae, Diversisporaceae, and Archaeosporaceae. Overall, 16 Glomus, three Diversispora, and one Archaeospora sequence types were identified. These sequence types were distinct and only distantly related to sequences from the available defined species. The composition of the AM fungal communities differed significantly between the two study sites. Comparison of the AM fungal community composition of P. falcatus with that of previously investigated Juniperus procera Hochst. ex Endl. (Cupressaceae), the only coexisting indigenous conifer tree species in the dry Afromontane forest ecosystem, yields that the two tree species are colonized by distinct AM fungal communities. This suggests that fungal communities are host plant specific in the natural stand conditions. Therefore, in the conservation of these endangered species and restoration of the degraded ecosystem, the use of appropriate mycorrhizal fungi should be taken into account in future projects.

AB Habitat fragmentation increases the migration distances among remnant populations, and is predicted to play a significant role in altering both demographic and genetic processes. Nevertheless, few studies have evaluated the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation in light of information about population dynamics in the same set of organisms. In a 10 000-km(2) experimentally fragmented landscape of rainforest reserves in central Amazonia, we examine patterns of genetic variation (amplified fragment length polymorphisms, AFLPs) in the epiphyllous (e.g. leaf-inhabiting) liverwort Radula flaccida Gott. Previous demographic work indicates that colonization rates in this species are significantly reduced in small forest reserves. We scored 113 polymorphic loci in 86 individuals representing five fragmented and five experimentally unmanipulated populations. Most of the variation (82%) in all populations was harboured at the smallest (400 m(2)) sampling unit. The mean ((+/-) SD) within-population genetic diversity (Nei's), of forest remnants (0.412 +/- 0.2) was indistinguishable from continuous (0.413 +/- 0.2) forests. Similarly, F-ST was identical among small (1- and 10-ha) and large (>= 100-ha) reserves (0.19 and 0.18, respectively), but linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci was significantly elevated in fragmented populations relative to those in continuous forests. These results illustrate that inferences regarding the long-term viability of fragmented populations based on neutral marker data alone must be viewed with caution, and underscore the importance of jointly evaluating information on both genetic structure and demography. Second, multilocus analyses may be more sensitive to the effects of fragmentation in the short term, although the effects of increasing linkage disequilibrium on population viability remain uncertain.

AB According to the Janzen-Connell model, high mortality of seeds and seedlings in proximity to conspecific adults can help maintain species diversity in tropical forests. Using a natural population of big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King), we tested the model's mechanism by examining seed predation and juvenile recruitment in the forest understory and in treefall gaps in the vicinity of both isolated and clumped adults. We used tethered seeds placed in three types of exclosure plots: (1) complete access to seeds, (2) semi-access (access by small-sized seed predators) and (3) no access (all mammals excluded). Exclosure treatments were applied within the understory (both near and far from adults) and in gaps at eight fruiting adults in the late dry season (2001) and scored ten months later. Significantly more seeds were removed in canopy gaps near clumped adults than at isolated adults; otherwise, none of the treatment factors significantly influenced seed predation. In contrast, understory juvenile recruitment was significantly enhanced by distance from adults and was twice as high at isolated than clumped adults, providing novel support for the Janzen-Connell mechanism. No-access exclosures protected significantly more seeds than semi- and full-access exclosures, implicating small mammals in seed losses. Across the eight trees, juvenile recruitment in the no-access exclosures decreased significantly with conspecific adult densities, implicating non-mammalian density-responsive factor(s) in mortality following germination; likely a known specialist invertebrate herbivore. When all treatments were combined, conspecific adult basal area and total DBH explained 72 and 90% of variation in overall juvenile recruitment, respectively. Collectively, these results indicate that Janzen-Connell effects can operate in S. macrophylla, especially during the seed-to-seedling transition, and will likely reduce recruitment in areas of high conspecific densities. They also suggest that further research into the causes of density-dependence in tropical trees should investigate mortality agents following germination.

AB Mammals are hypothesized to either promote plant diversity by preventing competitive exclusion or limit diversity by reducing the abundance of sensitive plant species through their activities as browsers or disturbance agents. Previous studies of herbivore impacts in plant communities have focused on tree species and ignored the herbaceous community. In an experiment in mature-phase, tropical moist forest sites in central Panama, we studied the impact of excluding ground-dwelling mammals on the richness and abundance of herbs in 16, 30x45-m plots. Within each plot, we censused the herbaceous community in 28, 2x2-m subplots (1,792 m 2 total area sampled). We identified over 54 species of herbs averaging 1.21 ramets m(-2) and covering approximately 4.25% of the forest floor. Excluding mammals for 5 years had no impact on overall species richness. Within exclosures, however, there was a significant two-fold increase in the density of rare species. Overall herbaceous density and percent cover did not differ between exclosures and adjacent control plots, although cover did increase over time. Mammalian exclusion significantly increased the total cover of three-dominant herb species, Pharus latifolius, Calathea inocephala, and Adiantum lucidum, but did not affect their density. This study represents one of the most extensive herbaceous community censuses conducted in tropical forests and is among a few that quantify herbaceous distribution and abundance in terms of both density and cover. Additionally, this work represents the first community level test of mammalian impacts on the herbaceous community in a tropical forest to date. Our results suggest that ground dwelling mammals do not play a key role in altering the relative abundance patterns of tropical herbs in the short term. Furthermore, our results contrast sharply with prior studies on similar temporal and spatial scales that demonstrate mammals strongly alter tree seedling composition and reduce seedling density. Thus, we question the pervasiveness of top-down control on tropical plant communities and the paradigm that defaunation will inexorably lead to widespread, catastrophic shifts in plant communities.

ID EXPERIMENTAL BURNS; FUELS; DYNAMICS; BIOMASS
AB Human-induced fires are a major disturbance in Baikiaea plurijuga woodland savannas that are economically important for timber production. Most fires occur during the late dry season, when they may severely damage woody plants. Prescribed burning during the early dry season is a management strategy to reduce fuel loads and thus the incidence of intense fires during the late dry season. There is, however, little information on fire behaviour characteristics of early dry season fires. We studied the relationship between experimental fuel conditions and fire behaviour by lighting 15 fires during the early dry season in a Baikiaea woodland. Fire intensity ranged from 25 to 1341 kW m(-1), while rate of spread of fire varied between 0.01 and 0.35 m s(-1). Fire intensity and rate of spread were positively related to flame height, leaf-scorch height and proportion of the area burnt. The relationships suggest that fire characteristics can be retrospectively determined using a variable such as scorch height. The grass fuel load, wind speed, relative humidity and to a lesser extent fuel moisture were important predictors of rate of spread, flame height, leaf-scorch height and proportion of the area burnt, with no impact due to the litter fuel load. The grass fuel load and wind speed had a positive effect on rate of spread, whereas relative humidity and fuel moisture had a negative effect. These findings indicate that managers can predict the likely damage to woody plants during an early dry season burn by assessing the grass fuel load and weather conditions at the time of burning.

Future management of these valuable ecosystems requires an integrative approach that takes into account complicated organismal interactions, oceanographic processes that span large scales of time and space, and how anthropogenic effects interact with the natural environment. The temperate west coasts of North and South America represent a unique opportunity for comparison, as many of the same oceanographic processes, particularly upwelling, occur off both coasts. Additionally, a number of marine ecosystems in both areas have surprising parallels. Here we present an overview of the oceanographic processes that dominate the coastlines, and give examples of ecosystems and the effects that oceanography, human activities and their interaction have on the communities.

AB Opportunities for dendrochronology in the tropics are rare because few locations experience seasonality strong enough to induce annual (or even dependably cyclic) ring formation in trees. Consequently, any such opportunities that exist are valuable and identifying them is worth investing time and effort. West Indian pine (Pinus occidentalis Swartz) is endemic to the island of Hispaniola (19degreesN, 71degreesW). It has previously been shown not to produce useful rings in low-elevation (<2000m) stands. We investigated its potential in small (4-11 tree) sample sets from four sites between 2000m and 3000m where seasonality of temperature and precipitation is more pronounced. Primary growth rings were distinct at all sites. False rings, diffuse rings, pinching rings and micro-rings were also present, and their number varied considerably by site. Quality of ring formation appeared to increase with both moisture stress (elevation, exposure, edaphic factors) and cold stress (elevation, exposure, cold-air drainage). We were able to cross-date samples (average interseries correlation = 0.44; average mean sensitivity = 0.44) from nine trees at the highest-elevation site, and that chronology correlated significantly (r = - 0.45, P < 0.001) with monthly and seasonal maximum temperatures from a nearby meteorological station. This finding suggests a centuries-long reconstruction of temperature may be possible for this subtropical location. We conclude that, with careful site and tree selection, oversampling to allow exclusion of problematic specimens and greater use of complete cross-sections rather than cores, P. occidentalis may allow dendrochronological reconstruction of climate, fire history and other environmental processes that operate on the island of Hispaniola.

AB Enemy release of introduced plants and variation in herbivore pressure in relation to community diversity are presently discussed as factors that affect plant species invasiveness or habitat invasibility. So far few data are available on this topic and the results are inconclusive. We compared leaf herbivory between native and invasive woody plants on Mahe, the main island of the tropical Seychelles. We further investigated variation in leaf herbivory on three abundant invasive species along an altitudinal gradient (50-550m a.s.l.). The median percentage of leaves affected by herbivores was significantly higher in native species (50%) than in invasive species (27%). In addition, the species suffering from the highest leaf area loss were native to the Seychelles. These results are consistent with the enemy release hypothesis (ERH). While the invasive species showed significant and mostly consistent variation in the amount of leaf damage between sites, this variation was not related to general altitudinal trends in diversity but rather to local variation in habitat structure and diversity. Our results indicate that in the Seychelles invasive woody plants profit from herbivore release relative to the native species and that the amount of herbivory, and therefore its effect on species invasiveness or habitat invasibility, may be dependent on local community structure and composition.

AB Over several fruiting seasons, the fates of seeds placed in recently burnt habitats, and one habitat unburnt for more than 10 years, were used to examine the impact of fire on seed predation levels in the endangered species Grevillea caleyi from southeastern Australia. Native rodents. Rattus fuscipes, and macropods. Wallabia bicolor, were responsible for seed losses after seeds fell below parent plants. Virtually all seeds (99-100%) were lost to these mammals for the first two fruiting seasons after a wildfire. Such losses usually exceeded pre-fire loss estimates or estimates from a site unburnt for more than 10 years. There was no significant difference in seed losses to mammals in three recently burnt sites over four fruiting seasons. However, there was a slight trend for some seed escape (seed losses 91-97%) acid a slowing of the rate of seed loss in the fourth fruiting season after fire. Time since the last fire accounted for some 60% of the estimated variation in magnitude of seed losses to mammals. These results suggest that in the endangered, fire-sensitive G. caleyi, replenishment of the soil seed bank after fire is severely retarded by mammal seed predation. The implications are that after a fire, G. caleyi should be protected from the risk of a future fire well beyond three times the primary juvenile period in the species or local extinction will occur.

AB Seedlings of nine tropical forest tree species were grown outdoors in open-top chambers at ambient and elevated (two times ambient) CO2 concentrations at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Republic of Panama. Plants were kept individually in large pots and received non-limiting supplies of water and mineral nutrients. The enhancement of biomass accumulation at elevated CO2 increased with increasing relative growth rates (RGR) of species at ambient CO2. Early successional pioneer trees (Cecropia longipes, Ficus insipida, Castilla elastica, Antirrhoea trichantha, Luehea seemannii, Pseudobombax septenatum) grew rapidly, and, at the end of 25 to 39 day treatments, dry matter accumulation was 74 +/- 26% higher at elevated than at ambient CO2 (mean increase +/- SD, n = 6). By contrast, seedlings of three late successional tree species (Calophyllum longifolium, Tetragastris panamensis, Virola surinamensis) grew slowly and, over an 84 day period, elevated CO2 led to either no (C. longifolium, T. panamensis) or only small enhancement in dry matter accumulation (V. surinamensis). These different responses to CO2 enrichment are a result of differences in growth kinetics between early and late successional species at ambient CO2 rather than a result of intrinsic physiological differences in CO2 responsiveness between plants from these two functional groups.

AB Overgrowth relationships in the fossil record of encrusting organisms on marine hard substrata have been used to infer success in competitive interactions, particularly for modular organisms such as colonial invertebrates and coralline algae. However, this interpretation has been questioned to varying extent-even by those who have used the procedure-because of the possibility that any individual observation may represent growth over a senescent organism or dead skeletal remains. Where sufficient numbers of overgrowth relationships are available to demonstrate that the proportions of overgrowths between two modular taxa are not essentially equal, the competitive superiority of the more frequently overgrowing taxon should be accepted. The degree of success of the more frequently overgrowing taxon was at least as great as seen in the fossil record and was probably substantially greater, depending upon the percent of bare surface on the substratum.

AB The word ''stand-off' has been used with different meanings by different authors in studies of interspecific space competition by sessile organisms. Most of them have treated stand-off as an outcome of secondary importance to those of wins and losses in the interactions. Here, it is postulated that stand-off should be treated as an important competitive outcome equal in status to wins and losses. On this assumption, a new type of index system composed of three indices: win, loss, and stand-off is proposed to measure the degree of intransitivity among sessile organisms at a given locality. Intransitivity can be defined as the state in which all species have equal probability to be overgrown by others. Here, a community is divided into five according to the competitive ranking of the organisms, namely, network due to stand-off, neutral system due to equal win-loss and stand-off, hierarchically dominant, network due to win-loss dominant and a neutral system of the last two types. The method of its determination and its merits over the index proposed by earlier and are discussed with the help of field data collected on interspecific interactions among sessile organisms on PVC panels suspended in Tomioka Bay, Japan. Data presented by other investigators, which differed each other in the number of stand-offs, were also used to test the merits of our index system.

AB We describe an easy and inexpensive way to determine whether intertidal microhabitats remain wet during tidal emersion. This new technique uses agarose beads (120 mum diameter when fully hydrated) that shrink in a graded fashion as they dry. The agarose beads allow variability in surface wetness to be gauged over distances of less than 1 mm. Describing this parameter of microclimate is important in order to predict the likelihood and spatial pattern of survival of settled larvae, reproductive propagules, and other microscopic stages in the life histories of organisms growing in intertidal and other water-stressed environments. For the brown seaweed Pelvetia fastigiata (J. Ag.) DeToni (Fucales, Phaeophyta), the use of agarose beads demonstrated that survival of zygotes during tidal emersion was highest at those sites that remain damp. Temperature alone was found to be an unreliable measure Of wetness within a single microhabitat (e.g. red algal turf).

AB The ability of ecosystems to withstand disturbances and maintain their functions is being increasingly tested as rates of change intensify due to climate change and other human activities. Microorganisms are crucial players underpinning ecosystem functions, and the recovery of microbial communities from disturbances is therefore a key part of the complex processes determining the fate of ecosystem functioning. However, despite global environmental change consisting of numerous pressures, it is unclear and controversial how multiple disturbances affect microbial community stability and what consequences this has for ecosystem functions. This is particularly the case for those multiple or compounded disturbances that occur more frequently than the normal recovery time. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the mechanisms that can govern the responses of microbes to multiple disturbances across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We first summarize and discuss properties and mechanisms that influence resilience in aquatic and soil biomes to determine whether there are generally applicable principles. Following, we focus on interactions resulting from inherent characteristics of compounded disturbances, such as the nature of the disturbance, timing, and chronology that can lead to complex and nonadditive effects that are modulating the response of microorganisms.

AB Our ability to describe the highly diverse pool of low abundance populations present in natural microbial communities is increasing at an unprecedented pace. Yet we currently lack an integrative view of the key taxa, functions and metabolic activity which make-up this communal pool, usually referred to as the 'rare biosphere', across the domains of life. In this context, this review examines the microbial rare biosphere in its broader sense, providing an historical perspective on representative studies which enabled to bridge the concept from macroecology to microbial ecology. It then addresses our current knowledge of the prokaryotic rare biosphere, and covers emerging insights into the ecology, taxonomy and evolution of low abundance microeukaryotic, viral and host-associated communities. We also review recent methodological advances and provide a synthetic overview on how the rare biosphere fits into different conceptual models used to explain microbial community assembly mechanisms, composition and function.

With the help of Super-CCR model, coupling coordination model and spatial panel models, the coupling coordination degree of forest ecological security and forestry management efficiency, and its spatiotemporal pattern characteristics and influencing factors of each province in China from 2003 to 2017 were measured and analyzed. Results showed that, first, in terms of forestry management efficiency, the number of DEA-efficiency provinces increased between 2003 and 2017, yet was still below 50% of all provinces. Efficiency values of most provinces in the Southern Forest Region increased significantly, whereas those of the Northern Forest Region decreased. In terms of forest ecological security, the index increased overall, with most high-value areas in the Northeast, Southwest, and Southern Forest Regions. Second, coupling coordination degree varied from near no coordination to intermediate coordination. Except for a decline in the Northern Region, the degree of coupling coordination in the other regions demonstrated an upward trend, with the growth from high to low in the Southern, Southwest and Northeast Forest Region. Spatially, high values appeared mainly in the Southern and Southwest Forest Regions, while low values mainly concentrated in the Northern Forest Region. Third, coupling coordination was affected by many factors, including nature, population, economy, society, and technological progress, driving temporal patterns and regional differences. This study provides a theoretical reference framework for decision making for forest management in China. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is growing use of economic incentives such as Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) to encourage sustainable land management. An important critique is that such approaches may unintentionally disrupt environmental and social values, 'crowding out' pre-existing motivations to conserve. Some scholars suggest that the use of in-kind payments and norm-based framing, rather than financial transfers and a market framing, can mitigate these risks. There are calls to use more robust methods for impact evaluation in environmental policy. We use one of the only Randomized Controlled Trials of a conservation incentive scheme to evaluate its impact on self-stated environmental and social values and beliefs. Data from before and after the intervention, from households in villages randomly selected to receive the program or not, demonstrate that the program increased prioritization of environmental values (evidence of crowding-in as opposed to crowding out) and altered social beliefs related to inequality and the role of government. The findings demonstrate that this conservation program had a positive impact on environmental values and increased the belief that government involvement is appropriate. The scheme, with its use of in-kind payments and reciprocity framing, offers lessons to those seeking to develop effective schemes to incentivize positive environmental stewardship.

AB Crops have different strategies to acquire poorly-available soil phosphorus (P) which are dependent on their architectural, morphological, and physiological root traits, but their capacity to enhance P acquisition varies with the type of fertilizer applied. The objective of this study was to examine how P-acquisition strategies of three main crops are affected by the application of sewage sludges, compared with a mineral P fertilizer. We carried out a 3-months greenhouse pot experiment and compared the response of P-acquisition traits among wheat, barley and canola in a soil amended with three sludges or a mineral P fertilizer. Results showed that the P-acquisition strategy differed among crops. Compared with canola, wheat and barley had a higher specific root length and a greater root carboxylate release and they acquired as much P from sludge as from mineral P. By contrast, canola shoot P content was greater with sludge than with mineral P. This was attributed to a higher root-released acid phosphatase activity which promoted the mineralization of sludge-derived P-organic. This study showed that contrasted P-acquisition strategies of crops allows increased use of renewable P resources by optimizing combinations of crop and the type of P fertilizer applied within the cropping system.

AB Rapid increase of nitrogen (N) deposition could alter nutrient availability, leading to changes in soil microbial processes and ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling. However, the effects of N deposition on soil microbes remain elusive in the tropical rainforests in Asia. Here, we conducted a 3-year N addition experiment with four treatments (0, 20, 50, and 100kg N ha(-1)year(-1)) in a primary and secondary tropical montane forest in Hainan Island, China, to explore the effects of elevated N availability on soil microbial community composition. We also conducted a phosphorus (P) treatment (50kg P ha(-1)year(-1)) and a N + P treatment (50kg N ha(-1)year(-1)+50kg P ha(-1)year(-1)) to examine potential P limitation driven by N deposition in highly weathered tropical soils, using a bar-coded pyrosequencing technique. The composition of soil bacterial communities differed dramatically between the primary and secondary forests, but not significant dissimilarity among the fertilization treatments. The community composition, phylogenetic diversity and phylotype richness were significantly correlated with soil pH, total organic C (TOC), and total N (TN), respectively. There were significant differences between the primary and secondary forest in pH, TOC, and TN, but not among the fertilization treatments. These results suggest that differences in soil nutrient status between the primary and secondary forests due to different successional stages rather than chronic N fertilization may be the major factor affecting soil bacterial composition in the tropical montane rainforests.

AB We explore the role of mining in contributing to deforestation across 300 plus districts in India. Using a unique dataset, covering the period 2001-2014, the impact of mining related deforestation is delineated from those driven by various socio-economic, demographic and climatic factors. The roles of several minerals, such as coal, iron, bauxite, dolomite, limestone, manganese, quartz, fireclay and granite are explicitly tested using econometric analysis. Findings indicate that, on average, a district that did not produce any of the minerals considered in the study had suffered about 350 km(2) lower forest area loss compared to a mineral producing district. Districts that produced coal, iron or limestone, saw on average 450 km(2) higher forest cover loss compared to those that did not produce the same minerals. Iron ore production was positively associated with barren land area across districts, whereas forest cover loss was higher in districts that produced higher amounts of limestone or granite. Overall, mining has evidently contributed to deforestation at a district level, and within the mineral groups considered in this study, coal, iron and limestone have had the most adverse impact on forest area loss. However, minerals such as fireclay, manganese, dolomite, and quartz are being produced in districts that have seen either a lower deforestation rate or an improvement in forest area over the study period. Among the non-mining related drivers of deforestation, higher share of cropping area in a district's geographical area significantly contributed to deforestation.

AB Naturally fragmented landscapes provide suitable scenarios through which to investigate patch and landscape effects on biodiversity patterns in areas that are isolated from the disturbances usually associated with human made fragments. We aimed to investigate the patch and landscape effects on the diversity of forest-dependent and matrix-tolerant dung beetles in a naturally fragmented landscape. We also assessed the influence that seasonal and vegetation variations had on these dung beetles. We sampled dung beetles during two summers and two winters in 14 forest islands of various sizes and shapes within a natural mountainous forest archipelago in southeast Brazil. We measured the patch and landscape variables based on high-resolution multispectral images of circular sectors with radii of 100, 250, and 500 m. We used generalized linear mixed models to relate dung beetle metrics to patch and landscape attributes. The interaction between canopy cover and season influenced both species' richness and abundance of the dung beetle metacommunity. The forest-dependent species' richness increased with greater canopy cover, regardless of the season. Patch attributes (e.g., size, canopy cover, distance to the closest patch, and distance to continuous forest) and landscape attributes (e.g., percentage of forest in the landscape, total edge, number of patches, distance to the nearest neighbor, and shape complexity) had small general effects on dung beetle species as a whole and on matrix-tolerant species in particular. However, these values strongly influenced forest-dependent species' richness, abundance, and temporal beta diversity. The matrix-tolerant species, therefore, mask the effects of patch and landscape effects on forest-dependent species within the mountainous forest archipelago. In other words, the changes in these patch and landscape attributes influenced forest-dependent and matrix-tolerant species differently. Therefore, the evaluation of entire metacommunities may not be helpful when evaluating species-specific responses in mixed landscapes-a fact that impairs the conservation of forest-dependent species.

We measured individual characteristics (diameter at breast height, wood density, growth rate, crown illumination and crown form) and environmental conditions (soil fertility and habitat suitability) for 26 425 trees >= 10 cm diameter at breast height belonging to 416 species in a 52-ha plot in Lambir Hills National Park, Malaysia. We used structural equation models to investigate the relationships among the different factors and tree mortality. Crown form (a proxy for mechanical damage and other stresses) and prior growth were the two most important factors related to mortality. The effect of all variables on mortality (except habitat suitability) was substantially greater than expected by chance. Tree death is the result of interactions between factors, including direct and indirect effects. Crown form/damage and prior growth mediated most of the effect of tree size, wood density, fertility and habitat suitability on mortality. Large-scale assessment of crown form or status may result in improved prediction of individual tree death at the landscape scale.

AB Small forest patches embedded in agricultural (and peri-urban) landscapes in Western Europe play a key role for biodiversity conservation with a recognized capacity of delivering a wide suite of ecosystem services. Measures aimed to preserve these patches should be both socially desirable and ecologically effective. This study presents a joint ecologic and economic assessment conducted on small forest patches in Flanders (Belgium) and Picardie (N France). In each study region, two contrasted types of agricultural landscapes were selected. Open field (OF) and Bocage (B) landscapes are distinguished by the intensity of their usage and higher connectivity in the B landscapes. The social demand for enhancing biodiversity and forest structure diversity as well as for increasing the forest area at the expenses of agricultural land is estimated through an economic valuation survey. These results are compared with the outcomes of an ecological survey where the influence of structural features of the forest patches on the associated herbaceous diversity is assessed. The ecological and economic surveys show contrasting results; increasing tree species richness is ecologically more important for herbaceous diversity in the patch, but both tree species richness and herbaceous diversity obtain insignificant willingness to pay estimates. Furthermore, although respondents prefer the proposed changes to take place in the region where they live, we find out that social preferences and ecological effectiveness do differ between landscapes that represent different intensities of land use. Dwellers where the landscape is perceived as more "degraded" attach more value to diversity enhancement, suggesting a prioritization of initiatives in these area. In contrast, the ecological analyses show that prioritizing the protection and enhancement of the relatively better-off areas is more ecologically effective. Our study calls for a balance between ecological effectiveness and welfare benefits, suggesting that cost effectiveness studies should consider these approaches jointly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ants can display modified behaviors that represent the extended phenotypes of genes expressed by parasites that infect them. In such cases, the modifications benefit the parasite. Alternatively, displayed behaviors can represent host responses to infection that benefit colony fitness. Though some enigmatic examples of behavioral manipulation have been reported, parasitism of ants and its effects on ant behavior and ecology are generally poorly understood. Here, we summarize some of the present-day literature on parasite-ant interactions. Our main focus is on interactions that change host behavior so drastically that infected ants play a seemingly different societal and, perhaps, ecological role. We highlight the parallels that can be found across parasite-ant symbioses that result in manipulated behaviors, such as summiting, phototaxis, substrate biting, and wandering. We also point out the many present knowledge gaps that could be filled by efforts ranging from novel parasite discovery, to more detailed behavioral observations and next-generation sequencing to start uncovering mechanisms.

AB The progressive development of economic valuations of biodiversity in recent decade enables the application of the concept of payments for ecosystem services (PES) in order to conservation of forest biodiversity in protected areas. In this article, the PES concept principles are applied for the monetary valuation of natural forest habitats, which were mapped in the Czech Republic in order to create the Natura 2000 European network. The method is based on expert evaluation of every type of mapped habitat by a point value (ranging from 1 to 6 points) for specific ecological evaluating criteria. The monetary value of every point of specific natural forest habitats was defined from the economic analysis of financial expenses of realised ecological restoration projects in the Czech Republic. This method is therefore based on a rather exceptional application of the PES concept, which is still rare in literature because it is based on actual invested financial means, not only on the potential willingness to spend these financial means. The presented results of the monetary valuation of the natural forest habitats in the Czech Republic indicate that the method used for the monetization of forest biodiversity in protected areas can represent a promising decision support tool in countries where habitat mapping results are available.

AB Macroclimate has traditionally been considered the predominant driver of litter decomposition. However, in drylands, cumulative monthly or annual precipitation typically fails to predict decomposition. In these systems, the windows of opportunity for decomposer activity may rather depend on the precipitation frequency and local factors affecting litter desiccation, such as soil-litter mixing. We used a full-factorial microcosm experiment to disentangle the relative importance of cumulative precipitation, pulse frequency, and soil-litter mixing on litter decomposition. Decomposition, measured as litter carbon loss, saturated with increasing cumulative precipitation when pulses were large and infrequent, suggesting that litter moisture no longer increased and/or microbial activity was no longer limited by water availability above a certain pulse size. More frequent precipitation pulses led to increased decomposition at high levels of cumulative precipitation. Soil-litter mixing consistently increased decomposition, with greatest relative increase (+194%) under the driest conditions. Collectively, our results highlight the need to consider precipitation at finer temporal scale and incorporate soil-litter mixing as key driver of decomposition in drylands.

AB Understanding the dynamics of natural ecosystems in highly transformed landscapes is key to the design of regional development plans that are more sustainable and otherwise enhance conservation initiatives. We analyzed secondary forest and shrubland dynamics over 30 years (1985-2015) in a densely populated area of the Colombian Andes using satellite and biophysical data. We performed a land-cover change analysis, assessed landscape fragmentation, and applied regression models to evaluate the effects of environmental and geographical correlates with the observed forest transitions. Forest cover area increased during the 30 year-span, due mostly to forest regrowth in areas marginal for agriculture, especially during the first half of the study period. However, a high dynamic of both forest regrowth and clearing near urban centers and roads was observed. Soil fertility turned out to be a key correlate of both forest recovery and deforestation. Secondary forests, < 30 years old represent the most fragmented component. Our findings reflect the complexity of the processes occurring in highly transformed and densely populated regions. Overall, this study provides elements for a better understanding of the factors driving land cover change near large urban areas, and raises new iideas for further research.

AB Aridity has increased in the past decades and will probably continue to increase in arid and semiarid regions. Here we decipher the plant and soil capacity to retain metal cations when climate evolves to more arid conditions.
   We analyzed K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu concentrations in 580 soil samples and 666 plant (shoot and root) samples along a 3600 km aridity gradient in northern China.
   The concentrations of soil exchangeable K, Mg, Mn, Fe and Cu clearly decreased with increasing aridity due to the relationships of aridity with soil clay content and soil pH. Increases in exchangeable Na and Ca concentrations at mid- and high-aridity levels are probably due to the soil salinization, whereas increased exchangeable Fe concentrations at extreme levels of aridity may be more related to a reduced pH. Element concentrations in both plant shoots and roots were unrelated to soil exchangeable element concentrations; instead they increased monotonously with increasing aridity, corresponding with decreases in plant size and shoot/root ratios. The shoot/root mineralomass ratios in general increased with increasing aridity. The proportional higher element contents in shoots than in roots with increasing aridity are related to increased water uptake and/or use efficiency.
   The extractability of soil elements in response to changing climate varied with the nature of specific elements that are controlled by biological and geochemical processes, i.e., some decreased linearly with increasing aridity, whereas others first decreased and then increased with different thresholds. These contrasting effects of aridity on nutrient availability could further constrain plant growth and should be incorporated into biogeochemical models. The prevailing paradigm of a positive relationship between concentrations of plant and soil elements needs to be reconsidered under changing climatic conditions.

AB Different combinations of behavioural and physiological responses may play a crucial role in the ecological success of species, notably in the context of biological invasions. The invasive mussel Xenostrobus securis has successfully colonised the inner part of the Galician Rias Baixas (NW Spain), where it co-occurs with the commercially-important mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. This study investigated the effect of a heatwave on the physiological and behavioural responses in monospecific or mixed aggregations of these species. In a mesocosm experiment, mussels were exposed to simulated tidal cycles and similar temperature conditions to those experienced in the field during a heat-wave that occurred in the summer of 2013, when field robo-mussels registered temperatures up to 44.5 degrees C at low tide. The overall responses to stress differed markedly between the two species. In monospecific aggregations M. galloprovincialis was more vulnerable than X. securis to heat exposure during emersion. However, in mixed aggregations, the presence of the invader was associated with lower mortality in M. galloprovincialis. The greater sensitivity of M. galloprovincialis to heat exposure was reflected in a higher mortality level, greater induction of Hsp70 protein and higher rates of respiration and gaping activity, which were accompanied by a lower heart rate (bradycardia). The findings show that the invader enhanced the physiological performance of M. galloprovincialis, highlighting the importance of species interactions in regulating responses to environmental stress. Understanding the complex interactions between ecological factors and physiological and behavioural responses of closely-related species is essential for predicting the impacts of invasions in the context of future climate change.

AB Disturbance shapes plant communities over a wide variety of spatial and temporal scales. How natural and anthropogenic disturbance interact to shape ecological communities is highly variable and begs a greater understanding. We used five censuses spanning the years 1990-2011 from the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP) in northeast Puerto Rico to investigate the interplay of human land-use legacies dating to the early 20th century and two recent hurricanes (Hugo, 1989 and Georges, 1998). The LFDP is a landscape mosaic comprised of an area of mature subtropical wet forest and three areas of secondary forest with differing past land-use intensities. We examined the degree to which hurricane disturbance-effect and subsequent community recovery varied across past land-use classes. We expected areas with greater intensity of human land use to be more affected by hurricane disturbance therefore exhibiting greater initial damage and longer successional recovery times. Structurally, areas of secondary forest contained smaller trees than old-growth areas; hurricanes caused widespread recruitment of shrubs and saplings that thinned with time since the first hurricane. Species richness of the plot declined over time, mostly due to the loss of rare species, but also due to the loss of some heliophilic, pioneer species that became abundant after the first hurricane. Species composition differed strongly between areas of secondary and mature forest, and these differences were largely constant over time, except for an increase in compositional differences following the second hurricane. An indicator species analysis attributed this pattern to the longer persistence of pioneer species in areas of greater past land-use intensity, likely due to the more open canopy in secondary forest. When secondary forest areas of differing past land-use intensity were considered separately, few species of low community rank were found as indicators. When these areas were combined, more and higher-ranked species emerged as indicators, creating ecologically meaningful indicator species combinations that better captured the broad-scale plant community response to past land use. Our findings support the idea that effects of past land use can persist for decades to centuries following land-use abandonment, illustrating the importance of land-use legacies in shaping regenerating tropical secondary forests.

AB Understanding the response of species with differing life-history traits to habitat edges and habitat conversion helps predict their likelihood of persistence across changing landscape. In Brazil's Atlantic Forest, we evaluated frog richness and abundance by breeding guild at four distances from the edge of a reserve: i) 200 m inside the forest, ii) 50 m inside the forest, iii) at the forest edge, and iv) 50 m inside three different converted habitats (coffee plantation, non-native Eucalyptus plantation, and abandoned pastures, hereafter matrix types). By sampling a dry and a wet season, we recorded 622 individual frogs representing 29 species, of which three were undescribed. Breeding guild (i.e. bromeliad, leaf-litter, and water-body breeders) was the most important variable explaining frog distributions in relation to edge effects and matrix types. Leaf-litter and bromeliad breeders decreased in richness and abundance from the forest interior toward the matrix habitats. Water-body breeders increased in richness toward the matrix and remained relatively stable in abundance across distances. Number of large trees (i.e. DBH > 15 cm) and bromeliads best explained frog richness and abundance across distances. Twenty species found in the interior of the forest were not found in any matrix habitat. Richness and abundance across breeding guilds were higher in the rainy season but frog distributions were similar across the four distances in the two seasons. Across matrix types, leaf-litter species primarily used Eucalyptus plantations, whereas water-body species primarily used coffee plantations. Bromeliad breeders were not found inside any matrix habitat. Our study highlights the importance of primary forest for bromeliad and leaf-litter breeders. We propose that water-body breeders use edge and matrix habitats to reach breeding habitats along the valleys. Including life-history characteristics, such as breeding guild, can improve predictions of frog distributions in response to edge effect and matrix types, and can guide more effective management and conservation actions.

AB The conservation of tropical forest carbon stocks offers the opportunity to curb climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and simultaneously conserve biodiversity. However, there has been considerable debate about the extent to which carbon stock conservation will provide benefits to biodiversity in part because whether forests that contain high carbon density in their aboveground biomass also contain high animal diversity is unknown. Here, we empirically examined medium to large bodied ground-dwelling mammal and bird (hereafter "wildlife") diversity and carbon stock levels within the tropics using camera trap and vegetation data from a pantropical network of sites. Specifically, we tested whether tropical forests that stored more carbon contained higher wildlife species richness, taxonomic diversity, and trait diversity. We found that carbon stocks were not a significant predictor for any of these three measures of diversity, which suggests that benefits for wildlife diversity will not be maximized unless wildlife diversity is explicitly taken into account; prioritizing carbon stocks alone will not necessarily meet biodiversity conservation goals. We recommend conservation planning that considers both objectives because there is the potential for more wildlife diversity and carbon stock conservation to be achieved for the same total budget if both objectives are pursued in tandem rather than independently. Tropical forests with low elevation variability and low tree density supported significantly higher wildlife diversity. These tropical forest characteristics may provide more affordable proxies of wildlife diversity for future multi-objective conservation planning when fine scale data on wildlife are lacking.

AB Tropical forests currently play a key role in regulating the terrestrial carbon cycle and abating climate change by storing carbon in wood. However, there remains considerable uncertainty as to whether tropical forests will continue to act as carbon sinks in the face of increased pressure from expanding human activities. Consequently, understanding what drives productivity in tropical forests is critical. We used permanent forest plot data from the Gola Rainforest National Park (Sierra Leone) - one of the largest tracts of intact tropical moist forest in West Africa - to explore how (1) stand basal area and tree diversity, (2) past disturbance associated with past logging, and (3) underlying soil nutrient gradients interact to determine rates of aboveground wood production (AWP). We started by statistically modeling the diameter growth of individual trees and used these models to estimate AWP for 142 permanent forest plots. We then used structural equation modeling to explore the direct and indirect pathways which shape rates of AWP. Across the plot network, stand basal area emerged as the strongest determinant of AWP, with densely packed stands exhibiting the fastest rates of AWP. In addition to stand packing density, both tree diversity and soil phosphorus content were also positively related to productivity. By contrast, historical logging activities negatively impacted AWP through the removal of large trees, which contributed disproportionately to productivity. Understanding what determines variation in wood production across tropical forest landscapes requires accounting for multiple interacting drivers - with stand structure, tree diversity, and soil nutrients all playing a key role. Importantly, our results also indicate that logging activities can have a long-lasting impact on a forest's ability to sequester and store carbon, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding old-growth tropical forests.

AB The Amazon tropical evergreen forest is an important component of the global carbon budget. Its forest floristic composition, structure, and function are sensitive to changes in climate, atmospheric composition, and land use. In this study biomass and productivity simulated by three dynamic global vegetation models (Integrated Biosphere Simulator, Ecosystem Demography Biosphere Model, and Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) for the period 1970-2008 are compared with observations from forest plots (Rede Amazonica de Inventarios Forestales). The spatial variability in biomass and productivity simulated by the DGVMs is low in comparison to the field observations in part because of poor representation of the heterogeneity of vegetation traits within themodels. We find that over the last four decades the CO2 fertilization effect dominates a long-term increase in simulated biomass in undisturbed Amazonian forests, while land use change in the south and southeastern Amazonia dominates a reduction in Amazon aboveground biomass, of similar magnitude to the CO2 biomass gain. Climate extremes exert a strong effect on the observed biomass on short time scales, but the models are incapable of reproducing the observed impacts of extreme drought on forest biomass. We find that future improvements in the accuracy of DGVM predictions will require improved representation of four key elements: (1) spatially variable plant traits, (2) soil and nutrients mediated processes, (3) extreme event mortality, and (4) sensitivity to climatic variability. Finally, continued long-term observations and ecosystem-scale experiments (e. g. Free-Air CO2 Enrichment experiments) are essential for a better understanding of the changing dynamics of tropical forests.

AB The seed-to-seedling transition constitutes a critical bottleneck in the life history of plants and represents a major determinant of species composition and abundance. However, we have surprisingly little knowledge regarding the forces driving this ontogenetic transition. Here we utilize information regarding organismal function to investigate the strength of intra-and interspecific negative density dependence during the seed-to-seedling transition in Puerto Rican tree species. Our analyses were implemented at individual sites and across an entire 16-ha forest plot, spanning 6 years. The functional richness of seedling assemblages was significantly lower than expected given the seed assemblages, but the functional evenness was significantly higher than expected, indicating the simultaneous importance of constraints on the overall phenotypic space and trait differences for successful transitions from seed to seedling. The results were consistent across years. Within species, we also found evidence for strong intraspecific negative density dependence, where the probability of transition was proportionally lower when in a site with high conspecific density. These results suggest that filtering of similar phenotypes across species and strong negative density dependence within and among species are simultaneously driving the structure and dynamics of tropical tree assemblages during this critical life-history transition.

AB Functional traits play a key role in driving biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning. Here, we examine the geographical distributions of three key functional traits in New World palms (Arecaceae), an ecologically important plant group, and their relationships with current climate, soil and glacial-interglacial climate change. We combined range maps for the New World (N=541 palm species) with data on traits (leaf size, stem height and fruit size), representing the leaf-height-seed plant strategy scheme of Westoby, to estimate median trait values for palm species assemblages in 110x110-km grid cells. Spatial and non-spatial multi-predictor regressions were used with the Akaike Information Criterion to identify minimum adequate models. Present-day seasonality in temperature and precipitation played a major role in explaining geographical variation of all traits. Mean annual temperature and annual precipitation were additionally important for median leaf size. Glacial-interglacial temperature change was the most important predictor for median fruit size. Large-scale soil gradients played only a minor role overall. These results suggest that current climate (larger median trait values with increasing seasonality) and glacial-interglacial temperature change (larger median fruit size with increasing Quaternary temperature anomaly) are important drivers for functional trait distributions of New World palms.

AB Land-use changes until the beginning of the 20th century made the terrestrial biosphere a net source of atmospheric carbon. Later, burning of fossil fuel surpassed land use changes as the major anthropogenic source of carbon. The terrestrial biosphere is at present suggested to be a carbon sink, but the distribution of excess anthropogenic carbon to the ocean and biosphere sinks is highly uncertain. Our modeling suggest that land-use changes can be tracked quite well by the carbon isotopes until mid-20th century, whereas burning of fossil fuel dominates the present-day observed changes in the isotope signature. The modeling indicates that the global carbon isotope fractionation has not changed significantly during the last 150 years. Furthermore, increased uptake of carbon by the ocean and increasing temperatures does not yet appear to have resulted in increasing the global gross ocean-to-atmosphere carbon fluxes. This may however change in the future when the excess carbon will emerge in the ocean upwelling zones, possibly reducing the net-uptake of carbon compared to the present-day ocean.

AB Understanding the spatial and temporal scales at which environmental variation affects populations of plants and animals is an important goal for modern population biology, especially in the context of shifting climatic conditions. The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) generates climatic extremes of interannual variation, and has been shown to have significant effects on the diversity and abundance of a variety of terrestrial taxa. However, studies that have investigated the influence of such large-scale climate phenomena have often been limited in spatial and taxonomic scope. We used 23 years (1988-2010) of a long-term butterfly monitoring data set to explore associations between variation in population abundance of 28 butterfly species and variation in ENSO-derived sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) across 10 sites that encompass an elevational range of 2750 m in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. Our analysis detected a positive, regional effect of increased SSTA on butterfly abundance (wetter and warmer years predict more butterfly observations), yet the influence of SSTA on butterfly abundances varied along the elevational gradient, and also differed greatly among the 28 species. Migratory species had the strongest relationships with ENSO-derived SSTA, suggesting that large-scale climate indices are particularly valuable for understanding biotic-abiotic relationships of the most mobile species. In general, however, the ecological effects of large-scale climatic factors are context dependent between sites and species. Our results illustrate the power of long-term data sets for revealing pervasive yet subtle climatic effects, but also caution against expectations derived from exemplar species or single locations in the study of biotic-abiotic interactions.

AB A large reservoir of soil nitrate in desert subsoil zones has been demonstrated in previous studies; however, information on the subsoil nitrate reservoir and its distribution characteristics in the deserts of China is still limited. This study investigated the distribution patterns of soil total nitrogen (N), nitrate, ammonium, and stable isotopic ratios of N-15 (delta N-15) in shallow (1 m) and subsoil (5 m) profiles in three types of dunes in the Mu Us desert of China. We found that soil N retention of the fixed and semi-fixed dunes followed a progressive nutrient depletion pattern in shallow soil profiles, whereas the subsoil nitrate of the fixed, semi-fixed and mobile dunes maintained a conservative accumulation pattern. The results indicate that the subsoil of the Mu Us desert may act as a reservoir of available nitrate. Furthermore, a soil delta N-15 analysis indicate that the nitrate content of the fixed dune is likely derived from soil nitrification, whereas the nitrate content in the mobile dune is derived from atmospheric nitrate deposition. Within the context of looming climate change and intensifying human activities, the subsoil nitrate content in the deserts of northern China could become mobilized and increase environmental risks to groundwater.

AB In Latin America, payment for environmental services (PES) is a tool for watershed conservation that is becoming increasingly promoted by some government agencies, international development organisations and environmental NGOs. However, in pursuit of conservation, PES initiatives implemented at the watershed level may conceal the environmental impacts on local communities of private actors funding PES initiatives. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, focus groups and archival research in the Cauca Valley, Colombia, we present the case of a PES scheme in which several commercial water users paid for the conservation of the upper part of the Nima watershed as a means of securing the flow of water upon which they rely. We show how the scheme was predicated upon very selective interpretations of degradation and conservation, and the roles of those deemed responsible for them, that were mobilised by those groups paying for environmental services to the detriment of other water users.

AB The jaguar is an endangered species in Brazil and one of the major threats is the hunting, sometimes as a result of livestock depredation. Understanding the ecological and anthropogenic factors that favor the predation of livestock by jaguar can help to reduce the number of attacks and thus, decrease cases of hunting in retaliation. We used field data on livestock depredation and environmental and anthropogenic variables to model the risk of depredation by jaguar along the Transamazon highway, a frontier region where ranching has been the main driver of deforestation. We used five algorithms and a final ensemble model in order to obtain a map of depredation risk, as well as to identify the variables related with it. The variables most related with depredation risk were distance to deforestation (negatively related) and cattle density (positively related). The major factors driving livestock depredation are related to anthropogenic disturbance, this means that the spatial distribution of risk is not a stable feature, but is likely to change dynamically following shifts in the deforestation frontier and in the livestock herd. Based on our results, it is reasonable to expect an increase in depredation of livestock in this area. The use of ecological niche modeling to identify potential hotspots of depredation of livestock is a recent innovation that holds potential to guide the allocation of conservation and management efforts over large areas at relatively low costs.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Following herbivore attack, plants can either reduce damage by inducing defenses or mitigate herbivory effects through compensatory growth and reproduction. It is increasingly recognized that such induced defenses in plants are herbivore-specific, but less is known about the specificity of compensatory responses. Damage by multiple herbivores may also lead to synergistic effects on induction and plant fitness that differ from those caused by a single herbivore species. Although largely unstudied, the order of arrival and damage by different herbivore species might also play an important role in the impacts of herbivory on plants.
   METHODS: We investigated the specificity of defense induction (phenolics) and effects on growth (number of stems and leaves) and reproduction (number of seeds, seed mass, and germination rate) from feeding by two generalist leaf-chewing herbivores (Spodoptera eridania and Diabrotica balteata) on Phaseolus lunatus plants and evaluated whether simultaneous attack by both herbivores and their order of arrival influenced such dynamics.
   KEY RESULTS: Herbivory increased levels of leaf phenolics, but such effects were not herbivore-specific. In contrast, herbivory enhanced seed germination in an herbivore-specific manner. For all variables measured, the combined effects of both herbivore species did not differ from their individual effects. Finally, the order of herbivore arrival did not influence defense induction, plant growth, or seed number but did influence seed mass and germination.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study highlights novel aspects of the specificity of plant responses induced by damage from multiple species of herbivores and uniquely associates such effects with plant lifetime fitness.

AB The management of rainforest ecosystems for multi-species conservation must assess the impacts of habitat degradation at different spatial scales as well as determine which species are vulnerable to landscape change. Our research objectives were to (1) evaluate the effects of life history traits on the patch occupancy and vulnerability of rainforest birds, (2) determine the relative effects of stand, landscape and patch structure on species richness, and (3) evaluate the relative contributions of deforestation and fragmentation to species richness. We collected presence-absence data for 29 bird species in 46 rainforest patches in South East Queensland, Australia. We used a multi-species occupancy model that accounted for incomplete detection to evaluate hypotheses for occupancy and species richness. Avian occupancy was strongly influenced by life history traits, including population density, foraging behavior, dispersal strategy, clutch size, body mass and diet. Sedentary species with low population sizes, low clutch sizes, large body sizes and insectivorous diets, such as the ground-dwelling Albert's Lyrebird (Menura alberti) and canopy-dwelling Paradise Riflebird (Ptiloris paradiseus), were the most vulnerable to landscape change. After accounting for life history, the positive effect of stand basal area was the best predictor of species richness followed by the positive effects of rainforest and dry eucalypt forest in the landscape, with less support for the positive effect of patch size and negative effect of patch isolation. Deforestation was more detrimental to the bird community than rainforest fragmentation. Conservation actions that retain high stand basal area, promote unmodified landscape mosaics and maintain moderate patch sizes near large rainforest tracts are expected to be effective strategies for managing the rainforest bird community. Landscape conservation strategies to minimize habitat loss are expected to be more effective than managing the configuration of rainforest patches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen (N) deposition can influence carbon cycling of terrestrial ecosystems. However, a general recognition of how soil microorganisms respond to increasing N deposition is not yet reached. We explored soil microbial responses to two levels of N addition (2.5 and 5 gN m(-2) yr(-1)) in interplant soil and beneath shrubs of Haloxylon ammodendron and their consequences to soil respiration in the Gurbantunggut Desert, northwestern China from 2011 to 2013. Microbial biomass and respiration were significantly higher beneath H. ammodendron than in interplant soil. The responses of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial respiration (MR) showed opposite responses to N addition in interplant and beneath H. ammodendron. N addition slightly increased MBC and MR in interplant soil and decreased them beneath H. ammodendron, with a significant inhibition only in 2012. N addition had no impacts on the total microbial physiological activity, but N addition decreased the labile carbon substrate utilization beneath H. ammodendron when N addition level was high. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis showed that N addition did not alter the soil microbial community structure as evidenced by the similar ratios of fungal to bacterial PLFAs and gram-negative to gram-positive bacterial PLFAs. Microbial biomass and respiration showed close correlations with soil water content and dissolved carbon, and they were independent of soil inorganic nitrogen across three years. Our study suggests that N addition effects on soil microorganisms and carbon emission are dependent on the respiratory substrates and water availability in the desert ecosystem.

AB Biodiversity declines in Southeast Asia have led to predictions that many vertebrate species will become extinct within 50 years. Examples of quantified deterioration in species status remain scarce, however. The Southeast Asian geographical range of the Endangered Green peafowl is still contracting due to hunting pressure and habitat disturbance. In Vietnam, the main population lies in the southcentral region with a relatively high density reported in 1998. The aim of this study was to assess the species' current status in Yok Don and Cat Tien National Parks, which are thought to contain the most important Vietnamese populations. We used line and point transects to investigate the density and analyze habitat selection and effects of human activity. The Yok Don population has decreased sharply during the past 15 years, while in Cat Tien, the estimated density was higher. Animals were most numerous close to water sources and lowest where cattle numbers were highest and ground vegetation cover absent. Here we document a significant negative population change in a previously widespread vertebrate species. Although comparisons of population data over long periods are rare, we demonstrate that taking advantage of opportunities to resurvey species can quantify population declines. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Frugivorous primates are important seed dispersers and their absence from forest patches is predicted to be detrimental to tropical forest regeneration and recruitment. With the reduction of primate populations globally, ecologically resilient primate species, characterized by dietary flexibility and the ability to thrive in a variety of habitats, assume new importance as seed dispersers. The most widely distributed non-human primate, the rhesus macaque Macaca mulatta has been intensively studied but little is known about its role in maintaining ecosystem structure and functions. Due to their frugivorous diet, large group sizes, large home ranges and tolerance to disturbance, rhesus macaques may be effective seed dispersers. We studied seed dispersal by rhesus macaques at the Buxa Tiger Reserve, India, through a combination of behavioural observations and germination experiments. Rhesus macaques dispersed 84% of the 49 species they fed on either through spitting or defecation. Nearly 96% of the handled seeds were undamaged and 61% of the species for which germination tests were performed had enhanced germination. Almost 50% of the monitored seeds among those deposited in situ germinated and 22% established seedlings, suggesting that rhesus macaques are important seed dispersers in tropical forests. Due to their widespread distribution and large populations, rhesus macaques are perceived as common and are categorized as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, effectively excluding them from any conservation plans. Based on the results of our study, we argue that rhesus macaques fulfill critical ecological functions in their habitat and that this parameter must be taken into consideration when they are reviewed for conservation priorities.

AB While much is known about abiotic and vegetative edge effects in tropical forests, considerably less is known about the impact of forest edges on large mammals. In this study, we examine edge effects in a primate community to determine: 1) the distance from the edge over which edge effects in primate density are detectable, 2) whether individual species exhibit edge effects in their density, and 3) whether biological characteristics can be used to predict primate presence in edge habitats. Given their importance to many primate species, we also examine the influence of the number of large trees. We found edge penetration distances of 150 m for the five species that experienced edge effects, suggesting that primates respond to edge-related changes in the plant community that are known to be strongest over the first 150 m. Four species had higher edge densities: Alouatta macconnelli (folivore-frugivore), Chiropotes chiropotes (frugivorous seed predator), Saguinus midas (frugivore-faunivore), and Sapajus apella apella (frugivore-faunivore); one species' density was lower: Ateles paniscus (frugivore); and the final species, Pithecia chrysocephala (frugivorous seed predator), did not show an edge-related pattern. The lone significant relationship between the biological characteristics examined (body weight, diet, group size, and home range size) and primate presence in edge habitats was a negative relationship with the amount of fruit consumed. Though we did not examine primate responses to edges that border a denuded matrix, we have shown that edges influence primate distribution even following decades of secondary forest regeneration at habitat edges.

AB Local, regional, and global extinctions caused by habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation have been widely reported for the tropics. The patterns and drivers of this loss of species are now increasingly well known in Amazonia, but there remains a significant gap in understanding of long-term trends in species persistence and extinction in anthropogenic landscapes. Such a historical perspective is critical for understanding the status and trends of extant biodiversity as well as for identifying priorities to halt further losses. Using extensive historical data sets of specimen records and results of contemporary surveys, we searched for evidence of local extinctions of a terra firma rainforest avifauna over 200 years in a 2500km(2) eastern Amazonian region around the Brazilian city of Belem. This region has the longest history of ornithological fieldwork in the entire Amazon basin and lies in the highly threatened Belem Centre of Endemism. We also compared our historically inferred extinction events with extensive data on species occurrences in a sample of catchments in a nearby municipality (Paragominas) that encompass a gradient of past forest loss. We found evidence for the possible extinction of 47 species (14% of the regional species pool) that were unreported from 1980 to 2013 (80% last recorded between 1900 and 1980). Seventeen species appear on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, and many of these are large-bodied. The species lost from the region immediately around Belem are similar to those which are currently restricted to well-forested catchments in Paragominas. Although we anticipate the future rediscovery or recolonization of some species inferred to be extinct by our calculations, we also expect that there are likely to be additional local extinctions, not reported here, given the ongoing loss and degradation of remaining areas of native vegetation across eastern Amazonia.

AB 1. Savannas are highly heterogeneous tree-grass mixtures, and the structural variation imposed by a discontinuous canopy cover results in spatial variation in soil properties such as plant-available nutrients, temperature and soil moisture. Many savannas are also dominated by large vertebrate herbivores, which impose a different suite of effects on soil properties related to consumption, excretion and physical disturbance.
   2. In nutrient-poor, water-limited systems, variation in soil resource availability may play a fundamental role in structuring plant communities, but the relative and interactive effects of key drivers of heterogeneity have received little attention in savanna ecosystems.
   3. We investigated the independent and interactive effects of herbivores and tree canopy cover on multiple soil properties up to a depth of 10 cm, including bulk density, soil C pools, total and plant-available nutrients, moisture dynamics and temperature at two contrasting sites in Kruger National Park, South Africa. We analysed samples from locations under and between adult tree canopies and inside and outside long-term herbivore exclosures using a nested design.
   4. We found strong positive effects of tree canopies on total and labile pools of soil C and N and negative effects on plant-available P and soil temperature. Tree canopy effects on soil moisture availability were small but clearly detectable. During precipitation events, trees increased moisture inputs on granite soils but decreased moisture inputs on basalt soils compared to open sites.
   5. Conversely, we found mixed evidence for herbivore effects on soil chemistry and temperature, but a clearer effect on soil moisture, with areas outside exclosures experiencing higher soil moisture retention, particularly immediately following precipitation events. Soil bulk density, a driver of both nutrient and soil moisture dynamics, was lower under trees and when herbivores were excluded.
   6. Synthesis. Our results suggest that variation in tree cover is the dominant biotic driver of C, N and P dynamics in these savanna systems in the top 10 cm of soil, that herbivores primarily affect soil moisture content, and that canopy and herbivore effects tend to be additive rather than synergistic.

AB Large hydroelectric dams are one of the current drivers of habitat loss across Amazonian forests. We investigated how the primate community at a hydroelectric dam in Brazilian Amazonia responded to changes in the landscape and local habitat structure of land-bridge islands after 21 yr of post-isolation history. The Balbina Dam, constructed in 1986, inundated 3129 km(2) of primary forests and created more than 3500 variable-sized islands. We conducted primate and habitat structure surveys on 20 islands from 5 to 1815 ha, and extracted forest patch and landscape metrics for each island. The number of primate species per island varied between 0 and 7 species. Primate composition varied substantially according to both island area and forest cover remaining within the landscape, whereas island area alone was the most significant predictor of richness. Locally, tree density and vertical stratification were the most significant explanatory variables of primate composition and richness. A model containing area effects had the most explanatory power regarding site occupancy for most species. Individually, each species responded differently, with howler and brown capuchin monkeys showing greater tolerance to cope with habitat changes. Body size was also an important predictor of primate occupancy. We recommend protecting large fragments and enhancing the suitability of surrounding habitats to ensure primate conservation in most Neotropical fragmented landscapes. Given the flat topography of hydroelectric reservoirs, which mainly favors the formation of small islands, and the escalating hydropower development plans in Amazonia, our findings provide evidence for pervasive detrimental impacts of dams on primate communities.

AB Studies linking genetic structure in amphibian species with ecological characteristics have focused on large differences in dispersal capabilities. Here, we test whether two species with similar dispersal potential but subtle differences in other ecological characteristics also exhibit strong differences in genetic structure in the same landscape. We examined eight microsatellites in marbled salamanders (Ambystoma opacum) from 29 seasonal ponds and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) from 19 seasonal ponds in a single geographic region in west-central Massachusetts. Despite overall similarity in ecological characteristics of spotted and marbled salamanders, we observed clear differences in the genetic structure of these two species. For marbled salamanders, we observed strong overall genetic differentiation (F (ST) = 0.091, F' (ST) = 0.375), three population-level clusters of populations (K = 3), a strong pattern of isolation by distance (r = 0.58), and marked variation in family-level structure (from 1 to 23 full-sibling families per site). For spotted salamanders, overall genetic differentiation was weaker (F (ST) = 0.025, F' (ST) = 0.102), there was no evidence of population-level clustering (K = 1), the pattern of isolation by distance (r = 0.17) was much weaker compared to marbled salamanders, and there was less variation in family-level structure (from 10 to 36 full-sibling families per site). We suspect that a combination of breeding site fidelity, effective population size, and generation interval is responsible for these marked differences. Our results suggest that marbled salamanders, compared to spotted salamanders, are more sensitive to fragmentation from various land-use activities and would be less likely to recolonize extirpated sites on an ecologically and conservation-relevant time frame.

AB Plant defence traits have evolved over macro- and microevolutionary time-scales in response to herbivores. Although a number of studies have investigated the evolutionary impacts of herbivores over short time-scales, few studies have experimentally examined what defence traits most commonly evolve and whether multiple coexisting species exhibit similar evolutionary responses to herbivores.
   We addressed these questions using a long-term experiment at Silwood Park, England, United Kingdom, where we excluded rabbits from 38 grassland plots for <1-34years. To assess the evolutionary impacts of rabbits on plant defence traits, we collected seeds from plots containing the following perennial species: Anthoxanthum odoratum (Poaceae), Festuca rubra ssp. rubra (Poaceae), Holcus lanatus (Poaceae) and Stellaria graminea (Caryophyllaceae). We then grew these plants in a common garden and measured defensive and morphological traits.
   We found some evidence for evolutionary change of defence traits in three of the four species following the exclusion of rabbits. We observed the clearest changes in F.rubra, which showed a 9% decline in tolerance to herbivory and a 26% decline in leaf number. We also observed weak evidence for a change in all grass species towards a more erect growth form suggesting that grazing selects for plants that grow close to the ground.
   Although our results are most consistent with evolution due to changes in the frequency of alleles and genotypes, we cannot rule out that epigenetic changes (e.g. methylation) or maternal environmental effects also contributed to or caused the observed long-term phenotypic responses.
   Synthesis. Our study provides an experimental test of the evolutionary effects of an ecologically important herbivore. We found evidence for plant defence evolution following >20years of rabbit exclusion. However, the evidence was only strong in one species for multiple traits, weak in all three grass species for avoidance and absent in an herb species. This suggests that the evolutionary effects of an ecologically important herbivore on plants will be variable and difficult to predict in nature.

AB 1. Recent studies have shown that herbivore cues trigger rapid shifts in primary metabolism and resource allocation within a plant. This has been suggested to be an induced mechanism of tolerance to defoliation but there is little evidence supporting this. Here, we investigated, using a cultivar of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), whether prior herbivore damage confers plants an advantage in terms of increased growth and initial flower production following defoliation.
   2. Plants were mechanically wounded and treated with either regurgitant of the specialist Manduca sexta, deionized water or received no damage for five consecutive days. Chlorophyll content, plant growth and biomass allocation were measured during the 5-day damage period. After the damage treatments, all leaves were removed to simulate defoliation in the three treatment groups, and regrowth capacity was followed until flowering. The number of regrown leaves, the initial number of flowers and biomass production and allocation were quantified at harvest.
   3. During the 5-day damage period, plants treated with M. sexta regurgitant grew less in height than undamaged plants (but had thicker stems). Chlorophyll content also decreased sharply in these plants. However, regurgitant-treated plants recovered more quickly from the defoliation treatment, producing more new leaves compared with undamaged and mechanically damaged treatments.
   4. Our results support the hypothesis that induced changes in resource allocation in response to specialist herbivores results in increased regrowth ability and may be adaptive in the event of severe defoliation. Future studies on wild plants could help inform the evolutionary significance of this response.

AB The coexistence of plant species in species-rich tropical forests can be promoted by specialised enemies acting in a negatively density-dependent manner. While survival of tropical tree seedlings is often negatively density-dependent, the causes have rarely been identified. We tested whether insects and plant pathogens cause density-dependent seedling recruitment and survival in five forest tree species in Belize, Central America. We manipulated densities of seeds or newly germinated seedlings in small (1 m(2) or 0.25 m(2)) plots close to fruiting conspecific trees. Using a factorial design, we excluded enemies from subsets of the plots with fungicides and insecticides. Seed germination (for two species) and early seedling survival (for all species) were monitored at approximately weekly intervals for up to eight weeks, during the period when plants are likely to be most susceptible to natural enemies. In Terminalia amazonia, seed germination was negatively density-dependent and the proportion of seeds germinating increased when insects were excluded. However, the magnitude of the insecticide effect was independent of density. The only significant density effect for survival of young seedlings was in Acacia polyphylla; counter to expectation, seedling survival was higher at high densities. In a few cases pesticide application had a significant effect on seedling survival, but in only one case (Terminalia amazonia) was a significant pesticide x density interaction detected. Our results caution against generalising from studies conducted on a single species at a single time and place and illustrate the challenges of experimentally testing for enemy-mediated negative density-dependence. Experimental outcomes are likely to depend on the spatial scale at which the principal enemies disperse and respond to plant density, and the timescales over which they act. Gathering information on these variables will improve our understanding of the natural histories of tropical forest species and help inform the design of future experiments.

AB Transgenic cotton varieties (Bollgard II) expressing two proteins (Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab) from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been widely adopted in Australia to control larvae of Helicoverpa. A triple-stacked Bt-transgenic cotton producing Cry1Ac, Cry2Ab, and Vip3A proteins (Genuity Bollgard III) is being developed to reduce the chance that Helicoverpa will develop resistance to the Bt proteins. Before its introduction, nontarget effects on the agro-ecosystem need to be evaluated under field conditions. Byusing beatsheet and suction sampling methods, we compared the invertebrate communities of unsprayed non-Bt-cotton, Bollgard II, and Bollgard III in five experiments across three sites in Australia. We found significant differences between invertebrate communities of non-Bt and Bt (Bollgard II and Bollgard III) cotton only in experiments where lepidopteran larval abundance was high. In beatsheet samples where lepidopterans were absent (Bt crops), organisms associated with flowers and bolls in Bt-cotton were more abundant. In suction samples, where Lepidoptera were present (i.e., in non-Bt-cotton), organisms associated with damaged plant tissue and frass were more common. Hence in our study, Bt-and non-Bt-cotton communities only differed when suffcient lepidopteran larvae were present to exert both direct and indirect effects on species assemblages. There was no overall significant difference between Bollgard II and III communities, despite the addition of the Vip gene in Bollgard III. Consequently, the use of Bollgard III in Australian cotton provides additional protection against the development of resistance by Helicoverpa to Bt toxins, while having no additional effect on cotton invertebrate communities.

AB Although light is a key factor in forestry, it is surprisingly seldom measured in day-to-day management of European forests. The spherical convex densiometer is a simple instrument that allows to evaluate the canopy openness (CO) by counting the number of 'canopy' dots on a grid lying on a convex mirror reflecting the canopy. In this contribution, we compared the performances of this instrument in mixed oak-beech hardwood forests spanning the lower end of the light gradient [1-17 % above canopy photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)] to two reference techniques: PAR measurements and fish-eye photography, based on a detailed analysis of its functioning. Discrepancies between the densiometer and the fish-eye estimates of CO were due to a combination of differences in dot resolution, dot counting and portion of the hemisphere considered. By contrast, the various effects of operator on densiometer estimates, including the influence of conformation on the angle of view, were found to be relatively minor. Densiometer readings were closely related to the relative light intensity assessed by PAR sensors in overcast conditions, which suggests that the use of this inexpensive tool should be expanded.
