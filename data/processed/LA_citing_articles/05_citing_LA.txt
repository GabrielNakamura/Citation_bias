AB Satellite data and the published coefficients about the world's and China's ecosystem were used to analyze the effects of land-use changes on the ecosystem service in the Yanqi Basin. Both economic developments and arid, fragile ecosystems have strongly affected the land use. A sensitivity analysis determined the effect of manipulating the coefficients on the estimated values. Results indicated that (1) the total value of ecosystem services in the Yanqi Basin were 9,374.66, 10,450.52, 9,964.20, and 9,8707.77 million Yuan in 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2011, respectively. The net increase in ecosystem service values were about 496.11 million Yuan within 1990-2011; (2) The aggregated ecosystem service values of water body, wetlands, grasslands, and croplands were about 99.25 % of the total value; (3) Waste treatment and soil formation were the top two ecological functions with high service values and contributing about 61.70 % of the total service values; and (4) Ecosystem service values estimated in this study were inelastic with respect to the value coefficients; therefore, the estimation was robust in spite of uncertainties on the value coefficients. A reasonable land-use plan should be based on rigorous environmental impact analyses for maintaining stability and sustainable development of the Yanqi Basin.

AB Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCF) support exceptional concentrations of biodiversity but are severely threatened by deforestation. In Mexico, 60% of TMCF tree species has been reported as threatened, and the epiphytic plants characteristic of these forests are particularly vulnerable to disturbance and climate change. We evaluated the role of remnant TMCF fragments as reservoirs of tree and epiphytic bromeliad biodiversity in southeastern Mexico. In four cloud forest fragments of varying size (1.2, 4.1, 6.6 and 9.8 ha), we recorded all trees >= 10 cm dbh in six 20 x 10 m plots and sampled eight trees at each site to measure bromeliad diversity. The assessment revealed that even very small forest fragments can host significant tree and epiphytic bromeliad diversity. In total, 45 tree and 18 bromeliad species were recorded among all the sites. These forest fragments are an important reservoir of both endemic tree species (seven species) and those with conservation status (nine tree species and one bromeliad species). Important variation in tree and bromeliad composition was found among fragments. This high heterogeneity among forest sites means that maintenance of even small fragments can play a strategic role in the conservation of biodiversity in the severely transformed landscape of the region. Such maintenance merits full consideration in the design of forest management policies and TMCF restoration initiatives.

AB Market based instruments for ecosystem services have become the norm since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment advanced the concept of "ecosystem services" as an international reference in global govemance. In this way, market based instruments for ecosystem services have increasingly been implemented within nation States. In this paper we analyze the role of environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in spreading market based instruments for ecosystem services. We put forward the hypothesis that: when a State cannot adequately defend its political and economic sovereignty to produce its own public policies, then the environmental NGOs are strong policy entrepreneurs, that are able to diffuse standards and policy instruments. When a State is more politically and economically capable, the role of environmental NGOs as policy entrepreneurs is more limited. To test this hypothesis, we analyze the diffusion of market based instruments for ecosystem services in three contrasted countries regarding State and NGOs' respective strength: Costa Rica, Madagascar and France. A comparison and analysis of the dissemination of the market based instruments for ecosystem services in different countries therefore seems highlk relevant for analyzing such transfers of international standards and policy instruments.

AB The inclusion of communities in the design and implementation of payment fur ecosystem services (PES) schemes is not a widely publicized practice in spite of the many accepted benefits that arise from the full participation of communities in interventions which affect them. The results of a pilot PES project in the Cauca Valley, Trinidad presented in this paper, show that even with the highly technical aspects of valuing ecosystem services as a requirement for PES schemes, communities can be involved in the design and implementation of such schemes. Based on an examination of the Caura community during the design and implementation of the PES project, we suggest that the successful design of the PES scheme in Caura was based on the community's active participation in the development of the project concept, the ecosystem service infrastructure, and the management framework for the PES. The paper concludes with research recommendations for improving the design and implementation of PES schemes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Payments for ecosystem services often are viewed as an innovative approach toward improving natural resource management, while also providing opportunities for enhancing incomes and livelihoods. Yet not all PES programs are designed and implemented in ways that reflect voluntary transactions between buyers and providers of well-defined, measurable ecosystem services. When third-party interests, such as donors or governments, design PES programs to achieve goals that lie outside the conceptual scope of payments for ecosystem services, the improvements in resource management and enhancements in livelihoods can fall short of expectations. We examine this potential dissonance in PES program implementation, taking the case of PES in the forestry sector in Vietnam. We question whether PES in Vietnam has the potential to enhance forest protection and watershed management. We highlight the importance of institutions and governance (i.e., the policies, rules, and regulations) in determining program significance and we illustrate how PES programs are implemented as part of the government's subsidy scheme. We conclude that in the absence of a competitive market structure and appropriate regulations, governments can reshape PES programs to function primarily as tools for strengthening state control over natural resources.

AB Regenerating forests are increasingly ubiquitous in tropical landscapes. They hold great conservation potential and there is demand for assessments of their biodiversity value. Forest disturbance and forest loss often occur together, yet few studies attempt to disentangle their separate effects on biological communities. In the Ecuadorian Choco, a biodiversity hotspot, we sampled understory birds in patches with increasing levels of disturbance (old-growth, selectively-logged, and secondary forests) within contiguous forest and in fragments. Species richness increased with disturbance but decreased with habitat loss, with a 75% reduction in endemic and threatened species in fragments compared to contiguous forest. This reduction in richness was most pronounced in secondary forest fragments, suggesting that disturbance and habitat loss interact synergistically to maximally reduce avian biodiversity. Species composition was strongly affected by habitat loss and, to a lesser extent, disturbance, with forest fragments and secondary forests presenting distinct communities dominated by generalists with medium-to-low sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance and reduced proportions of endemics and endangered species. Capture rates also decreased (non-significantly) with habitat loss, and the relative abundance of dietary guilds varied in response to both habitat loss and disturbance. Our study shows that regenerating patches surrounded by contiguous forest can sustain high biodiversity levels and, when past habitat disturbance is mild, present similar communities to old-growth forests. In contrast, forest loss caused reductions in richness (especially in more disturbed patches), profound changes in community composition, and loss of species of conservation concern. These results underscore the importance of considering landscape context when evaluating the conservation value of disturbed forests. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The region recognized as the Rondnia area of endemism is one of the most threatened in the Brazilian Amazon. In addition to rampant deforestation that took place during the 1980s and 1990s, it is now the locus of infrastructure development and economic expansion. However, the patterns of species distribution and diversity in this region are much more complex than previously recognized. Patterns of distribution of birds, primates, and butterflies strongly suggest that the Rondnia area of endemism is not biogeographically homogenous. On opposite banks of the Madeira tributaries, in particular the Aripuan and Jiparana rivers, there are genetically, morphologically, and vocally distinct bird populations with restricted distributions and geographic substitution. These areas are relatively small and already highly threatened by deforestation and economic development. Up to 70 % of the Jiparana basin has been deprived of its original forest cover. Thus, their unique populations deserve to be recognized as conservation priorities and urgently included in conservation planning blueprints. Many restricted taxa, including many yet to be described, may already be highly endangered or locally extinct. Conservation planning in the Brazilian Amazon directed at specifying areas to be protected has focused on the larger proposed areas of endemism. If fine-scale endemism in threatened areas does exist in other Amazonian regions, then conservation policies that do not recognize these patterns will not adequately protect regional diversity.

AB Ecosystem-based management (EBM) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for the Canadian boreal forest. One of the principles of EBM is to maintain ecosystem function by means of management activities that approximate the historic patterns or processes responsible for maintaining a range of landscape conditions. This ideal has been manifested as planning schemes are shifting away from traditional sustained yield harvests toward designs based on historic wildfire disturbance patterns. Wildfire disturbance patterns represent a coarse-filter management strategy, and are well-suited to the boreal forests of Canada. Forest management professionals in the boreal have been leaders in adopting these strategies over the past decade. However, two key questions remain unanswered: (1) to what degree have these forest management efforts resulted in disturbance patterns that resemble wildfire burning patterns?; and (2) to what degree do the other sources of anthropogenic disturbance activities align with historic wildfire patterns? In this paper, an existing knowledge of historic range of variability (HRV) of wildfire patterns and the NEPTUNE (Novel Emulation Pattern Tool for Understanding Natural Events) decision support tool were used to test both questions.
   The results suggest that forest harvest disturbances better approximated historic disturbance patterns than did energy extraction disturbances, though in both cases some of the metrics were beyond the HRV. Significant differences were found between traditional dispersed patterns (e.g., multi-pass harvesting) and the more recent aggregate harvest (e.g., single-pass) designs. Aggregate harvests were characterized by low proportional area in matrix remnants, moderate levels of combined island and matrix remnants, and a high proportional area in the single largest disturbed patch (LDP). Dispersed harvests tended to have a higher proportional area in matrix remnants and better approximated the HRV in terms of proportional area in proportional island remnants area and largest island remnant. Aggregate harvest patterns did not perform as well for a few metrics such as proportional area in island remnants, mean island remnant size and largest island remnant. Overall, the results suggest that aggregate harvest designs better approximated key HRV patterns such as proportional matrix remnants and LDP, than did dispersed harvest designs on the landscape. The results also suggest that forest harvesting was significantly more effective at approximating historic disturbance patterns than the activities of the energy sector.

TI Grain Amaranths Are Defoliation Tolerant Crop Species Capable of
   Utilizing Stem and Root Carbohydrate Reserves to Sustain Vegetative and

AB Tolerance to defoliation can be defined as the degree to which productivity is affected by photosynthetic area reduction. This trait was studied in grain amaranth (Amaranthus cruentus and A. hypochondriacus), which are considered to be a highly defoliation-tolerant species. The physiological and biochemical responses to increasing levels of mechanical leaf removal up to total defoliation were quantified. Tolerance appeared to be dependent on various factors: (i) amount of lost tissue; (ii) mechanics of leaf tissue removal; (iii) environment, and (iv) species tested. Thus, grain amaranth was found to be a highly tolerant species under green-house conditions when leaf tissue loss was performed by gradual perforation. However, tolerance was compromised under similar conditions when defoliation was done by gradual cutting of the leaf. Also tolerance in completely defoliated plants tended to decrease under field conditions, where differences between A. cruentus and A. hypochondriacus were observed. All non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) levels were reduced in stems and roots of totally defoliated amaranths one day after treatment. Such depletion probably provided the carbon (C) resources needed to sustain the early recovery process in the absence of photosynthetic capacity. This was corroborated by shading of intact plants, which produced the same rapid and drastic reduction of NSC levels in these tissues. These results emphasize the role of stored NSCs, particularly starch, in buffering the impact of severe defoliation in amaranth. The fall in sucrose synthase and cell wall invertase activity observed in stems and roots soon after defoliation was consistent with their predicted shift from sink to source tissues. It is concluded that mobilization of C stores in stems and roots, is a physiologically important trait underlying tolerance to defoliation in grain amaranth.

AB Ecosystems services are threatened by the rapid degradation of tropical rainforests. In light of these threats, questions remain about how societies on the forest fringe who depend on provisioning services affect plant functional traits. This study assessed the relationship between plant functional traits, forest-dependent societies and provisioning ecosystem services along a forest-agriculture matrix gradient in tropical humid forests of Madagascar. Data were collected for six functional traits and six provisioning services. We evaluated functional diversity (FD) and utilitarian diversity (FD of provisioning services) along disturbance gradients. We also determined the traits most susceptible to loss along the gradient as well as the relationship between functional traits and provisioning services. The results showed that FD, utilitarian diversity and species richness decreased significantly across all modified habitats. There was a distinct suite of traits absent from intensely used habitats and those same traits were associated with the two most important provisioning services in the region (firewood and construction). The activities of people living on the forest fringe seem to be a strong selective force on trait loss in plant communities, which in turn will influence future species assembly and trait diversity and distribution. Moreover, this study suggests that it is possible to predict trait loss from plant communities in forests where degradation is mediated primarily through subsistence agriculture and resource extraction. Conservation efforts should recognize that forest degradation and deforestation are contextually specific, determined mostly by people's efforts to maintain their basic livelihood, and therefore necessitate local-scale interventions that feed into landscape-scale policy initiatives.

AB Sprouting is an important way of extending the lifespan of trees. Persistence in low light conditions of the understory is the most important feature of a seedling bank. In this long-term study we showed how sprouting can extend the persistence of seedlings. Sorbus aucuparia (rowan), a tree species with multi-stemmed seedlings growing in subalpine spruce forest, was chosen for this study. The main aim of the study was to examine the persistence of seedlings and dynamics of sprouts within seedlings. Specifically, we sought to answer three main questions: (i) How long do individual seedlings and their sprouts live? (ii) How often do individuals produce sprouts? and (iii) Do individuals differ in their sprouting ability? It was found that rowan seedlings are very long-lived and it is achieved by the replacement of stems. The half-life of stems was 9.5 years. A mean height increase was 0.58 cm/year. New sprouts appeared in the population continuously. On average, the mean probability of sprouting was 0.16 per year. Individuals differed in their intensity of sprout replacement. Individuals with higher number of sprouts had more new and dead sprouts. After 12 years of study, 18% of individuals had replaced all their sprouts, i.e., lost all their sprouts that were present at the beginning of the study. The production of new sprouts was not a response to loss of biomass in the previous year. To conclude, our study showed that sprouting can be very effective mechanism of extending the lifespan of individuals suppressed in the forest understory. Such a prolonged lifetime should be taken into account when considering the probability of natural regeneration in forest areas with long intervals between successive disturbances. The sprouting process should also be taken into account when assessing the lifespan of a seedling bank under a forest canopy, as the lifespan of individuals can be many times longer than the lifespan of sprouts.

AB Questions Plant species can be assembled into communities through habitat filtering or species competition, but their relative roles are still debated. We do not know whether there is limited similarity between co-existing species when accounting for the parallel effect of abiotic habitat filtering and biotic competition. By accounting for such effects, we test the predictions of three theories (classic niche theory, the Hubbell neutrality theory and the Scheffer and van Nes theory) of community assembly. Location Two vegetation transitions (a grazing gradient and a timber line ecotone) in a sub-alpine area of western Sichuan Province, China (31 degrees 51'N, 102 degrees 41'E). Methods We used a null model to investigate the above plant community assembly theories on two sub-alpine gradients of woody vegetation. In the null model, species traits were constrained between the maximum and minimum trait values of observed communities to test the principle of limiting similarity between co-existing species by testing for even spacing of traits. We analysed traits characterizing growth strategies of stems, leaves and twigs, measured at the level of individuals in situ. Results After accounting for variations in trait range, it became evident that six out of eight traits showed significantly uneven spacing within some plots, notably towards the forest end of the gradient, i.e. under increased competition pressure among woody plants. The Wilcoxon rank test showed that seven out of eight traits were significantly unevenly spaced within plots. The two transitions studied showed surprisingly similar patterns, despite their dissimilar precise drivers. Conclusion Our results support the recent theory of Scheffer & van Nes, which suggests that competition could result in a clumped pattern of species along a niche axis.

AB Aim The aim of this study was to use compositional changes in tree species along the Amazon River floodplain in Brazil to identify and characterize biogeographic regions that would serve as broad surrogates for conservation planning.
   Location The main course of the Amazon River in Brazil, covering a river distance of approximately 2800 km.
   Methods Two sampling methods were employed at specific sites: standardized transects and/or individual-based samples. Seventy-three samples were collected from 26 sites at approximately 100-km intervals along the floodplain. Biogeographic regions were identified by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination and by a hierarchical cluster analysis. The relative influence of environmental components (flood depths, annual rainfall, and length of the dry season) on tree species composition and one spatial component (longitude) were analysed by multiple regressions against a one-dimensional NMDS ordination axis.
   Results Based on tree species composition, three main biogeographic regions were identified: a western region between Tabatinga and the Negro River confluence; a central region from the Negro River confluence to the Xingu confluence; and an estuarine region from the Xingu confluence to Santana. The regions identified were consistent using different data sets and analytical techniques. Mixed environmental and spatial effects explained most of the variation, but the spatial effect alone had a greater influence on species composition than environmental effects alone.
   Main conclusions The regions delimited in the analyses differed from those based on geomorphology or World Wildlife Fund (WWF) ecoregions. These results reinforce the need for surrogates to be tested against biological data before they are used to shape approaches to conservation planning. Although a protected area coverage of 25% gives the impression of extensive conservation management on the floodplain, less than 1% of the Amazon's floodplain in Brazil is strictly protected. The significant compositional differences between regions and the strong spatial variation along the Amazon indicate that strict protection areas should be distributed much more evenly within and between regions.

AB The species-area relationship (SAR), i.e. the increase in species number with area, has been repeatedly used to predict species extinction, at both local and global scales, with habitat reduction. He and Hubbell (Nature, 2011; 473, 368-371), however, argued that the function that relates species loss with decreasing habitat area cannot be simply obtained reversing the species-area accumulation curve. Using a statistically more appropriate curve based on endemics (EAR), they concluded that the SAR overestimates species extinction. Although we agree that SARs and EARs have different shapes, this does not imply that SARs overestimate species extinction. Empirical evidence suggests that SARs do not overestimate, but underestimate species extinction by habitat loss and fragmentation. We discuss various examples taken from recent literature to show that SARs underestimate species extinction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Urban riparian zones are highly valuable for a range of environmental, social and economic reasons. Despite their ecological complexity, legislative instruments underpinning riparian protection focus predominantly on minimum corridor widths required to fulfill environmental functions. This study sought to identify the dominant environmental variables that influence riparian corridor biodiversity in northern Sydney, Australia. Ant and plant assemblages were sampled from 18 riparian corridors of various widths. Environmental data pertaining to each corridor were collected using field and desktop surveys. Generalised Linear Modelling found perimeter:area ratio and the gradient of the slope perpendicular to the stream to predict significantly ant and plant richness. Plant richness was also influenced by vegetation community type and corridor width. When streamside vegetation communities were considered in isolation, many of the same factors were found to influence species richness. Likewise, Distance-based Linear Modelling identified vegetation community type and landscape connectivity as significant predictors of ant composition both in streamside habitats and those located across the full width of each riparian corridor sampled. While width was the best predictor of plant assemblage composition across the whole riparian corridor, streamside vegetation was influenced more significantly by soil pH. This result arose principally due to a dominance of exotic plants in alkaline soils. Although wider corridors were likely to encompass a greater variety of biotic assemblages, landscape and site scale environmental characteristics appeared to be of greater ecological significance. Environmental managers should therefore consider these factors and target weed invasion when seeking to enhance biodiversity in urban riparian corridors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Neotropical freshwater ichthyofauna has among the highest species richness and density of any vertebrate fauna on Earth, with more than 5,600 species compressed into less than 12% of the world's land surface area, and less than 0.002% of the world's total liquid water supply. How have so many species come to co-exist in such a small amount of total habitat space? Here we report results of an aquatic faunal survey of the Fitzcarrald region in southeastern Peru, an area of low-elevation upland (200-500 m above sea level) rainforest in the Western Amazon, that straddles the headwaters of four large Amazonian tributaries; the Jurua (Yurua), Ucayali, Purus, and Madre de Dios rivers. All measures of fish species diversity in this region are high; there is high alpha diversity with many species coexisting in the same locality, high beta diversity with high turnover between habitats, and high gamma diversity with high turnover between adjacent tributary basins. Current data show little species endemism, and no known examples of sympatric sister species, within the Fitzcarrald region, suggesting a lack of localized or recent adaptive divergences. These results support the hypothesis that the fish species of the Fitzcarrald region are relatively ancient, predating the Late Miocene-Pliocene (c. 4 Ma) uplift that isolated its several headwater basins. The results also suggest that habitat specialization (phylogenetic niche conservatism) and geographic isolation (dispersal limitation) have contributed to the maintenance of high species richness in this region of the Amazon Basin.

   FOREST; HONG-KONG; BIODIVERSITY; EXTINCTIONS
AB To examine the relationship between forest succession after severe logging forestry practices and the composition of avian communities, we investigated how forest bird composition and guild structure change as a function of structural properties along a successional gradient, including a climax mature forest (>400 years), a rehabilitated mixed forest (50-70 years), and a disturbed Masson pine forest (70 years) of the Dinghushan Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province, China. Of a total of 51 resident species recorded, mixed forests hosted the highest numbers of individuals and species, reflecting the high species richness of both forest and non-forest species. For forest-dependent species, however, mature stands had the highest observed and estimated species richness. Of 6 habitat-use guilds identified, vertical-profile generalists and understory-birds formed the two dominant guilds, accounting for 54.0% and 38.7% of all individuals respectively. The results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) clearly showed that most forest-dependent species were associated with high proportions of native canopy cover and the mean density of dead trees and large trees, which are characteristic of old-growth mature forests ( horizontal heterogeneity) at stand level. Accordingly, conservation efforts should focus on the specialized requirements of the most habitat-restricted species in the future, especially for understory insectivores (Babblers) and large-tree users in mature subtropical monsoon forests of southern China. Moreover, since regenerating mixed forests are very similar to mature forests in both vegetation structure and bird community composition, we recommend that logging cycles (>50 years) be increased to a minimum of 50 years in southern China, so that a balance between economic and ecological interest can be reestablished.

AB Wild bear populations in Southeast Asia are threatened with extinction, but the ecology and distribution of the 2 species occurring in the region's protected areas is poorly known, so there is little scientific basis underlying conservation strategies. We used bear signs, primarily claw marks on climbed trees, to study habitat selection and distribution of Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) and sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) across Khao Yai National Park, Thailand from March to December 2008. We found black bear claw marks in 24 of 30 random sample blocks (80%), indicating that this species was widely distributed across Khao Yai. Sun bear signs were much scarcer: their claw marks occurred in 11 blocks (37%); data were too sparse for sun bear so we limited our focus to Asiatic black bear. Using logistic regression, we found that fruit abundance best explained variation in presence of black bear, whereas human disturbance, distance to park edge, elevation, and ground cover had little influence. Fruits appear to be a key resource for Asiatic black bears, and factors affecting fruit abundance or shifts in seasonality (e. g., climate change) will impact bear populations. Knowledge of this relationship will allow managers to be more proactive in managing bears. We recommend using sign surveys for monitoring changes in black bear occupancy as they are inexpensive, efficient, and can be conducted by trained park rangers. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.

AB Secondary habitats are increasing in importance in tropical countries due to ongoing destruction of pristine vegetation. In spite of the magnitude of current changes, our understanding of their effects on nontrees (e.g., nonvascular or vascular epiphytes) is still very patchy, particularly in lowland habitats. Here, we report a study with isolated pasture trees in southwest Panama. The > 800 studied trees, which belonged to > 100 different species, harbored almost 27,000 epiphytes of 83 species. Orchidaceae was the most species-rich family, with almost 60 percent of all species, while Bromeliaceae were most abundant. A rainfall gradient in the study region from ca 1000 to > 3000 mm explained more of the variation in species abundance and richness than host characteristics (e.g., species identity, tree size). The unexpectedly large number of epiphytes in these pastures still represents a substantial change relative to a natural setting, which is suggested by a comparison with a forest inventory under similar climatic conditions. In pastures, species richness was lower as deduced from individual-based rarefaction curves, a larger proportion of species and individuals showed crassulacean acid metabolism, and the relationship of epiphyte abundance/species richness and tree diameter was much less steep. Even the already reduced diversity, however, may be only transient in secondary habitats-the long-term persistence of epiphyte populations in pastures is an open question and has to be addressed by repeated monitoring to fully evaluate the significance of pasture trees for the conservation of vascular epiphytes in tropical lowlands.

AB Information about plant growth, development and age forms the basis for understanding complex forest ecological processes. Although lianas play an important role in tropical forests, little is known about their growth and development from either climatic or ecological perspectives. Therefore, we studied the growth rings in Legume liana species collected in a mountainous Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. Four of the eight studied species did not show cambial variants, three had a lobed stem, and one had a furrowed xylem. Distinct growth rings were observed in all species. Semi-ring porosity, marginal parenchyma, fibrous zone and radially flattened latewood cells were the main characteristic features of these growth rings. Species without cambial variants, including Dalbergia frutescens, Piptadenia adiantoides, P. micracantha and Senegalia tenuifolia, showed very distinct growth rings visible in macroscopic and microscopic analysis. Ring-width time series and cambial wound assessment were performed to analyze periodicity and dendrochronology. The species with cambial variants, S. grandistipula, S. lacerans, S. martiusiana and S. pedicellata, also showed distinct growth rings, however, sometimes barely detectable or not detected at all. Cambial wounding, cross-dating and climate-growth relationships indicated the annual nature of growth rings in species without cambial variant. Cross-dating between radii within one individual and between individuals was successful, and the synchronized series enabled us to build species chronologies and a mean chronology. Climate-growth analysis revealed significant correlations between chronologies and precipitation, indicating that available moisture is the main factor determining growth rates of lianas in the Atlantic forest.

AB Dung beetles fulfill several key functions in ecosystems but their role as secondary seed dispersers is probably one of the most complex ones. Various factors, such as seed characteristics, dispersal pattern induced by the primary disperser, season, and habitat, can affect the seed-beetle interaction. Particularly little is known about the fate of seeds primarily dispersed in small feces. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of these factors on the dung beetle community (species composition, number and size of individuals) and its consequences on burial occurrence and depth of seeds primarily dispersed by two tamarin species. We captured dung beetles in a Peruvian rain forest with 299 dung-baited pitfall traps to characterize the dung beetle community. Seed burial occurrence and depth were assessed by marking in situ 551 dispersed seeds in feces placed in cages. Among these seeds, 22.5 percent were buried by dung beetles after 2 d. We observed a significant effect of the amount of dung, season, time of deposition, and habitat on the number of individuals and species of dung beetles, as well as on seed burial occurrence and depth, while the tamarin species significantly influenced only the number and the size of dung beetles. This seed dispersal loop is particularly important for forest regeneration: small to large seeds dispersed by tamarins in secondary forest can be buried by dung beetles. These seeds can thus benefit from a better protection against predation and a more suitable microenvironment for germination, potentially enhancing seedling recruitment.

AB Land cover change in the Brazilian Amazon depends on the spatial variability of political, socioeconomic and biophysical factors, as well as on the land use history and its actors. A regional scale analysis was made in Rondnia State to identify possible differences in land cover change connected to spatial policies of land occupation, size and year of establishment of properties, accessibility measures and soil fertility. The analysis was made based on remote sensing data and household level data gathered with a questionnaire. Both types of analyses indicate that the highest level of total deforestation is found inside agrarian projects, especially in those established more than 20 years ago. Even though deforestation rates are similar inside and outside official settlements, inside agrarian projects forest depletion can exceed 50% at the property level within 10-14 years after establishment. The data indicate that both small-scale and medium to large-scale farmers contribute to deforestation processes in Rondnia State encouraged by spatial policies of land occupation, which provide better accessibility to forest fringes where soil fertility and forest resources are important determinants of location choice.

AB Monitoring programmes are essential for management of large mammal populations because they can detect population change. It is vital that we have the means to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas. Kibale National Park is a stronghold for large mammal conservation in Uganda. Past wildlife surveys in Kibale focused on specific taxa or areas, but our large mammal survey covered the entire protected area and we evaluated the intensity of sampling required to determine population change. Using line transect sampling, we found that the distribution of large mammals was nonrandom and related to habitat-type. However, confidence intervals of population estimates revealed that much more intensive sampling was required to detect changes in population density at a time scale reasonable for management. For many species, populations would have to decline by 40-60% for this method to detect population change. Post-stratification decreased confidence intervals of density estimates slightly, increasing our ability to detect change. However, confidence intervals of estimates were still too large to detect a meaningful population change on a time scale that would allow management to take action. Most incidences of illegal activity were about 5 km from the park boundary; however, animal densities were not lower in this area.Resume
   Les programmes de suivi sont essentiels pour la gestion de populations de grands mammiferes parce qu'ils permettent de detecter tout changement de population. Il est vital que nous ayons les moyens d'evaluer l'efficacite des aires protegees. Le Parc National de Kibale est un haut-lieu de la conservation des grands mammiferes en Ouganda. Des etudes anterieures faites sur la faune sauvage a Kibale se sont focalisees sur des taxons ou des sites specifiques, mais notre etude de grands mammiferes a couvert la totalite de l'aire protegee et nous avons evalue quelle etait l'intensite d'echantillonnage necessaire pour determiner un changement de population. En recourant a l'echantillonnage par transect lineaire, nous avons trouve que la distribution des grands mammiferes n'etait pas aleatoire et qu'elle etait liee au type d'habitat. Cependant, les intervalles de confiance des estimations de population ont revele qu'il etait necessaire de faire des echantillonnages beaucoup plus intenses pour deceler des changements de population dans des delais raisonnables pour la gestion. En effet, pour de nombreuses especes, il faudrait que les populations declinent de 40-60% pour que cette methode detecte un changement de population. La post-stratification diminuait legerement les intervalles de confiance des estimations de densite, et augmentait notre capacite de deceler un changement. Pourtant, les intervalles de confiance des estimations etaient encore trop grands pour detecter un changement de population significatif dans un delai qui permette a la gestion de prendre des mesures. La plupart des cas d'activites illegales se passaient a moins de cinq kilometres de la limite du parc, et pourtant la densite des animaux n'etait pas moindre dans cette zone-la.

AB Question: Under what conditions do species using distinct niches evolve and converge to become ecologically equivalent? Does evolution in a community context affect functional group diversity?
   Mathematical methods: We simulated the population dynamics and evolution of multiple species competing for discrete, substitutable resources.
   Key assumptions: Species' competitive effect and response are based on resource-use overlap. Evolution occurs via selection on mutations of small effect. Intraspecific genetic variation is the same for each species.
   Predictions: Evolution of equivalence is possible when species evolve in a community context. A combination of convergence, divergence, and extinctions occurs when the number of species exceeds the number of resources. Species avoid competitive exclusion via convergence or divergence in their resource use. Ecological and evolutionary outcomes depend on an interaction between the rate of evolution and the initial similarity of competitors. The evolution of equivalence determines diversity within functional groups, but niche processes drive diversity among groups.

AB Neighbourhood competition indices (NCI), where position and species identity of neighbours are known, have been used to investigate growth and competitive interactions among adult trees. In this study, we used NCI in 8-15-year-old stands following clear-cutting in a boreal mixedwood forest of eastern Canada to improve our understanding of early successional forest dynamics. Trees of increasing diameter from the center (>= 1 cm) to the edge (>= 5 cm) were mapped in twenty-five circular 450 m(2) plots. Target trees (DBH >= 1 cm) were sampled in plot center to determine their annual radial stem growth. For each species, we compared a set of growth models using either a spatially explicit NCI or a non-spatial competition index. Both types of indices estimated a species-specific competition coefficient for each pair of competitor-target species. NCI were selected as the best competition model for all target species although differences in variance explained relative to the non-spatial index were small. This likely indicates that competition occurs at the local level but that the high density and the relative uniformity of these young stands creates similar neighbourhoods for most trees in a given stand. The effective neighbourhood radius for competitors varied among species and was smaller for shade tolerant species. Intraspecific neighbours were the strongest competitors for most species. Aspen (Populus tremuloides) was a weak competitor for all species as opposed to balsam fir (Abies balsamea) which was a strong competitor in all cases. These results are in contradiction with some widely used forest policies in North America (e.g. free-to-grow standards) that consider broadleaf species, such as aspen, as the strongest competitors. For these early successional forests, the decision regarding the use of spatial or non-spatial competition indices should rest on the intended use. For even-age management, spatial indices might not justify their use in high-density stands but they are needed for the simulation of novel harvest techniques creating complex stand structure.

AB (Recently burnt 'campo rupestre' in the Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil: resprouters and seeders, with endemic rock species). Fire is a recurrent disturbance in many areas of Chapada Diamantina, generally set by human activity that drives rapid changes in communities. This study aims to investigate the composition and structure of 'campo rupestre' vegetation in a recently burned area, between 700 and 800 to above sea level, at Chapada Diamantina National Park, Bahia, Brazil, and to discuss the strategies of regeneration for the roost conspicuous species and floristic similarities among sites with and without recent fire disturbance. A species census of all vascular plants in 16 plots (10x10 m) was performed, and species cover was estimated in five subplots (2x2 m). 85 species were found, distributed among 34 families, including 11 monocotyledons, 22 eudicotyledons and one monilophyte. The most abundant specie was Panicum trinii Kunth (Poaceae) and the most frequent was Periandra mediterranea (Vell.) Taub (Fabaceae). The Shannon index was 3.4. The study area grouped with a rocky area at lower altitudes (38% similarity). Probably, fire is more frequent in these areas than on hill summits. The main dominant species resprouted from underground buds and from aerial organs. One of the most frequent species, Dactylaena microphylla Eichler, was established from seed. Fire-sensitive endemic species survive on vegetation islands on rocky outcrops.

AB This article draws on world-system theorizing to explore the relationship between deforestation and the vertical flow of soybean exports from less-developed nations to more-developed nations as a specific form of ecologically unequal exchange. Despite overwhelming case-study research exploring soybean-deforestation dynamics in less-developed countries, the current literature lacks any cross-national investigation of this trend. Ordinary least squares regression is used to examine whether soybean exports are associated with deforestation and if the magnitude of this relationship varies by region. Overall, the findings confirm the proposed hypotheses and suggest that having a comparative advantage in soybean production is not a viable development strategy.

AB Key questions for understanding the resilience and variability of Mexican Neotropical cloud forest assemblages in current and future climate change include: How have human disturbances and climate change affected the dynamics of the cloud forest assemblage? What are the predominant processes responsible for its present day composition and distribution? Are the current conservation strategies for the cloud forest in accordance with preserving its natural variability through time? In this study, the temporal dynamics of the cloud forest in west-central Mexico over the last similar to 1300 years were reconstructed using palaeoecological techniques. These included analyses of fossil pollen, microfossil charcoal, and sediment geochemistry. Results indicated that a cloud forest assemblage has been the predominant vegetation type in this region over the last similar to 1300 years. During this time, however, there have been changes in the vegetation with an apparent expansion of cloud forest from similar to 832 to 620 cal years bp and a decline from 1200 to 832 cal years bp. Climate change (intervals of aridity) and human disturbances through anthropogenic burning appear to have been the main factors influencing the dynamics of this cloud forest. The spatial heterogeneity reported for high-altitude forests in this region, in concert with high beta diversity, appears to be a manifestation of the high temporal variability in species composition for these forests. Greater turnover in cloud forest taxa occurred during intervals of increased humidity and is probably representative of a higher temporal competition for resources among the cloud forest taxa. The present results support the current protection scheme for cloud forests in west-central Mexico where areas are kept in exclusion zones to avoid timber extraction, grazing, and agriculture; this will maintain diversity within these forests, even if there are only a few individuals per species, and enable the forests to retain some resilience to current and future climate change.

AB Establishment of protected area networks to protect species and habitats has been one of the most effective conservation tools used around the world. On this premise Madagascar is planning to triple its protected areas by 2012. Recent studies have addressed the design of this new network in order to optimize biodiversity conservation. However, given the limited time, available resources and looming imminent threats both to biodiversity and to ecosystem services, we argue that we need to prioritize this process by including human related factors. We developed a framework and three composite indices, incorporating human related threats, ecosystem services and biological measures, which we used to identify priorities within the developing protected area network of Madagascar. In particular, we examined data on human population, roads, agricultural suitability and fire prevalence, alongside measures of hydrological and biological importance. Sixteen key biodiversity sites, which were not formally gazetted in the first round of designation, emerged as especially important for both biodiversity and ecosystem services. Two of these unprotected sites contain endemic frog species under imminent threat of extinction. Six of the sites we highlighted were subject to high-human pressure, while we detected limited human activity in the other ten. Our framework is computationally straight-forward and applicable to other regions of the world, and could be applied alongside community and stakeholder consultation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB The number of species-rich seminatural grasslands in Northern Europe has decreased significantly due to the abandonment of traditional land use practices. To preserve these habitats, an increasing number of abandoned and overgrown grasslands have been restored by cutting down trees and shrubs and reintroducing grazing. These practices are considered a useful tool to recover the species richness of vascular plants, but their impact on other taxa is hardly known. Here we studied ants as one important group of grassland insects. We investigated (1) the effects of restoration of nongrazed and afforested seminatural grasslands, compared to continuously managed reference sites; and (2) the modulating impacts of habitat characteristics and time elapsed since restoration. We found a total of 27 ant species, 11 of these were characteristic of open habitats and seven characteristic of forests. Neither species richness per site nor the number of open-habitat species, nor the number of forest species differed between restored and reference sites. Yet, within the restored sites, the total species richness and the number of open-habitat species was positively related to the time since restoration and the percentage of bare rock. High frequencies of most open-habitat species were associated with low vegetation, older restored sites, and reference sites. Most forest species showed their highest frequencies in tree- and shrub-dominated habitat. We conclude that restoration efforts have been successful in terms of retrieving species richness. A regular and moderate grazing regime subsequent to the restoration is suggested in order to support a high abundance of open-habitat species.

AB Competitive coexistence depends on dynamic interactions between competitor and resource populations, including mutualism between the resource and each competitor. We add mutualism to a well-known model of resource competition and show that it can powerfully stabilize competitive coexistence in the absence or presence of resource heterogeneity. We use a transition matrix approach to describe lottery competition, while allowing each of two competitors to affect the population dynamics of their shared resource. For example, two plant-defending ant species may compete for nesting space within ant-adapted (myrmecophytic) plants. We show that mutualism between consumers and a resource species can stabilize competitive coexistence of the consumers by allowing each competitor to influence resource dynamics in a way that benefits the other. The effect of this novel coexistence mechanism depends on a mutualism's biological details: for example, altering myrmecophyte fecundity affects competing ant species differently than does altering plant survival. Finally, we consider a heterogeneous resource (e.g., two types of nest site) and show how niche partitioning can stabilize coexistence in the absence of resource dynamics. When resource heterogeneity is dynamic (e.g., small and large plants of the same species), niche partitioning also provides new routes for additional stabilization via mutualism.

AB Ants are extensive users of arboreal sugars, but little is known about how ecological dominance or habitat succession influences this interaction. We investigated how the availability and use of arboreal sugar resources by ants changes across a restoration chronosequence. We surveyed the use and availability of hemipteran honeydew and floral nectar on the two dominant plant genera, Eucalyptus and Acacia, in study sites in south eastern Australia. Sugars used by ants are likely to drive their role as ecosystem engineers, while sugars not used by ants remain available to other organisms. We also tested whether the use of sugars differed between ecologically dominant and non-dominant ants; taxa likely to perform different functions in ecosystems. No floral nectar was available on Acacia, but later successional eucalypts supported more floral resources and fewer mutualist hemiptera. Successional stage significantly affected how much sugar remained unexploited by ants, with similar trends for ant use of sugars. Non-dominant ants used mainly floral nectar, while hemipteran honeydew resources were used disproportionately by dominant ants, consistent with the prediction that this group monopolises persistent carbohydrate resources. This pattern was similar across successional stages, but the difference was least in habitats with the greatest availability of floral nectar, suggesting that high sugar availability may reduce the incentive to defend honeydew. Across habitat types, the proportion of dominant ants increased with the availability of hemipteran honeydew. This suggests that honeydew availability may regulate ecological dominance, thus affecting ant-driven ecosystem processes.

AB Aechmea bracteata is a common epiphytic bromeliad found in symbiosis with many other species throughout tropical forests of Mexico and south through Panama. Given its importance and distribution in these forests, we asked how may A. bracteata be restored to areas where they have thrived in the past? We first investigated seed viability and response of seed germination to temperature, humidity, vapour pressure deficit (VPD), and light, under controlled growth chamber conditions. We recorded these environmental conditions within a seasonal tropical forest where this species is common and then conducted seed germination trials in various seral stages. In growth chambers, with constant water supply, highest germination percentages were at the highest temperature and lowest VPD levels. In the field, germination was less than 1%. Because of high temperatures and VPD within early seral stages, efforts to re-introduce A. bracteata into forests < 20 years old are not likely to be successful.

AB In Amazonia, topographical variations in soil and forest structure within "terra-firme" ecosystems are important factors correlated with terrestrial invertebrates' distribution. The objective of this work was to assess the effects of soil clay content and slope on ant species distribution over a 25 km(2) grid covering the natural topographic continuum. Using three complementary sampling methods (sardine baits, pitfall traps and litter samples extracted in Winkler sacks), 300 subsamples of each method were taken in 30 plots distributed over a wet tropical forest in the Ducke Reserve (Manaus, AM, Brazil). An amount of 26,814 individuals from I I subfamilies, 54 genera, 85 species and 152 morphospecies was recorded (Pheidole represented 37% of all morphospecies). The genus Eurhopalothrix was registered for the first time for the reserve. Species number was not correlated with slope or clay content, except for the species sampled from litter. However, the Principal Coordinate Analysis indicated that the main pattern of species composition from pitfall and litter samples was related to clay content. Almost half of the species were found only in valleys or only on plateaus, which suggests that most of them are habitat specialists. In Central Amazonia., soil texture is usually correlated with vegetation structure and moisture content, creating different microhabitats, which probably account for the observed differences in ant community structure.

AB 1. We carried out rapid assessments of the richness and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies (sampled with baited traps) and dung beetles (sampled with buffalo dung-baited pitfall traps) at 20 sites across an anthropogenic forest disturbance gradient in Ba Be National Park, Vietnam.
   2. We investigated measures of diversity, richness, and functional composition for individual taxa in relation to the degree of disturbance, and verified whether dung beetles and butterflies showed congruent trends.
   3. For butterflies, overall species richness increased with forest disturbance, but the richness of rare species decreased. Species diversity was uncorrelated with disturbance.
   4. In dung beetles, species richness was unrelated to forest disturbance, but species diversity increased with forest disturbance. The richness of dung beetles in the telecoprid (roller) guild declined with forest disturbance.
   5. There was no significant correlation between dung beetles and butterflies across sites for either species richness or species diversity.
   6. Apparent effects of disturbance were thus sensitive to the particular metric used (species richness or diversity), the taxonomic group studied (butterflies or dung beetles), and the functional group investigated (different guilds of dung beetle).

AB Transferring ecological information across scale often involves spatial aggregation, which alters information content and may bias estimates if the scaling process is nonlinear. Here, a potential solution, the preservation of the information content of fine-scale measurements, is highlighted using modeled net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of an Arctic tundra landscape as an example. The variance of aggregated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), measured from an airborne platform, decreased linearly with log(scale), resulting in a linear relationship between log(scale) and the scale-wise modeled NEE estimate. Preserving three units of information, the mean, variance and skewness of fine-scale NDVI observations, resulted in upscaled NEE estimates that deviated less than 4% from the fine-scale estimate. Preserving only the mean and variance resulted in nearly 23% NEE bias, and preserving only the mean resulted in larger error and a change in sign from CO2 sink to source. Compressing NDVI maps by 70-75% using wavelet thresholding with the Haar and Coiflet basis functions resulted in 13% NEE bias across the study domain. Applying unique scale-dependent transfer functions between NDVI and leaf area index (LAI) decreased, but did not remove, bias in modeled flux in a smaller expanse using handheld NDVI observations. Quantifying the parameters of statistical distributions to preserve ecological information reduces bias when upscaling and makes possible spatial data assimilation to further reduce errors in estimates of ecological processes across scale.

AB Patterns of movement and space usage are important components of the ecology of any organism. Among snakes, this information is often lacking even for species that are abundant, ecologically important, and/or relevant to human health. We used radiotelemetry to examine the spatial ecology and behavior of the fer-de-lance (Bothrops asper), a highly venomous pit viper that is ubiquitous throughout much of Central America. Sixteen adult snakes were tracked over 2 yr in lowland rainforest of Costa Rica to determine home range, movement patterns, and foraging behavior. Consistent with previous descriptions, B. asper was found to be a highly nocturnal ambush predator, exhibiting virtually no activity during the day. Overall home range was determined using both minimum convex polygon (mean size = 5.95 ha) and 95 and 50 percent kernel density (mean size = 3.71 and 0.370 ha, respectively); home range size did not differ between males and females by any estimation method. Movement pattern was largely aseasonal and unrelated to any observed environmental conditions other than the daily low temperature. Most movements consisted of short (< 10 m) movements between daytime shelter and nocturnal ambush sites within a given area, interspersed with longer distance (> 50 m) movements to new foraging areas. Compositional analysis of habitat usage indicated an avoidance of developed areas and selection of swamp habitat. Most snakes had several activity cores (50% kernel density), the majority which were in or near swamps. These patterns suggest that space and habitat usage of fer-de-lance may be related to foraging strategy.

AB Local species diversity may be determined by processes operating locally, such as disturbance, predation and competition, or by regional processes, such as environmental structuring or history. Classical theory focusing on competition predicts that the species combining to form communities will be less similar to each other than they would be if they were assembled at. random from a regional species pool, Theory focusing on environmental structuring predicts that species will be more similar to each other than expected by chance. A randomisation test that determines the extent to which local species lists represent random selections from a regional list, based on the average relatedness between species, was applied to data held in the MacroBen database. Little or no evidence was found for species lists of whole faunas at any scale being random subsets of species lists at larger scales. Species tend to be more closely related to each other than would be expected if they were assembled at random. Thus marine soft-sediment macrofauna are not locally assembled at random from regional species pools and it is likely that regional processes determine the assembly of communities. Focusing on the most abundant class within the macrofauna, a different pattern emerges, in that there is a much stronger tendency for local polychaete composition to be a random subset from regional pools at all scales. Thus it is not possible to determine whether local polychaete diversity is independent of both local and regional processes, or determined by a combination of both acting antagonistically.

AB Extrapolation of local abundance-environment relationships to broader scales provides species distribution models used for conservation planning. We investigated the importance of environmental heterogeneity and geographic distance on pteridophyte species spatial distribution on 38 plots of 250 x 2.5 m distributed over 90 km(2) in Central Amazon. Inclusion of canopy openness in our models increased the capacity of predicting community composition even under the narrow range of canopy openness found in our plots. Nevertheless, there was still a large amount of unexplained variance (55-65%). The response of the community to the light gradient was hierarchical and we did not find evidences of light partitioning. Most species were concentrated in low light plots but a few common and abundant occurred along the entire gradient. Soil properties were the major determinants of community composition. Contrary to similar studies, slope was not a good predictor of pteridophyte community composition, indicating that this relationship may be site-specific. There was no correlation between floristic distances and geographic distances. We concluded that mesoscale turnover is low, although locally environmental variation determines high turnover of species. Studies among different Amazonian physiognomies tend to find high levels of beta-diversity. However, coarse comparisons can not reveal subtle patterns that are relevant for biodiversity conservation planning. This study found some important changes on pteridophyte community within the same type of forest, mainly related to environmental heterogeneity, even in narrow ranges of environmental variation.

AB This study examines the functional attributes of Neotropical dung beetles, and, based on the analysis, evaluates the role of dung beetles in pastures and tropical dry forest in El Salvador. Dung beetle diversity was lower in pastures than in forests. However, the total biomass of beetles at similarly-sized dung baits was frequently higher in pastures. Diversity loss followed structured patterns: (1) carrion and fruit feeding beetles were well represented (species number) in the forests but were largely absent from pastures; (2) large ball rollers and small fast tunnellers were present in forests but were absent from pastures; (3) large fast tunnellers and small slow tunnellers were poorly represented in pastures compared to forests but the few species that survived in pastures attained extremely high populations; and (4) each functional group in the species-poor pasture assemblages was divided almost equally into day and night active species. Substrate and habitat generalists that were present in both the forests and pastures were attracted to fruit and carrion in forested habitat but not in open pastures. In open habitats, flies and other insects may be the principal decomposers of decaying fruit and carrion.

AB Sympatric species of vesper mice Calomys laucha and Calomys musculinus are difficult to discriminate, especially in natural history collections where they are identified by external body measurements and cranial characteristics. Accurate identification of these two species can be important because only one of them, C. musculinus, is a Junin virus reservoir, the aetiological agent of the Argentine Hemorragic Fever. Research has focused into the development of molecular techniques to unambiguously identify these species. We apply statistical procedures from the field of pattern recognition to three-dimensional geometric morphometric data based on skull landmarks to identify sympatric species C. laucha, C. musculinus and Calomys venustus. Pattern recognition techniques correctly identified the three species without any prior information on specimen identity. By contrast to expectations, C. venustus differed from the other two species mainly on the basis of shape and not by its centroid size. The main sources of difference between C. laucha and C. musculinus were of shape, specifically localized at the landmarks defined by: (1) the sutures between the premaxillaries, the nasals and the frontals; (2) the sutures between the parietals, the frontals and the squamosals; and (3) the suture between the parietals and the interparietal. Nevertheless, allometries dominate the patterns of interspecific variation between these latter species and may partly explain past identification difficulties. Morphological evolution is discussed. The need for objective methods to define phenotypic clusters is highlighted with respect to the need for fast and precise biodiversity assessments.

AB The role of edaphic factors in driving the relationship between plant community structure and ecosystem processes is a key issue of the current debate on functional implications of biodiversity. In this study, we draw a direct link between aboveground/belowground relationships, vegetation structure, and aboveground management. We used ground nesting ants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as an example for quantifying the role of biotic interactions in soil. Although both groups are known to have a major impact on grasslands, the interactive effect of these taxa on vegetation structure and its sensitivity to grassland management is poorly understood. We show that the ant Lasius flavus increases the root arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization (AMC) of grasses by modifying biotic and abiotic soil properties. As a possible consequence, the shoot length of grass growing on ant mounds was shorter and shoot N and P concentrations were higher than in grass growing off of the mounds. In addition, management affected ant nest architecture and soil and, in turn, AMC. These results emphasize the need to consider the interactions between plants, soil microorganisms, soil fauna, and aboveground management to increase the understanding of the drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in grasslands both aboveground and belowground.

AB 1. The diversity and structure of communities are partly determined by how species partition resource gradients. Plant size is an important indicator of species position along the vertical light gradient in the vegetation.
   2. Here, we compared the size distribution of tree species in 44 Ghanaian tropical forest communities, using data from 880 one-hectare plots and over 118 000 trees belonging to more than 210 species.
   3. The size distribution of forest species showed a continuous normal or log-normal distribution, with many canopy species and a few large species, and varied from community to community. Multiple regression showed that this variation is related to rainfall and to disturbance.
   4. Size distributions in wet forests were less skewed than those in dry forests, with a smaller proportion of big species and a smaller size range. At the same time they exhibited tighter species packing, resulting in higher species richness. Communities with high disturbance have less species packing and lower species richness. 5. Synthesis. We conclude that the factors that constrain organism size and species coexistence in these tropical forest tree communities differ from those known to operate on a number of well-studied animal communities.

AB The Southern Grassland biome in Brazil has long been neglected by the government and by the scientific community as well. Lack of studies about the effects of disturbance (mostly fire and grazing) on plant community and populations are the main hindrances for the future management plans, which complicates the conservation of this rich and unique biome. In this study, the population biology of a rosette species, Eryngium horridum (Apiaceae), has been investigated, in order to compare the effects of fire, grazing and abandonment. E. horridum is a very common species and many farmers consider it a nuisance. Two different areas were chosen for the study purposes: Morro Santana and the Research Center Pro-Mata. Areas under different types (fire and grazing) and disturbance histories were compared. Populations were analysed in plots of 25 m(2), divided in age-state classes (seedlings, young, adult and reproductive individuals). Both morphological and phenological traits have been investigated. Fire influenced populations in a direct way, whilst grazing showed an indirect effect. Seedlings were found only in areas excluded from disturbance for 3 years on Morro Santana. Due to this, seedling establishment might be more related to environmental conditions than to disturbance regimes. Young individuals were mainly found in recently burned areas, while adult individuals were dominant in areas excluded from disturbance. Additionally, individuals from E. horridum showed a great capacity of resprouting after plant damage. Reproductive individuals also showed the capacity of producing new rosettes after the death of the inflorescence axis. This strategy is probably of great importance for the survival of populations in areas excluded from disturbance. Therefore, vegetative reproduction seemed to be the most important strategy for the maintenance and survival of its populations, allowing longer population persistence over time, even in the absence of disturbance.

AB We present the results for over two decades of monitoring on intertidal food-gatherers and the population of the low rocky shore dweller kelp Durvillaea antarctica, a short-distance disperser, inside and outside the no-take marine reserve, Estacion Costera de Investigaciones Marinas (ECIM), at Las Cruces, central Chile. It was hypothesized that protection of an initially extremely depleted population would recover by recolonizing first the no-take area and then adjacent non-protected (exploited) areas. We found that recovery of D. antarctica occurred slowly inside ECIM, with increase in density and biomass, of up to three orders of magnitude as compared to an adjacent non-protected area, which showed similar to 2-yr delay. These results suggest that the kelp population inside ECIM was likely regulated via intraspecific competition, which did not occur outside. Results showed no evidence for juvenile vs. adult density dependence other than a weak relationship for the central area of ECIM. These findings also suggest that the population recovery and cross-boundary seeding subsides affected the population dynamics. Understanding these dynamics may enhance management and conservation policies. Our work highlights the critical value of baseline and long-term comparative studies in marine no-take protected and non-protected areas for understanding how population processes respond to human and conservation practices.

AB We used the process-based forest growth model FORMIND2.0 to show that recruitment limitation and the intermediate disturbance hypothesis which proposes maximum diversity in forests of intermediate disturbance intensity or frequency are both processes which impact on tropical tree species richness. Both processes influence each other and should therefore not be analyzed separately. While on a local level a rise in recruitment limitation promotes species richness, the overall richness of the whole forest declines. Disturbance levels are more important for species richness in forests which are highly limited by recruitment. This study supports previous field data investigations from the Americas. It also highlights the lack of consensus regarding the definition of disturbance and recruitment limitation, which makes inter-study comparisons difficult. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The introduction of alien species is one of the main threats to the conservation of native species, especially in island ecosystems. Here, we report on the population growth of 15 species of mammals introduced in 1983 on the island of Anchieta, an 828 ha land-bridge island in southeastern Brazil. We estimated the density of mammals through 296 km of line transect census. Five species introduced became extinct (coypu, brocket deer, six-banded armadillo, nine-banded armadillo, maned three-toed sloth); six became over-abundant (marmoset, coati, agouti, seven-banded armadillo, and capybara); one has a stable population (capuchin monkey). Anchieta Island has the highest density of mammals in the entire Atlantic forest (486.77 ind/km(2)), especially nest predators (232.83 ind/km(2)) and herbivores (253.58 ind/km(2)). Agoutis (Dasyprocta spp.) and marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) were, by far, the species with the highest population growth. The high density of mammals in this island may have strong consequences for plant recruitment and bird diversity.

AB Nectar production may disproportionately benefit male relative to female pollination success. In such cases, sexual selection is often suggested as the cause of asymmetric benefits, yet sexual selection in plants-particularly plants with hermaphroditic flowers-is infrequently tested empirically. Here, I used a protandrous herb with male-biased nectar production (Chrysothenlis friediichsthaliana. Gesneriaceae) to test predictions from sexual selection theory. During three flowering seasons, I measured nectar production, pollinator visits. and male and female fecundity following different numbers of cross-pollination events. In accordance with sexual selection predictions, (I) nectar production was greater during the male phase by at least 65%; (2) visits by the main pollinator (hummingbird Phaethornis striigularis) were limiting for part of the season, indicating that plants had to compete for pollinator visits-, (3) pollinators spent 53% more time per visit and made 86% more visits to male- vs. female-phase flowers, suggesting that nectar increased male more than female pollination success: and (4) female fecundity was maximized by one visit. whereas male fecundity continued to increase with additional visits. Autonomous self-pollination further reduced visit requirements for maximum female seed set. These findings match specific sexual selection predictions: they link an observable I male bias in a secondary sexual trait (nectar) to positive responses of mating participants (pollinators), resulting in more mating opportunities for mate-limited males, relative to apparently resource-limited females. This field-testing of theoretical predictions provides unique evidence that sexual selection helps maintain nectar production patterns in this and, quite likely. other hermaphroditic plant species.

AB It is known that convergence and divergence can occur in complex plant communities, but the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors driving these processes is less clear. We addressed this issue in an experiment using a range of mixed stands of five species that are common in Swiss fens (Carex elata, C. flava, Lycopus europaeus, Lysimachia vulgaris and Mentha aquatica) and two levels of water and nutrients. One hundred and seventy-six experimental mixtures were maintained in large pots (75 l) for two consecutive growing seasons in an experimental garden. The stands varied systematically in the initial relative abundance of each of the five species and in overall initial stand abundance. The changes in biomass over 2 years were modelled as linear functions of treatments and the initial biomass of each species. The dynamics of the system were mainly driven by differences in the identity of species and by a negative feedback mechanism but also by different abiotic conditions. In all mixtures, C. elata became more dominant over time, which caused an overall convergence of community composition. In addition, the rate of change of each species' biomass was negatively related to its own initial abundance. Thus, a negative feedback further contributed to the convergence of communities. Species responded differently to water level and nutrient supply, causing community dynamics to differ among treatments. However, the different abiotic conditions only slightly modified the overall convergence pattern. Competitive interactions between more than two species were weaker than the negative feedback but still significantly influenced the species' final relative abundance. The negative feedback suggests that there is niche partitioning between the species, which permits their coexistence.

AB Low postdispersal mortality of palm seeds in tapir dung is hypothesized to result from the mechanical barrier provided by dung against bruchid infestation and/or from the distance to adult palms at which seeds are dispersed. We tested these hypotheses by distributing endocarps of Attalea phalerata Mart. ex Spreng. in experimental dung piles in Beni, Bolivia. Predation rates were significantly lower for seeds covered by dung than for exposed or partially covered seeds, but did not differ between seeds placed below and 50 m away from palms. Thus, dung, not short-distance dispersal, protects seeds against bruchid beetles, and may ultimately promote survival of palm seeds.

AB The nature of Amazonian ecosystem responses to the large-scale environmental changes characterizing glacial-interglacial cycles is poorly understood. We investigated this issue with a series of transient, continuous 21 000-year simulations using a dynamic process-based ecosystem model. Our results indicate that the Amazon Basin has been dominated by evergreen rain forests since the last glacial maximum (LGM), demonstrating the resilience of this ecosystem to glacial-interglacial environmental change. We find that biome shifts in ecotonal areas since the LGM were driven predominantly by climate change, while coincident, increased ecosystem carbon storage throughout the Amazon Basin was driven largely by CO2. Our findings imply that recent observed biomass increases in contemporary rain forest plots might be part of a long-term trend driven by the anthropogenic rise in CO2 over recent centuries.

AB A mathematical model incorporating the effects of possibly asymmetric frequency dependent interactions is proposed. Model predictions for an idealized two-species annual plant community with asymmetric linear frequency dependence are explored using (i) analytic mean field equilibrium predictions, (ii) deterministic, discrete-time, finite-population, mean field predictions, and (iii) stochastic, discrete-time, cellular automata predictions for a variety of sizes of the spatial interaction and dispersal neighborhoods. We define species interaction factors, ranging from 0 to 1, which incorporate both frequency independent and frequency dependent terms. The maximum competitive ability of a species is reduced unless species frequency is optimal based on species-specific frequency dependence coefficients, ranging from -1 to +1. Assuming that maximum competitive ability is identical for two species, they can coexist indefinitely when they have equal absolute magnitude or both have sufficiently negative frequency dependence. Although smaller scales of spatial interactions reduce the region of the parameter space in which stable coexistence is predicted, the time to extinction of one species can be significantly increased or decreased by the locality of interactions, depending on whether the losing species has positive or negative frequency dependence, respectively. The sensitivity to initial conditions in the community at large is dramatically reduced as the spatial scale of interactions is decreased. As a consequence, smaller spatial interaction neighborhoods increase the ability of introduced species to invade established communities in regions of the parameter space not predicted by mean field approximations. In the "loser positive, winner positive" regions, smaller scales of interaction dramatically increased invasiveness. In the "loser positive, winner negative" regions of the parameter space, invasion success decreases, but time to extinction of the resident species during successful invasions increases, with an increase in the spatial scale of interactions. The "loser negative, winner positive" regions were relatively insensitive to initial conditions, so invasion success was relatively high at a variety of spatial scales. Surprisingly, invasions in parts of this region are most often successful with intermediate neighborhood sizes, although the maximum time that the losing species could persist before being driven to extinction increases with an increase in the spatial scale of interactions. These results are explained by understanding cluster formation and density and the relative local interspecific dynamics in cluster interiors, exteriors, and boundaries. In summary, frequency dependent interactions, and the spatial scale on which these interactions occur, can have a big impact on spatio-temporal community dynamics, with implications regarding species coexistence and invasiveness. The model proposed herein provides a theoretical framework for studying frequency dependent interactions that may shed light on spatio-temporal dynamics in real ecological communities.

AB Time-lapse videography of limpets mounted with light-emitting diodes was used to monitor the movements of a population of the non-homing Cellana grata on a vertical gully wall in Hong Kong. Animals were monitored for > 7 days to examine spatial and temporal variation in their behaviour as the tides transited from a semi-diurnal to an almost diurnal pattern. Movement was synchronised with the tides, irrespective of the day-night cycles. Limpets rested low on the shore and were stimulated to move by the rising tide. Individuals moved up shore with the flooding tide, maintaining themselves in the awash zone, and then down shore on the ebbing tide, until they reached a resting height when the tide then fell beneath them, exhibiting 'zonal shuttling'. A tight coupling of limpet position to tide height persisted through the changing tidal pattern, and almost all animals displayed the same organisation of activity over all tides. Initiation of activity and maximum height reached were probably controlled by the tides, but the cessation of activity may have been controlled by an internal clock. The pattern observed is consistent with the threat of attack from aquatic predators coupled with the need to minimise physical stresses while exposed. It is also consistent with the avoidance of grazing lower on the shore where interspecific competition may be more intense. Limpets showed two peaks of activity per tide, corresponding to when the rate of change of tide height was the greatest, except when tides became much reduced during the transit to a diurnal pattern. Movement was triphasic: an initial rapid phase, followed by a slower phase in the high shore and then a rapid phase before the limpets stopped moving. This structure is common in limpets and in this case is likely to be a consequence of animals maintaining themselves within the awash zone. Tide height appears to determine foraging activity, but with modifications in the behaviour in response to factors operating at more local temporal and spatial scales.

AB To examine tree diversity and stand structure and their relation to site disturbances, we used the tree dataset of ten I-ha permanent plots of tropical dry evergreen forests of peninsular India, distributed five in inland and five in coastal areas. In the ten independent sites, a 100 m x 100 m permanent plot was established, and all trees >= 10 cm girth at breast height were enumerated, their girth measured and tagged. Tree diversity totalled 77 species in 61 genera of 30 families. Tree density varied from 596 to 2813 stems ha(-1), and basal area ranged between 12.4 and 36.5 m(2) ha(-1). Species richness did not show any significant variation within and between the inland and coastal areas. We examined the relationship between basal area and site disturbance scores between the five sites of inland and coastal forest areas and found a negative correlation in both the areas. The coefficient of variability in species distribution among the ten sites revealed the extent of species heterogeneity. The number of species and stems decreased from the smallest to largest girth class. The tree inventories of the studied sites when compared with those of other tropical dry evergreen forests showed great differences in density and basal area, probably due to different geographical location and varying annual rainfall patterns. Our study sites can be designated as Meme-cylon umbellatum-Drypetes sepiaria-Pterospermum canescens series, based on species importance value.

AB Aextoxicon punctatum, the only representative of the family Aextoxicaceae, is a tree species endemic to temperate forests of western South America. This species exhibits a disjunct distribution pattern, with few isolated populations occurring on coastal hilltops of the Chilean semi-arid zone (SAZ), 30 - 32 degrees S; small populations mixed with sclerophyllous forest in some gorges of the central Chilean Mediterranean coastal range (MCR), 32 - 39 degrees S; more continuous forests extended along the southern temperate coastal range (TCR), 39 - 43 degrees S; and fragmented populations eastward in the south temperate central depression and Andean foothills (TAF), 39 - 41 degrees S. This geographic disjunction is the result of climatic and tectonic changes that took place in southern South America since the late Tertiary, leading to the isolation of forest fragments in the SAZ from the rest of the distribution. According to palynological evidence, populations of TCR and TAF originated from postglacial population expansions from refuges located on the coastal range, north of 40 degrees S. We examined how the present genetic structure and diversity of Aextoxicon populations in Chile reflects this biogeographic history. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to characterise genetic differences within and among 16 populations of this species throughout its natural range. AMOVA and UPGMA analysis showed high genetic differentiation between the geographically closer SAZ and MCR populations, suggesting a long history of restricted genetic exchange between populations in these two zones. Estimates of Shannon's genetic diversity and percentage polymorphism were relatively low compared with other southern temperate forest trees (mainly conifers) that were less affected by the glaciations. Positive correlations between genetic and geographic distances were found for TCR but not for TAF populations, suggesting earlier postglacial population expansion southwards along the TCR and more recent eastward migration from coastal locations to TAF during the Holocene.

AB In the past decade, there has been growing concern about the rapid degradation of marine ecosystems due to anthropogenic causes. Consequently, identifying priority areas for the conservation of marine biodiversity has become a crucial conservation issue. Taking into account the influence of human population density, we performed complementarity analyses to identify priority areas for the conservation of all coastal marine vertebrate species in Chile (265 species), and evaluated congruence among the different target groups. The distribution ranges of all species were digitized in a geographic information system and analyses were performed on latitudinal bands of 0.5. Our results show that 12 latitudinal bands (similar to 16% of all latitudinal bands) are necessary to conserve at least one population of each species. Ten of these bands are irreplaceable, whereas two are flexible. Many of the irreplaceable sites lie within areas that have high human population density. In order to conserve all threatened and endemic species, six and three latitudinal bands are needed, respectively. Four latitudinal bands are needed to represent all species of fish, reptiles, and mammals, whereas nine bands are needed to protect all bird species. Taking flexible sites into account, reserve networks that meet the minimum representation goal for each taxonomic group, and for threatened and endemic species, represent subsets of the 12 latitudinal band network selected for all species. Spatial congruence among reserve networks selected for each target group was relatively low and only significantly higher than random in 9 out of 2.1 pairwise comparisons. However, with the exception of reptiles, conservation areas selected for different surrogate groups represented other groups relatively well, compared to randomly selected sites.

AB Pine wilt disease is one of the most serious diseases in the pine forests of Korea. Since the first report of the disease in Busan, Korea, in 1988, the disease has been gradually spreading into neighboring regions and now occurs in many regions of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula. The control of the disease is focused on the killing of the sawyer, Monochamus alternatus, an insect vector, by aerial insecticide spraying for adult control and by fumigation or burning infected trees for larval control. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of aerial insecticide application on pine forest fauna by comparing ant communities in insecticide-sprayed and Unsprayed areas. Samples were collected from five regions using three different sampling methods (pitfall trap, sweeping net, and shaking net). The results showed that community indices such as abundance, species richness and species diversity were not significantly different between insecticide-sprayed sites and unsprayed sites. According to a cluster analysis and a correspondence analysis, ant communities were generally grouped based on the location of the sampling sites with a slight variation of insecticide application, but not grouped by insecticide application showing that ant community structures were not significantly different between the insecticide-sprayed sites and the unsprayed sites. Our results, overall, support the theory that the impact of the aerial insecticide application oil pine forest fauna may be less severe than expected.

AB Bray and Curtis ordination was used to explore which environmental variables explained importance values and the presence-absence of tropical tree seedlings, saplings and adults in La Escondida-La Cabana, Sierra de Manantlain, Jalisco, Mexico. The diameters of trees >= 2.5 cm DBH and the presence and height of seedlings and saplings were measured in nine 0.1 ha sites. Four matrices including presence-absence data and importance value indices for trees and seedlings and saplings were analyzed through Bray and Curtis ordination. The matrices were based on density, frequency, and dominance of adult trees as well as seedlings and saplings. The environmental matrix consisted of 18 variables, including elevation, slope, canopy gaps, disturbance, and soil variables. We recorded 63 tree species and 38 seedling and sapling species in the nine sites. The ordination explained 70.9% of the variation in importance value data for trees and 62.6% for seedlings and saplings. The variation explained in presence-absence data for trees was 67.1 and 77.4% for seedlings and saplings. The variance in the ordination axes of seedlings and sapling presence-absence data was poorly explained by the number of gaps in the tree, shrub, or herb layer, suggesting little light specialization by seedlings and saplings. Habitat specialization for soil nutrients appears to be important in explaining the presence-absence of seedlings and saplings. Seedling and sapling specialization along different soil microsites could promote species coexistence in this forest, while heterogeneity in light conditions may instead determine differences in growth and, thus, importance value of trees. We hypothesize that in tropical dry forest in Jalisco, Mexico, a habitat specialization for soil resources is likely more importance at early stages in tree life histories than in later life history.

AB 1. Experimental field data and interspecific comparative analyses were used to detect effects of seed mass on seedling performance within and among seven species of Psychotria sown in gaps and shaded rainforest sites. In addition we compared the effects of seed mass within and among species to detect concordance between the two ecological scales. We used two comparative methods: phylogenetically independent contrasts and cross-species correlations.
   2. Among species, we detected weak evidence of a positive correlation between seed mass and the probability of emergence in the shaded forest, and no effects of seed mass in gaps.
   3. Among species, no significant correlations between seed mass and either seedling survival or seedling recruitment were found in any habitat. Other variables specific to each subgenus appear to be more important than seed mass in determining survival in the shaded forest.
   4. There was a negative correlation between seed mass and relative growth rate (RGR) in both habitats. In gaps, small-seeded taxa exhibited particularly high RGR, compensating for the initial advantages of higher seed mass.
   5. All species studied exhibited recruitment in gaps equal to or higher than that in the shaded forest. However, recruitment success in shaded forest relative to gaps increased with seed mass, indicating a higher affinity for shaded forest among larger-seeded taxa, but this relationship was only detected using PICS analysis.
   6. Correlations between seed mass and seedling mass are similar within and among species, indicating a simple principle of mass transference. In contrast, correlations between seed mass and seedling emergence, seedling survival, seedling recruitment and RGR depend on the scale at which they are observed.

AB The width of the increment zones in the xylem of Cedrela fissilis Veil. was investigated by dendrochronological methods on a tropical (10 degrees 09' S, 59 degrees 26' W) and a subtropical site (25 degrees 15' S, 50 degrees 45' W) in Brazil as to study the relationship between the El-ni (n) over tildeo southern oscillation (ENSO) and the cambial growth of this species. Tree-ring width chronologies were developed for both sites from cross-dated increment curves. Simple correlations were computed between the southern oscillation index (SOI), meteorological records, and the annual increment of Cedrela. On the tropical site the annual increment of Cedrela was correlated with the precipitation from March to May of the previous growth period, while on the subtropical site the annual increment was correlated with the air temperature in May of the previous growth period and in November of the current growth period. On the, tropical site reduced precipitation from March to May was correlated with low SOI values ("El-ni (n) over tildeo") in March and April. On the subtropical site increase of air temperature in May and October was correlated with low SOI values in March/April and September/ October, respectively. On the tropical site 57% and on the subtropical site 53% of the variability of the annual increment of Cedrela was due to precipitation and temperature anomalies related to ENSO. This shows that on both sites to a certain amount the variability of cambial growth of Cedrela is related to ENSO, but tree ring chronologies of Cedrela alone are not secure proxy data for the reconstruction of El-ni (n) over tildeo events.

AB 1. A prime goal in ecology is to understand the consequences of different productivity levels on system structure and stability. The number of trophic connections per species is a main parameter of food web structure often associated with total number of species and disturbance but not with productivity. We analyse the association between number of trophic connections and productivity for top predators in a terrestrial ecosystem.
   2. Since 1987, the diets of the strigiforms Speotyto cunicularia (Burrowing owl), Bubo magellanicus (Magellan horned owl), Glaucidium nanum (Austral pygmy owl), Tyto alba (Barn owl), the falconiform Falco sparverius (American kestrel), and the canid Pseudalopex culpaeus (Culpeo fox) have been monitored in a semi-desert scrubland of central Chile. The collective sample yielded 18 707 regurgitated pellets, 6557 fox faeces and 87 698 individual prey identified over 15 years of study.
   3. Prey richness was standardized with a rarefaction procedure to a constant number of individual prey. The association between precipitation (a proxy of ecosystem productivity in semi-deserts) and mean number of trophic connections was analysed with polynomial multiple regression. The analysis was also done for each predator separately.
   4. The diet richness of all six predators varied idiosyncratically with precipitation, supporting the hypothesis that detailed food web structure varies dynamically with productivity. However, no association between these variables was detected across the entire predator assembly. Conservation of food web topology in spite of large variation in productivity, species composition, and individual species richness, supports the view that connection pattern is a key attribute of food web structure.

AB The present study aims to identify and characterize the relationships among landscape structure and plant diversity in a tropical landscape forest in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Total species richness as well as that of trees, shrubs and vines species were identified from 141 sampling quadrats (16,543 individuals sampled). Based on vegetation classes obtained from multi-spectral satellite image classification, I constructed plant diversity maps of the landscape under study using stratified kriging. I calculated the mean number of species in individual patches as the average values of kriging estimates inside of each patch. I then explored the relationships between landscape pattern metrics and the species richness of trees, shrubs and vines, as well as all groups combined using regression analysis. I employed Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to select a set of candidate models. Based on akaike weights, I calculated model-averaged parameters. Results show that plant diversity of the patches depends on both the quality of the surrounding habitats and the proximity of surrounding patches (i.e., patch isolation).

AB We asked whether the ability of individual plants to adjust leaf traits during ontogeny reflected immediate morphological means of responding to current light availability or was consistent with a developmental strategy to meet predictable future light conditions. We determined leaf mass per unit area ( specific leaf mass, SLM), leaf area, toughness, and water content of seedlings, juveniles, and adults of eight nonpioneer tropical tree species of different maximum mature heights ranging from 8 to 40 m. For SLM and leaf area, immediate responses to environmental conditions, reported as the ratio of leaf traits in sun and shade environments ( leaf plasticity), were similar for seedlings, juveniles, and adults of all species irrespective of maximum mature height. For toughness and water content, leaf plasticity at different ontogenetic stages depended on species identity. To facilitate comparisons across species, developmental changes were reported as the correlations between the ratio in leaf traits for three ontogenetic stages ( developmental leaf change) and maximum mature height. Tall species showed greater change in SLM and leaf area from seedling to adult stages than short species, as might be expected of taxa that experience more heterogeneous light environments during their lives. Leaf traits changed in response to current light levels during ontogeny, but the magnitude of the response is related to the adult habitat of a species.

AB The diet of thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) during a cool-water oceanographic regime, July 1999 through May 2000, was compared to the diet during the previous warm-water/transitional period, August 1998 through January 1999. Stomach samples were collected from the U.S. Pacific Coast drift and set gill net fisheries. Of the samples examined from the cool-water period, only 8 prey taxa were found, revealing a narrower trophic spectrum than found during the previous warm-water/transitional period, when 20 prey taxa were identified. As in the warm-water/transitional period, northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) was the most important overall prey, even more dominant than in the previous period. Additionally, market squid (Loligo opalescens) was second in importance and dramatically more prevalent in the cool-water period than in the warm-water/transitional period. Other important diet items in the cool-water period, in descending order of importance, were "unidentified teleosts"; Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax); Pacific hake (Merluccius productus); and Pacific or chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus): these were also among the top six items in the previous warm-water/transitional period. As expected, pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes), relatively common in the diet during the warmer period, was absent from the diet during the cool-water period. It is suggested that during cool-water periods the thresher shark subsists on a narrow range of food items (such as anchovy and squid), but the diet becomes more diversified and opportunistic during less-productive warm-water El Nino periods.

AB Birds are sensitive to perturbations in climate. Changes in reproductive ecology may reflect changes in food availability caused by environmental conditions. We studied the influence of the La Nina phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on breeding success and survival and growth of nestling Burrowing Parrots (Cyanoliseus patagonus) (Aves, Psittaciformes) in Patagonia. During the breeding season 1998-99, a severe drought affected the region as a consequence of a strong La Nina. We compare data from a La Nina event with an average year. Clutch sizes were similar in the two years. In both years, clutch size declined during the season. Our results suggest that environmental conditions are not the primary determinant of clutch size in Burrowing Parrots, and seasonal differences are more likely caused by differences in adult quality. Nestling mortality was higher during La Nina, while the surviving nestlings showed reduced growth. Hatching order had a stronger influence on growth and survival of nestlings during La Nina than during the average year. Last-hatched nestlings always showed reduced growth compared with middle- and first-hatched nestlings, but the difference between nestlings was greater during La Nina.

AB We examined the distribution, germination, growth and photosynthetic characteristics of two co-existing morphotypes of the pioneer tree Trema micrantha at the Barro Colorado Nature Monument (BCNM), Panama. Morphotypes differed significantly in distribution and in seed characteristics. A 'large'-seeded morphotype (endocarp mass = 3.83 mg) was associated with treefall gaps in the forest interior, whereas a 'small'-seeded morphotype (endocarp mass = 1.38 mg) was found predominantly on landslides on the margins of Lake Gatun. Seeds of the small-seeded morphotype germinated faster than seeds of the large-seeded morphotype, with seedlings of the small-seeded morphotype showing both a higher Unit Leaf Rate (ULR) and a lower Specific Leaf Area (SLA). Differences in photosynthetic rates reflected differences in SLA; the small-seeded morphotype had a higher rate on a leaf area basis, while the large-seeded morphotype had a higher rate on a leaf mass basis. Although allocation patterns between morphotypes varied in a way consistent with known interspecific differences between 'sun' and 'shade' plants, relative growth rates (RGR) of the morphotypes were similar across different light conditions suggesting that factors other than light, such as water uptake efficiency, soil nutrient requirements, and perhaps seed dispersal characters may explain the habitat partitioning of morphotypes.

AB Here we report massive seed predation of Pseudobombax grandiflorum (Bombacaceae) by Botogeris versicolurus (Psittacidae) in a forest fragment in Brazil. The intensity of seed predation was very high when compared to other studies in continuous forest, perhaps resulting from a scarcity of resources in such areas. This scarcity may limit the range of parrot's diet to a few plant species. It suggests that studies of Psittacidae seed predation may be important for conservation of some plants in fragments.

AB The effects of soil-water availability on leaf light acclimation and whole-plant carbon gain were examined in Arisaema heterophyllum Blume, a riparian deciduous forest understorey plant. Photosynthesis, above-ground morphology and ramet biomass accumulation (relative growth rate: RGR of a corm for a full leaf life-span) were measured on plants raised under three light treatments combined with two soil water conditions. The two higher light treatments during growth (high: max. 550 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1); medium: 150 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)) resulted in a twofold increase in RGRs, 30% higher photosynthetic capacities and 20% less photosynthetic low-light use efficiency than those under a low light condition (50 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)). Leaf area was the smallest and leaf mass area ratio was the largest under the high light treatment. Water stress decreased both photosynthetic rate and leaf area and, hence, RGR in all the light regimes. However, water stress did not alter the general patterns of physiological and morphological responses to different light regimes. We estimated that higher photosynthetic low-light use efficiency and larger leaf area in the low light leaf would lead to a threefold carbon gain as compared with the high light leaf under simulated low light conditions. Both experimental and simulation results suggest that the physiological and morphological acclimations tend to be beneficial to carbon gain when light availability is low, whereas they favor increased water use efficiency when light availability is sufficiently high.

AB The population structure of the canopy liana Machaerium cuspidatum Kuhlm. & Hoehne (Fabaceae) was studied in ten transects covering a total of 2.5 ha of tropical rain forest in Yasuni National Park, eastern Ecuador. The aim was to investigate how trellis availability, topographic position and light availability affected the population density and structure of the most abundant liana species in the area. The environmental variation affected plants in different size classes differently. Large plants (diameter greater than or equal to1 cm) were almost exclusively found in areas with low canopy and dense undergrowth. These areas had the highest density of suitable host plants. Seedling-sized plants (height < 30 cm) and saplings (height &GE;30 cm but diameter < 1 cm) occurred more frequently and with higher density in steep upland areas than in the floodplains, presumably due to elevated seedling mortality in the periodically flooded areas. Seedling-sized plants and saplings did not grow in areas with elevated light levels, and although plants of all sizes were highly clumped, this clumping rarely coincided with patches with abundant canopy gaps. Machaerium cuspidatum reproduces clonally when branches re-root and break off from the parent plant. The density of clonally produced plants was high in areas where the density of sexually produced plants was low, whereas the total density varied little among habitat types. A higher proportion of the seedling-sized plants were of sexual origin in the upland areas. An environmentally induced increase in the production of independent ramets enables M. cuspidatum to persist in the floodplains. This shows that plants may expand their realised niches to habitats with a low potential for seedling survival if high seedling mortality can be compensated for by increased clonal reproduction.

AB This paper summarizes recommendations for the management of previously marginalized and neglected subsistence fisheries in South Africa. The recommendations stem from the activities and analyses of a task group appointed by Government and mandated to provide advice about management of the new fishing sector. The following focus areas were identified for attention: planning for implementation; definitions of subsistence fishers and other sectors; assessment and categorization of resources; determination of types of fishing activities; zonation; management systems; training; communication mechanisms; application and allocation procedures; compliance processes; research and monitoring; development of institutional capacity. Subsistence fishers were defined as poor people who personally harvest marine resources as a source of food or to sell them to meet basic needs of food security; they operate on or near to the shore or in estuaries, live in close proximity to the resource, consume or sell the resources locally, use low-technology gear (often as part of a long-standing community-based or cultural practice), and the resources they harvest generate only sufficient returns to meet basic needs of food security. A second group of informal fishers was identified that fishes for profit but cannot be equated to large industrial fisheries, and a new sector was proposed to accommodate these artisanal "small-scale commercial" fishers. Resources were classified for use by these different sectors based on accessibility, fishing methods, cash value and sustainability. In all, 12 different categories of subsistence and small-scale commercial 'fisheries were identified, and a preliminary list of resource species suitable for different fishing sectors is presented. A multi-tiered institutional management structure is recommended, with the national agency (MCM) controlling issues of national concern, and supporting and coordinating the activities of provincial and local structures. The management agents required for effective implementation were identified and include a dedicated national Subsistence Fisheries Management Unit, provincial management agencies that have the capacity to be delegated authority, Regional Fieldworkers, an independent Advisory Group for Subsistence Fisheries Management, local co-management structures, and community monitors responsible for observing and recording fishing activities and catches. Co-management, involving both authorities and users in joint management, is advocated in preference to previous top-down approaches, because of its potential to improve communication and compliance.

AB 1, Attempts at determining the physiological basis of species' differences, such as the ability to grow in deep shade, have been of limited success. However, this basis is fundamental to predicting species' responses to rising atmospheric CO, in the forest understorey. We linked a leaf photosynthesis and a tree architecture model to predict the effects of dynamic and steady state photosynthetic characteristics, crown architecture and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration( [CO2]) on crown-level carbon gain (A(crown)). Twenty-four-h A(crown) was modelled for shade-tolerant Acer rubrum and shade-intolerant Liriodendron tulipifera saplings growing for three years in a forest understorey under ambient and elevated [CO2] in free-air CO2 enrichment.
   2, Two factors best explained A(crown) in ambient [CO2]: tree light environment and sapling allometry. Microsite light environment influenced carbon gain via daily photosynthetic photon flux (PFD), average diffuse PFD and sunfleck characteristics. Species differences in specific leaf area (SLA) and size-related biomass allocation to leaves affected the effective leaf area and hence A(crown).
   3, At a common above-ground biomass, small saplings (100 g above-ground dry mass) of L. tulipifera had higher A(crown) than A. rubrum samples due to larger SLA and greater biomass allocation to leaves. Larger saplings of the two species had similar A(crown) due to greater carbon allocation to leaves with increasing plant size in A. rubrum vs L. tulipifera. For saplings > 800 g, A(crown) was greater in A. rubrum than in L. tulipifera. Enhancement of A(crown) by elevated [CO2] on sunny days was similar for both species.
   4, Overall, though the shade-tolerant species had lower A(crown) than the shade-intolerant species at a common small size, our results indicate that the relative performance of these species can reverse at larger sizes due to allocational differences. These results suggest that elevated [CO2] may accelerate competition for light between A. rubrum and L, tulipifera as these species grow larger in the understorey.

AB The effects of dispersal pattern (seeds in small clumps vs. seeds scattered in pain) and distance to the nearest Carapa procera (Meliaceae; a tree that produces seeds preferred by terrestrial vertebrates) on survival of seeds and seedlings were examined for the anima-dispersed tree species Virola michelii (Myristicaceae) in a mature forest at Paracou, French Guiana, in 1992 and 1993. We assessed the putative role of ground-dwelling mammalian herbivores, rodents, and ungulates that filter the seed shadow, acting either as dispersers or predators and thus modifying the original pattern of seed dispersal made by frugivores. We measured the effects of simulated seed burial by rodents using marked seeds and quantified the effect of protecting seeds and seedlings from ground-dwelling vertebrates on seedling germination and survival with fence exclosures in 1992. Dispersal pattern had short-term but no long-term effect on the proportion of V, michelii seeds that survived one year later as seedlings. In the short term, within six weeks, clumped seeds survived better than scattered seeds in both years. Marked seeds that were removed from their site of dispersal were eaten; rodents only rarely buried seeds of V. michelii, and seed burial reduced seed and seedling survivorship. The combined effect of the factors year and Carapa proximity significantly affected seed survival within six weeks. Although six-week seed survival was greater in 1993 than in 1992, seedling establishment was lower in 1993 than in 1992 following a lower rainfall regime during the key period of seed germination (February). One-year seed and seedling survivorship was similar between treatments and years. Seed survival and seedling establishment in V. michelii was dependent on vertebrates in the short term and on climate in the long term. Overall, seed and seedling survivorship depended on a combination of these factors.

AB We present a graphic model that explores the effect of distance between parent plants on seed predation and seedling recruitment. Based on the assumption that distance between parents may affect the shape of the seed shadow, the model predicts that seed predators may affect seedling recruitment curves under isolated plants but they are unable to affect these curves under close parent plants. The predictions of the model are tested experimentally in Cryptocarya alba (Lauraceae), a common tree of the Mediterranean forest, Central Chile. Results show that predictions are not met under isolated parent plants. Although seed density decreases significantly away from parent plants, this effect is not relevant for seed predation and seedling recruitment. The biotic/abiotic contrast existing under the canopy vs outside the canopy, plus the shade-tolerance of this tree, better explains the seedling recruitment observed under isolated parent plants. Nevertheless, the predictions of the model are corroborated under close parent plants. Seed shadows overlap to the extent that they generate a homogeneous seed distribution, homogeneous seed predation and homogeneous seedling recruitment as well. We discuss the implications of the model in terms of the spatial pattern of seedlings and the benefits of dispersal from isolated and close parent plants.

An integral analysis was made using a basic data matrix related to mechanisms of isolated overlaps.
   A herbivorous-detritivorous diet was observed, mainly composed by planktonic and benthonic organisms wit no apparent preference of perifiton. The abundance of tadpoles was mainly related to pluviometric distribution and hydrological level. No statistically significant differences of diet composition were found. The selection pressure would consist in non-trophic resource distribution on spatial and temporal dimensions.

AB Post-dispersal predation on seeds of vertebrate-dispersed plants (Rubus spectabilis, Oplopanax horridus, and Streptopus amplexifolius) of the temperate rainforest of southeast Alaska was experimentally examined comparing "clean" seeds with seeds embedded in feces of bears, important dispersers in the area, and comparing also different microhabitats where seeds may be dropped or defecated. It was found that seed removal was significantly higher for clean seeds than for seeds within bear feces, and that levels of seed predation were similar for seeds under plants of the same species and for seeds under plants of other species. These results indicate that seed predators (presumably mostly rodents) use neither fecal material nor the presence of a conspecific plant as a clue to the location of seeds.

AB The littorine gastropods Cenchritis muricatus, Nodilittorina mespillum, N. angustior, N. dilatata, N. riisei, N. ziczac and Tectarius antonii from a natural limestone platform on the north coast of Jamaica were evaluated according to several ecological parameters in an effort to define their respective niches on this shore. Distributions along transects perpendicular to the shore demonstrated that distance from the sea is one, albeit not always consistent, ecological criterion which serves to delineate these species. N. riisei generally occupies that region of the shore frequently wetted by wave splash, N. mespillum is usually found within frequently refreshed tidepools and C. muricatus always occupies the highest regions of the shore most distant from the sea. There is, however, considerable overlap between these and other species and, along much of the rock platform, N. angustior, N. dilatata, T. antonii and C. muricatus are sympatric. N. dilatata has the broadest range on this low profile limestone platform. A comparison of body temperatures and substratum temperatures taken from adjacent rock surfaces revealed that the body temperatures of T. antonii generally reflect that of the ambient environment. On the other hand, C. muricatus, N. dilatata, N. riisei and N. angustior seem to thermoregulate, maintaining body temperatures above ambient at temperatures below 29 degrees C and below ambient at temperatures above 33 degrees C. Data were also compiled for most species with respect to resting posture (whether hanging suspended or resting aperture-down), resting site (whether within the shelter of a crevice or upon an exposed rock surface), shell orientation and the relative frequency (presence or absence) of a mucous holdfast. Size-frequency analyses indicate that N. riisei and N. angustior re-populate the shore from the meroplankton at least sometime between January and March.

AB Openings in the pitch pine (Pinus rigida Mill.) forests of southern New Jersey may persist for decades. In five such openings, ranging in size from 22 to 223 m(2), and their surrounding forest matrix, we characterized the vegetation, the forest floor, root biomass, soil chemistry and soil fungi. There was a much greater disparity between the openings and the forest matrix in the density of small ericad shrubs than in the number or basal area of the canopy trees, and this disparity was mirrored in the thickness of the litter and organic horizons, and in the total small root biomass. The matrix:gap ratios of total root biomass and of total soil fungal length were similar to the ratios for tree and large shrub densities. Extractable NH4-N, Bray-P, pH, and soil moisture did not differ between the openings and matrix, but extractable NO3-N was higher in the openings than the intact forest. We suggest that the shrubs may be an important factor in maintaining the differences between the openings and the matrix, by trapping litter, maintaining high root biomasses, and inhibiting decomposition. If the organic horizon is destroyed in a locally intense disturbance, the slow rate of invasion and growth of the shrubs into mineral soil may help perpetuate the opening for long periods of time.

AB Four ascidians - Clavelina lepadiformis, Aplidium proliferum, Morchellium argus and Botryllus schlosseri - were examined for larvotoxic properties. In using aqueous extracts against invertebrate larvae, moderate levels of toxicity were detected. C. lepadiformis extract displayed strong toxicity to all larvae. Methanol extracts applied to a polystyrene surface reduced settlement of M. argus larvae, and produced toxic effects against larvae of the bryozoan Flustrellidra hispida and the tubeworm Spirorbis spirorbis. The observations suggest that the ascidians may contain potential anti-larval compounds and their possible role in preventing fouling is discussed.

AB The preference of large (>60 cm total length) Cape hake (Merluccius capensis Castelnau, 1861) for small conspecifics under natural conditions was analyzed off southern Namibia (S.E. Atlantic) between 1983 and 1989. The results indicate that cannibalism is not related to the density of the small conspecifics nor to the density of alternative prey, but rather that large hake have a dietary preference for small conspecifics. The main consequence of such cannibalism is a lack of density-dependent regulation of the M. capensis population.

AB The effects of shell and food availability on survival and duration of the megalopal stage of the sympatric intertidal hermit crabs Pagurus hirsutiusculus (Dana) and P. granosimanus (Stimpson) were examined. In both species, survival to the first juvenile crab stage in the laboratory was independent of food and shell availability. In P. hirsutiusculus, megalopal duration was also independent of food and shell availability, whereas the presence of a shell shortened the duration of the megalopal stage in P. granosimanus by slightly more than a day. P. granosimanus megalopae took longer to reach competency, but used shells more quickly and consistently, than did P. hirsutiusculus megalopae. When P. granosimanus megalopae had a shell, the presence of food shortened megalopal duration, whereas when megalopae lacked a shell, food lengthened megalopal duration. This suggests that P. granosimanus megalopae may retain at least a limited ability to feed (although we were unable to directly observe feeding in either species). These observations are consistent with interspecific differences in adult shell-associated behaviors, and suggest that for P. granosimanus shells are more important to early postlarval survival, or more difficult for megalopae to obtain, than for P. hirsutiusculus. However, the delay capabilities of P. granosimanus are relatively trivial compared to other invertebrates, which suggests that pagurid megalopae generally have little trouble locating suitable shells.

AB For decades, ecologists have studied fundamental questions of how Amazonian biodiversity is maintained, and whether that diversity can persist following deforestation. The long history of avian research at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, near Manaus, Brazil, has helped advance this understanding in the context of a broader research program focused on rainforest fragments embedded in a dynamic matrix. By sampling birds beginning before fragments were isolated, in the late 1970s, and continuing the protocol to the present, our work has revealed community dynamics driven not just by area and isolation, but also by larger landscape patterns, particularly second growth recovery over decadal scales. Fragments permanently lose some bird species, but their communities need not follow a trajectory toward catastrophic change. Our challenge now is to determine under what conditions remnant patches and developing second growth can support not just the rich diversity of Amazonian rainforest species but also their population processes and emergent community properties.

AB Many insects feed on a low-nitrogen diet, and the origin of their nitrogen supply is poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that some insects rely on nitrogen-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs) to supplement their diets. Nitrogen fixation by diazotrophs has been extensively studied and convincingly demonstrated in termites, while evidence for the occurrence and role of nitrogen fixation in the diet of other insects is less conclusive. Here, we summarize the methods to detect nitrogen fixation in insects and review the available evidence for its occurrence (focusing on insects other than termites). We distinguish between three aspects of nitrogen fixation investigations: (i) detecting the presence of potential diazotrophs; (ii) detecting the activity of the nitrogen-fixing enzyme; and (iii) detecting the assimilation of fixed nitrogen into the insect tissues. We show that although evidence from investigations of the first aspect reveals ample opportunities for interactions with potential diazotrophs in a variety of insects, demonstrations of actual biological nitrogen fixation and the assimilation of fixed nitrogen are restricted to very few insect groups, including wood-feeding beetles, fruit flies, leafcutter ants, and a wood wasp. We then discuss potential implications for the insect's fitness and for the ecosystem as a whole. We suggest that combining these multiple approaches is crucial for the study of nitrogen fixation in insects, and argue that further demonstrations are desperately needed in order to determine the relative importance of diazotrophs for insect diet and fitness, as well as to evaluate their overall impact on the ecosystem.

AB Indirect defence, the adaptive top-down control of herbivores by plant traits that enhance predation, is a central component of plant-herbivore interactions. However, the scope of interactions that comprise indirect defence and associated ecological and evolutionary processes has not been clearly defined. We argue that the range of plant traits that mediate indirect defence is much greater than previously thought, and we further organise major concepts surrounding their ecological functioning. Despite the wide range of plant traits and interacting organisms involved, indirect defences show commonalities when grouped. These categories are based on whether indirect defences boost natural enemy abundance via food or shelter resources, or, alternatively, increase natural enemy foraging efficiency via information or alteration of habitat complexity. The benefits of indirect defences to natural enemies should be further explored to establish the conditions in which indirect defence generates a plant-natural enemy mutualism. By considering the broader scope of plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions that comprise indirect defence, we can better understand plant-based food webs, as well as the evolutionary processes that have shaped them.

AB Tropical forests in Central Africa host unique biodiversity threatened by human degradation of habitats and defaunation. Forests allocated to conservation, production and community management are expected to have different conservation values. Here, we aimed to identify the determinants of the conservation value of tropical forests in southeastern Cameroon, by disentangling the effects of forest allocations, proximity to human settlements, and local habitat. We inventoried two taxonomical groups: mammal species with camera traps (3464 independent detection events) and dung beetle species with pitfall traps (4475 individuals). We used an integrated analytical approach, examining both species richness and composition. For both mammals and dung beetles, species richness decreased from the protected area to the community forests, and the logging concession showed intermediate richness. Species richness of both groups was negatively correlated to the proximity to human settlements and disturbance, with a decreasing gradient of body mass and the loss of the most threatened species. The replacement (i.e., spatial turnover) of both mammal and dung beetle species among forest allocations suggest an integration of conservation initiatives to a large number of different sites, with a priority on protected and remote areas of high biodiversity. These results confirm the high conservation value of protected areas and their essential role in conservation strategies, ecologically connected with well-managed production forests with variable conservation value mainly depending on accessibility. Community forests located close to villages are much more degraded but not totally defaunated and still provide bushmeat to local populations.

AB Interception loss can remove a significant portion of rainwater from forested ecosystems. Therefore, the quantification and modelling of interception loss are of significant importance if human and ecosystem water demands are to be balanced under a future changing climate. This is particularly true for semi-arid/arid regions, where afforestation has become an important ecological restoration measure to tackle desertification, poverty and climate change. However, quantification and modelling of interception loss of plantations in these regions have rarely been reported. In the present study, rainfall interception loss was quantified and modelled over a one-year period (January-December 2016) for a deciduous broad-leafed R. pseudoacacia plantation and an evergreen needle-leaf P. tabuliformis plantation (common afforestation tree species) situated in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China. The stand age, density, canopy cover and leaf area index of R. pseudoacacia during the study period were 15 years, 2000 tree ha(-1), 0.48 and 1.41 m(2) m(-2), respectively. The corresponding values for Pinus tabuliformis were 17 years, 1200 tree ha(-1), 0.62 and 2.53 m(2) m(-2). The measured throughfall, stemflow and derived estimates of interception loss for R pseudoacacia were 81.1%, 1.3% and 17.6%, respectively. The corresponding values for P. tabuliformis were 75.4%, 0.7% and 23.9%. Given that the weather conditions experienced by the two forest stands were similar, the observed higher interception loss for P. tabuliformis can be explained by the higher canopy storage capacity and wet canopy evaporation rate of this species. The revised Gash analytical model of rainfall interception was well calibrated and validated against field measurements and was able to simulate the cumulative interception loss at two forest stands accurately, and it also effectively captured the seasonal variation (leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons), provided that the optimized wet canopy evaporation rates were used. The revised model was highly sensitive to the canopy storage capacity and changes in the ratio of mean wet canopy evaporation to mean rainfall intensity and less sensitive to canopy cover, but it was found to be fairly insensitive to the trunk storage capacity.

AB An ecological compensation standard should reflect the value of ecosystem services that their beneficiaries derive from providers. However, as there is no uniform method for the establishment of such standards, we researched the flow of water services in the upper reaches of Miyun Reservoir located in Beijing and Hebei provinces (China) based on the InVEST model and integrated water storage capacity method. The proposed ecological compensation standard can reflect the value of water services flowing from upstream to downstream areas. The results show that the total value of water services in the study area was $ 62,778.71x10(4)/year. The water regulation value accounted for 73.64% of the water service value. Further, the downstream areas in Beijing should pay $ 57,444x10(4) to the upper reaches. The ecological compensation standards for different supply areas varied based on forest composition. In Chengde, Zhangjiakou, and Beijing, the ecological compensation standards were $ 759.51/hm(2)/year, $ 479.65/hm(2)/year, and $ 938.26/hm(2)/year, respectively. The developed compensation standard reflects the value of the ecosystem services, and is also affordable. The results of this study could thus provide a basis to establish a compensation standard based on continuous consultation and discussion.

AB Network analysis is a powerful tool to understand community-level plant-pollinator interactions. We evaluated the role of floral visitors on plant fitness through a series of pollination exclusion experiments to test the effectiveness of pollinators of an Ipomoea community in the Pacific coast of Mexico, including: (1) all flower visitors, (2) visitors that contact the reproductive organs, (3) visitors that deposit pollen on stigmas, and (4) visitors that mediate fruit and seed production. Our results show that networks built from effective pollination interactions are smaller, less connected, more specialized and modular than floral visitor networks. Modules are associated with pollinator functional groups and they provide strong support for pollination syndromes only when non-effective interactions are excluded. In contrast to other studies, the analyzed networks are not nested. Our results also show that only 59% of floral visitors were legitimate pollinators that contribute to seed production. Furthermore, only 27% of the links in visitation network resulted in seed production. Our study shows that plant-pollination networks that consider effectiveness measures of pollination in addition to floral visitation provide insightful information about the different role floral visitors play in a community, encompassing a large number of commensalistic/antagonistic interactions and the more restricted set of mutualistic relationships that underlie the evolution of convergent floral phenotypes in plants.

AB A current goal among many scientific disciplines is to incorporate data on past human land use and climate change into current global climate and vegetation models. Here, we used existing archaeological and paleoecological data to provide a spatiotemporal reconstruction of human history in Greater Amazonia over the Holocene. We used an ensemble distribution model based on a database of georeferenced C-14-dated material and environmental factors to predict the changes in spatial distributions of past human occupation sites. We ran these models for the precultivation (13,000-6000 yr ago), early cultivation (6000-2500 yr ago), and late cultivation (2500-500 yr ago) periods. The ensemble models suggest that people mostly inhabited the peripheral areas of Greater Amazonia and the eastern sections of the main Amazon River and its larger tributaries during the precultivation period. Human populations began growing exponentially through the early cultivation period, and people spread and expanded into the interior forests and along river channels in western Amazonia. Populations continued growing through the late cultivation period in these same regions. Our results suggest that many forests, particularly in the peripheral regions and riverine locations, may still be in recovery from disturbances that have occurred repeatedly through the Holocene.

AB In a fragmented landscape, transitional zones between neighboring habitats are common, and our understanding of community organizational forces across such habitats is important. Edge studies are numerous, but the majority of them utilize information on species richness and abundance. Abundance and taxonomic diversity, however, provide little information on the functioning and phylogeny of the co-existing species. Combining the evaluation of their functional and phylogenetic relationships, we aimed to assess whether ground beetle assemblages are deterministically or stochastically structured along grassland-forest gradients. Our results showed different community assembly rules on opposite sides of the forest edge. In the grassland, co-occurring species were functionally and phylogenetically not different from the random null model, indicating a random assembly process. Contrary to this, at the forest edge and the interior, co-occurring species showed functional and phylogenetic clustering, thus environmental filtering was the likely process structuring carabid assemblages. Community assembly in the grassland was considerably affected by asymmetrical species flows (spillover) across the forest edge: more forest species penetrated into the grassland than open-habitat and generalist species entered into the forest. This asymmetrical species flow underlines the importance of the filter function of forest edges. As unfavorable, human-induced changes to the structure, composition and characteristics of forest edges may alter their filter function, edges have to be specifically considered during conservation management.

AB Despite calls for greater use of randomized control trials (RCTs) to evaluate the impact of conservation interventions; such experimental evaluations remain extremely rare. Payments for environmental services (PES) are widely used to slow tropical deforestation but there is widespread recognition of the need for better evidence of effectiveness. A Bolivian nongovernmental organization took the unusual step of randomizing the communities where its conservation incentive program (Watershared) was offered. We explore the impact of the program on deforestation over 5 years by applying generalized additive models to Global Forest Change (GFC) data. The "intention-to-treat" model (where units are analyzed as randomized regardless of whether the intervention was delivered as planned) shows no effect; deforestation did not differ between the control and treatment communities. However, uptake of the intervention varied across communities so we also explored whether higher uptake might reduce deforestation. We found evidence of a small effect at high uptake but the result should be treated with caution. RCTs will not always be appropriate for evaluating conservation interventions due to ethical and practical considerations. Despite these challenges, randomization can improve causal inference and deserves more attention from those interested in improving the evidence base for conservation.

AB Forest gaps can change stand structure and affect forest regeneration dynamics. The gap partitioning hypothesis claims that tree species would regenerate along gap environmental gradients owing to their different resource demands. However, many studies that examined this hypothesis in uncontrolled gap conditions have yielded inconsistent conclusions and there are limited studies testing the hypothesis taking into account biomass allocation. In this study, we examined the gap partitioning hypothesis in a temperate secondary forest ecosystem where gap formation drives forest regeneration. We created gaps with different sizes and planted two commercially important native tree species with contrasting shade tolerance in nine positions along four cardinal directions within the gaps. We found that shade tolerance was the main factor affecting seedling regeneration performance within gaps. For the light-demanding Manchurian walnut (Juglans mandshurica Maxim.), seedling growth varied significantly along the light intensity gradients, which indicated that seedlings could greatly benefit from high light areas within gaps, especially when the gap size increased. Seedling biomass in gap centers and transitions (54.0 g) were much higher than in gap edges (13.7 g) and forest understories (8.6 g). High light environments contributed to higher biomass allocation to the leaves and accelerated carbon assimilation. Low light conditions resulted in increasing proportions of stem biomass, which might promote seedling height growth, although the promotion effects were relatively limited. However, for the shade-tolerant Korean spruce (Picea koraiensis Nakai), little evidence of seedling divergence was found within gaps. Mostly, seedlings only showed growth and biomass allocation differences between gaps and forest understories. Korean spruce showed high adaptability to various gap environments and might be a generalist species rather than being limited to small gaps. The performance of Manchurian walnut strongly supported the gap partitioning hypothesis, but Korean spruce provided little evidence for gap partitioning. Therefore, planting scenarios in silvicultural practices could be suitably designed, with Manchurian walnut in high light gap areas and Korean spruce in most positions within gaps, during the early stage after competition elimination.

AB Global climate change has been reported to affect tree growth around the world and such impacts are predicted to be intensified under future climate change particularly in the tropics. It is therefore important to study the climate-growth relationships of tropical trees to understand how they have responded to the past climate variability and to predict how they will respond to future climatic changes. We investigated tree radial growth responses to regional climatic changes in Bangladeshi moist tropical forests. We selected three species based on their distinct growth-ring boundaries and their wide distribution around the tropics. First, we simulated growth responses to climate for the past 66 years (1950-2015) based on the climate-growth relationships. Next, we projected tree-growth until the end of current century (2016-2100) under different climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways, RCP). All the three species produced statistically robust ring-width index chronologies covering the current and the past century. Climate-growth analysis revealed that temperature (monthly, annual and seasonal) significantly negatively affected tree radial growth in all three species. Precipitation prior to the current growing season negatively and current year post monsoon precipitation positively influenced radial growth. Tree radial growth was also influenced by Nino 3.4 region Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies mainly through the modulation of local climate. We projected tree radial growth to be declined in all three species by 20% under high concentration scenario (RCP 8.5) followed by 11.3% and 9% under medium (RCP 6.0) and low-medium concentration scenarios (RCP 4.5). If these species show similar growth responses to climatic changes in other native ranges across the tropics, this could have severe consequences for the carbon balance of tropical forests.

AB The presence and distribution of green vegetation cover in the biosphere are of paramount importance in investigating cause-effect phenomena at the land/atmosphere interface, estimating primary production rates as part of global carbon and water cycle assessments and evaluating soil protection and land use change over time. The fraction of green vegetation cover (FCover) as estimated from satellite observations has already been demonstrated to be an extraordinarily useful product for understanding vegetation cover changes, for supporting ecosystem service assessments over areas with variable extents and for processes spanning a variable period of time (abrupt events or long-term processes). This study describes a methodology implemented to estimate global FCover (from 2001 to 2015) by applying a linear spectral mixture analysis with global endmembers to an entire temporal series of MODIS satellite observations and gap-filling missing FCover observations in temporal series using the DINEOF algorithm. The resulting global MODV1 FCover product was validated with two global validation datasets and showed an overall good thematic absolute accuracy (RMSE = 0.146) consistent with the validation performance of other FCover global products. Basic statistics performed on the product show changes in average and trend values and allow for the quantification of gross vegetation loss and gain over different temporal scales. To demonstrate the capacity of this global product to monitor specific dynamics, a multitemporal analysis was performed on selected sites and vegetation responses (i.e., cover changes), and specific dynamics resulting from cause-effect phenomena are briefly discussed. The product is intended to be used for monitoring vegetation dynamics, but it also has the potential to be integrated in other modeling frameworks (e.g., the carbon cycle, primary production, and soil erosion) in conjunction with other spatial datasets such as those on climate and soil type.

AB Over the last 20 years, Uganda has emerged as a testing ground for the various modes of carbon forestry used in Africa. Carbon forestry initiatives in Uganda raise questions of justice, given that people with comparatively negligible carbon footprints are affected by land use changes initiated by the desire of wealthy people, firms, and countries to reduce their more extensive carbon footprints. This paper examines the notions of justice local people express in relation to two contrasting carbon forestry projects in Uganda, the Mount Elgon Uganda Wildlife Authority- Forests Absorbing Carbon Emissions (UWA-FACE) project and Trees for Global Benefit (TFGB). UWA-FACE closed down its initial operations at Mount Elgon after 10 years as a result of deep controversies and negative international publicity, whereas TFGB is regarded by many as an exemplary design for smallholder carbon forestry in Africa. Our approach builds upon an emerging strand in the literature, of empirical analyses of local people's notions of justice related to environmental interventions. The main contribution of the paper is to examine how people's notions of justice have influenced divergent project outcomes in these cases. In particular, we highlight the relative success of TFGB in the way it meets people's primarily distributional concerns, apparently without significantly challenging prevalent expectations of recognition or procedural justice. In contrast, we illuminate how controversy across the range of justice dimensions in UWA-FACE at Mount Elgon ultimately led to the project's decline. This paper therefore explores how attention to notions of justice can contribute to a fuller understanding of the reactions of people to carbon forestry projects, as well as the pathways and ultimate outcomes of such interventions.

AB Interspecific competition can strongly influence community structure and limit the distribution and abundance of species. One of the main factors that determine hummingbird community structure is competition for food. The temporal and spatial distribution of nectar has a strong impact on hummingbird assemblages, shaping foraging niches according to hummingbird dominance and foraging strategy. We investigated whether body size and the degree of aggressive dominance influence feeding behaviour of hummingbirds in a temperate forest in northwestern Mexico (El Palmito, Mexico) when winter migrant hummingbirds are present in the community. First, we determined the dominance status of hummingbirds and evaluated the relationship between dominance and body mass, wing disc loading and migratory status. Secondly, we determined how hummingbird species used plant species differently. Thirdly, we examined whether the most dominant hummingbird species defended floral patches with more energy and/or with a larger number of flowers. At each flower patch, hummingbird species, number of hummingbird interactions, feeding time and number of flowers present were recorded. The total number of calories available within each floral patch was also determined. Our results demonstrate that the dominance hierarchy of 13 hummingbird species (migratory and resident) was correlated with body size but not wing disc loading, and that members of the hummingbird community showed a clear separation in resource use (by plant species). Hummingbirds at the top of the dominance hierarchy defended and fed on the best flower patches, defined by the quantity of calories available. Hence, the feeding behaviour of hummingbirds at El Palmito depends on the abundance of plant species used by hummingbirds and on the amount of energy available from each flower patch. Thus, hummingbird body size, aggressive dominance and defence of quality flower patches determines niche partitioning among species.

AB Hummingbirds are important pollinators of many native Neotropical plants but their abundance and diversity in landscapes dominated by intensive human uses such as agriculture have rarely been examined, despite such land-uses prevailing in the tropics. We examined how tropical deforestation affects hummingbird community structure in premontane forest patches embedded in a tropical countryside of Coto Brus Canton, Costa Rica. We captured hummingbirds in fourteen landscapes representing a gradient in patch size and forest amount, and tested for the effects of these variables on (1) hummingbird captures at flowers (pollinator availability); (2) species richness; and (3) filtering of functional traits. After accounting for sampling effects, both hummingbird availability and species richness declined by 40% and 50%, respectively, across the gradient in deforestation that we observed (9-66% forest within 1000m). Focal patch size was the strongest predictor, even after statistically accounting for the amount of forest and matrix composition of landscapes. These reductions in availability and richness were well predicted by functional traits; morphologically specialized species with the capacity to transport long-distance outcrossed pollen and low functional redundancy within the pollinator network showed the greatest sensitivity to landscape change. We hypothesize that declines in hummingbird availability, diversity, and functional traits are important mechanisms driving the observed pollen limitation of ornithophilous flowers in fragmented tropical landscapes. Efforts to conserve large forest patches and enhance matrix permeability are critical for maintaining forest hummingbird communities and pollination services under current and predicted deforestation regimes.

AB Forest conversion in the tropics is increasingly driven by global demand for agricultural forest-risk commodities such as soy, beef, palm oil and timber. In order to be effective, future forest conservation policies should include measures targeting both producers (the supply side) and consumers (the demand side) to address commodity driven deforestation. Whereas the UN Conventions on Biodiversity (CBD) and Climate Change (UNFCCC) do not make reference to this driving factor, here we explore whether and how recent national strategies by member states to the Conventions acknowledge the role of agricultural commodities in tropical deforestation. A text analysis of 139 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to climate change mitigation and 132 National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) shows that the general trade-off between national development aspirations and forest conservation is commonly acknowledged. However, only few strategies link deforestation to commodity production and consumption, whereas most documents do not mention this topic. This lack of reference to a key driver of tropical deforestation limits the prospects of safeguarding tropical forests for biodiversity and climate change mitigation purposes as part of the two UN Conventions, and might jeopardise their overall effectiveness.
   These findings were complemented by a content analysis of INDCs, NBSAPs and REDD + documents from eight case countries affected by commodity-driven deforestation. We investigated whether this driver is acknowledged in the national strategies, and which policy measures are suggested to address forest loss from agricultural commodities. We found that six case countries mention agricultural commodities as deforestation driver in their REDD + documents, whereas the biodiversity and climate change strategies were silent on the topic. Policy measures targeting commodity production were suggested in four REDD + strategies, ranging from incentive payments, sustainable agricultural practices and land-use planning to demand-side approaches such as certification and the promotion of sustainable lifestyles.
   One conclusion from this exercise is that UN member states seem not to consider climate and biodiversity national plans the adequate forum to discuss detailed forest conservation approaches. We argue that in order to increase effectiveness, strategies under the UN Conventions should take commodity-driven deforestation into account, through measures that address both the producer and the consumer side.

AB Developing nature-based tourism in private lands calls for new mechanisms to consolidate the interests of the tourism industry, visitors, and landowners. This choice experiment study elaborates on the heterogeneity of visitors' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for enhanced forest amenities and ecosystem services. The survey, targeting domestic and foreign tourists visiting the Ruka-Kuusamo area in Finland, considered four attributes: landscape quality, outdoor routes, forest biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. For observed heterogeneity, the visitors were grouped by their attitudes towards forest management. Unobserved heterogeneity in visitors' choice behaviour and WTP was examined with the latent class model. While most visitors had environmentally friendly attitudes and were willing to pay, especially for enhanced landscape quality and biodiversity, considerable heterogeneity was revealed in terms of three segments with distinctive attitudes, choice behaviour and WTP. The variation in WTP has important implications for the design of a scheme of payments for environmental management.

AB Over 80% of Atlantic Forest remnants are <50ha and protected areas are embedded in a matrix dominated by human activities, undermining the long-term persistence of carnivores. The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) is an opportunistic species, but little is known about its tolerance to habitat alterations and the influence of other species on its occupancy in Atlantic Forest remnants. We used camera traps to assess ocelot occupancy in protected areas of Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. We found a positive correlation between the occupancy of ocelots and top predators (jaguars, Panthera onca, and pumas, Puma concolor), and a weaker negative effect between the number of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) detected and ocelot occupancy. Ocelot detection was higher at sites with more eucalyptus, suggesting that ocelots frequently use these areas. Better-protected areas surrounded by permeable matrices may be critical to the persistence of ocelots in the fragmented Atlantic Forest.

AB Thermal performance curves (TPCs) represent an increasingly popular tool in ecology for anticipating species responses to climate change. TPC theory has been developed using species that experience similar temperatures during activity and at rest and consequently exhibit thermal ranges for activity that closely coincide with their physiological thermal tolerances. Many species, however, experience other stressors, such as desiccation, that limit active behaviour at temperatures below the maximum values experienced. As a result, activity is constrained to a narrow thermal window that is a subset of the range of temperatures that can be tolerated physiologically. This results in a decoupling of behavioural and physiological TPCs that does not conform to the present paradigm. To test the generality of TPC theory, we measured thermal responses for behaviour (crawling speed) and physiological tolerance (heart rate) for six rocky shore gastropods spanning a thermal/desiccation stress gradient. We hypothesized a positive relationship between shore level and the degree of decoupling of behavioural and physiological TPCs. This prediction was confirmed, and was explained by the extension of the physiological TPC beyond the range of the behavioural TPC. Decoupling of behavioural and physiological TPCs is central to predicting accurately the fitness dynamics of ectothermic species subject to multiple stressors. We believe that this decoupling should be explicitly considered as an adaptive trait defining an organism's thermal niche.

AB The uneven representation of frugivorous mammals and birds across tropical regions-high in the New World, low in Madagascar and intermediate in Africa and Asia-represents a long-standing enigma in ecology. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these differences but the ultimate drivers remain unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that fruits in Madagascar contain insufficient nitrogen to meet primate metabolic requirements, thus constraining the evolution of frugivory. We performed a global analysis of nitrogen in fruits consumed by primates, as collated from 79 studies. Our results showed that average frugivory among lemur communities was lower compared to New World and Asian-African primate communities. Fruits in Madagascar contain lower average nitrogen than those in the New World and Old World. Nitrogen content in the overall diets of primate species did not differ

AB The degree to which terrestrial vertebrate populations are depleted in tropical forests occupied by human communities has been the subject of an intense polarising debate that has important conservation implications. Conservation ecologists and practitioners are divided over the extent to which community-based subsistence offtake is compatible with ecologically functional populations of tropical forest game species. To quantify depletion envelopes of forest vertebrates around human communities, we deployed a total of 383 camera trap stations and 78 quantitative interviews to survey the peri-community areas controlled by 60 semi-subsistence communities over a combined area of over 3.2 million hectares in the Medio Jurua and Uatuma regions of Central-Western Brazilian Amazonia. Our results largely conform with prior evidence that hunting large-bodied vertebrates reduces wildlife populations near settlements, such that they are only found at a distance to settlements where they are hunted less frequently. Camera trap data suggest that a select few harvest-sensitive species, including lowland tapir, are either repelled or depleted by human communities. Nocturnal and cathemeral species were detected relatively more frequently in disturbed areas close to communities, but individual species did not necessarily shift their activity patterns. Group biomass of all species was depressed in the wider neighbourhood of urban areas rather than communities. Interview data suggest that species traits, especially group size and body mass, mediate these relationships. Large-bodied, large-group-living species are detected farther from communities as reported by experienced informants. Long-established communities in our study regions have not "emptied" the surrounding forest. Low human population density and low hunting offtake due to abundant sources of alternative aquatic protein, suggest that these communities represent a best-case scenario for sustainable hunting of wildlife for food, thereby providing a conservative assessment of game depletion. Given this 'best-case' camera trap and interview-based evidence for hunting depletion, regions with higher human population densities, external trade in wildlife and limited access to alternative protein will likely exhibit more severe depletion.

AB The spatial distribution of species is affected by dispersal barriers, local environmental conditions and climate. However, the effect of species dispersal and their adaptation to the environment across geographic scales is poorly understood. To investigate the distribution of species from local to broad geographic scales, we sampled termites in 198 transects distributed in 13 sampling grids in the Brazilian Amazonian forest. The sampling grids encompassed an area of 271 500 km(2) and included the five major biogeographic regions delimited by Amazonian rivers. Environmental data for each transect were obtained from local measurements and remote sensing. Similar to previous studies, termite species composition at the local scale was mostly associated with measures of soil texture and chemistry. In contrast, termite species composition at broad geographic scales was associated with soil nutrients, and the geographic position of the transects. Between 17 and 30% of the variance in termite species composition could be attributed exclusively to the geographic position of the transects, but could not be attributed to measured environmental variables or the presence of major rivers. Isolation by distance may have strong effects on termite species composition due to historic processes and the spatially structured environments along distinct geological formations of Amazonia. However, in contrast to many taxa in Amazonia, there is no evidence that major rivers are important barriers to termite dispersal.

AB There is increasing recognition that community assembly theory can offer valuable insights for ecological restoration. We studied community assembly processes following tropical forest restoration efforts, using dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) as a focal taxon to investigate taxonomic and functional patterns of biodiversity recovery. We evaluated the relative importance of the local environment (i.e., canopy cover, understory cover, tree basal area, and soil texture), landscape context (i.e., habitat patch proximity and availability and percentage of surrounding area classified as natural forest or Eucalyptus spp. plantation), and space (i.e., spatial proximity of the study areas to estimate dispersal limitation or unmeasured spatially structured processes) on dung beetle species and functional trait composition across a gradient of 15 restoration sites in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We also assessed which factors were the primary determinants in the establishment of individual dung beetle functional groups, classified according to size, food relocation habit, diet, and period of flight activity. Both species and functional trait composition were most strongly influenced by the local environment, indicating that assembly was predominantly driven by niche-based processes. Most of the variation explained by space was co-explained by local environment and landscape context, ruling out a strong influence of dispersal limitation and random colonization on assembly following restoration. In addition, nearly all of the variance explained by landscape context was co-explained by local environment, suggesting that arrival and establishment at a site depends on both local and landscape-scale environmental factors. Despite strong evidence for niche-based assembly, a large amount of variation remained unexplained in all models, suggesting that stochastic processes and/or unmeasured environmental variables also play an important role. The relative importance of local environment, landscape context, and space changed considerably when analyzing the assembly mechanisms of each functional group separately. Therefore, to recover distinct functional traits in restoration sites, it may be necessary to manipulate different components of the local environment and surrounding landscape. Overall, this study shows that assembly rules can help to better understand recovery processes, enabling improvement of future restoration efforts.

AB One of the most characteristic and abundant amphibian taxa of South American temperate forests is Eupsophus. The ten currently recognized species of the genus have been divided in two species groups, roseus and vertebralis, but most of them, eight, belong to the roseus group. Recent phylogeographic and phylogenetic studies have suggested that species diversity of the roseus group could be underestimated. An examination of the literature shows that species of the roseus group exhibit high levels of variation in their external characteristics, particularly those used as diagnostic characters, which compromises their taxonomy and hinders their field recognition. High levels of variation were also observed in several new populations of the roseus group discovered in southern Chile (36 degrees - 40 degrees S), which could not be identified to the species level by their external characteristics. On the other hand, the literature reveals a scarse karyotype differentiation and a high bioacoustic uniformity among the species of the roseus group. We performed a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear genes to reevaluate the species diversity of the roseus group, including all the nominal species of Eupsophus and new populations. This analysis was complemented with three species delimitation approaches, General Mixed Yule Coalescent, multi-rate Poisson Tree Process and Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery. We favored a conservative delimitation of only four species for the roseus group, a result more consistent with the distribution of pairwise genetic distances, and the available chromosome and bioacoustic evidence. The four recognized lineages, which have nearly completely allopatric distributions, are named after the earliest nominal species that they include, but because high levels of phenotypic variation, they are not diagnosable by consistent differences in external morphology. We discuss the implications of this new proposal for the taxonomy and conservation of the genus, and the possible causes of the difficulty to estimate its species diversity.

TI Development paradigms contributing to the transformation of the
   Brazilian Amazon: do people matter?
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
LA English
DT Review
ID DEFORESTATION; TRANSITION
AB The Brazilian Amazon is being affected by the new worldwide geopolitical transformation that is tending towards an integrated global economy. In the region environmental considerations have not been adequately incorporated into long-term land use planning and this failure has partly been due to the complexities of the country's existing inter-sectorial institutional arrangements. In this paper, we briefly explore two distinct economic development phases that have been reshaping Amazonian landscapes since the 1990s. We first focus on the role of traditional populations in conservation and land use planning (socio-environmental model). We contrast this with the 'post-environmental' development model that currently dominates the land use dynamics of Amazonia and which is in stark contrasts with previous advances in environmental protection, whose basis was sustainable use of resources and social participation. The future of the socio-environmental model appears uncertain and its recovery and long-term maintenance to underpin sustainable development will depend on the strengthening the participation of the civil societal sectors that are able to reestablish balance to the sustainability agenda in the region.

AB Brazil confirmed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 2008, including an 80% reduction in deforestation in the Amazon by 2020. With this in mind, we investigated the trade-off between environmental conservation and economic growth in the Amazon. The aim of this study is to project the economic losses and land-use changes resulting from a policy to control deforestation and the rise in land productivity that is necessary to offset those losses. We developed a Dynamic Interregional Computable General Equilibrium Model for 30 Amazon regions with a land module allowing conversion between types of land. The results have shown that the most affected regions would be soybeans and cattle producers as well as regions dominated by family farms. To offset these impacts, it was estimated that an annual gain of land productivity of approximately 1.4% would be required. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Can terrestrial laser scanners (TLSs) and hemispherical photographs
   predict tropical dry forest succession with liana abundance?

AB Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are ecosystems with long drought periods, a mean temperature of 25 degrees C, a mean annual precipitation that ranges from 900 to 2000 mm, and that possess a high abundance of deciduous species (trees and lianas). What remains of the original extent of TDFs in the Americas remains highly fragmented and at different levels of ecological succession. It is estimated that one of the main fingerprints left by global environmental and climate change in tropical environments is an increase in liana coverage. Lianas are non-structural elements of the forest canopy that eventually kill their host trees. In this paper we evaluate the use of a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) in combination with hemispherical photographs (HPs) to characterize changes in forest structure as a function of ecological succession and liana abundance. We deployed a TLS and HP system in 28 plots throughout secondary forests of different ages and with different levels of liana abundance. Using a canonical correlation analysis (CCA), we addressed how the VEGNET, a terrestrial laser scanner, and HPs could predict TDF structure. Likewise, using univariate analyses of correlations, we show how the liana abundance could affect the prediction of the forest structure. Our results suggest that TLSs and HPs can predict the differences in the forest structure at different successional stages but that these differences disappear as liana abundance increases. Therefore, in well known ecosystems such as the tropical dry forest of Costa Rica, these biases of prediction could be considered as structural effects of liana presence. This research contributes to the understanding of the potential effects of lianas in secondary dry forests and highlights the role of TLSs combined with HPs in monitoring structural changes in secondary TDFs.

AB Background: The combined analysis of species ranges allows the detection of overall species richness patterns. As such, the reliability of richness maps is directly related to the accuracy of individual range estimates.Aims: We compared how species ranges and richness patterns are influenced according to the use of different methods (convex hull and alpha hull) and evaluated if differences in range estimates are related to the Wallacean shortfall.Methods: We used occurrence records of 386 species from the tribe Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae) to build richness maps by stacking species ranges, using the convex hull and alpha hull methods. We evaluated the behaviour of the richness estimates in relation to other variables (i.e., other richness measures, environmental and spatial variables). We correlated the differences in range estimates to proxies of Wallacean shortfall (i.e., species description date and variation of pseudo-ranges generated by jack-knife).Results: Convex hull estimated larger ranges than alpha hull. The Wallacean shortfall affected range estimates equally regardless of the hull method used. Both hull methods generated similar richness maps. Richness estimates showed similar correlation patterns in relation to other variables regardless of the hull method used.Conclusions: Despite the slight differences in range estimates, both hull methods can be used in equivalence to map species richness.

AB How climate change interacts upon human activities necessary for meeting the needs of a society is important to understand. Mining is such an activity, as it provides the fundamental raw materials required in everyday life. However, mining is potentially extremely vulnerable to climate change. This is because of the exacerbation of interactions already occurring to the local environment-human system, as well as the development of new interactions and their subsequent impacts. Within the literature, there has been no generic review or synthesis of the fundamental interactions between climate change and surface mining. This paper intends to undertake such a review and synthesis of the literature. The paper discusses the potential and actual interactions between climate change and surface mining in relation to five core themes: Heavy Metals; Hydrological Processes & Resources; Ecological Impacts; Air Pollution; and Mass Movement. This is based upon an extensive and focussed review of the current and available literature. The paper then concludes with a discussion of open themes and future research concerning climate change and surface mining in relation to three fundamental spatial dynamic questions.

AB The mixed-broadleaved Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc.) forest (MBKPF) is a zonal climax ranging from Northeast China to the Far East region of Russia. However, since the 1950s, most of the MBKPFs in Northeast China have become the mixed broadleaved secondary forests due to the heavy forest exploitation by timber harvesting. The natural regeneration of Korean pine is generally poor because of the light limitation in Northeast China. This study was conducted to understand how Korean pine seedlings adapt to different canopy openness (CO) and what would be the minimum CO for its establishment and growth in the natural forest stands. In order to test the hypothesis that Korean pine seedlings have acclimated to low light regimes, the responses of photosynthetic, morphological and growth parameters to light environments were examined in Korean pine seedlings that were field-grown in secondary forests. The results can provide the references for the restoration of MBKPFs in Northeast China. Three-year-old Korean pine seedlings were under-planted in secondary forest stands with three levels of CO at 30%, 15% and 7%, which were created by modifying the branches of the secondary forest stands. After one year of acclimation under the secondary forest stands, the variations in the physiological and morphological characteristics of the needles as well as the growth parameters were measured. The maximum net photosynthesis (A(max)), dark respiration (R-d), needle chlorophyll (Chl) contents and total needle nitrogen (N) contents all responded positively to the increased CO. The total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC), A(max),R-d, and N contents in the 7% stand were significantly lower than those in the 15% and 30% stands (p < 0.05). The capture efficiency of excitation energy by open Photosystem II (PSII) reaction centres (F-v'/F-m') in the 7% stand was the lowest and was significantly different from those in the 15% and 30% stands (p < 0.05), although no significant differences were found between 15% and 30% CO (p > 0.05). These results indicated that 7% CO seedlings were experiencing some degree of low light stress. The leaf mass area (LMA) and height growth decreased as the CO decreased from 30% to 15% to 7%, while the lateral shoot growth increased. Therefore, needle morphology, tree height and crown growth of Korean pine seedlings displayed a large plasticity in response to variations in light intensities. These findings suggest that Korean pine seedlings can strongly acclimate in the forest canopy by adjusting physiological traits that are associated with light energy distribution in the PSII and by adjusting the morphological features of their needles. These results suggest that the minimum canopy openness required for the survival of P. koraiensis seedlings (4 years old) grown under a canopy should be more than 7%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Spatially explicit planning is required to set focused conservation priorities and assessing future ecological implications. Spatial ecological modeling and hotspot analysis prioritizes the forest ecosystems and supports the conservation of species level biodiversity. In the present study, the hotspots of deforestation and forest fires were obtained using historical deforestation trends (1975-1985-1995-2005-2014) and fire history (2009-2014) in Andhra Pradesh, India. The priority areas were identified as deforestation and degradation hotspots using combined measures of threat from deforestation, fire hotspots and current level of forest fragmentation. The state of Andhra Pradesh represents an area of 25985 km(2) (16.2% of total geographical area) under forest cover in 2014. The net deforested area was estimated as 2390 km(2) (8.4%) from 1975 to 2014. We have calculated the region of influence in percentages and found deforestation hotspots covering an average of 40.2% forest, followed by 35.9% under high fragmentation and 19.2% under fire hotspots. Ecosystem level analysis has been carried out for all the forest types i.e., semi evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, dry evergreen, thorn and mangroves, indicating ecosystem vulnerability. According to the results of prioritization, about 10.5% of existing forest had severe ecosystem collapse and categorized as deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Analysis of protected areas shows Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Sri Peninsula Narasimha sanctuary, Papikonda sanctuary and Sri Venkateshwara sanctuary are representing deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Deforestation and degradation hotspots identified in the study is an excellent surrogate for understanding anthropogenic disturbances and can be effectively useful in forest management to proceed for applicable restoration measures.

AB Heteroblasty, the temporal development of the meristem, can produce diverse leaf shapes within a plant. Gevuina avellana, a tree from the South American temperate rainforest shows strong heteroblasty affecting leaf shape, transitioning from juvenile simple leaves to highly pinnate adult leaves. Light availability within the forest canopy also modulates its leaf size and complexity. Here we studied how the interaction between the light environment and the heteroblastic progression of leaves is coordinated in this species. We used RNA-seq on the Illumina platform to compare the range of transcriptional responses in leaf primordia of G.avellana at different heteroblastic stages and growing under different light environments. We found a steady up-regulation of SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE (SPL), NAC, YUCCA and AGAMOUS-LIKE genes associated with increases in age, leaf complexity, and light availability. In contrast, expression of TCP, TPR and KNOTTED1 homeobox genes showed a sustained down-regulation. Additionally, genes involved in auxin synthesis/transport and jasmonate activity were differentially expressed, indicating an active regulation of processes controlled by these hormones. Our large-scale transcriptional analysis of the leaf primordia of G.avellana sheds light on the integration of internal and external cues during heteroblastic development in this species.

AB An analysis of data on property size and type as well as land use reveals the distribution of deforestation, remaining forest cover and carbon stocks in Mato Grosso, Brazil's third largest state. Nearly two-thirds of remaining forests and carbon reserves, equating to between 2 and 3 Pg of carbon, are located on private properties. Around 80% of forests and carbon reserves are on properties larger than 1,000 ha, with smallholder farms and public land reform settlements controlling only a tiny fraction of the state's remaining forest and carbon reserves. Efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation must target owners controlling most of the remaining forest and land types with the highest deforestation rates. We thus suggest that policymakers seeking to protect the remaining forest should focus both incentives and enforcement of anti-deforestation laws in the larger properties where most of these forests are located.

AB Patterns in rainfall and soil water availability are considered to be the main drivers governing arid and semiarid ecosystems. While the mechanisms by which water limits aboveground net primary production has been widely explored, few long-term studies have examined interactions between precipitation, soil resources, plant communities, and soil microbial communities; these may be critical to understanding soil biogeochemical cycles and above- and belowground interactions. We capitalized on a long-term biotic manipulation (exclusion of small mammal herbivores from replicate plots) and long-term variation in rainfall to assess how precipitation, small mammals, and shrub cover act directly and interactively to influence the spatial and temporal distribution of soil microorganisms, a key first step to understanding soil biogeochemical cycles. We measured the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), soil fungi, soil bacteria, and soil physicochemical characteristics over 10 consecutive years in a semiarid thorn scrub community in north central Chile; we sampled two microhabitats (under shrub cover, and in open spaces between shrubs colonized by ephemeral plants), and in plots with or without the presence of native small mammals, the main herbivores in this environment. Annual rainfall ranged widely (11 356 mm) in this period and was the primary factor affecting abundance of AM root colonization and soil microbes. While the percentage of root length with AM was higher in dry compared to wet years, free-living soil bacteria and fungi were more abundant during wet years. All microorganisms were more abundant in the resource islands beneath the shrubs compared to open microhabitat between shrubs, although the relation between soil biota and the concentration of some particular nutrients was negative. These patterns were modulated by the presence of small mammals, which enhanced root colonization by AM fungi, particularly for ephemeral plants, but which were negatively associated with soil fungi abundance. The abundance of soil bacteria showed a more complex response to the presence of small mammals and was dependent on microhabitat and year. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil resources and the activity of small mammals are important modulators of subterranean biotic responses to rainfall, the primary factor affecting soil microbiota abundance in this semiarid ecosystem.

AB 1. Climate change and deforestation are suggested to be the main drivers of decline in pollinators. Forest-dependent species are expected to be the most affected and Euglossa marianae Nemesio (Hymenoptera: Apidae), an endemic species of the highly fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF), is believed to be declining as a consequence of human impact.
   2. Over the last 17 years, we carried out field surveys to unveil its distribution, allowing us to investigate the potential effects of global climate change on this species, from the last glacial maximum into the future, using species distribution models. Our main goals were to: (i) identify populations potentially under risk of extinction given future climate change; (ii) quantify the amount of climatically suitable and climatically stable areas for E. marianae within AF; (iii) evaluate the area that are available as natural habitat and under legal protection, in an attempt to indicate priority areas to preserve this species.
   3. The most stable areas for maintaining populations of E. marianae were located in southern Bahia and northern Espirito Santo states, a region severely affected by deforestation and with several protected areas. Climate change per se does not seem to be the major problem for E. marianae. It may constitute an indirect problem given the limited dispersal abilities of this species, however.
   4. Climatically suitable areas will probably increase southwards in the future, but the extreme fragmentation of AF adds great uncertainty as to whether the species will disperse southwards, to regions such as the 'Serra do Mar' in northeastern Sao Paulo.

AB Sex-biased dispersal and multiple mating may prevent or alleviate inbreeding and its outcome, inbreeding depression, but studies demonstrating this in the wild are scarce. Perennial ant colonies offer a unique system to investigate the relationships between natal dispersal behavior and inbreeding. Due to the sedentary life of ant colonies and lifetime sperm storage by queens, measures of dispersal distance and mating strategy are easier to obtain than in most taxa. We used a suite of molecular markers to infer the natal colonies of queens and males in a wild population of the ant Formica exsecta. Dispersal was male biased, with median male dispersal distances (approximate to 140 m) twice those of queens (approximate to 60 m). The results also showed that the population was inbred and that inbreeding avoidance behaviorssex-biased dispersal, queen dispersal distance, and multiple matingwere all ineffective in reducing homozygosity among colony workers. Queen homozygosity did not affect dispersal behavior, but more homozygous queens had lower colony-founding success and were more incestuously mated themselves, with potentially accumulating effects on colony fitness. We also provide independent evidence that dispersal is sex biased and show that our estimate corresponds well with dispersal estimates derived from population-genetic estimates.

AB The evolution of self-pollination has long been considered an adaptive strategy to cope with low or variable pollinator service; however, alternative reproductive strategies, such as generalized pollination (>1 pollinator functional group), may also ensure plant reproductive success in environments with inadequate pollinator visitation. Island-mainland systems provide ideal settings to assess the interaction between pollination and breeding systems in response to pollinator visitation because islands are often pollinator-depauperate. This study compared 28 insular and 26 mainland species of Caribbean Gesneriaceae to test the hypothesis that low diversity and possibly low pollinator service on islands would lead to a greater frequency of generalized plant-pollinator interactions and/or a higher potential for autonomous self-pollination in insular than in mainland species. We also assessed the hypothesis that epiphytic species should have greater autofertility than species occurring in other habitats. Pollinator observations conducted in the field from 2004 to 2014 revealed bat, bee, butterfly, hummingbird, moth, and generalized pollination systems. Functional specialization in pollination systems was high in insular (71% of the species) and mainland sites (all species), but generalized and bat-pollinated species were more common on islands. Overall, pollinator visitation rates did not differ between island and mainland; however, for hummingbird-pollinated species, visitation rate was on average three times higher in mainland than island species. Autofertility indices (fruit set of bagged/outcross flowers) ranged from 0 to 1 and did not differ between island and mainland species. Species growing on rocks (rupiculous) and trees (epiphytic) had on average higher autofertility than terrestrial species.Synthesis. This study revealed that alternative reproductive strategies are used in pollinator-depauperate environments. Pollinator visitation is lower in insular hummingbird-pollinated species (the ancestral pollination system of insular Gesneriaceae); therefore, generalized pollination may be considered a reproductive assurance mechanism evolved primarily on island environments. Contrary to the long-standing tenet, however, autonomous self-pollination was similar in island and mainland Gesneriaceae suggesting that: (i) generalized pollination provides a viable alternative to selfing in pollinator-depauperate environments, (ii) autofertility as a reproductive assurance mechanism may be frequent in plant species from mainland regions in environments with unpredictable pollinator visitation and resource availability.

AB Tropical forest fragmentation influences community composition via differential species-level effects. Avian responses to fragmentation at La Selva Biological Station are, in part, responsible for the particular concern over the fate of understory insectivorous species. However, since the 1990s, much previously deforested land within and surrounding La Selva has reverted to forest, providing an opportunity to test hypotheses explaining ongoing avifaunal change. Analyses of 23 years (1989-2011) of Christmas Bird Counts reveal that 63 of 202 species have increased whereas 44 are declining, with declines occurring more rapidly than increases. Habitat association was an important predictor of population trends, as understory birds continue to decline whereas forest generalists increased. Our results differ from previous work in the tropics by revealing that, at La Selva, insectivores are not currently suffering greater declines than birds of other dietary guilds. Instead, body size was more strongly associated with population change than was diet, with smaller birds having more negative population trends than larger birds. These results suggest that we must consider additional hypotheses that may explain ongoing population declines of tropical birds. In particular, the associations between population trends and body size implicate physiological mechanisms influencing population change, which may result from direct or indirect consequences of changing climates.

AB In French Guiana, the leaf and cambium phenologies should not be considered only as exogenous-driven processes, as the dry season, but also as endogenous-driven, as tree development stage.
   Studies of the periodicity of wood formation provide essential data on tree age and on factors that control tree growth. The aim of this work was to investigate cambial phenology and its relation with leaf phenology and climatic seasonality in two briefly deciduous tropical rainforest species belonging to the genus Parkia. Wood microcores were collected every 15 days from April 2009 to February 2012 from five trees of each species. The microcores were stained with cresyl violet acetate to facilitate counting the number of cells in the cambial zone, in the radial enlargement zone and wall-thickening zone. At the same time, we observed leaf shedding pattern in the crown of the same trees. In both species, cambial activity was significantly reduced during the leafless period. In P. nitida, these two concomitant events were observed during the dry season whereas in P. velutina they can occur anytime in the year with no apparent link with seasonality. In conclusion, the period of reduced cambial activity in some tropical rainforest trees may be independent of rainfall seasonality and not necessarily follow an annual cycle. It appears that leaf phenology is a good proxy to estimate cambial activity.

AB Given rates of deforestation, disturbance, and secondary forest accumulation in tropical rainforests, there is a great need to quantify habitat use and movement among different habitats. This need is particularly pronounced for animals most sensitive to disturbance, such as insectivorous understory birds. Here we use multistate capture-recapture models with radiotelemetry data to determine the successional stage at which within-day movement probabilities of Amazonian birds in secondary forest are similar to those in primary forest. We radio-tracked three common understory insectivore species in primary and secondary forest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments project near Manaus, Brazil: two woodcreepers, Glyphorynchus spirurus (n = 19) and Xiphorhynchus pardalotus (n = 18), and the terrestrial antthrush Formicarius colma (n = 19). Forest age was a strong predictor of fidelity to a given habitat. All three species showed greater fidelity to primary forest than to 8-14-year-old secondary forest, indicating the latter's relatively poor quality. The two woodcreeper species used 12-18-year-old secondary forest in a manner comparable to continuous forest, but F. colma avoided moving even to 27-31-year-old secondary forest the oldest at our site. Our results suggest that managers concerned with less sensitive species can assume that forest reserves connected by 12-18-year-old secondary forest corridors are effectively connected. On the other hand, >30 years are required after land abandonment before secondary forest serves as a primary forest-like conduit for movement by F. colma; more sensitive terrestrial insectivores may take longer still.

AB Tropical forests are important in worldwide carbon (C) storage and sequestration. C sequestration of these forests may especially be determined by the growth of canopy trees. However, the factors driving variation in growth among such large individuals remain largely unclear. We evaluate how crown traits [total leaf area, specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen (N) concentration] and stem traits [sapwood area (SA) and sapwood N concentration] measured for individual trees affect absolute biomass growth for 43 tropical canopy trees belonging to four species, in a moist forest in Bolivia. Biomass growth varied strongly among trees, between 17.3 and 367.3 kg year(-1), with an average of 105.4 kg year(-1). We found that variation in biomass growth was chiefly explained by a positive effect of SA, and not by tree size or other traits examined. SA itself was positively associated with sapwood growth, sapwood lifespan and basal area. We speculate that SA positively affects the growth of individual trees mainly by increasing water storage, thus securing water supply to the crown. These positive roles of sapwood on growth apparently offset the increased respiration costs incurred by more sapwood. This is one of the first individual-based studies to show that variation in sapwood traits-and not crown traits-explains variation in growth among tropical canopy trees. Accurate predictions of C dynamics in tropical forests require similar studies on biomass growth of individual trees as well as studies evaluating the dual effect of sapwood (water provision vs. respiratory costs) on tropical tree growth.

AB Intergenomic evolutionary conflicts increase biological diversity. In sexual conflict, female defence against males is generally assumed to be resistance, which, however, often leads to trait exaggeration but not diversification. Here, we address whether tolerance, a female defence mechanism known from interspecific conflicts, exists in sexual conflict. We examined the traumatic insemination of female bed bugs via cuticle penetration by males, a textbook example of sexual conflict. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed large proportions of the soft and elastic protein resilin in the cuticle of the spermalege, the female defence organ. Reduced tissue damage and haemolymph loss were identified as adaptive female benefits from resilin. These did not arise from resistance because microindentation showed that the penetration force necessary to breach the cuticle was significantly lower at the resilin-rich spermalege than at other cuticle sites. Furthermore, a male survival analysis indicated that the spermalege did not impose antagonistic selection on males. Our findings suggest that the specific spermalege material composition evolved to tolerate the traumatic cuticle penetration. They demonstrate the importance of tolerance in sexual conflict and genitalia evolution, extend fundamental coevolution and speciation models and contribute to explaining the evolution of complexity. We propose that tolerance can drive trait diversity.

AB Agricultural management and the landscape surrounding farms impact biological diversity and ecosystem services, such as predation, in agroecosystems. Diversified coffee agroecosystems harbor biodiversity, and maintain ecosystem services, especially when in complex landscapes, and when diversity of organisms providing services is maintained. But few have examined whether biological diversity, per se, or the local and landscape habitat features are stronger drivers of the services provided. We studied the relationships between local characteristics associated with agricultural management (vegetation complexity and agrochemical use), landscape surroundings of farms, abundance and richness of ants, and predation services provided by ants in a tropical coffee landscape. Specifically, we tested whether: (1) ants remove prey items and prey removal differs in the wet and dry season, (2) ant prey removal differs in farms that vary in vegetation complexity and agrochemical use, (3) ant prey removal differs with changes in ant abundance and species richness, and (4) ant prey removal differs with changes in local and landscape characteristics. We established sites across a range of coffee management systems, at varying distances to forest fragments, and in forest fragments and examined prey removal by ants on the ground, coffee branches, and shade tree trunks in the wet and dry season. Prey removal did not differ with season. Prey removal on the ground increased within increases in ant abundance and richness, and number of hollow coffee twigs. Prey removal on coffee plants decreased with vegetation complexity, but increased with ant abundance and richness, coffee density (a local factor), and rustic coffee within 200 m (a landscape factor). Prey removal on trees declined with vegetation complexity, but increased with abundance and richness of ants. Characteristics of the ant community were consistent predictors of prey removal, whereas local and landscape habitat features were less important, and only three habitat features correlated with prey removal. Our results demonstrate the positive effects of ant diversity for predatory function, and that promoting pest control services within coffee agroecosystems may be best accomplished by manipulating ant abundance and richness, or vegetation factors that correlate with ants.

AB Euglossine bees were sampled in three different phytophysiognomies [Rainforest (RF), Mixed Forest (MF) and Seasonal Semi-Deciduous Forest (SF)] of Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF). In this study, euglossine males attracted to eight synthetic scent baits were captured with an entomological net. Results revealed different euglossine bee assemblages associated with three AF ecosystems surveyed. A higher richness (14 spp.) of euglossines was found in the RF, followed by SF (seven spp.) and MF (three spp.) forests. Surprisingly, despite the short distance between MF and SF and that both forest remnants were located in the same studied region and under the same climatic conditions, the species richness detected was lower in MF than in SF. The present study contribute to greater knowledge of euglossine assemblages in remnants of Atlantic Forest areas composed of MF, SF and RF, helping to further understand how the structure of these bee assemblages can vary significantly at the local and/or regional level. In addition, our findings also represent a contribution to the understanding to the orchid bee biogeography.

AB The discovery of morphologically very similar but genetically distinct species complicates a proper understanding of the link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Cryptic species have been frequently observed to co-occur and are thus expected to be ecological equivalent. The marine nematode Halomonhystera disjuncta contains five cryptic species (GD1-5) that co-occur in the Westerschelde estuary. In this study, we investigated the effect of three abiotic factors (salinity, temperature and sulphide) on life-history traits of three cryptic H. disjuncta species (GD1-3). Our results show that temperature had the most profound influence on all life-cycle parameters compared to a smaller effect of salinity. Life-history traits of closely related cryptic species were differentially affected by temperature, salinity and presence of sulphides which shows that cryptic H. disjuncta species are not ecologically equivalent. Our results further revealed that GD1 had the highest tolerance to a combination of sulphides, high salinities and low temperatures. The close phylogenetic position of GD1 to Halomonhystera hermesi, the dominant species in sulphidic sediments of the Hakon Mosby mud volcano (Barent Sea, 1280 m depth), indicates that both species share a recent common ancestor. Differential life-history responses to environmental changes among cryptic species may have crucial consequences for our perception on ecosystem functioning and coexistence of cryptic species.

AB In closed-canopy tropical forest understory, light availability is a significant determinant of habitat diversity because canopy structure is highly variable in most tropical forests. Consequently, variation in canopy cover affects the composition and distribution of plant species via creating variable light environments. Nevertheless, little is known about how variation in canopy openness structures patterns of plant-animal interactions. Because of the great diversity and dominance of ants in tropical environments, we used ant-plant interactions as a focal network to evaluate how variation in canopy cover influences patterns of plant-insect interactions in the Brazilian Amazon rain forest. We observed that small increases in canopy openness are associated with increased diversity of ant-plant interactions in our study area, and this change is independent of plant or ant species richness. Additionally, we found smaller niche overlap for both ants and plants associated with greater canopy openness. We hypothesize that enhanced light availability increases the breadth of ant foraging sources because variation in light availability gives rise to plant resources of different quality and amounts. Moreover, greater light availability promotes vegetative growth in plants, creating ant foraging bridges' between plants. In sum, our results highlight the importance of environmental heterogeneity as a determinant of ant-plant interaction diversity in tropical environments.
   Resumo No interior do sub-bosque de densas florestas tropicais, a disponibilidade de luz e um fator que determina a diversidade de habitats, principalmente porque a estrutura do dossel e altamente variavel na maioria das florestas tropicais. Consequentemente, a variacAo na cobertura do dossel afeta a composicAo e distribuicAo das especies de plantas, criando ambientes com diferentes niveis de luz. No entanto, pouco e o conhecimento de como a variacAo na abertura do dossel estrutura os padroes de interacoes planta-animal. Devido a grande diversidade e dominancia de formigas nos ambientes tropicais, nos usamos como modelo de estudo as interacoes formiga-planta em uma floresta tropical na Amazonia brasileira. Nos observamos que pequenas mudancas na abertura do dossel esta associada com o aumento da diversidade das interacoes formiga-planta na nossa area de estudo, e essa mudanca e independente da riqueza de formigas ou de plantas. Adicionalmente, nos encontramos baixa sobreposicAo de nicho tanto para formigas quanto de plantas em ambientes com maior abertura do dossel. Nos hipotetizamos que a disponibilidade de luz aumenta a possibilidade de forrageamento das formigas, uma vez que, a variacAo na disponibilidade de luz fornece diferentes quantidades e qualidades de recurso disponivel nas plantas. Alem disso, a maior disponibilidade de luz promove o crescimento vegetativo das plantas, criando pontes entre as plantas para o forrageamento das formigas. Em resumo, nossos resultados destacam a importancia da heterogeneidade ambiental como um fator que determina a diversidade das interacoes formiga-planta em ambientes tropicais.

AB 1. In highly diverse ecosystems, such as tropical forests, the relative importance of mechanisms underlying species coexistence (e.g. habitat filtering, competitive exclusion, neutral dynamics) is still poorly known and probably varies depending on spatial and phylogenetic scales.
   2. Here, we develop new approaches for dissecting simultaneously the phylogenetic structure of communities at different phylogenetic depths and spatial scales. We tested with simulations that our method is able to disentangle overdispersion and clustering effects occurring at contrasted phylogenetic depths.
   3. We applied our approaches to a 50 ha Forest Dynamic Plot located in Korup National Park (Cameroon) where 329,000 tree stems >= 1 cm in diameter were identified and mapped, and using a newly generated dated molecular phylogenetic tree based on 2 plastid loci (rbcL and matK), including 272 species from Korup (97% of the individuals).
   4. Significant patterns of phylogenetic turnover were detected across 20 x 20 m(2) quadrats at most spatial scales, with higher turnover between topographic habitats than within habitats, indicating the prevalence of habitat filtering processes. Spatial phylogenetic clustering was detected over the entire range of phylogenetic depths indicating that competitive exclusion does not generate a pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion at this scale, even at a shallow phylogenetic depth.
   5. Using an individual-based approach, we also show that closely related species tended to aggregate spatially until a scale of 1 m. However, the signal vanishes at smaller distance, suggesting that competitive exclusion can balance the impact of environmental filtering at a very fine spatial scale.
   6. Synthesis. Using new methods to characterize the structure of communities across spatial and phylogenetic scales, we inferred the relative importance of the mechanisms underlying species coexistence in tropical forests. Our analysis confirms that environmental filtering processes are key in the structuring of natural communities at most spatial scales. Although negative-density tends to limit coexistence of closely related species at very short distance (<1 m), its influence is largely veiled by environmental filtering at larger distances.

AB As vital components of desert systems, the roles of ants in arid ecological processes have been well documented, while little attention has been given to their effects on soil water. We conducted a six-year investigation in sand dune systems stabilized via revegetation, to explore the hydrological role of ants through comparing the influence of ant nests on rainfall infiltration in different-aged revegetated dunes. The presence of ant nests markedly enhanced infiltration due to weakening the rainfall interception by biological soil crusts (BSCs) in revegetated dunes. The distribution of ant nest was denser in older revegetated areas, due to better developed BSCs of later successional stages, compared to younger revegetated areas. Ants prefer later to early successional BSCs because the later lichen-moss dominated crusts were thicker and their surface was more stable than the early cyanobacteria dominated crusts. Conversely, the crustal rainfall interception was positively correlated with BSC thickness. These findings suggest that the occurrence of ant nests in older revegetated areas benefited to the planted shrubs with deeper root systems and maintain a relative constant cover of shrubs in artificial sand-binding vegetation following an increase in infiltration to deeper soil layers.

AB Bromeliaceae is a species-rich neotropical plant family that uses a variety of pollinators, principally vertebrates. Tillandsia is the most diverse genus, and includes more than one-third of all bromeliad species. Within this genus, the majority of species rely on diurnal pollination by hummingbirds; however, the flowers of some Tillandsia species show some characteristics typical for pollination by nocturnal animals, particularly bats and moths. In this study an examination is made of the floral and reproductive biology of the epiphytic bromeliad Tillandsia macropetala in a fragment of humid montane forest in central Veracruz, Mexico.
   The reproductive system of the species, duration of anthesis, production of nectar and floral scent, as well as diurnal and nocturnal floral visitors and their effectiveness in pollination were determined.
   Tillandsia macropetala is a self-compatible species that achieves a higher fruit production through outcrossing. Nectar production is restricted to the night, and only nocturnal visits result in the development of fruits. The most frequent visitor (75 % of visits) and the only pollinator of this bromeliad (in 96 % of visits) was the nectarivorous bat Anoura geoffroyi (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae).
   This is the first report of chiropterophily within the genus Tillandsia. The results on the pollination biology of this bromeliad suggest an ongoing evolutionary switch from pollination by birds or moths to bats.

AB Structure and composition of tropical dry forest (SBC) and tropical semideciduous forest (SMS) were described in 2 locations at Campeche, Mexico. We compare the species richness, abundance and distribution of trees as well as their dasometric characteristics within each plant communities. We established 27 plots (500 m(2)) were all individuals >= 3 cm of diameter at the breast height were counted and measured. We counted 3 162 individuals belonging to 83 species and 30 families. Tree species richness was higher in the SMS (70 species in 30 families; 13 species average per plot) than in SBC, were 50 species in 21 families and 11 species per plot were recorded. Tree diversity in SBC was 1.91 (+/- 0.34) versus 2.10 (+/- 0.32) in SMS. Consequently, communities are not equitably distributed both in SMS (J=0.65 +/- 0.12) and SBC (J=0.63 +/- 0.12). Species composition was statistically different between plant communities (ANOSIM, R=0.19, p=0.01). Beta diversity, estimated using the Sorensen index, confirms this, with 46 species non-shared (13 registered only for SBC and 33 only in SMS; while 37 species (45%) were common to both plant communities. Some species are considered as indicators of the SMS while others are for SBC as shown by SIMPER analysis; representative species of SMS were Coccolob a barbadensis, Croton reflexifolius, Diospyros albens, Swartzia cubensis and Tecoma stans. In SBC forests highlighted Diospyros tetrasperma, Gymnopodium floribundum, Mimosa bahamensis, Randia aculeata and Sideroxylon americanum. Conspicuous and dominant species present in both vegetation types were Lonchocarpus xuul, Lysiloma latisiliquum, Piscidia piscipula, Bursera simaruba and Vitex gaumeri.

   DENSITY; SAPLING GROWTH; DANUM-VALLEY; DIVERSITY
AB Evidence of negative conspecific density dependence (NDD) operating on seedling survival and sapling recruitment has accumulated recently. In contrast, evidence of NDD operating on growth of trees has been circumstantial at best. Whether or not local NDD at the level of individual trees leads to NDD at the level of the community is still an open question. Moreover, whether and how perturbations interfere with these processes have rarely been investigated. We applied neighborhood models to permanent plot data from a Bornean dipterocarp forest censused over two 10-11 year periods. Although the first period was only lightly perturbed, a moderately strong El Nino event causing severe drought occurred in the first half of the second period. Such events are an important component of the environmental stochasticity affecting the region. We show that local NDD on growth of small-to-medium-sized trees may indeed translate to NDD at the level of the community. This interpretation is based on increasingly negative effects of bigger conspecific neighbors on absolute growth rates of individual trees with increasing basal area across the 18 most abundant overstory species in the first period. However, this relationship was much weaker in the second period. We interpreted this relaxation of local and community-level NDD as a consequence of increased light levels at the forest floor due to temporary leaf and twig loss of large trees in response to the drought event. Mitigation of NDD under climatic perturbation acts to decrease species richness, especially in forest overstory and therefore has an important role in determining species relative abundances at the site.

AB Nature is often more diverse than expected with multiple species appearing to occupy the same niche. This observation is especially perplexing when the co-occurring species are cryptic (i.e. only distinguishable via molecular markers), because phenotypic similarity is expected to correspond with strong niche overlap. One way that phenotypically similar species can coexist is if fine-scale phenotypic differences affect how species interact with other members of the community that ultimately results in performance tradeoffs. An alternative explanation for co-occurrence is that phenotypic similarity leads to ecological equivalence allowing species to co-occur for long periods. We tested whether three phenotypically similar amphipod species that co-occur exhibit performance tradeoffs that may allow them to stably coexist in lakes. We found that despite their similarity the three species differed in how well they performed in competition with each other and their ability to avoid predation by fish and invertebrate predators. In some species comparisons, performance tradeoffs were apparent with species that perform well against heterospecifics performing poorly against predators and vice versa. We also found evidence for direct antagonistic interactions among amphipod species, in the form of wounding, which may play a role in structuring amphipod assemblages. Finally, the two species with the most similar phenotypes showed comparable responses to competitors and predators, which suggests that long-term co-occurrence via ecological equivalence may also be important in this system. Collectively, our results suggest that a mix of performance tradeoffs and ecological equivalence may allow for higher diversity than expected in amphipod assemblages.

AB Behavioral strategies of natal dispersers in response to human-altered habitat have far-reaching implications for functional connectivity and local population dynamics. Spotted salamanders Ambystoma maculatum are forest-dependent, pond-breeding amphibians which metamorphose and disperse out of aquatic habitat with limited knowledge of the terrestrial habitat. We quantified the fine-scale movement behavior and search strategies of recently metamorphosed spotted salamanders in three different habitat types (field, early successional forest and forest) and at varying distances from both hard (field and forest) and soft (early successional forest and forest) edges using fluorescent powder tracking. We found that salamanders moved straighter and with fewer turns through field habitat compared with both forest and early successional habitat. Salamanders significantly oriented movement toward forest when released in the field and when released on the edge between the forest and field. We found that salamander movement in the forest and early successional forest was approximated by a correlated random walk. Based on these results, dispersing spotted salamanders exhibit strong edge-mediated behavior when differences between habitats are stark (forest and field) and can perceive forest habitat from distances of at least 10m. These results indicate that dispersing juvenile salamanders exhibit reasonable behavioral rules when moving through habitat types of differing quality. Knowledge of these behavioral rules will improve predictions of the effects of habitat type and configuration on amphibian survival and dispersion in altered landscapes.

AB Profits from forest management generally originate from harvested wood products or hunting leases. Other joint services such as biodiversity protection or landscape beauty are rarely paid for and are insufficiently provided. Payment schemes are designed to reduce this undersupply. In this paper, we analyze how paying for the additional provision of some services might affect the production of joint services. Payments should at least compensate for the loss of revenue resulting from providing more services. These opportunity costs can be estimated using a production possibility frontier in which the maximum profit from currently marketed outputs is a function of the externalities. We show that payment for a single service can threaten other services if there are diseconomies of scope. If at least two services are considered, then payments can either be made independently for each of them (stacking) or simultaneously in a bundle. In the case of bundling, the minimum payment amount corresponds the total opportunity cost whatever the interactions between services. In the case of stacking, if there are diseconomies of scope and if the amount paid for increasing each service equals the individual opportunity cost, then the total payment would not compensate for the total cost. Some services might remain undersupplied. On the contrary, if there are economies of scope then the total stacked amount will be greater than the total opportunity cost. Hence, it is critical to analyze interactions between ecosystem services because they are likely to change the profitability or the opportunity costs related to increasing the production of the ecosystem services and so the schemes of payments.

AB Although biological conservation has traditionally focused on the protection of pristine areas, it is becoming increasingly evident that efforts should also be made toward the maintenance of biological diversity in human-managed ecosystems. We evaluated the potential role of scattered, remnant trees in enhancing ant diversity in agricultural lands within a biodiversity hotspot, namely the Cerrado savannas of central Brazil. Ant collections were performed in, beneath, and away from the crowns of a native tree species growing in planted pastures, soy fields, and in small (<400ha) savanna reserves. Significantly more ant species were found beneath than 30m away from scattered trees. The magnitude of this effect was similar in soy fields and in pastures at all scales of our analyses, except at the landscape scale where the effect was comparatively greater in soy fields. Most of the species that occurred more frequently beneath than away from trees nest on ground, indicating that the conservation value of scattered trees goes beyond the mere protection of arboreal ant species. Soy plantations presented a particular species-poor ground-dwelling fauna when compared with savannas, whereas differences in the number and composition of arboreal species were less marked. In contrast, the diversity of arboreal- and ground-dwelling ants recorded in and beneath pasture trees was nearly as high as the one found in savannas. It is suggested that pasture trees can have an important value for ant conservation off reserves, particularly in regions where most of the native vegetation has already been cleared.

AB Biogenic structures produced by soil ecosystem engineers mediate soil functions and ecosystem services. Ant mounds are important biogenic structures in marsh wetlands, where they can occur at high densities. However, little information is available on their roles in the C and N cycling in these ecosystems. We measured CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from ant mounds of three different ant species (Lasius flavus, Lasius niger and Formica candida) and estimated their contribution to the total gas emissions of soils from May to September 2010 in a Calamagrostis angustifolia-Carex schmidtii marsh wetland of the Sanjiang Plain, in northeastern China. Average CO2 emissions from ant mounds ranged from 0.84 to 1.95 g CO2 m(-2)h(-1) and were 1.08-3.09 times higher than from the surrounding marsh soils. Soil CO2 emissions from ant mounds were significantly influenced by mound type and sampling season. On the whole, average soil CO2 emissions from L niger mounds were lower in comparison to those from E candida mounds and L.flavus mounds. Ant mound soils were CH4 sinks (-0.39 similar to -0.19 mg m(-2) h(-1)) while the control marsh soils were CH4 emission sources (0.13-0.76 mg m(-2) h(-1)). Soil CH4 and N2O emissions did not significantly differ among the three different types of ant mounds. Compared with control marsh soils (0.034-0.045 mg m(-2) h(-1)), N2O emissions from ant mounds (0.007-0.13 mg m(-2)h(-1)) were influenced more by sampling season. Overall, ant mounds contributed measurable amounts to soil gas emissions from the wetland, averaging 7.02%, -4.28% and 335% of total soil CO2, CH4 and N2O emission, respectively. Ant mounds also increased the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil gas emissions in the marsh. Thus ant mounds may be important to a complete understanding of wetland ecosystem C and N cycles and balances. Research on more ant species from more ecosystems is needed to establish ant mound impacts on soil gas emissions at a global scale. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Secondary evergreen broadleaved forests are precious remnants for biodiversity conservation and templates for sustainable management of natural forests in subtropical China. Floristic composition, size structure, and spatial pattern of dominant tree species have been investigated for a subtropical secondary evergreen broadleaved forest in the Huitong Yingzuijie National Forest Reserve, Hunan, China. The location of all trees greater than 4 cm in diameter at breast height (DBH) were mapped within a 0.96-ha plot in which species, DBH, and total tree height were recorded. Ripley's K(t) function was used to analyze spatial patterns and associations. The secondary forest consisted of 74 tree species and 1,596 stems per hectare. A reverse-J shaped DBH classes distribution was observed for all stems and trees of later seral species whereas trees of earlier successional species were distributed irregularly. Significant aggregated spatial patterns were observed for all trees within the forest and for conspecific trees of each dominant species. This result, and a repulsive spatial pattern for interspecific trees of Choerospondias axillaries and Cyclobalanopsis glauca against other dominant tree species, support segregation hypothesis. Contributions of seed dispersal, topographic heterogeneity, and competition to spatial patterns of conspecific trees vary depending on tree species. Attractive spatial pattern among interspecific trees of Liquidambar fortunei, Liquidambar formosana, and Pinus massoniana reflects stochastic colonization of pioneer tree species and a facilitation relationship. Although deciduous species are long-lived and persist over long successional processes, they will eventually be replaced by late seral evergreen species within the secondary forest if no disturbance events occur.

AB The inventory of soil phosphorus (P) is subject to significant changes over time. The main primary form, bedrock-derived apatite P, becomes progressively lost through leaching, or transformed into more immobile and less plant-accessible, secondary organic and mineral forms. Here we studied the rejuvenating effect of dust deposition on soil P along an active dust flux gradient downwind of a braided river. Along the gradient, we measured soil P fractions to 50 cm depth of six Spodosols and one Inceptisol, supplemented by tree foliage P concentrations. While an increasing dust flux correlates with a twofold increase of foliar P and soil organic P along the gradient, apatite P declines from similar to 50 to 3 gm(-2) and total P shows no response. Compared to dust-unaffected Spodosols, depth distribution of total P becomes increasingly uniform and organic P propagates deeper into the soil under dust flux. Further, the effect of topsoil P eluviation attenuates due to higher organic P content and the zone of high apatite P concentrations associated with un-weathered subsoil becomes progressively removed from the upper 50 cm. We interpret these patterns as being consistent with upbuilding pedogenesi and conclude that dust-derived mineral P is assimilated in the organic surface horizon and does not reach the mineral soil. Dust-derived mineral P is temporarily stored in the living biomass and returns to the soil with plant and microbial detritus as organic P, which is subsequently buried by further dust increments. We further conclude that (1) the efficiency of P fertilization of the ecosystem by dust accession is higher than through P advection in dust-unaffected Spodosols and (2) organic P may serve as an important source of labile P in a high-leaching environment.

AB Human stressors are currently impacting both the Amazon and Orinoco river basins and these are likely to increase. However, there is a lack of standardized monitoring programs to track these human stressors in most of the countries that overlap these basins, and no clear ecological indicators have been identified. In this study we investigated the relationships between measures of ecosystem degradation and river dolphins as potential ecological indicators. The presence of human stressors and their distance from the areas surveyed were used to provide an estimate of ecosystem degradation. We tested three ecological indicators of freshwater ecosystem degradation using river dolphins: (i) density of river dolphins, (ii) mean group size of dolphins, and (iii) dolphin sighting rates. We found a strong negative relationship between measures of habitat degradation and river dolphin density estimates in selected locations of the Amazon and Orinoco. Therefore, we suggest that river dolphins are good candidates as ecological indicators, flagship and sentinel species for monitoring the conservation status of large tropical rivers in South America. We suggest that further effort should be directed toward collecting reliable data on human stressors, creating collaborative networks for compiling existing data, and documenting and monitoring current trends in freshwater ecosystem degradation and indicator species in the Amazon and Orinoco basins with the goal of targeting areas for recovery or sustainable management.

AB There is growing consensus that sustainable use has a significant role to play in global conservation. Tropical forests are no different, and managing them for multiple products is envisioned as a preferable alternative to timber-dominant management models. Limited research, however, has tested coupling timber and non-timber harvests in multiple-use species for both economic gain and long-term species conservation. We employ matrix population models and the extinction time cumulative distribution function to examine one such species, Carapa guianensis. We investigated sustainable harvests of C. guianensis in two forest types in which it occurs naturally in western Amazonia, testing whether differences between forest types affect population responses to harvest under measured environmental stochasticity regimes. Our results indicated that some C. guianensis populations may be suitable for extraction of seeds, timber, or a combination of both. In upland or terra firme forest sites, model projections suggested that no tested levels of seed and timber extraction were sustainable. In contrast, we found the potential for compatibility between seed and timber harvest in occasionally inundated forests. In these sites, which are ecologically similar to wet areas where Carapa thrives throughout its range, our results suggested that 10% annual seed harvests were compatible with 100% timber harvests of trees >= 50 cm twice a century, the equivalent of approximately two trees per hectare. Application of this research approach to other economically important tropical species could increase the diversity of Amazonian management and conservation options. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study aims to investigate the relationship of biomass with density and richness and soil characteristics. In particular, we focus on the different types of land use found in areas of family farming in the southern and southeast regions of Para State, Brazil. The study was conducted in three communities located in the Nova Ipixuna, Parauapebas and Pacaja municipalities, Para State, Brazil. In each of the three areas, nine small family farms were chosen; in each lot five collection sites were established, where the structure of the vegetation cover was inventoried. Nine different types of land use were considered: conserved, exploited and burned forests; old and young secondary forests; clean and invaded pastures; crops areas (with cassava and cocoa). At each of the 135 sampling sites, vegetation cover was inventoried in upper, middle and lower strata; soil samples were also collected for physico-chemical characterization. From these data, we calculated the biomass of the different strata and individuals density, species richness and physico-chemical of soil to investigate their relationships with biomass. Total biomass varied greatly in all types of land use and in all strata studied. Conserved and exploited forests were different from those of burned forests. Burned forests were similar to old secondary forests. Young secondary forests were similar to invaded pastures and cocoa plantations. In principal component analyses (PCA) of biomass three groups of land use were distinguished: one group was explained by important biomass from the upper stratum; a second group was explained by the absence of biomass in the upper stratum; and a third group was explained by biomass found in the middle stratum. This result was compared with the results of the PCAs of density and richness matrix per stratum and physico-chemical properties of soil matrix through a co-inertia analysis. The first co-inertia analysis showed that the two data matrices (density and richness structure and biomass) share a common structure, with 77% of the variability being explained. The second co-inertia analysis also showed that the two data matrices (soil and biomass) do share a common structure. Thus, biomass was strongly correlated with density and richness and with the edaphic characteristics analyzed. The different types of land use in areas of family farms can be categorized into three simple groups according to biomass; this categorization can serve as a reasonable indicator for the rapid estimation of stored biomass.

AB A hierarchical-based classification method was designed to develop time series land-use/land-cover datasets from Landsat images between 1977 and 2008 in Lucas do Rio Verde, Mato Grosso, Brazil. A post-classification comparison approach was used to examine land-use/land-cover change trajectories, which emphasis is on the conversions from vegetation or agropasture to impervious surface area, from vegetation to agropasture, and from agropasture to regenerating vegetation. Results of this research indicated that increase in impervious surface area mainly resulted from the loss of cerrado in the initial decade of the study period and from loss of agricultural lands in the last two decades. Increase in agropasture was mainly at the expense of losing cerrado in the first two decades and relatively evenly from the loss of primary forest and cerrado in the last decade. When impervious surface area was less than approximately 40 km(2) before 1999, impervious surface area was negatively related to cerrado and forest, and positively related to agropasture areas, but after impervious surface area reached 40 km(2) in 1999, no obvious relationship exists between them.

AB We present a list of amphibians and reptiles from northern region of the Serra da Mantiqueira mountain range, under local name Serra do Brigadeiro mountain. This region comprehends an Atlantic Forest remain with emphasis at the Serra do Brigadeiro State Park, a conservation unit with approximately 15,000 ha which the boundaries are included at the municipalities of Araponga, Divino, Ervalia, Fervedouro, Miradouro, Muriae, Pedra Bonita and Sericita, all in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. Throughout complementary methods as pitfall traps and local collectors, besides other conventional methods as visual and auditive surveys, occasional encounters and scientific collection records, the present list broaden the knowledge on herpetofauna on this region. We recorded 98 herpetofauna species, being 57 anurans, one gymnophiona, nine lizards, one amphisbenian, 29 snakes, and one turtle. Although amphibian species registered were not considered threatened of extinction in Minas Gerais, Brazil or by IUCN, 11 species (18.96%) are considered Data Deficient. There is a high number of species endemic to Atlantic Forest (46.55%) or with restricted distribution (20.68%). Is worth noting the registers of the frogs Gastrotheca ernestoi and Megaelosia apuana, respectively the first and second registers of these genus for Minas Gerais. The caecilian Luetkenotyphlus brasiliensis is also rediscovered. Among reptiles, can be highlighted the presence of the freshwater turtle Hydromedusa maximiliani, which appears as vulnerable in the red lists of Minas Gerais and in IUCN. Sixty percent of the reptiles encountered are widely distributed in the Atlantic Forest, and the presence of the snakes Echinanthera melanostigma and E. undulata are important as, respectively, the second and third records for Minas Gerais.

AB The articles in this Special Feature stem from a 2010 conference (Bridging Conservation and Development in Latin America and Africa) organized by the University of Florida's Tropical Conservation Development Program, Center for African Studies, and Center for Latin American Studies. The conference involved researchers and practitioners from Africa and Latin America focused on the complex and evolving relationship between conservation and development. The conference provided bridges between academics and non-academics, conservation and development, and theory and practice. The resulting comparative analyses focus on: empowerment of local institutions; enhanced capacity of local and regional stakeholders through a recognition and validation of local knowledge systems and the creation of knowledge networks; understanding of social and natural landscapes, history, contexts, and their evolution; and the roles of economic and market forces in shaping opportunities for using market-based incentives to promote conservation and development. In this introductory article we propose a conceptual framework based on the six connected pillars of natural resource characteristics, interactions of social actors, governance and participation, politics, information exchange, and economic issues that support spaces for both conflicts and synergies between conservation and development goals. Our goal is to foster informed dialogue and social learning to promote sustainability.

AB We examined the influence of seed handling by two semi-terrestrial African forest primates, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and l'Hoest's monkeys (Cercopithecus lhoesti), on the fate of large-seeded tree species in an afromontane forest. Chimpanzees and l'Hoest's monkeys dispersed eleven seed species over one year, with quantity and quality of dispersal varying through time. Primates differed in their seed handling behaviors with chimpanzees defecating large seeds (>0.5 cm) significantly more than l'Hoest's. Furthermore, they exhibited different oral-processing techniques with chimpanzees discarding wadges containing many seeds and l'Hoest's monkeys spitting single seeds. A PCA examined the relationship between microhabitat characteristics and the site where primates deposited seeds. The first two components explained almost half of the observed variation. Microhabitat characteristics associated with sites where seeds were defecated had little overlap with those characteristics describing where spit seeds arrived, suggesting that seed handling in part determines the location where seeds are deposited. We monitored a total of 552 seed depositions through time, recording seed persistence, germination, and establishment. Defecations were deposited significantly farther from an adult conspecific than orally-discarded seeds where they experienced the greatest persistence but poorest establishment. In contrast, spit seeds were deposited closest to an adult conspecific but experienced the highest seed establishment rates. We used experimental plots to examine the relationship between seed handling, deposition site, and seed fate. We found a significant difference in seed handling and fate, with undispersed seeds in whole fruits experiencing the lowest establishment rates. Seed germination differed by habitat type with open forest experiencing the highest rates of germination. Our results highlight the relationship between primate seed handling and deposition site and seed fate, and may be helpful in developing models to predict seed shadows and recruitment patterns of large-seeded trees.

AB The effects of edge distance on the structure, composition and diversity of tree community, considering individuals of all size classes, were studied in a well-preserved fragment of deciduous dry forest in northeastern Goias state, Brazil. Plots were systematically established at six distances (0, 40, 80, 160, 280 and 400 m) from the edge, over 10 orthogonal transects on the forest-pasture edge. It was sampled 602 adult individuals/ha, 8,927 saplings/ha and 54,167 seedlings/ha distributed in 58 species. Although the composition of seedlings and adult individuals varied significantly over the forest-pasture gradient, the variation explained by edge distance was below 4%. Among parameters of community structure and tested diversity indexes, there was significant variation only for diversity of seedlings and height of adult trees among forest-pasture edge distances. The dry forest fragment showed only a slight edge effect on the evaluated tree community parameters. This conclusion contrasts with findings from studies on tropical rain forests which indicate sharp differences between edge and interior tree communities in forest fragments.

   interactions
ID REEF FISH; RECRUITMENT; POPULATIONS
AB Ecological theory suggests that both dispersal limitation and resource limitation can exert strong effects on community assembly. However, empirical studies of community assembly have focused almost exclusively on communities with a single trophic level. Thus, little is known about the combined effects of dispersal and resource limitation on assembly of communities with multiple trophic levels. We performed a landscape-scale experiment using spatially arranged mesocosms to study effects of dispersal and resource limitation on the assembly dynamics of aquatic invertebrate communities with two trophic levels. We found that interplay between dispersal and resource limitation regulated the assembly of predator and prey trophic levels in these pond communities. Early in assembly, predators and prey were strongly dispersal limited, and resource (i.e., prey) availability did not influence predator colonization. Later in assembly, after predators colonized, resource limitation was the strongest driver of predator abundance, and dispersal limitation played a negligible role. Thus, habitat isolation affected predators directly by reducing predator colonization rate, and indirectly through the effect of distance on prey availability. Dispersal and resource limitation of predators resulted in a transient period in which predators were absent or rare in isolated habitats. This period may be important for understanding population dynamics of vulnerable prey species. Our findings demonstrate that dispersal and resource limitation can jointly regulate assembly dynamics in multi-trophic systems. They also highlight the need to develop a temporal picture of the assembly process in multi-trophic communities because the availability and spatial distribution of limiting resources (i.e., prey) and the distribution of predators can shift radically over time.

AB We studied developmental and environmental constraints on leaf dynamics, morphology and physiology in the monopodial tropical palm of the Atlantic Forest biome, Euterpe edulis. Plastic responses to light environments in terms of photosynthesis, leaf size, leaf life span, patterns of biomass allocation and growth were analysed. Plants were grown during 14 months in a shade house under four different growth irradiances. Plants of Euterpe edulis were able to adjust leaf demography and biomass allocation in the different light treatments. Leaf life span increased by 100 days with decreasing light levels while the rate of leaf production decreased, consistent with lower electron transport rates. At low light levels, adjustments in biomass allocation to leaf components allowed E. edulis to reduce self-shading and increase light interception. At high light plants allocated more biomass to roots, and the plants exhibited small leaf sizes when leaves were compared using an explicit ontogenetic analysis. Ontogeny constrained the maximum size that each consecutive leaf could achieve, while growth irradiance determined the rate of leaf production and other leaf traits. Consequently, there were both, developmental constraints and environmental determinants influencing leaf demography and morphology in E. edulis. The findings of this ecophysiological and demographic study are relevant to palms growing under natural conditions and help to explain the success of E. edulis in the forest understory and its absence from large gap openings.

AB Does competition prevail in large size classes of trees in tropical forests? This question is fundamental to our understanding of the demography and dynamics occurring in rain forests. We investigated this question based on an undisturbed late-secondary forest on a 1-ha plot in central Cameroon. Trees were stem-mapped and classified into three size classes: understorey, midstorey and overstorey. The diameter at breast height and yearly biomass increment were determined as measures of plant growth and performance. Spatial statistics such as pair-and mark-correlation functions were used to detect scale-dependent patterns that could be caused by competition within and between the three size classes. The results revealed a random pattern and spatially uncorrelated measures of plant growth of overstorey trees. This suggests that competitive effects are of minor importance in the large size class of overstorey trees. Likewise, only weak evidence for competition between trees was found within the two lower size classes. However, negative distance correlations were found between the different size classes. We suggest that competition within height classes was relatively low due to the diversity of species with their variable niche differentiations and phenotypic plasticity that may compensate for competitive effects.

AB Fire is an important factor in several ecosystems, affecting plant population biology. Campos grasslands are under constant influence of disturbance, mostly grazing and fire. However, few studies evaluated the effect of fire on plant population biology of grassland species. Therefore, we aim to analyze the effect of fire on the population biology of four species, from different functional groups and regeneration strategies: Chaptalia runcinata (forb, resprouter, absence of belowground organ), Vernonia flexuosa (forb, resprouter, presence of rhizophore), Eupatorium ligulaefolium (shrub, resprouter, presence of xylopodium) and Heterothalamus psiadioides (shrub, obligate seeder). Seven plots were established in different sites in southern Brazil: frequently burned (FB) and excluded from fire since 6 years (E). All plots were subjected to controlled burns during summer. Before experiments, populations were sampled. Further observations were carried out after 90 and after 360 days of fire experiments. In addition, we counted the number of seedlings and resprouters recruited after fire. Heat shock experiments were conducted with two species (H. psiadioides and V. flexuosa), as well as the study of the bud bank of the following species: E. ligulaefolium and V. flexuosa. The obligate seeder species had all individuals killed by fire and established only after 1 year. Resprouters, however, showed new stems immediately after fire. E. ligulaefolium and V. flexuosa showed only vegetative regeneration from belowground organs and more individuals in excluded sites 1 year after the fire. The bud bank of E. ligulaefolium tended to be larger in excluded sites, whilst V. flexuosa showed an opposite result. High temperatures did not enhance nor kill seeds from both studied species. Vegetative regeneration was the most important strategy for all studied species, except for H. psiadioides, the obligate seeder species. Fire thus, plays an important role on population structure and demography, being also important for plant recruitment.

AB Aim
   To assess the hypotheses that compound leaves of trees in the Amazon forest are an adaptation to drought and/or rapid growth.
   Location
   Amazon rain forest, South America.
   Methods
   Genera from 137 permanent forest plots spread across Amazonia were classified into those with compound leaves and those with simple leaves. Metrics of compound leaf prevalence were then calculated for each plot and regression models that accounted for spatial autocorrelation were used to identify associations between climate variables and compound leaf structure. We also tested for associations between compound leaf structure and a variety of ecological variables related to life history and growth strategies, including wood density, annual increase in diameter and maximum height.
   Results
   One plant family, Fabaceae, accounts for 53% of compound-leaved individuals in the dataset, and has a geographical distribution strongly centred on north-east Amazonia. On exclusion of Fabaceae from the analysis we found no significant support for the seasonal drought hypothesis. However, we found evidence supporting the rapid growth hypothesis, with possession of compound leaves being associated with faster diameter growth rates and lower wood densities.
   Main conclusion
   This study provides evidence that possession of compound leaves constitutes one of a suite of traits and life-history strategies that promote rapid growth in rain forest trees. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully considering the geographical distribution of dominant taxa and spatial clustering of data points when inferring ecological causation from environment-trait associations.

AB Habitat fragmentation is often associated with reduced levels of fitness and local extinction of plant species, and consequently poses a major threat to the persistence of species worldwide. The majority of demography-based fragmentation studies to date have focussed primarily on fragmentation impacts on individual plant fecundity. Here we investigate the impact of habitat fragmentation on the demography (plant height classes and density) and key population dynamic processes for the rainforest tree species Macadamia integrifolia (Proteaceae). Raceme and fruit production and seedling emergence across fragmented sites exceeded that in more intact sites with no apparent difference in short-term mortality rates. Fecundity of flowering trees did not appear to be affected by fragmentation. Instead, overall reproductive output in fragmented sites was enhanced relative to undisturbed sites due to a higher proportion of reproductively active individuals. The probability of flowering and fruiting was negatively correlated with the projected foliage cover (PFC) surrounding individual trees, and average PFC was significantly lower in small and medium fragments, suggesting light availability as a potential contributor to the trends observed here.
   This study demonstrates that the short-term effects of habitat fragmentation on population viability may not necessarily be detrimental for some species, and highlights the importance of assessing not only the fecundity of flowering individuals but also the proportion of individuals reproducing within fragments.

AB Amazonia is a highly threatened rainforest that encompasses a major proportion of Earth's biological diversity. Our main goal was to establish conservation priorities for Amazonia's areas of endemism on the basis of measures of evolutionary distinctiveness. We considered two previously identified sets of areas of endemism. The first set consisted of eight large areas used traditionally in biogeographical studies: Belem, Tapajos, Xingu, Guiana, Rondonia, Imeri, Inambari, and Napo. The second set consisted of 16 smaller areas that were subdivisions of the larger areas. We assembled a data set of 50 phylogenies that represented 16 orders and 1715 distributional records. We identified priority conservation areas for the areas of endemism according to node-based metrics of evolutionary distinctiveness. We contrasted these results with priority areas identified on the basis of raw species richness and species endemicity. For the larger areas, we identified Guiana and Inambari as the first- and second-most important areas for conservation. The remaining areas in this first group scored half (e.g., Napo) or less than Guiana and Inambari on all indices. For the smaller areas, a subdivision of Guiana (i.e., Guyana and the Brazilian states of Roraima and Amazonas) was at the top of the ranking and was followed by a subdivision of Inambari (i.e., northwestern portion of Amazonas) and then another subdivision of Guiana (i.e., Suriname, French Guiana, and the Brazilian state of Amapa). The distinctiveness-based rankings of the priority of areas correlated directly with those derived from species richness and species endemicity. Current conservation strategies in Amazonia, although they rely on many other criteria apart from phylogeny, are focusing on the most important areas for conservation we identified here.

AB Background: The Janzen-Connell hypothesis proposes that seed and seedling enemies play a major role in maintaining high levels of tree diversity in tropical forests. However, human disturbance may alter guilds of seed predators including their body size distribution. These changes have the potential to affect seedling survival in logged forest and may alter forest composition and diversity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We manipulated seed density in plots beneath con- and heterospecific adult trees within a logged forest and excluded vertebrate predators of different body sizes using cages. We show that small and large-bodied predators differed in their effect on con- and heterospecific seedling mortality. In combination small and large-bodied predators dramatically decreased both con- and heterospecific seedling survival. In contrast, when larger-bodied predators were excluded small-bodied predators reduced conspecific seed survival leaving seeds coming from the distant tree of a different species.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that seed survival is affected differently by vertebrate predators according to their body size. Therefore, changes in the body size structure of the seed predator community in logged forests may change patterns of seed mortality and potentially affect recruitment and community composition.

AB Small seed mass is regarded as a robust trait related to invasion success, especially in pines. However, few studies have explored whether invasiveness related to small seed mass is also associated to low levels of seed predation in the recipient community. We conducted field cafeteria seed removal experiments comparing 16 Pinus species that differ in seed mass to test if seed removal might impose biotic resistance to Pinus spp. and if there are differences between species related to seed mass. Seeds were removed rapidly and in high proportion. In the Mediterranean shrublands, where the experiments were conducted, rodents and ants were the main seed removers. Mean seed survival time was significantly different between species. However, smaller seeds were not the most predated. Our study suggests that, in pine species with high invasiveness, the potential higher seed removal of small seeds can be counterbalanced by larger seed crops.

AB Assessments of restoration are usually made through vegetation community surveys, leaving much of the ecosystem underexamined. Invertebrates, and ants in particular, are good candidates for restoration evaluation because they are sensitive to environmental change and are particularly important in ecosystem functioning. The considerable resources currently employed in restoring calcareous grassland on ex-arable land mean that it is important to gather as much information as possible on how ecosystems change through restoration. We compared ant communities from 40 ex-arable sites where some form of restoration work had been implemented between 2 and 60 years previously, with 40 paired reference sites of good quality calcareous grassland with no history of improvement or cultivation. A total of 11 ant species were found, but only two of these were found to be significantly different in abundance between restoration and reference sites: Myrmica sabuleti was more likely to be present in reference sites, whereas Lasius niger was more likely to be found in restoration sites. Myrmica sabuleti abundance was significantly positively correlated with age of restoration sites. The potential number of ant species found in temperate grasslands is small, limiting the information their assemblages can provide about ecosystem change. However, M. sabuleti is a good indicator species for calcareous grassland restoration success and, alongside information from the plant community, could increase the confidence with which restoration success is judged. We found the survey to be quick and simple to carry out and recommend its use.

AB Objective. To analyze the association between social and environmental indicators and the Hansen's disease new case detection rate (HNCDR) in the Brazilian Amazon.
   Methods. This ecological study was based on the new cases of Hansen's disease reported to the Brazilian Disease Surveillance System SINAN in 2006. Analyses were performed considering 105 micro-regions formed by adjacent municipalities with economic and social similarities. HNCDRs per 10 000 people were calculated. Independent variables were total area deforested (km(2)) in each micro-region until 2006; proportion of people living in households with rudimentary septic tanks; proportion of people living in households with water supply from wells; and human development index (HDI) in 2000. Local empirical Bayes smoothing was applied to HNCDR. Analyses were carried out to determined correlations and differences between means (analysis of variance) for a significance level of 5%. The Kernel technique was used to investigate the geographic distribution of events of interest for all the study indicators.
   Results. A positive correlation was observed between HNCDR and total deforested area (r = 0.50; P < 0.000) and percent of households with rudimentary septic tanks (r = 0.49; P < 0.000). HDI was inversely correlated with HNCDR: the higher the HDI, the lower the HNCDR (r = -0.36; P < 0.000). Considering the entire region, proportion of households with water from wells was not associated with NCDR.
   Conclusions. The Hansen's disease new case detection rate, which reflects the magnitude of disease, is associated with social conditions and land settlement practices in the Brazilian Amazon.

AB Climate change, human disturbance, and disease can have large impacts on the dynamics of a species by affecting the likelihood of survival and reproduction of individuals. We investigated the roles of precipitation, off-road vehicle (ORV) alteration of habitat, and infection with Sin Nombre virus on the survival and reproductive probabilities of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). We used generalized linear mixed models to estimate the effects of these factors and their interactions by fitting capture-recapture data collected seasonally from 2002 to 2007 at 17 sites in the Great Basin Desert of central Utah, USA. During periods with high precipitation, we found no difference in survival and reproductive probabilities between seasons, but during drier periods, we found a reduction of overwinter survival and fall reproductive activity. Precipitation also interacted with disturbance to affect Survival probabilities and female reproduction; in periods with low precipitation, deer mice on highly disturbed sites had extremely low survival probabilities and low reproductive probabilities of females compared to those of individuals from low-disturbance sites. However, high precipitation ameliorated the effect of disturbance on both parameters. Deer mice from sites with high impact of ORV disturbance also had low survival over summer. Additionally, male reproductive probabilities were diminished on highly disturbed sites in both seasons; in contrast, they were reduced only in the fall on low-disturbance sites. Density had an overall negative effect on survival and reproductive probabilities of deer mice. For females, the negative effect on reproductive activity was amplified in highly disturbed sites. We found no effect of hantavirus infection on Survival probabilities of deer mice. Overall, this Study revealed complexity in the determinants of deer mouse survival and reproduction given by the effects of a number of significant interactions among explanatory variables. Thus, factors that may not appear to have a strong effect when investigated alone can still be influential by modulating the effect of a different factor.

AB How deterministic or stochastic is tree regeneration in a temperate forest? To answer this question, we analyzed the relative effects of abiotic and biotic factors on seed and seedling demography of tree species in an old-growth temperate forest, Ogawa Forest Reserve, Japan. The working hypothesis was that seed and seedling demography of trees would be controlled more deterministically in comparison with tropical forests and that the magnitude of deterministic effects of the abiotic and biotic factors would depend on regeneration traits relating to seed dispersal ability. We examined 5 abiotic factors (litter and humus cover, vegetation cover, light level, soil moisture, and relative elevation) and 2 species-specific biotic factors (distance from the nearest conspecific adult and density of conspecific seeds or seedlings) to quantify their contribution to the spatial variation in seedling emergence and survival for 18 principal tree species in the community. The results showed that conspecific seed density had a negative effect on seedling emergence for almost all species, as suggested by the Janzen-Connell model. On the other hand, various factors were detected for seedling survival of each species. We also found that regeneration traits relating to seed dispersal ability were significantly correlated with some of the abiotic factors. However, the 7 factors tested were less important than expected; seed and seedling demography appeared to be determined rather stochastically in this stable forest community. Even in a temperate forest, seed and seedling demography appeared to be rather stochastic, and niche partitioning among species during these stages was of limited importance.

AB Upland watersheds in the tropics provide a range of crucial ecosystem goods and services. How they are governed can be crucial to human well-being and environmental sustainability. Communities, governments and firms have taken many different approaches to sharing these benefits, negotiating trade-offs between them, and allocating the risks and burdens if services are degraded or lost. This review of policies and projects draws four initial conclusions: (1) multi-stakeholder planning improves the assessment of underappreciated services and users, but does not eliminate importance of power relations; (2) regulations invariably create winners and losers with outcomes that often depend on pre-existing institutions; (3) information and incentives can change behaviours and are therefore important complement to plans and regulations; (4) monitoring is the least well developed area of governance. Many challenges in integrating ecological and social understanding remain.

AB There is still little information on effects of habitat degradation on post-dispersal seed predation at the landscape scale. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of habitat degradation and seed species on the variability of post-dispersal seed-predation rate. Experimental seed removal was investigated in six Mediterranean woody plant species, four trees (Pinus sylvestris, Quercus ilex, Acer opalus ssp. granatense, and Sorbus aria) and two shrubs (Berberis vulgaris and Crataegus monogyna), in an extensively used mosaic landscape on the Sierra Nevada massif (SE Spain). Seed depots were distributed over 2 years in five differently degraded landscape units, each one with three plots: shrubland; native forest; and dense, cleared and fenced reforestation stands. Predation was the highest in native forest, shrubland, and fenced reforestation, and the lowest in dense and cleared reforestation stands, being partially due to a positive correlation between shrub cover and post-dispersal seed predation. However, the main factors driving post-dispersal seed predation were intrinsic to seeds, as species preference explained most of the variance in our model for predation. The plant-species ranking was Quercus > Pinus > Sorbus > Berberis > Acer > Crataegus, the dominant tree species being the most depredated. These findings are novel because they suggest for the first time that species-selection patterns by post-dispersal seed predators tended to remain constant through both study years in all habitats comprising a mosaic landscape, whether native forest, reforestation stands or successional shrubland.

AB Prescribed fire and livestock grazing are used for the management and restoration of native grasslands the world over; however, the effects of these management techniques on ant communities are unclear. We examined the response of ants to these disturbances in grasslands in northern California. Twenty-four 30 by 30 m plots were established across two sites that received one of four treatments: grazing, fire, grazing and fire, or no treatment. Ants were censused using 240 pitfall traps with one preburn and two postburn samples (14 d and 1 yr after burning). We analyzed ant abundance using broadly defined groups based on feeding habit and/or habitat use and detected no grazing effect but a significant fire effect that differed by group. Immediate postfire sampling showed an increase in cryptic species (particularly Brachymyrmex depilis). One year after the fire, no response was detected for cryptic species, but burned plots had greater abundance of seed harvesters. Analysis of vegetation showed burned plots had significantly greater forb cover, which might have provided greater food resources, and also lower biomass, which might have facilitated foraging. Understanding the effects of these management tools on ant abundance complements our understanding of their effect on vegetation and assists conservation practitioners effectively manage grassland ecosystems both in California mid beyond.

AB Vibrio cholerae strains are capable of inhabiting multiple niches in the aquatic environment and in some cases cause disease in humans. However, the ecology and biodiversity of these bacteria in environmental settings remains poorly understood. We used the genomic fingerprinting technique enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR) to profile 835 environmental isolates from waters and sediments obtained at nine sites along the central California coast. We identified 115 ERIC-PCR genotypes from 998 fingerprints, with a reproducibility of 98.5% and a discriminatory power of 0.971. When the temporal dynamics at a subset of sampling sites were explored, several genotypes provided evidence for cosmopolitan or geographically restricted distributions, and other genotypes displayed nonrandom patterns of cooccurrence. Partial Mantel tests confirmed that genotypic similarity of isolates across all sampling events was correlated with environmental similarity (0.04 <= r <= 0.05), temporal proximity (r = 0.09), and geographic distance (r = 0.09). A neutral community model for all sampling events explained 61% of the variation in genotype abundance. Cooccurrence indices (C-score, C-board, and Combo) were significantly different than expected by chance, suggesting that the V. cholerae population may have a competitive structure, especially at the regional scale. Even though stochastic processes are undoubtedly important in generating biogeographic patterns in diversity, deterministic factors appear to play a significant, albeit small, role in shaping the V. cholerae population structure in this system.

AB The dynamics of aseasonal lowland dipterocarp forest in Borneo is influenced by perturbation from droughts. These events might be increasing in frequency and intensity in the future. This paper describes drought-affected dynamics between 1986 and 2001 in Sabah, Malaysia, and considers how it is possible, reliably and accurately, to measure both coarse- and fine-scale responses of the forest. Some fundamental concerns about methodology and data analysis emerge. In two plots forming 8 ha, mortality, recruitment, and stem growth rates of trees a parts per thousand yen10 cm gbh (girth at breast height) were measured in a 'pre-drought' period (1986-1996), and in a period (1996-2001) including the 1997-1998 ENSO-drought. For 2.56 ha of subplots, mortality and growth rates of small trees (10-< 50 cm gbh) were found also for two sub-periods (1996-1999, 1999-2001). A total of c. 19 K trees were recorded. Mortality rate increased by 25% while both recruitment and relative growth rates increased by 12% for all trees at the coarse scale. For small trees, at the fine scale, mortality increased by 6% and 9% from pre-drought to drought and on to 'post-drought' sub-periods. Relative growth rates correspondingly decreased by 38% and increased by 98%. Tree size and topography interacted in a complex manner with between-plot differences. The forest appears to have been sustained by off-setting elevated tree mortality by highly resilient stem growth. This last is seen as the key integrating tree variable which links the external driver (drought causing water stress) and population dynamics recorded as mortality and recruitment. Suitably sound measurements of stem girth, leading to valid growth rates, are needed to understand and model tree dynamic responses to perturbations. The proportion of sound data, however, is in part determined by the drought itself.

AB Greater understanding of habitat selection requires investigation at the scales at which organisms perceive and respond to their environment. Such knowledge could reveal the relative importance of factors limiting populations and the extent of response to habitat changes, and so guide conservation initiatives. We conducted a novel, spatially explicit analysis of winter habitat selection by caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in Newfoundland, Canada, to elucidate the spatial scales of habitat selection. We combined conventional hierarchical habitat analysis with a newly developed geospatial approach that quantifies selection across scales as the difference in variance between available and used sites. We used both ordination and univariate analyses of lichen and plant cover, snow hardness and depth. This represents the first use of ordination with geostatistics for the assessment of habitat selection. Caribou habitat selection was driven by shallow, soft snow and high cover of Cladina lichens and was strongest at feeding microsites (craters) and broader feeding areas. Habitat selection was most evident at distance lags of up to 15 km, perhaps an indication of the perceptual abilities of caribou. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB We analyze the geographic distribution pattern of Chilean amphibian and reptile species between 18 degrees 20'S (Arica) to 56 degrees S (Magellanic Area) by the identification of centers of higher richness and endemism and we infer the biological processes that could have promoted these patterns from a biogeographic point of view, comparing our results with the present location of National Parks found in the National System of State Wildlife Protected Areas.
   Our results provide evidence that richness and endemism shows clear latitudinal trends along Chile, with highest values at mid-latitudes (31 degrees S to 44 degrees S). Five areas of endemism for phenetic analysis and six for PAE (Parsimony analysis of endemism) were found that agree with bioclimatic boundaries. We suggest that the richness and endemism patterns registered for Chilean herpetological taxa may be explained by an historical mechanism, in accordance with previous biogeographical proposals. To improve the conservation efforts for amphibians and reptiles we suggest inclusion of new protected areas at the regional level for the Mediterranean region of south-central Chile and for local northern and southern quadrats with high species richness and endemism.

AB Stem discs from trees of known age were used to determine the periodic nature of the growth rings formed in Laguncularia racemosa and to describe the anatomical features of these rings. The growth rings were scarcely distinct on microscopic examination, but they were well distinguishable macroscopically, with alternating light brown and dark brown layers. Cross-dating analysis revealed the occurrence of annual growth rings in L. racemosa. The existence of annual growth rings in L. racemosa suggests that it may have great potential for dendrochronology and should encourage age-related studies on the dynamics of mangrove forests. These studies can be important for the evaluation of climate change impact on mangrove ecosystems, as well as for the analysis of effects related to climate variability on plant communities.

AB This paper describes an environmental conservation planning model used in Queensland, Australia to purchase agreements on 66 sites covering 81,046 ha at a cost of A$1.9 million. The model was used as part of a competitive tendering program called "NatureAssist". The model maximises conservation benefit subject to a cost constraint using binary combinatorial optimisation. Multiple criteria analysis (MCA) is used to capture investor preferences and measure benefit over multiple outcomes. Conservation costs are drawn from real market data; i.e. the prices being offered by sellers (landholders) to supply conservation services to a buyer (the government). This study shows the potential strengths, and weaknesses, of taking an MCA approach to select conservation sites in a real market context. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Studies on ant communities in agroecosystems have contributed to the knowledge of the effect of agricultural activities on biological communities. The aim of this study is to explain the effect of soil use on ant communities. We tested the hypothesis that there was a decrease in ant species richness and a change in the species composition at habitats with more intense soil use. We collected ants using sardine baits, subterranean traps and direct sampling at four habitats with different Soil use (secundary forest, Acacia forestry, initial stage of succession and mixed crops). The ant species richness did not decrease with intensity of soil use. In successional habitat the species numbers collected using sardine baits and subterranean traps were significantly different. Species composition of communities had a pronounced variation, with the epigaeic and hypogaeic ant faunas of the habitat with high intense soil use (mixed crops) had low similarity with ant communities of the three other habitats. The predator species were restricted to habitats with low intensity of soil use. Then, species composition could better reflect the functional changes on ant communities than species richness. Our data can help to choose the component of ant community that better reflect the response of biodiversity to agricultural impacts.

AB Species diversity has attracted particular attention because of its significance for helping determine present species performance and likely future community composition. The spatial pattern of species diversity (species richness, abundance and Shannon diversity) in Changbai temperate forest in Northeastern China was studied to investigate the present and likely causes for the formation of spatial patterns. To fulfill this goal, three aspects of diversity were addressed: 1) changes in the relationships of the diversity variables, species richness, abundance and Shannon diversity, to sampling area and sampling design. The three diversity variables were found to respond to sampling area in a dissimilar way. Sampling design had no significant effect on the diversity variable-area curves. The power function, which was derived under the assumption that the forest was in equilibrium, did not fit the observed species-area curves, indicating that the Changbai temperate forest was probably not in equilibrium. 2) Variograms, used to examine the spatial structure of species diversity, showed that the spatial structure of species diversity in the Changbai temperate forest was weakly anisotropic. 3) Partitioning the variation of species diversity into spatial and environmental factors indicated that the spatial pattern of the Changbai forest community was unpredictable, probably because there were many undetermined processes controlling its development.

AB There is growing evidence that distance- and density-dependent recruitment are important factors in structuring tree communities in temperate forests. Although pathogens have generally been assumed to be driving these patterns, few studies have attempted to experimentally identify the agent responsible. Here we investigate patterns of recruitment in sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus, a temperate tree species, in its exotic range in Britain. Seedling mortality, the limiting stage in sycamore regeneration, was monitored with respect to the proximity and density of adult sycamores and seedlings in a grid of sampling units. We found that mortality was significantly greater beneath adult sycamores compared with heterospecifics, and was further elevated in areas of high conspecific basal area, a proxy for biomass. An experimental approach that manipulated the access of predators to seedlings demonstrated that herbivorous invertebrates were responsible for driving these distance- and biomass-dependent trends in mortality. Evidence of stem damage on dead seedlings suggests that slugs are the principal cause of mortality, although there was only partial evidence of higher slug activity beneath sycamores. The implications of these findings for sycamore invasion, species co-existence and management are discussed.

AB Fruit abundance is a critical factor in ecological studies of tropical forest animals and plants, but difficult to measure at large spatial scales. We tried to estimate spatial variation in fruit abundance on a relatively large spatial scale using low altitude, high-resolution aerial photography. We measured fruit production for all 555 individuals of the arborescent palm Astrocaryum standleyanum across 25 ha of mapped tropical moist forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, by visually counting fruits from the ground. Simultaneously, we used high-resolution aerial photographs to map sun-exposed crowns of the palm across the same area, which were then linked to ground-mapped stems. First, we verified that the fruit crop size of individual trees was positively associated with both crown presence on aerial photos and crown area visible on aerial photos. Then, we determined how well spatial variation in Astrocaryum fruit density across the study area was predicted by spatial densities of photo-detected crowns and crown area compared to spatial densities of ground-mapped stems and stem diameters. We found a positive association of fruit crop size with crown visibility on aerial photographs. Although representing just one third of all individuals in the study area, photo-detected crowns represented 57% of all fruits produced. The spatial pattern of photo-detected crowns was strongly correlated with the spatial pattern of fruit abundance based on direct fruit counts, and correctly showed the areas with the highest and lowest fruit abundances. The spatial density of photo-detected crowns predicted spatial variation in fruit abundance equally well as did the spatial density of ground-mapped stems. Photo-detected crown area did not yield a better prediction. Our study indicates that remote sensing of crowns can be a reliable and cost-effective method for estimating spatial variation in fruit abundance across large areas for highly distinctive canopy species. Our study is also among the few to provide empirical evidence for a positive relationship between crown exposure of forest trees and fruit production.

AB Massive anthropogenic land use changes are taking place in the tropics. These changes have not only jeopardized native biodiversity but also people. Environmental apathy, corruption, poor natural resource governance, poverty and lack of conservation funding remain formidable challenges for conservation biologists. Any meaningful success in tropical conservation will, hence, need active collaboration by the civil society, biologists, social scientists, lawyers, funding agencies, national and multinational corporations, governments and non-governmental organizations. Concerted research efforts are urgently needed to understand the imperiled tropical biodiversity. (c) 2007 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB The tropical monodominant tree Dicymbe corymbosa reiterates via epicormic shoots and roots, resulting in multistemmed trees with complex pseudotrunks and root mounds. In 2 ha of primary forest on the Guiana Shield, we quantified the reiterative structure and aboveground soil development of 307 D. corymbosa individuals >= 10 cm dbh and investigated the potential adaptive significance of reiteration in terms of genet persistence and root exploitation of aboveground soil accumulations. We also investigated the incidence of the heart rot fungus Phellinus robustus in D. corymbosa and examined its relationship to the reiteration process. Large trees contained more and larger reiterations, greater trunk, root mound, and organic soil volumes, and a higher incidence of Phellinus than smaller trees. Roots and ectomycorrhizas were abundant in aboveground soils on the trees, occurred at higher densities than those of the surrounding forest floor, and may be important in recycling mineral nutrients. Stem turnover and reiteration were associated with Phellinus heart rot and appeared to be cumulative over time, resulting in persistent, structurally complex trees of indeterminate lifespan. Dicymbe corymbosa provides a rare example of a tree species that exploits both persistence and recruitment niches, as it successfully recruits through mast fruiting.

AB The Sky Island archipelagos of the Sierra Madre Occidental contain diverse, highly endemic, and topographically complex ecosystems, yet the local and landscape-scale controls on woody plant dominance and diversity patterns are poorly understood. This study examines variation in woody plant species composition in relation to a suite of environmental variables (i.e., elevation, potential soil moisture, soil type, geologic substrate, and heat load) in the Chiricahua National Monument, Arizona (CHIR). Nine vegetation types were identified using cluster analysis that varied by species composition and plant life form. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and correlation analyses identified significant relationships between vegetation composition and elevation, potential soil moisture, and heat load. Rarefied species richness varied among vegetation types, and in relation to topography, with higher species richness occurring on more topographically complex sites. beta (species turnover) and gamma (landscape) diversity were also high in CHIR compared to other temperate forests. This study highlights the importance of local- and landscape-scale environmental controls on species diversity and vegetation patterns in Madrean evergreen woodlands.

AB Tropical rain forest dominated by Peltogyne gracilipes (Fabaceae) occurs on Maraca Island, Roraima, Brazil, on a range of soil types. Three forest types were stratified for sampling, according to the occurrence of Peltogyne trees: (1) Peltogyne-rich forest (PRF), (2) Peltogyne-poor forest (PPF), and (3) forest without Peltogyne (FWP). Biomass increment and change in total stand biomass were calculated from mortality, recruitment, and growth data for trees in the three forest types. Data were derived from permanent plots established in 1991, where all trees (>= 10 cm diameter at breast height), including palms and vines (lianas), were tagged and measured in three plots, each of 0.25 ha, in each of the three forest types. Field surveys were carried out in October 1991 and March 2003. Over a period of 11 years, the above-ground biomass in all forest types declined slightly (< 5%), associated with the death of large trees, especially in the monodominant forests (PRF and PPF). Within the study period, the forest on Maraca experienced two heavy droughts, related to El Nino events (1997-1998 and 2002-2003) and most mortality and loss of biomass probably occurred during these events. Therefore, as the Maraca forests appear not be increasing in above-ground biomass overall, they may not be acting as a sink for atmospheric CO2. The trees of the five most abundant species (Ecclinusa, Lecythis, Licania, Peltogyne, and Pradosia) accounted for about 55% of the total biomass in both FWP and PPF and for 74% in PRF. Peltogyne gracilipes had a stable, regenerating population in PRF, and is clearly a persistent dominant in a monodominant forest.

AB Waves breaking on rocky shorelines impart large forces on intertidal organisms, sometimes dislodging individuals. Dislodged individuals may be deposited in habitats that have a greater risk of predation or that prevent return to preferred regions on the shore. Thus, dislodgement is often assumed to be lethal. We experimentally dislodged Litlorina keenae snails from high in the intertidal zone to test the likelihood of survival. Under a variety of wave conditions, we measured return rates to the high shore of 54-90%, so in this species, dislodgement is not equal to death. Snails showed a strong preference for returning to the approximate tidal height from which they were dislodged, but we found no evidence of widespread homing behaviour back to the original site of dislodgement.

AB Walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, are one of the dominant fishes in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) ecosystem, yet relatively little information is available on the diet and prey selectivity of pollock in the northern GOA. Stomachs of midwater trawled adult pollock were collected in April, August and November 2003 in the northern GOA. Euphausiids were the dominant prey in April, averaging 59% by number and 70% by weight. Euphausiids persisted as the dominant prey in August, averaging 84% by number and 95% by weight, Decapods were the dominant prey item in November. This was primarily due to the shrimp Pandalus borealis, which averaged 68% by number and 53% by weight. Stomach contents were also compared with available prey fields using chi-square-based resource selection statistics. This analysis revealed significant differences between the environmental and dietary distributions of prey types. Additional analysis found significant selection for euphausiids over all other categories of available zooplankton in both spring and summer. Amongst euphausiids, there was significant selection for Thysanoessa inermis in spring and T. spinifera in summer. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The conservation of biodiversity is dependent on protecting ecosystem-level processes. We investigated the effects of fragment size and habitat edge on the relative functioning of three ecological processes - decomposition, predation and regeneration of trees - in small Afromontane forests in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Ten sampling stations were placed in each of four forest categories: the interior of three large indigenous forest fragments (100 m from the edge), the edges of these large fragments, 10 small indigenous fragments (< 1 ha) and 10 small exotic woodlands (< 0.5 ha). Fragment size and edge effects did not affect the abundance of the amphipod Talitriator africana, a litter decomposer, and overall dung beetle abundance and species richness significantly. Bird egg predation was marginally greater at large patch edges compared with the other forest categories, while seed predation did not differ among forest categories. Tree seedling assemblage composition did not differ significantly among large patch interiors and edges, and small indigenous fragments. Sapling and canopy assemblage composition each differed significantly among these three indigenous forest categories. Thus, while tree recruitment was not negatively affected by patch size or distance from the edge, conditions in small fragments and at edges appear to affect the composition of advanced tree regeneration. These ecological processes in Afromontane forests appear to be resilient to fragmentation effects. We speculate that this is because the organisms in these forests have evolved under fragmented conditions. Repeated extreme changes in climate and vegetation over the Pleistocene have acted as significant distribution and ecological extinction filters on these southern hemisphere forest biota, resulting in fauna and flora that are potentially resilient to contemporary fragmentation effects. We argue that because small patches and habitat edges appear to be ecologically viable they should be included in future conservation decisions.

AB Field studies in Acre, Brazil assessed logging impacts of a certified community timber management project. The main objectives of the study were: (1) to determine if damage incidence to future crop trees (FCTs; >= 20 cm diameter at breast height (dbh)) differs between (a) forest with and without bamboo (Guadua spp.), and (b) trees with and without lianas; (2) to what extent harvesting can be conducted more intensely (m(3)ha(-1)), without incurring greater FCT damage; and (3) to what extent marking diminishes FCT damage. Full inventories of FCTs of 50 commercial species complexes were conducted before and after logging in 50 m-radius zones of impact around each designated harvest tree in three 10 ha (200 m x 500 m) logging blocks. We also mapped all forested areas potentially influenced by logging, including skid trails, log landings and felling gaps, throughout the 30 ha logged.
   More than 28% of the forest area was disturbed by logging, with 12.1% in skid trails and 16.8% in gap clearings, indicating that the forest gap mosaic can be significantly altered even when reduced-impact logging guidelines are followed. Overall, 15% of FCTs inventoried were damaged. Damage rates were not significantly reduced by marking treatment, location in bamboo-dominated forest, or liana load on FCT damage. Harvest intensity did not influence the probability of FCT damage. For future studies, it would be prudent to address impacts of timber extraction on other livelihood activities, such as non-timber forest product collection, particularly in such regions as the Brazilian Amazon, where many communities are attempting to integrate a suite of income-generating activities.

AB Edge effects potentially have negative consequences for biodiversity in logging areas. In Tasmanian wet eucalypt forest, ground-dwelling beetle assemblages responded to habitat edges between mature unlogged forest and young regeneration following clearfelling. Transects of pitfall traps extended 100 m into unlogged forest and 10 m into the felled area firebreaks at four study sites (4 sites x 3 transects x 8 traps/transect = 96 traps). The depth of edge influence extended between 10 m and 25 m into mature forest, and the beetle assemblage was estimated to be 95% similar to interior forest at approximately 22 m from the edge. The species composition of beetles changed gradually with distance from the edge, but for practical purposes we distinguished three zones of edge response: mature forest interior extending >= 22 m into unlogged forest, firebreak habitat at the edge of the coupe that extends 1 m into unlogged forest, and an edge-affected mature forest zone in between. Individual species known to be characteristic of mature and young forest were of greatest indicator value in mature forest interior and firebreak habitat, respectively. Choleva TFIC sp 01 (Leiodidae), Decilaus nigronotatus, D. lateralis and D. striatus (all Curculionidae) were identified as indicator species characteristic of mature forest interior. No species were found to be characteristic of the habitat edges.
   These results are relevant to current management practices in Tasmanian wet eucalypt forest, in particular to the efficacy of linear reserve networks. One hundred metre wide wildlife habitat strips, when bounded by recently harvested forest, are estimated to contain a little over 50% of interior habitat not compromised by edge effects. Small patches of forest (< 1 ha) retained in variable retention harvesting are predicted to contain little or no uncompromised interior habitat for ground-dwelling beetles. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI Fire regime of an Ozark wilderness area, Arkansas
SO AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
ID HISTORY; FORESTS; PINE
AB Many of the present day issues associated with fire management in wilderness areas are addressed by studying past interactions among fire, humans, vegetation and climate. In this paper we describe three centuries of the fire regime in the Lower Buffalo River Wilderness Area, Arkansas, USA. We reconstructed fire events from 159 tree-ring dated fire scars on 26 shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) remnants and live trees. During the late-17th Century and early 18(th) Century the mean fire return interval (MFI) was 7.7 y. Fire frequency increased abruptly circa 1820 with fires burning every 2 y on average until 1920. The number of fires decreased during the 1900s as cultural values changed to favor fire suppression over multiple-use burning. Analyses of the influence of human ignitions and drought on the fire regime resulted in two important findings: (1) that fire frequency was positively correlated to human population density up to 1920 and (2) the influence of drought seemed to be masked by frequent anthropogenic fires and fire suppression. Fire events were associated with droughts only prior to Euro-American settlement. Studies of climate-fire relationships should consider the potential for anthropogenic influence and future studies should attempt to quantify the historic role of humans in the fire regime.

AB The indicator value (Ind Val) method which combines measures of fidelity and specificity has been used in a study on wild boar parasites in Corsica during 2001-2003. Because of its resilience to changes in abundance, IndVal is a particularly effective tool for ecological bioindication. The Ind Val method showed how season can influence the occurrence of parasite species in the wild boar, and also identified parasites as bioindicators relative to host age. The randomization test identified five parasite species having a significant indicator value for the season (the ticks, Hyalomma aegyptium and Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the louse, Haematopinus suis and the nematodes Globocephalus urosubulatus and Ascaris suum and two indicator species of an age class (the nematodes G. urosubulatus and Metastrongylus sp.). Data on species composition and infection levels would help improve the monitoring and management of parasitism in Suidae populations.

AB Climbing plants are known to play an important role in tropical forest systems, but key features for their distribution are only partly understood. Investigation was carried out to find if climbers differ from self-supporting vegetation in their adjustment of leaf parameters over a wide variety of light regimes in different forest types along an altitudinal gradient. Relative photon flux density (PFDrel) was assessed above 75 pairs of strictly linked climbers and supporting vegetation on seven plots between 2,020 and 2,700 m a.s.l. along a mountain range in South-Ecuador up to the Pairamo vegetation. Leaf samples from both growth forms were analyzed for leaf area (LA), specific leaf mass (LMA), mass and area-based carbon and nitrogen concentration (C, C-area, N, and N-area) and concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn and Al. Leaf size of climbers was independent of general light condition, whereas the leaf size of the self-supporting vegetation increased in shade. LMA increased as expected with altitude and irradiance for both growth forms, but climbers generally built smaller leaves with lower LMA. N, P, and K concentrations were higher in the leaves of climbers than in their supporters. Relationships of LMA and N-area to the light conditions were more pronounced within the climbers than within their supporters. Slope for the regression between climber's N-area and LMA was twice as steep as for the supporter leaves. Al accumulators were only found within the self-supporting vegetation. The investigated traits indicate improved adjustment towards light supply within climbers compared to self-supporting vegetation. Thus climbing plants seem to have a higher potential trade off in resource-use efficiency regarding irradiance and nutrients.

AB We studied two pairs of congeneric species (Dipterocarpus hispidus, Dipterocarpus zeylanicus, Mesua ferrea, and Mesua nagassarium). These species are canopy trees of rain forest in south-west Sri Lanka that exhibit differing topographic affinities. We hypothesized that topographic affinity is related to successional status and species ability to endure drought. We tested for these changes by measuring morphology of seedlings growing with each other in differing combinations of light and water. We constructed shade houses with a range of photosynthetic photon flux densities (PFD) and red:far red (R:FR) ratios. Two watering regimes within shade treatments created soil conditions that were either evermoist or periodically dry. Seedlings of the four species were inter-planted at equal spacing within large flats. They were allowed to grow amongst each other for a 2-year period. The more shade-intolerant Dipterocarpus spp. exhibited greater morphological responsiveness to increases in irradiance than the more shade-tolerant Mesua spp. We also demonstrate that all four species differ substantially from each other when morphological attributes (height, dry mass, leaf area) are compared together. Differences among these four species can be logically explained by their sequential competitive exclusion in relation to increasingly limited resources of light and soil water. In high light and evermoist soil conditions D. zeylanicus performs best. Under deep shade Mesua spp. have greater height than Dipterocarpus spp. When soil water is limiting, and the level of shade intermittent, M. nagassarium has greater height than the other three species. These results conform to species observed topographic distribution in the forest. Further studies are needed of wild populations growing across a range of forest sites to confirm whether these four species differ when grown under natural field conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB The large ateline primates are efficient seed dispersers in Neotropical forests and hunting is driving their populations to extinction, but we do not know whether other frugivores could substitute primates in their ecological role as seed dispersers. In this study we test this possibility using a potential keystone species (Bursera inversa) at Tinigua Park, Colombia. This plant species allows us to compare seed removal rates between emergent, isolated trees, without primate visitors and trees with connected crowns. We used traps to estimate fruit production and seed removal rates in six different trees, and fruiting trees were observed during 2 yr to cluantif, the number of seeds manipulated by different animal species. We carried out seed predation experiments to test if seed removal by predators was affected by distance or density effects. We found that the most productive trees attracted more visiting species and seed removal rates differed among trees, the lowest corresponding to trees without primate access. Seed removal rates from the ground by predators were not higher below parental trees than away from them, but the distribution of saplings in the forest suggests that seed dispersal is advantageous. Although it is likely that the effect of primate extinctions will vary depending on tree species traits, conserving the populations of primate seed dispersers is critical to maintain the ecological processes in this forest.

AB Primate frugivory may reduce density-dependent predation on seeds and seedlings via effective seed dispersal. Accordingly, the tendency of cercopithecines to spit and scatter seeds > 4 mm wide could represent a prominent means of dispersal. However, the importance of seed-spitting may vary according to the life history adaptations of plants. Indeed, the actions of cercopithecines may be incongruent with the reproductive biology of plants that rely on large frugivores to swallow and defecate their seeds. This possibility raises conservation concerns because large frugivores are often susceptible to extirpation or extinction from hunting and habitat fragmentation. It is therefore important to determine if cercopithecines have a compensatory effect; that is, whether or not seed-spitting effectively conveys large seeds to recruitment sites. To test this concept, we used geospatial techniques to measure and analyze the dispersion of tree species dispersed by elephants, chimpanzees, and cercopithecines to different spatial extents. We studied adult trees of Balanites wilsoniana, Chrysophyllum gorungosanum, and Uvariopsis congensis in a 2.2-ha plot in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Despite the tendency of cercopithecines to spit the seeds of Uvariopsis congensis, adult trees were highly clumped, with a modal nearest-neighbor distance of < 5 m and a crown overlap of 1.5 m. Virtually identical results for Balanites wilsoniana and Chrysophyllum gorungosanum, the seeds of which are not spat, suggest that seed-spitting may be a poor mechanism of dispersal for some large-seeded plants.

AB Competent larvae of the commercially important marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas (Gastropoda: Muricidae) 'loco', were collected in the field and exposed in the laboratory to adult conspecific shells with and without barnacle epibionts. Settlement and metamorphosis was induced by the presence of barnacles on shells of live or dead conspecifics, but not by C concholepas shells without barnacles. Results from laboratory experiments agreed well with field surveys showing the presence of recruits on conspecific shells overgrown with barnacles in shallow subtidal habitats (similar to3-30 m deep), suggesting the potential importance of barnacles inin inducing settlement and metamorphosis of locos under natural conditions. Most loco recruits were found below the C. concholepas shell apex, feeding on barnacles, inhabiting crevices among them, and inside dead barnacles. The mean size of recruits on locos' shells increased over four months from the beginning of the settlement season and no individual larger than 1.5 cm was observed, suggesting that they abandon adult loco shells at this size, roughly 5-6 months after settlement.

AB Species-area relationships predict that there is a positive relationship between the number of species and the size of an area. It has been suggested that species richness will covary with area because larger areas have a greater diversity of habitats. Moreover, habitat diversity may operate in conjunction with riverine barriers to influence primate biogeography. Few studies have determined if and how these hypotheses relate to primate diversity in Guyana. To test these biogeographic hypotheses, I used data from 1,725 km of primate surveys I conducted in Guyana. I estimated geographic ranges for each of the 8 primate species via a GIS system. Geographic range size is a major determinant of the number of sightings of the 8 primate species. Primate species diversity is strongly negatively correlated with the number of rivers crossed moving in a clockwise pattern from eastern to NW Guyana. Interfluvial and habitat areas influence primate species diversity in Guyana. However, my data on primate biogeography in Guyana do not support the hypothesis that habitat diversity within the interfluvial areas effects primate diversity. Although the species-area relationship is considered the closest thing to a rule in ecology, researchers should be wary of too readily applying and accepting the model at all scales in biogeographic studies.

AB A conservation study was conducted at Camp Swift, Bastrop County, Texas to determine if the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, could be selectively managed to protect endemic ant diversity. The study site was deemed to be an area where S. invicta had recently invaded, and was still in the process of expanding its population. The study was conducted between 1998 and 2001, and resulted in significantly higher ant diversity in the area where S. invicta was managed by prescription bait treatments. The control site, which was not conserved, lost four endemic ant species during the test, while the treatment site had an increase in one species. This provides evidence that S. invicta populations can be managed, but may not need to be eliminated, to preserve ant diversity. New county records are given for Brachymyrmex depilis, Forelius mccooki, F. pruinosus, Gnamptogenys hartmani, Monomorium minimum, Pogonomyrmex comanche, and Tetramorium spinosum.

AB Settlement of concholepas concholepas (Gastropoda: Muricidae) on natural and artificial substrata was studied between April 1999 and March 2001 at two sites in central Chile; the Las Cruces Marine Reserve and El Quisco Management and Exploited Area. Four different artificial materials were tested in the low intertidal zone during 1999 settlement season to determine their properties as settlement and microhabitat substrata for competent Concholepas larvae. Globular pads made of plastic filaments were identified as the best artificial collectors, exhibiting overall higher settlement rates than rock plots and lower variability among replicates within a given site. Thus, subsequent monitoring of settlement used only these globular pads that were replaced twice monthly, The temporal pattern of settlement was remarkably similar from year to year, starting at the end of austral winter (August-September) and ending in summer (December-January), defining a temporally restricted settlement season. Settlement at two sites within the Marine Reserve of Las Cruces was significantly higher than at sites in El Quisco. However, during the second settlement season, an additional site at El Quisco exhibited settlement rates comparable to those observed at Las Cruces. The results show that Concholepas settlement varies significantly over scales of several hundreds of metres as well as tens of kilometres, probably due to differences in coastal oceanographic conditions.

AB Subsistence fishers were first recognized as a formal fishing sector in South Africa when new fishing legislation, aimed at redressing past inequalities, was enacted in 1998. Little information was available about these fishers, their activities, and the resources upon which they rely. Recognizing the imperative to gain an understanding of the fishers and to consult broadly, the national agency responsible for the management of marine living resources, Marine and Coastal Management (MCM) of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, appointed a Subsistence Fisheries Task Group (SFTG) in December 1998 to provide advice on the implementation of appropriate management systems for subsistence fisheries. This paper describes the process followed to formulate recommendations that were presented by the SFTG to MCM in February 2000. The activities of the SFTG fell into two categories: research aimed at identifying subsistence fishers and gaining an understanding of their activities and socio-economic profiles; and consultation aimed at ensuring that the needs and aspirations of fishers and the experience of local managers were incorporated. Research included both field-based studies and synthesis of information about comparative fisheries elsewhere. Consultation took the form of local interviews and focus-group discussions, meetings with fishers and a national workshop. A pivotal activity was the development of a clear definition and qualifying criteria for subsistence fishers. A significant outcome was the identification of a separate small-scale commercial sector, previously erroneously lumped with subsistence fishers. Needs of fishers and problems identified during the process provided the basis for recommendations in the following areas: definitions, assessment and categorization of resources, management systems, communication mechanisms, application and allocation procedures, capacity building, compliance, research and monitoring, and funding and staff required for the management of this new sector. An evaluation is made of the opportunities presented by the SFTG process, constraints experienced and lessons learnt, giving important insights that are applicable to other similar processes, yet seldom documented in formal literature.

AB We examined browsing by red-necked pademelons (Thylogale thetis) on shoots of rainforest plants at areas of rainforest-grassland interface in the Lamington Plateau of southeast Queensland. Terminal shoots from nine species (three each of vines, trees and shrubs) were compared. The effects of five factors (plant species, site, distance from forest edge, habitat (grassland or forest) and time (trip) at two levels of exposure (caged or uncaged)) were also compared. Among the uncaged shoots, 98% showed signs of damage compared with 18% of the caged shoots. In general, shoot predation was higher in the grassland than in the forest and decreased with increasing distance away from the forest edge in both habitats. The three vine species were more heavily browsed than all other species. Browsing by red-necked pademelons is likely to influence regeneration near forest edges through direct death of seedlings as a result of predation and through altered competitive interactions resulting from selective herbivory. This effect, however, would be lower on seedlings within the forest habitat and would also reduce as seedlings establish themselves further from the forest edge into grassland habitat.

AB The eastern Pacific puffer fish Sphoeroides rosenblatti (family Tetraodontidae) preys on the mangrove periwinkles Littoraria fasciata and L. varia up to 13 cm above the water surface. Puffers capture snails by jumping partially out of the water and removing them by mouth from Rhizophora spp. prop roots. Field predation trials suggested puffer predation is intense, averaging 40.6% h(-1) on L. fasciata tethered at the water surface. L. fasciata < similar to 8 mm in shell length and L. varia <similar to 12 mm remained near or below the water surface and were easily crushed by puffers; gut content analyses showed that these snails were commonly eaten by puffers. L. fasciata > similar to 8 mm and L. varia similar to 12-16 mm were also crushed by puffers, but were generally located above their reach; these snails were much less abundant in puffer guts. L. varia >similar to 16 mm were abundant and some were submerged at high tide, however, none were found in puffer guts presumably because puffers encounter difficulty crushing these snails. S. rosenblatti is an important predator of L. fasciata and L. varia and appears to affect their vertical distributions.

AB During 1993-1994 the decapod crustacean community of littoral detritic bottoms (15-24 m deep) from Southern Spain (Barbate Bay, near the Straits of Gibraltar) were studied. The substrata include coarse sand, fine gravel, Amphioxus sand, and contain abundant bioclastic remains (bivalve and gastropod shells), which are under the influence of bottom currents. The taxocoenosis shows a clear dominance of the Anomura, 87% of those being hermit crabs; among them, Diogenes pugilator (Roux, 1829) is the dominant species (76.6%). The structure and development of the taxocoenosis during an annual cycle (number of specimens, richness, diversity, evenness and heterogeneity) is controlled by the cycle of D. pugilator, a characteristic species of shallow fine sand bottoms, and by the appearance of, or increase in, seaweed in the late summer and autumn; this produces a notable seasonal variation and modifies the dominance and composition of species.

We examined factors influencing spatial patterns of seed removal by the western harvester ant (Pogonamyrmex occidentalis) using three seed removal experiments. In the first two experiments, which assessed the effect of foraging trails on colony foraging patterns, seed removal rates from both low- and high-density seed patches were higher near foraging trails than away from them. Observations suggest that differences in removal rates are due in part to a higher probability of discovery for patches located near trails. In both experiments, there was significant variation in seed removal patterns among individual ant colonies. The third experiment examined patterns of seed removal at a range of spatial scales. Rates of seed removal were not affected by the distance of seeds from the nest nor by the surface location (undershrub or intershrub space) in which seeds were placed. At che largest spatial scale considered (areas encompassing multiple ant colonies), the risk of seed predation varied between years. Though seed removal; was monitored for up to 27 days in this experiment, >30% of seeds taken were removed within 1 day, suggesting that colony foraging areas are a mosaic of frequently and less frequently visited areas in which the risk of seed predation is highly variable.

AB Population dynamics, mortality factors, growth and dry weight changes in Quercus floribunda seedlings were studied to determine the implication of sun and shade microsites and the role of mast years on regeneration and maintenance of oak forests in Kumaun Himalaya. The number of seedlings was significantly greater at the sun microsites, but seedling survival was not, as ground herbage clearance at sun microsites accounted for 53.5 % mortality. Insect herbivores (e.g. acorn worm) were also one of the major mortality factors. At both microsites, most mortality was encountered between June and August. The initial seedling height at sun microsites was significantly lower compared to shade microsites. Seedlings at sun microsites were superior in terms of number of leaves and peak dry weight. Dry mass allocation in seedling components and root:shoot ratio was similar at both microsites. The study shows the importance of sun microsites and of masting in the potential for regeneration and expansion of Q. floribunda forests.

AB Herbivory and plant defenses exhibit a coupled decline along elevation gradients. However, the current ecological equilibrium could be disrupted under climate change, with a faster upward range shift of animals than plants. Here, we experimentally simulated this upward herbivore range shift by translocating low-elevation herbivore insects to alpine grasslands. We report that the introduction of novel herbivores and increased herbivory disrupted the vertical functional organization of the plant canopy. By feeding preferentially on alpine plants with functional traits matching their low-elevation host plants, herbivores reduced the biomass of dominant alpine plant species and favored encroachment of herbivore-resistant small-stature plant species, inflating species richness. Supplementing a direct effect of temperature, novel biotic interactions represent a neglected but major driver of ecosystem modifications under climate change.

AB Aims The objectives of this study were to assess how Arachis hypogaea L. (peanut or groundnut) responds to different P supplies in terms of growth and photosynthesis, and to determine the optimum P supply and differential P stress thresholds. Methods We investigated biomass production, leaf expansion, photosynthetic parameters, relative chlorophyll concentration, P700 parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence in a climate-controlled chamber at different P supplies (0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mM). Results Both deficient and excessive exogenous P supplies significantly reduced leaf growth, relative chlorophyll concentration and dry matter production in two high-yielding peanut cultivars. The optimum P range was 0.8-1.1 mM for peanut seedlings. Through principal component analysis (PCA) and data fitting, we found that the trade-off of the normalised actual quantum yield [Y(II)] and non-regulatory quantum yield [Y(NO)] in photosystem II (PSII) under light is one of the best proxies to determine the suboptimal, supraoptimal, deficient and toxic P supplies, because they are the two key factors with major positive and negative effects of PC1, accounting for 75.5% of the variability. The suboptimal P range was 0.41-0.8 mM and the supraoptimal P range was 1.1-1.72 mM. The suboptimal P supplies corresponded with a leaf P concentration range of 4.8-8.1 mg P g(-1) DW, while the supraoptimal P supplies corresponded with a leaf P concentration range of 9.9-12.2 mg P g(-1) DW. Conclusions Both deficient and toxic P levels severely inhibited leaf growth and photosynthesis of peanut, and these unfavourable conditions were associated with significant reduction of biomass and photosynthesis, and photodamage extending beyond PSII. The trade-off of the normalised Y(II) and Y(NO) is a useful benchmark to demarcate deficient, suboptimal, supraoptimal and toxic P-fertilisations levels in A. hypogaea.

AB Forest-to-agriculture conversion has been identified as a major threat to soil biodiversity and soil processes resilience, although the consequences of long-term land use change to microbial community assembly and ecological processes have been often neglected. Here, we combined metagenomic approach with a large environmental dataset, to (i) identify the microbial assembly patterns and, (ii) to evaluate the ecological processes governing microbial assembly, in bulk soil and soybean rhizosphere, along a long-term forest-to-agriculture conversion chronosequence, in Eastern Amazon. We hypothesized that (i) microbial communities in bulk soil and rhizosphere have different assembly patterns and (ii) the weight of the four ecological processes governing assembly differs between bulk soil and rhizosphere and along the chronosequence in the same fraction. Community assembly in bulk soil fitted most the zero-sum multinomial (ZSM) neutral-based model, regardless of time. Low to intermediate dispersal was observed. Decreasing influence of abiotic factors was counterbalanced by increasing influence of biotic factors, as the chronosequence advanced. Undominated ecological processes of dispersal limitation and variable selection governing community assembly were observed in this soil fraction. For soybean rhizosphere, community assembly fitted most the lognormal niche-based model in all chronosequence areas. High dispersal and an increasing influence of abiotic factors coupled with a decreasing influence of biotic factors were found along the chronosequence. Thus, we found a dominant role of dispersal process governing microbial assembly with a secondary effect of homogeneous selection process, mainly driven by decreasing aluminum and increased cations saturation in soil solution, due to long-term no-till cropping. Together, our results indicate that long-term no-till lead community abundances in bulk soil to be in a transient and conditional state, while for soybean rhizosphere, community abundances reach a periodic and permanent distribution state. Dominant dispersal process in rhizosphere, coupled with homogeneous selection, brings evidences that soybean root system selects microbial taxa via trade-offs in order to keep functional resilience of soil processes.

AB Evolution has been viewed as occurring primarily through selection among individuals. We present a framework based on multilevel selection for evaluating evolutionary change from individuals to communities, with supporting empirical evidence. Essential to this evaluation is the role that interspecific indirect genetic effects play in shaping community organization, in generating variation among community phenotypes, and in creating community heritability. If communities vary in phenotype, and those phenotypes are heritable and subject to selection at multiple levels, then a community view of evolution must be merged with mainstream evolutionary theory. Rapid environmental change during the Anthropocene will require a better understanding of these evolutionary processes, especially selection acting at the community level, which has the potential to eliminate whole communities while favoring others.

AB Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain the island species-area relationship (ISAR), including the passive sampling effect, the habitat diversity effect, ecological drift and a group of mechanisms jointly termed environmental filtering (or abiotic selection process). However, determining which of these hypotheses underpins the ISAR in a given system remains an open and controversial question, particularly with regards to the environmental filtering. The effect of environmental filtering on the ISAR for woody plants was tested on 29 islands in a subtropical land-bridge archipelago. Island area had a significant effect on species richness, while isolation was not found to have an effect. After controlling for the passive sampling effect and habitat diversity using a systematic sampling design, we found that a positive ISAR remained. After controlling for island area and isolation, species richness was significantly affected by environmental conditions (e.g. total phosphorus, soil depth and bulk density). When a null model was used that randomly assigned individuals to islands from the regional pool, the difference between the observed and expected richness was greater for smaller islands relative to larger islands. Synthesis. Our results point to an overlooked role of environmental filtering in driving the island species-area relationship (ISAR). Consequently, our study highlights the importance of considering deterministic process in future analyses of the ISAR.

AB Invasive plant species (IPS) are the second biggest threat to biodiversity after habitat loss. Since the spatial extent of IPS is essential for managing the invaded ecosystem, the current study aims at identifying and mapping the aggressive IPS of Acacia salicina and Acacia saligna, to understand better the key factors influencing their distribution in the coastal plain of Israel. This goal was achieved by integrating airborne-derived hyperspectral imaging and multispectral earth observation for creating species distribution maps. Hyperspectral data, in conjunction with high spatial resolution species distribution maps, were used to train the multispectral images at the species level. We incorporated a series of statistical models to classify the IPS location and to recognize their distribution and density. We took advantage of the phenological flowering stages of Acacia trees, as obtained by the multispectral images, for the support vector machine classification procedure. The classification yielded an overall Kappa coefficient accuracy of 0.89. We studied the effect of various environmental and human factors on IPS density by using a random forest machine learning model, to understand the mechanisms underlying successful invasions, and to assess where IPS have a higher likelihood of occurring. This algorithm revealed that the high density of Acacia most closely related to elevation, temperature pattern, and distances from rivers, settlements, and roads. Our results demonstrate how the integration of remote-sensing data with different data sources can assist in determining IPS proliferation and provide detailed geographic information for conservation and management efforts to prevent their future spread.

AB The Brazilian Soy Moratorium has effectively reduced forest conversion for soybeans in Amazonia. This has come at the expense of the region's pasturelands, which have increasingly ceded space for compliant soy expansion. The question of extending the policy to the Cerrado, where recent soy expansion has come at the cost of ecologically valuable vegetation, plugs into a wider discussion on how to reconcile competing commodities on finite amounts of cleared area. Innovative management strategies that allow different land uses to coexist are urgently needed. Integrated crop-livestock systems with soybeans (ICLS) rotates beef and soy on the same area, and shows promise as a means to improve production, farmer benefit, and environmental impacts. Here we reconstruct historical land use maps to estimate Cerrado Soy Moratorium outcomes with benchmark years in 2008 and 2014, we then estimate additional production afforded by ICLS implementation between 2008 and 2014. We find that if a 2008 Cerrado Soy Moratorium were in place, 0.7 Mha of 2014 Cerrado soy area would currently be in violation of the policy. Roughly 96% of this acreage is found in Matopiba (82%) and Mato Grosso (14%) states, suggesting that adoption may have slowed recent production in these rapidly transforming soy centers, in contrast to central and southwestern Cerrado where there is more concentrated eligible expansion area. Changing the benchmark to 2014 could have added 0.7 Mha of eligible expansion area, though over 80% of these additions would be in states with the most 2008 eligible area (Distrito Federal, Mato Grosso, Maranhao, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul). Meanwhile, ICLS adoption could have added between 4.0 and 32 Mha of new soy land to the study area without additional clearing between 2008 and 2014, though this would depend on rigorous accompanying land zoning policy to guide implementation. The roughly 5 Mha of Cerrado soybean expansion that actually occurred between 2008 and 2014 could have been accommodated on 2008 suitable pasture area given an ICLS rotation frequency of every 6 years or less. Conservation estimates presented here represent the upper limit of what is possible, as our scenario modeling does not account for variables such as leakage, laundering, or rebound effects.

AB Aim The factors determining spatial distributions and diversity of terrestrial invertebrates are typically investigated at small scales. Large-scale studies are lacking for soil animals, which control microbial communities and represent one of the most diverse yet poorly known animal assemblages. Here, we analyzed a major group (Oribatida) to test whether belowground macroecological patterns can be predicted by climatic variables, vegetation and large-scale variation in key soil properties. Location We modelled the multivariate distribution of more than 100 species using biodiversity data collected across Great Britain in the framework of the Countryside Survey (). Methods We analyzed species-level data from 582 samples collected across 162 hectads (10 x 10 km) covering the largest possible range of vegetation types, soil properties and climatic conditions within GB. We created the first large-scale maps of soil animal diversity metrics at the GB scale, including novel estimates of metrics of phylogenetic diversity (PD). Using structural equation modelling, we quantified the direct and indirect effects of location (latitude, longitude), plant community structure and abiotic factors such as precipitation on species composition, richness and PD. Results We found that variation in species composition follows a latitudinal gradient with diversity generally increasing northward. The latitudinal variation in species composition drives PD via changes in both species richness and phylogenetic distance between species. This gradient is mostly determined by latitudinal variation in precipitation and organic matter, which were very good predictors of species composition. Precipitation and organic matter were, however, relatively weak while statistically significant predictors of diversity metrics. Conclusions Past studies have emphasized the unpredictability of species distributions and variation in species composition in hyper diverse soil animal communities. However, past studies were conducted at small scales, where stochastic factors may weaken the signal of deterministic factors. Oribatid mites in our study show for the first time that the large scale latitudinal gradients in climate and organic matter predict not only variation in species composition but also taxonomic and PD of soil animal communities.

AB Aim Understanding how ecosystem functioning and evolution shape taxonomic assemblages is a lively debate basically involving two major opposite views: the niche- and dispersal-assembly hypotheses. Here, we introduce a new method allowing for the identification of the first-order process of assembly underlying a set of taxonomic assemblages. Methods Building on Clarke's SIMPER (for "similarity percentage") analysis of a taxon/locality occurrence data set, we develop a permutation-based algorithm named PER-SIMPER, allowing for the identification of the first-order process-either niche- or dispersal-assembly-that drives species distribution within two or more groups of assemblages. We demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the method through cellular automaton-like simulations generating niche-assembled and/or dispersal-assembled species occurrence data sets. Sensitivity analysis further allows evaluation of its accuracy and robustness to sampling effort, including reduced numbers of sampled localities and/or species. Main conclusions Niche- and/or dispersal-assembled communities generate very different SIMPER profiles, which, in turn, allow for the accurate and consistent identification of the first-order process of assembly operating within two or more groups of species assemblages through a threefold randomization procedure named PER-SIMPER. The PER-SIMPER method appears robust to varying sampling efforts that may affect the number of sampled localities and/or species, especially when one of the two processes of assembly dominates the other. The PER-SIMPER analysis can be achieved on any empirical occurrence data set using a dedicated R function available as Supporting Information.

AB In 2010, the Vietnamese government implemented a national payment for ecosystem services (PES) policy. In promoting the policy, the government has conveyed PES as a successful policy that has achieved multiple objectives, including forest protection and poverty alleviation. Contrary to these claims, however, critical studies of PES in Vietnam have found a weak relationship between PES and forest protection, the continuing dominance, rather than retreat, of the state in forest management, and no clear evidence that PES assists the poor in the near universal manner purported. Using a discourse analysis approach, this paper examines why and how PES policy was formulated and implemented in Vietnam. We explore the influence of key networked individuals involved in the production and negotiation of PES policy, as well as the socio-political and institutional context that influences PES policy design and implementation. The paper details how social relationships between state officials, donors and technical experts were built and mobilized through the process of PES policy design and implementation to achieve specific state objectives. In this context, we argue that government discourse on the 'success' of PES has served as an effective vehicle to deflect attention from the weakness of the forestry sector, to generate new funding for the sector's survival in the face of enduring budget shortages, and to expand state power in relation to forest resources. The 'success' of PES helps sustain the poor management and corrupt practices of state forest entities and eliminates villagers' opportunities to benefit from the forest, hence sustaining poverty in the uplands.

AB The Brazilian Cerrado is considered to be the most species-rich savannah region in the world, covering 2 million km(2). Uncontrolled late season fires promote deforestation, produce greenhouse gases (similar to 25% of Brazil's land-use related CO2 emissions between 2003 and 2005) and are a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity in protected areas. Governmental institutions therefore implemented early dry season (EDS) prescribed burnings as part of integrated fire management (IFM) in protected areas of the Cerrado, with the aim to reduce the area and severity of late dry season (LDS) fires. The planning and implementation of EDS prescribed burning is supported by satellite-based geo-information on fuel conditions, derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel -2 data. The Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering algorithm was used to analyse the data, and the relationship between the resulting matched fractions (dry vegetation, green vegetation and soil) and in situ surface fuel samples was assessed. The linear regression of in situ data versus matched filter scores (MF scores) of dry vegetation showed an r(2) of 0.81 (RMSE = 0.15) and in situ data versus MF scores of soil showed an r(2) of 0.65 (RMSE = 0.38). To predict quantitative fuel load, a multiple linear regression analysis was carried out with MF scores of NPV and soil as predictors (adjusted r(2) = 0.86; p < 0.001; standard error = 0.075). The fuel load maps were additionally evaluated by fire managers while planning EDS prescribed burning campaigns. The fuel load mapping approach has proven to be an effective tool for integrated fire management by improving the planning and implementation of prescribed burning, promoting pyrodiversity, prioritising fire suppression and evaluating fire management efforts to meet overall conservations goals. National and state level authorities have successfully institutionalized the approach and it was incorporated into IFM policies in Brazil.

AB Phototrophic microbial mats dominated terrestrial ecosystems for billions of years, largely causing, through cyanobacterial oxygenic photosynthesis, but also undergoing, the Great Oxidation Event approximately 2.5 billion years ago. Taking a space-for-time approach based on the universality of core metabolic pathways expressed at ecosystem level, we studied gene content and co-occurrence networks in high-diversity metagenomes from spatially close microbial mats along a steep redox gradient. The observed functional shifts suggest that anoxygenic photosynthesis was present but not predominant under early Precambrian conditions, being accompanied by other autotrophic processes. Our data also suggest that, in contrast to general assumptions, anoxygenic photosynthesis largely expanded in parallel with the subsequent evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration. Finally, our observations might represent space-for-time evidence that the Wood-Ljungdahl carbon fixation pathway dominated phototrophic mats in early ecosystems, whereas the Calvin cycle probably evolved from pre-existing variants before becoming the dominant contemporary form of carbon fixation.

AB Selection and drift are universally accepted as the cornerstones of evolutionary changes. Recent theories extend this view to ecological changes, arguing that any change in species composition is driven by deterministic fitness differences among species (enhancing selection) and/or stochasticity in birth and death rates of individuals within species (enhancing drift). These forces have contrasting effects on the predictability of ecological dynamics, and thus understanding the factors affecting their relative importance is crucial for understanding ecological dynamics. Here we test the hypothesis that dispersal increases the relative importance of ecological selection by increasing the effective size of the community (i.e., the size relevant for competitive interactions and drift). According to our hypothesis, dispersal increases the effective size of the community by mixing individuals from different localities. This effect diminishes the relative importance of demographic stochasticity, thereby reducing drift and increasing the relative importance of selective forces as drivers of species composition. We tested our hypothesis, which we term the "effective community size" hypothesis, using two independent experiments focusing on annual plants: a field experiment in which we manipulated the magnitude of dispersal and a mesocosm experiment in which we directly manipulated the effective size of the communities. Both experiments, as well as related model simulations, were consistent with the hypothesis that increasing dispersal increases the role of selective forces as drivers of species composition. This finding has important implications for our understanding of the fundamental forces affecting community dynamics, as well as the management of species diversity, particularly in patchy and fragmented environments.

AB The ecosystem services (ES) provided by drylands are critical to human wellbeing (HWB). Maintaining ES sustainability and improving peoples livelihood in drylands are crucial to global sustainable development as 90% of the dryland population belongs to the developing countries. Global environmental changes have greatly altered ecosystem structure and process of dryland ecosystems and have led to significant changes in ES provision, supply-demand relationship and trade-offs at multiple scales. We reviewed research advances and identified knowledge gaps on dryland studies in line with the 'structure-function-service-wellbeing' cascade framework. Focus was put on ES and their contributions to HWB. ES concept and methodology are highly useful in understanding natural-social linkages of drylands and informing decision making. More empirical studies are needed to apply the ES methods and make regional comparisons.

AB Tropical forest mortality is controlled by both biotic and abiotic processes, but how these processes interact to determine forest structure is not well understood. Using long-term demography data from permanent forest plots at the Paracou Tropical Forest Research Station in French Guiana, we analysed the relative influence of competition and climate on tree mortality. We found that self-thinning is evident at the stand level, and is associated with clumped mortality at smaller scales (<2m) and regular spacing of living trees at intermediate (2.5-7.5m) scales. A competition index (CI) based on spatial clustering of dead trees was used to build predictive mortality models, which also accounted for climate interactions. The model that most closely fitted observations included both the CI and climatic variables, with climate-only and competition-only models less informative than the full model. There was strong evidence for U-shaped size-specific mortality, with highest mortality for small and very large trees, as well as sensitivity of trees to drought, especially when temperatures were high, and when soils were water saturated. The effect of the CI was more complex than expected a priori: a higher CI was associated with lower mortality odds, which we hypothesize is caused by gap-phase dynamics, but there was also evidence for competition-induced mortality at very high CI values. The strong signature of competition as a control over mortality at the stand and individual scales confirms its important role in determining tropical forest structure. The complexity of the competition-mortality relationship and its interaction with climate indicates that a thorough consideration of the scale of analysis is needed when inferring the role of competition in tropical forests, but demonstrates that climate-only mortality models can be significantly improved by including competition effects, even when ignoring species-specific effects.Synthesis. Empirical models such as the one developed here can help constrain and improve process-based vegetation models, serving both as a benchmark and as a means to disentangle mortality processes. Tropical vegetation dynamic models would benefit greatly from explicitly considering the role of competition in stand development and self-thinning while modelling demography, as well as its interaction with climate.

AB Lemna minuta Kunth is an invasive, alien duckweed that is present throughout much of Europe, where it competes with native congeneric Lemna minor Linnaeus. Previously, L. minuta was found to grow faster than L. minor. The aim of this study was to determine whether the rapid growth of invasive L. minuta is based on differential light utilisation. For this purpose, the growth performance of L. minuta was compared with that of L. minor under a range of different light intensities. Both physiological and morphological parameters were determined. L. minuta showed a higher Relative Growth Rate (RGR) than L. minor when grown under medium and high intensities. Further analysis showed that, at high light intensities, L. minuta has a higher Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), and displays more photochemical quenching (qP) and a higher quantum yield (Y(II)) than L. minor. In contrast under low light intensities L. minor displayed a marginally higher RGR, due to a greater Leaf Area Ratio (LAR), and higher chlorophyll content than L. minuta. The results indicate two distinct light utilisation strategies, and reveal that the invasive species L minuta takes more advantage from high intensity light conditions. In turn, this may influence plant distribution and, consequently, ecosystem management by relevant authorities.

AB Persistent genetic variation within populations presents an evolutionary problem, as natural selection and genetic drift tend to erode genetic diversity. Models of balancing selection were developed to account for the maintenance of genetic variation observed in natural populations. Negative frequency-dependent selection is a powerful type of balancing selection that maintains many natural polymorphisms, but it is also commonly misinterpreted. This review aims to clarify the processes underlying negative frequency-dependent selection, describe classes of polymorphisms that can and cannot result from these processes, and discuss the empirical data needed to accurately identify processes that generate or maintain diversity in nature. Finally, the importance of accurately describing the processes affecting genetic diversity within populations as it relates to research progress is considered.

AB The paper suggests a minimum set of abiotic and biotic threshold indicators and progress indicators for forest landscape restoration (FLR), then also briefly discusses progress indicators of pressures and project outputs. FLR aims to restore multiple functions of forests at a landscape scale. It is predicated on the hypothesis that restoration produces enabling conditions for ecosystem services, including regulating services such as carbon sequestration and pollination, and provisioning services such as food and energy. As FLR gains greater uptake, it is increasingly important to monitor progress. The types of indicators required are influenced by the degree of forest loss and degradation. To measure the status of land under restoration, one or more abiotic and biotic threshold indicators are required, measuring the return of enabling conditions for restoration (soil quality, water, etc.), along with progress indicators measuring the reemergence of the ecosystem services. Although all elements of the proposed monitoring framework are well known, compiling them into a coherent system, suitable for application in a wide range of conditions, will take much further development.

AB We present the microscopic analysis of growth-ring boundary anatomy of 27 tree species from a moist tropical forest in Bangladesh and evaluate their dendrochronological potential. We observed high inter-species variability in the anatomical features that define growth-ring boundaries. Marginal parenchyma, fibre zones, and thick-walled latewood fibres were identified as the dominant anatomical features delineating growth-ring boundaries. The evaluation of growth-ring boundary distinctness in thin-sections and scanned images revealed that 25 out of 27 studied species (93%) showed distinct to fairly distinct growth-ring boundaries. Cluster analysis of wood anatomical features was used to select an additional 5 species for further investigation. Ring-width series of these species crossdated well within the same tree. Between trees crossdating was also successful in all 5 species. The Gleichlaufigkeit (GLK; i.e. the proportion of agreement/disagreement of inter-annual growth tendencies among the trees) varied among species between 0.55 and 0.71. A strong synchronization of tree-ring series between trees suggests that growth rings are annual and influenced by common environmental factors. The derived tree-ring series, estimated tree ages, and growth trajectories underline the high potential of our study area for answering a variety of climatological, ecological and archaeological questions by applying den-drochronology. This study will therefore provide a new endeavor in tropical dendrochronology of South Asian moist tropical forests.

AB In addition to causing physical degradation and nutrient depletion, erosion of cultivated soils in the Amazon affects aquatic ecosystems through the release of natural soil mercury (Hg) towards lakes and rivers. While traditional agriculture is generally cited as being among the main causes of soil erosion, agroforestry practices are increasingly appreciated for soil conservation. This study was carried out in family farms of the rural Tapajos region (Brazil) and aimed at evaluating soil erosion and associated Hg release for three land uses. Soils, runoff water and eroded sediments were collected at three sites representing a land cover gradient: a recently burnt short-cycle cropping system (SCC), a 2-year-old agroforestry system (AFS) and a mature forest (F). At each site, two PVC soil erosion plots (each composed of three 2 x 5 m isolated subplots) were implemented on steep and moderate slopes respectively. Sampling was done after each of the 20 rain events that occurred during a 1-month study period, in the peak of the 2011 rain season. Runoff volume and rate, as well as eroded soil particles with their Hg and cation concentrations were determined. Total Hg and cation losses were then calculated for each subplot. Erosion processes were dominated by land use type over rainfall or soil slope. Eroded soil particles, as well as the amount of Hg and cations (CaMgK) mobilized at the AFS site were similar to those at the F site, but significantly lower than those at the SCC site (p < 0.0001). Erosion reduction at the AFS site was mainly attributed to the ground cover plants characterizing the recently established system. Moreover, edaphic change throughout AFS and F soil profiles differed from the SCC site. At the latter site, losses of fine particles and Hg were enhanced towards soil surface, while they were less pronounced at the other sites. This study shows that agroforestry systems, even in their early stages of implementation, are characterized by low erosion levels resembling those of local forest environments, thus contributing to the maintenance of soil integrity and to the reduction of Hg and nutrient mobility.

AB Fire activity plays an important role in the past, present and future of Earth system behavior. Monitoring and assessing spatial and temporal fire dynamics have a fundamental relevance in the understanding of ecological processes and the human impacts on different landscapes and multiple spatial scales. This work analyzes the spatio-temporal distribution of burned areas in one of the biggest savanna vegetation enclaves in the southern Brazilian Amazon, from 2000 to 2016, deriving information from multiple remote sensing data sources (Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance, TRMM pluviometry and Vegetation Continuous Field tree cover layers). A fire scars database with 30m spatial resolution was generated using a Landsat time series. MODIS daily surface reflectance was used for accurate dating of the fire scars. TRMM pluviometry data were analyzed to dynamically establish time limits of the yearly dry season and burning periods. Burned area extent, frequency and recurrence were quantified comparing the results annually/seasonally. Additionally, Vegetation Continuous Field tree cover layers were used to analyze fire incidence over different types of tree cover domains. In the last seventeen years, 1.03 million ha were burned within the study area, distributed across 1432 fire occurrences, highlighting 2005, 2010 and 2014 as the most affected years. Middle dry season fires represent 86.21% of the total burned areas and 32.05% of fire occurrences, affecting larger amount of higher density tree surfaces than other burning periods. The results provide new insights into the analysis of burned areas of the neotropical savannas, spatially and statistically reinforcing important aspects linked to the seasonality patterns of fire incidence in this landscape.

AB Understanding how climatic variation affects animal populations and communities is essential for addressing threats posed by climate change, especially in systems where impacts are projected to be high. We evaluated abundance dynamics of five common species of diurnal lizards over 25 years in a Sonoran Desert transition zone where precipitation decreased and temperature increased across time, and assessed hypotheses for the influence of climatic flux on spatiotemporal variation in abundances. We repeatedly surveyed lizards in spring and summer of each year at up to 32 sites, and used hierarchical mixture models to estimate detection probabilities, abundances, and population growth rates. Among terrestrial species, abundances of a short-lived, winter-spring breeder increased markedly by an estimated 237%-285% across time, while two larger spring-summer breeders with higher thermal preferences declined by up to 64%. Abundances of two arboreal species that occupy shaded and thus sheltered microhabitats fluctuated but did not decline systematically. Abundances of all species increased with precipitation at short lag times (1-1.5 years) likely due to enhanced food availability, but often declined after periods of high precipitation at longer lag times (2-4 years) likely due to predation and other biotic pressures. Although rising maximum daily temperatures (T-max) are expected to drive global declines of lizards, associations with T-max were variable and weak for most species. Instead, abundances of all species declined with rising daily minimum temperatures, suggesting degradation of cool refugia imposed widespread metabolic or other costs. Our results suggest climate warming and drying are having major impacts on lizard communities by driving declines in species with traits that augment exposure to abiotic extremes and by modifying species interactions. The complexity of patterns we report indicates that evaluating and responding to the influence of climate change on biodiversity must consider a broad array of ecological processes.

AB The understanding of the degree of forest fragmentation and landscape transformation is crucial for landscape sustainability and biodiversity conservation. Within the Chilean hotspot the Nahuelbuta Mountain can be found, which is considered as a high biodiversity value area under an intense human pressure. However, there is no information on the degree of transformation of the landscape and the conservation status of its natural forest ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the state of the landscape and the spatiotemporal changes in native forests in Nahuelbuta. Through the use of Landsat imagery acquired for 1986 and 2011, land-cover and use maps were generated. Results revealed a loss of 33% of native forest in 25 years, mainly associated with the conversion to forest plantations. Changes in spatial patterns of land-cover and uses revealed a profound transformation of the study landscape and an advanced fragmentation of native forests. We discuss how these changes threaten the persistence of different endemic species at high risk of extinction. If the current trend of spatial pattern changes continues, it is probable that these species might face an increase in their extinction risk.

AB Linear disturbances such as roads are common in areas of intensive resource development. When roads cross peatlands, they can interrupt natural hydrologic processes and alter vegetation composition and structure. Hydrological changes to a poor fen impacted by a road in northeastern Alberta were evaluated using tree rings of living and dead black spruce trees. All trees that were less than 83.5 cm above the road's single culvert died in 1989. The temporal uniformity of dieback suggested that a single inundation event caused the trees to drown. The inundation likely was caused by a culvert blocked by beavers, and indicates the critical role of hydrologic patterns and processes for controlling vegetation composition, including tree growth patterns and mortality. The disturbance of peatlands by roads could be reduced or eliminated by improving road designs to include multiple culverts that cannot easily be blocked by debris or beavers, or underdrain systems that create more natural surface and ground water flow patterns. In addition, regular inspection and maintenance could limit the negative effects of blocked point locations that can be dammed by beavers.

AB Host-associated microbiomes are integral components of host health, but microbiome community structure varies among and within hosts. Reconciling community variability with the apparent dependence of hosts on community function, and characterizing how functional divergence proceeds across niches, remains challenging. Here, through the study of gut microbiomes and diets of three insectivorous bat species we characterize how community structure is shaped by predicted functional properties of community members. We found that while host diet and microbiome community composition do not significantly relate to each other, host diet and metagenome function do, suggesting that diet directly selects metagenomic functions rather than communities. We use a novel inference framework to show how the discordance between community structure and functional variation derives from functional equivalence and is influenced by the continuum of shared and derived gene sets across microbial lineages. Our findings help clarify how metagenome community structure-function relationships contribute to deterministic processes in community assembly, and describe the basis for metagenomic differences across ecologically similar hosts.

AB The substitution of natural ecosystems with agriculture has led to the establishment of human-modified landscapes globally. In some tropical regions, this process is decades-old, allowing for the study of the effect of such modifications on the remaining biodiversity. However, unlike forest fragments inside regions with extensive primary coverage, the conservation value of ecosystems embedded within intensive farming, i.e., the anthropogenic matrices, has long been ignored, as have the effects of the landscape on such disturbed forest communities. Since the degradation process is predicted to cause the collapse of these fragmented forests, we can choose either to neglect them or to attempt the reversal of the degradation process for biodiversity conservation. Here we investigated the possible influence of landscape predictors on numerous plant species and on the relative proportions of different functional groups. Our results revealed that the richness found in human-modified landscapes had significantly more species than the protected reserves (+90%). The distribution of species suggested that any forest patch is likely to harbour a rare species. Generalised linear models and quantile regressions showed that forest cover and connected area influences the persistence of pioneer species and non-pioneer species of the canopy and zoochorics, with the latter also depending on slope. Rarefaction analysis revealed that natural remnants retain many species, even in sites with less than 20% forest cover. The presence of many zoo-choric and non-pioneer canopy species may indicate a qualitative aspect to support conservation-restora tion efforts. These results indicate that the current strategy, which is limited to the preservation of biodiversity in public conservation reserves, should be reconsidered and should include smaller remnants of the natural ecosystem in a regional context and adopt large-scale restoration strategies to preserve the species pool.

AB Environmental filtering consistently shapes the functional and phylogenetic structure of species across space within diverse forests. However, poor descriptions of community functional and lineage distributions across space hamper the accurate understanding of coexistence mechanisms. We combined environmental variables and geographic space to explore how traits and lineages are filtered by environmental factors using extended RLQ and fourth-corner analyses across different spatial scales. The dispersion patterns of traits and lineages were also examined in a 20-ha tropical rainforest dynamics plot in southwest China. We found that environmental filtering was detected across all spatial scales except the largest scale (100 x 100 m). Generally, the associations between functional traits and environmental variables were more or less consistent across spatial scales. Species with high resource acquisition-related traits were associated with the resource-rich part of the plot across the different spatial scales, whereas resource-conserving functional traits were distributed in limited-resource environments. Furthermore, we found phylogenetic and functional clustering at all spatial scales. Similar functional strategies were also detected among distantly related species, suggesting that phylogenetic distance is not necessarily a proxy for functional distance. In summary, environmental filtering considerably structured the trait and lineage assemblages in this species-rich tropical rainforest.

AB Environmental conservation is increasingly operated through partnerships among state, private, and civil society actors, yet little is known empirically about how such collectives function and with what livelihood and governance outcomes. The landscape approach to conservation (known also as the ecosystem approach) is one such hybrid governance platform. Implemented worldwide over the past decade by international NGOs, the landscape approach employs the 'ecosystem principles' of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In spite of its prominence as a conservation and development strategy, little political ecology scholarship has considered the landscape approach. This article offers a case study of a conservation landscape in the Congo Basin, the Tri-National de la Sangha (TNS), which connects tropical forests in Cameroon, Republic of Congo, and Central African Republic. Led by NGOs, the TNS has since 2001 relied on partnerships among logging companies, safari hunters, the state, and local communities. Although the landscape approach purports to facilitate re-negotiations of user rights, resource access patterns in the TNS appear to have molded to pre-existing power relations. Rather than incorporating local concerns and capabilities into management, local knowledge is discredited and livelihoods are marginalized. As a result, management occurs through spatially-demarcated zones, contrasting the fluidity of interactions among diverse groups: both human (loggers, hunter-gatherers, safari guides, NGOs) and non-human (trees, elephants). These findings are situated within a burgeoning literature on neoliberal environmental governance, and suggest that ensuring ecologically and socially positive outcomes will require careful and iterative attention to linkages between ecological processes and evolving power dynamics.

AB Soil erosion threatens both soil and water resources and has increased globally because of the removal of natural vegetation and the intensification of existing agriculture. Brazil is privileged by a large proportion of natural vegetation and abundant freshwater. Recently, modifications of the Brazilian Forest Act (BFA) have been approved, which offer landowners that had committed illegal riparian deforestation in the past amnesty from reforestation, and further reductions of riparian protected areas are currently discussed. Here, we used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to simulate river discharge and sediment exports in a typical human-impacted Brazilian catchment, the Rio das Mortes catchment. By restoring the riparian vegetation according to the BFA and ignoring amnesties to land owners, the current annual sediment export of the catchment of 0.830 t ha(-1) was reduced by 29.4% according to our model. Further, simulated reforestation twice the size demanded by the BFA resulted in a 31.4% reduction of the current sediment export. However, reforestation of a 5-m homogeneous riparian corridor only, as currently discussed in the Federal Brazilian State of Sao Paulo, reduced sediment exports by only 23.8%, not considering expected additional erosion due to deforestation outside the simulated reforested 5-m corridor. Our study is the first catchment-wide assessment of the role of riparian vegetation in preventing soil erosion in Brazil. Its results support intensive reforestation efforts of the riparian zone and point to substantial negative effects of further reductions of the protected riparian corridor width and amnesties from reforestation to land owners.

AB Evaluating community assembly through the use of functional traits is a promising tool for testing predictions arising from Niche and Coexistence theories. Although interactions among neighboring species and their inter-specific differences are known drivers of coexistence with a strong spatial signal, assessing the role of individual species on the functional structure of the community at different spatial scales remains a challenge. Here, we ask whether individual species exert a measurable effect on the spatial organization of different functional traits in local assemblages. We first propose and compute two functions that describe different aspects of functional trait organization around individual species at multiple scales: individual weighted mean area relationship and individual functional diversity area relationship. Secondly, we develop a conceptual model on the relationship and simultaneous variation of these two metrics, providing five alternative scenarios in response to the ability of some target species to modify its neighbor environment and the possible assembly mechanisms involved. Our results show that some species influence the spatial structure of specific functional traits, but their effects were always restricted to the finest spatial scales. In the basis of our conceptual model, the observed patterns point to two main mechanisms driving the functional structure of the community at the fine scale, "biotic" filtering meditated by individual species and resource partitioning driven by indirect facilitation rather than by competitive mechanisms.

AB The interplay between evolution and ecological communities is critical for the integration of different levels of biological organization. Recent work has begun to unveil the importance of plant phenotypic plasticity and plant-herbivore (co) evolution to link plant evolution and associated insect communities. Specifically, herbivore-induced plant traits (i.e., plastic phenotypes) have significant effects on the structure and diversity of herbivore communities, which can in turn promote the evolution of not only the focal plant but also insect community members. Here, I will provide a conceptual framework on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of plant-herbivore communities to understand how biological organizations are integrated in plant-insect interactions. Research on eco-evolutionary dynamics of plant-herbivore communities will undoubtedly enrich understanding of a wide range of plant-insect interactions.

AB In order to compare the effectiveness of diurnal and nocturnal pollinators, we studied the reproductive biology and pollinators of Tillandsia heterophylla E. Morren, an epiphytic tank bromeliad endemic to southeastern Mexico. Since anthesis in T. heterophylla is predominantly nocturnal but lasts until the following day, we hypothesised that this bromeliad would receive visits from both diurnal and nocturnal visitors, but that nocturnal visitors would be the most effective pollinators, since they arrive first to the receptive flower, and that bats would be the most frequent nocturnal visitors, given the characteristics of the nectar. Flowering of T. heterophylla began in May and lasted until July. The species is fully self-compatible, with an anthesis that lasts for ca. 15-16 h. Mean volume of nectar produced per flower was 82.21 mu l, with a mean sugar concentration of 6.33%. The highest volume and concentration of nectar were found at 20: 00 h, with a subsequent decline in both to almost zero over the following 12-h period. T. heterophylla has a generalist pollination system, since at least four different morphospecies of visitors pollinate its flowers: bats, moths, hummingbirds and bees. Most of the pollinating visits corresponded to bats and took place in the early evening, when stigma receptivity had already begun; making bats the probable pollinator on most occasions. However, diurnal pollinators may be important as a 'fail-safe' system by which to guarantee the pollination of T. heterophylla.

AB Consistent forest loss estimates are important to understand the role of forest loss and deforestation in the global carbon cycle, for biodiversity studies, and to estimate the mitigation potential of reducing deforestation. To date, most studies have relied on optical satellite data and new efforts have greatly improved our quantitative knowledge on forest dynamics. However, most of these studies yield results for only a relatively short time period or are limited to certain countries. We have quantified large-scale forest loss over a 21-year period (1990-2010) in the tropical biomes of South America using remotely sensed vegetation optical depth (VOD). This passive microwave satellite-based indicator of vegetation water content and vegetation density has a much coarser spatial resolution than optical data but its temporal resolution is higher and VOD is not impacted by aerosols and cloud cover. We used the merged VOD product of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) observations, and developed a change detection algorithm to quantify spatial and temporal variations in forest loss dynamics. Our results compared reasonably well with the newly developed Landsat-based Global Forest Change (GFC) maps, available for the 2001 onwards period (r(2) = 0.90 when comparing annual country-level estimates). This allowed us to convert our identified changes in VOD to forest loss area and compute these from 1990 onwards. We also compared these calibrated results to PRODES (r(2) = 0.60 when comparing annual state-level estimates). We found that South American forest exhibited substantial interannual variability without a clear trend during the 1990s, but increased from 2000 until 2004. After 2004, forest loss decreased again, except for two smaller peaks in 2007 and 2010. For a large part, these trends were driven by changes in Brazil, which was responsible for 56% of the total South American forest loss area over our study period according to our results. One of the key findings of our study is that while forest loss decreased in Brazil after 2005, increases in other countries partly offset this trend suggesting that South American forest loss as a whole decreased much less than that in Brazil.

AB Habitat complexity is a major determinant of structure and diversity of ant assemblages. Following the size-grain hypothesis, smaller ant species are likely to be advantaged in more complex habitats compared to larger species. Habitat complexity can act as an environmental filter based on species size and morphological traits, therefore affecting the overall structure and diversity of ant assemblages. In natural and semi-natural ecosystems, habitat complexity is principally regulated by ecological successions or disturbance such as fire and grazing. Urban ecosystems provide an opportunity to test relationships between habitat, ant assemblage structure and ant traits using novel combinations of habitat complexity generated and sustained by human management. We sampled ant assemblages in low-complexity and high-complexity parks, and high-complexity woodland remnants, hypothesizing that (i) ant abundance and species richness would be higher in high-complexity urban habitats, (ii) ant assemblages would differ between low-and high-complexity habitats and (iii) ants living in high-complexity habitats would be smaller than those living in low-complexity habitats. Contrary to our hypothesis, ant species richness was higher in low-complexity habitats compared to high-complexity habitats. Overall, ant assemblages were significantly different among the habitat complexity types investigated, although ant size and morphology remained the same. Habitat complexity appears to affect the structure of ant assemblages in urban ecosystems as previously observed in natural and semi-natural ecosystems. However, the habitat complexity filter does not seem to be linked to ant morphological traits related to body size.

AB Deforestation and fragmentation influence the microclimate, vegetation structure, and composition of remaining patches of tropical forest. In the southern Amazon, at the frontier of cropland expansion, forests are converted and fragmented in a pattern that leaves standing riparian forests whose dimensions are mandated by the Brazilian National Forest Code. These altered riparian forests share many characteristics of well-studied upland forest fragments, but differ because they remain connected to larger areas of forest downstream, and because they may experience wetter soil conditions because reduction of forest cover in the surrounding watershed raises groundwater levels and increases stream runoff. We compared forest regeneration, structure, composition, and diversity in four areas of intact riparian forest and four areas each of narrow, medium, and wide altered riparian forests that have been surrounded by agriculture since the early 1980s. We found that seedling abundance was reduced by as much as 64% and sapling abundance was reduced by as much as 67% in altered compared to intact riparian forests. The most pronounced differences between altered and intact forest occurred near forest edges and within the narrowest sections of altered riparian forests. Woody plant species composition differed and diversity was reduced in altered forests compared to intact riparian forests. However, despite being fragmented for several decades, large woody plant biomass and carbon storage, the number of live or dead large woody plants, mortality rates, and the size distribution of woody plants did not differ significantly between altered and intact riparian forests. Thus, even in these relatively narrow forests with high edge : area ratios, we saw no evidence of the increases in mortality and declines in biomass that have been found in other tropical forest fragment studies. However, because of the changes in both species community and reduced regeneration, it is unclear how long this relative lack of change will be sustained. Additionally, Brazil recently passed a law in their National Forest Code allowing narrower riparian buffers than those studied here in restored areas, which could affect their long-term sustainability.

AB Few examples of mesopredator release, whereby subordinate predators increase in abundance in response to a reduction in dominant predators, have been demonstrated from reptile communities despite the important ecological role of large varanids and snakes. We tested the hypothesis that trophic cascades attributable to mesopredator release of varanids could explain the apparently perverse decline of some small reptiles following removal of exotic mammalian predators in a landscape-scale reserve in arid South Australia. We used counts of Sand Goanna (Varanus gouldii) tracks and diggings as a surrogate activity index in paddock-scale treatments with different assemblages of feral predators and reintroduced mammals. Varanus gouldii activity was five times higher in regions where cats and foxes were removed than where they were present. We hypothesize that the suppression of mammalian predators can have complex effects that extend to reptile communities and should inform conservation management decisions in environments with large reptile predators.

AB Deforestation is a widely recognized problem in the Brazilian Amazon. Small farmers play a key role in this process in that they earn their livelihood by ranching and farming. Many studies have addressed the link between deforestation and livelihood strategies adopted by small farmers. Most have focused on advanced monitoring systems, simulation models, and GIS approaches to analyze the interaction of both dimensions, i.e., livelihoods and forest cover change. Although the current toolbox of methods has proved successful in increasing our understanding of these interactions, the models and approaches employed do not consider small farmers' perspectives. On the assumption that local small farmers are agents of land-cover change, understanding how they perceive their own situation is essential to elucidate their actions. Our objective is to explore future changes in livelihood security and environmental sustainability as envisaged by local small farmers in the Brazilian Amazon. Previous livelihood cluster analysis of small farmers located in southeast Para was integrated with fuzzy cognitive mapping to determine present perceptions and to explore future changes, using global scenarios downscaled to the local situation. Overall, system description differs only on details; all results indicate a strong trade-off between livelihood security and environmental sustainability in all livelihood systems, as identified by the small farmers. However, fundamentally different outcomes are obtained from the future analysis, depending on the livelihood strategy cluster. Achieving win-win outcomes does not necessarily imply a positive scenario, especially if small farmers are dependent on income transfers from the government to provide their livelihood.

   FUTURE; MODIS
AB Fires are used as a tool in the deforestation process. Yet, the relationship between fire and deforestation may vary temporally and spatially depending on the type of deforestation and climatic conditions. This study evaluates spatiotemporal dynamics of deforestation and fire represented by burned area over the 2002-2012 period in the Brazilian Legal Amazon. As a first step, we compared newly available Landsat-based maps of gross forest cover loss from the Global Forest Change (GFC) project with maps of deforestation extent from the Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project (PRODES) produced by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE). As a second step, we rescaled the Landsat-based data to the 500m resolution of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burned area data (MCD64A1) and stratified this using MODIS land cover data to study the role of burned area in forest cover loss and deforestation. We found that while GFC forest cover loss and PRODES deforestation generally agreed on spatial and temporal dynamics, there were several key differences between the data sets. Both showed a decrease in the extent of forest cover loss or deforestation after 2004, but the drop was larger and more continuous in PRODES than in GFC. The observed decrease in forest cover loss or deforestation rates over our study period was mainly due to lower clearing rates in the evergreen broadleaf forests in the states of Mato Grosso, Para, and Rondonia. GFC indicated anomalously high forest cover loss in the years 2007 and 2010, which was not reported by PRODES. The burned area data indicated that this was predominantly related to increased burned area occurring outside of the tropical forest area during these dry years, mainly in Para. This indicated that fire and forest loss dynamics in woodlands or secondary forests may be equally important as deforestation in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In addition to the decrease in forest cover loss rates, we also found that post-deforestation fire use declined; burned area within 5 years after forest cover loss decreased from 54 to 39% during our study period.

AB Foliar elemental concentrations are predictors of life-history variation and contribute to spatial patterns in biogeochemical cycling. We examined the contributions of habitat association, local soil environment, and elemental interactions to variation in foliar elemental concentrations in tropical trees using methods that account for phylogeny. We sampled top-soils and leaves of 58 tropical trees in heath forest (HF) on nutrient-poor sand and mixed dipterocarp forest (MDF) on nutrient-rich clay soils. A phylogenetic generalized least squares method was used to determine how foliar nutrient and aluminium (Al) concentrations varied in response to habitat distribution, soil chemistry and other elemental concentrations. Foliar nitrogen (N) and Al concentrations were greater for specialists of MDF than for specialists of HF, while foliar calcium (Ca) concentrations showed the opposite trend. Foliar magnesium (Mg) concentrations were lower for generalists than for MDF specialists. Foliar element concentrations were correlated with fine-scale variation in soil chemistry in phylogenetically controlled analyses across species, but there was limited within-species plasticity in foliar elemental concentrations. Among Al accumulators, foliar Al concentration was positively associated with foliar Ca and Mg concentrations, and negatively associated with foliar phosphorus (P) concentrations. The Al-accumulation trait and relationships between foliar elemental and Al concentrations may contribute to species habitat partitioning and ecosystem-level differences in biogeochemical cycles.

AB The Brazilian Amazon is under threat from more frequent and intense forest fires, with a few studies showing negative consequences for forest integrity and the biodiversity. However, the impacts of this disturbance on tropical forests remain mostly unknown. We investigate the impacts of forest fires on community parameters and biomass of dung beetles, a cost-effective indicator of disturbance and overall biodiversity, in the northern Brazilian Amazon. Our results indicate that burned forests harbor a modified dung beetle community, with altered abundance, community composition, and structure. Burned forest samples had lower total biomass and were dominated by small-bodied dung beetles. Large-bodied tunneler species were negatively impacted, responding to changes in environmental characteristics such as soil compaction. Lower biomass and higher predominance of smaller species in burned forest is likely to impact dung beetle-mediated ecological functions, such as nutrient cycling and seed dispersal. Our results support that forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon pose a serious threat to local biodiversity and habitat integrity.

AB For niche differences to maintain coexistence of sympatric species, each species must grow and/or survive better than each of the others in at least one set of conditions (i.e., performance trade-offs). However, the extent of niche differentiation in tropical forests remains highly debated. We present the first test of performance trade-offs for wild seedlings in a tropical forest. We measured seedling relative growth rate (RGR) and survival of four common native woody species across 18 light, substrate, and topography microhabitats over 2.5 years within Hawaiian montane wet forest, an ideal location due to its low species diversity and strong species habitat associations. All six species pairs exhibited significant performance trade-offs across microhabitats and for RGR versus survival within microhabitats. We also found some evidence of performance equivalence, with species pairs having similar performance in 26% of comparisons across microhabitats. Across species, survival under low light was generally positively associated with RGR under high light. When averaged over all species, topography (slope, aspect, and elevation) explained most of the variation in RGR attributable to microhabitat variables (51-53%) followed by substrate type (35-37%) and light (11-12%). However, the relative effects of microhabitat differed among species and RGR metric (i.e., RGR for height, biomass, or leaf area). These findings indicate that performance trade-offs among species during regeneration are common in low-diversity tropical forest, although other mechanisms may better explain the coexistence of species with small performance differences.

AB Community ecologists use functional groups based on the rarely tested assumption that within-group responses to ecological processes are similar and thus members are functionally equivalent. However, recent research suggests that functional equivalency may break down with human impacts. We tested the equivalency assumption and model predictions of responses to simulated human alterations in nutrients and large herbivores for two models of coral reef algae, the Relative Dominance Model (RDM) and the Functional Group Model (FGM). Results of both mesocosm and field experiments using assembled communities were compared to model predictions, and within- and between-group variability were assessed. Both models' predictions of group response to herbivory matched experimental outcomes, but only the RDM predicted response to nutrients. However, within-group variability was dramatic, because the RDM grouped species with opposite responses to herbivory and the FGM grouped species with unique responses to nutrients. These heterogeneous responses resulted in loss of information and masked strong interactions between herbivory and nutrients that were not included in the models. As humans continue to impact major ecological processes in ecosystems globally, we postulate that functional-group models may need to be reformulated to account for shifting baselines.

AB Ants are highly influential organisms in terrestrial ecosystems, including the tallgrass prairie, one of the most endangered ecosystems in North America. Through their tunneling, ants affect soil properties and resource availability for animals and plants. Ants also have important ecological roles as consumers of plant tissue and seeds. In the last several decades, various organizations, agencies, and agricultural producers have attempted to create wildlife habitat or reduce soil erosion by seeding thousands of hectares of bare cropland in the central United States with tallgrass prairie seed mixes. Although initially, monitoring of these restorations and of unplowed prairie remnants focused on plants and birds, in recent years the response of invertebrates such as ants has increasingly been the subject of research. An understanding of tallgrass prairie ant communities can help land managers and scientists better monitor the ecological condition of tallgrass prairie and guide management and restoration efforts. Here I review our current knowledge of ant species found within tallgrass prairie, their ecological roles, and their response to management.

ID NORTH-KOREA; TRANSITION; SOUTH
AB Since the early 1990s, sustainable forest management (SFM) has emerged as a paradigm of forest management on global, regional and national levels. In developing countries, avoiding deforestation is a preliminary step towards SFM. The Korean peninsula experienced severe deforestation and forest degradation after the Korean War (1950-1953). In the 1970s and 1980s, South Korea achieved forest restoration through the National Greening Program. In contrast, North Korea failed to restore forests in spite of continuous trials with forest restoration plans. In North Korea, deforestation has accelerated since the mid-1980s. Deforestation and forest degradation in North Korea threatens stability throughout the Korean peninsula. This study focuses on comparing the forest policy and laws of South Korea and North Korea and suggesting forest policy that promotes sustainability in the Korean peninsula. The research findings can provide developing countries with significant information on forest policy and laws to avoid deforestation and forest degradation and move towards sustainability.

AB Most large reserves in Brazil do not hold viable populations of jaguars to guarantee the species' long-term survival. Corridors linking populations have been identified as a potential tool to avoid negative effects of isolation, increasing population viability. Here, we performed a Brazil-wide evaluation of potential large scale corridors connecting protected jaguar populations. Six variables (human population size, dam reservoir size, number of dams, roads, railways and cities) expected to negatively impact jaguar movement were analyzed across 180 potential corridors connecting 298 protected jaguar areas. We established overall disturbance scores for the corridors using a principal components analysis and compared them among the Brazilian biomes. We further investigated which variables separated biomes using a canonical variates analysis. The Atlantic Forest and the semi-arid Caatinga have the most impacted potential corridors, whereas the Amazon and Pantanal still have the best potential corridors. Corridor quality in the Cerrado grasslands was intermediate. All variables but human population size and corridor length contributed significantly to differences in corridor variables among biomes. Our conclusions suggest that we need to plan the implementation of large scale corridors in the Amazon, Pantanal and particularly the Cerrado soon, while potential corridors might still be economically viable. In the much more impacted Atlantic Forest and Caatinga, the need for conservation actions is strongest, but logistical difficulties and costs may turn implementation of corridors unfeasible.

AB Tall canopy trees produce many more seeds than do understory treelets, yet, on average, both classes of trees achieve the same lifetime fitness. Using concurrent data on seedfall (8 years) and sapling recruitment (12 years) from a long-established tree plot at the Cocha Cashu Biological Station in Peru, we show that a 40-m canopy tree must produce roughly 13 times the mass of seeds to generate a sapling as a 5-m understory treelet. Mature tree height accounted for 41% of the variance in seed mass per sapling recruit in a simple univariate regression, whereas a multivariate model that included both intrinsic (seed mass, tree height, and dispersal mode) and extrinsic factors (sapling mortality as a surrogate for microsite quality) explained only 31% of the variance in number of seeds per sapling recruit. The multivariate model accounted for less variance because tall trees produce heavier seeds, on average, than treelets. We used "intact" (mostly dispersed) seeds to parameterize the response variable so as to reduce, if not eliminate, any contribution of conspecific crowding to the difference in reproductive efficiency between canopy trees and treelets. Accordingly, a test for negative density dependence failed to expose a relationship between density of reproductive trees in the population and reproductive efficiency (seed mass per recruit). We conclude that understory treelets, some of which produce only a dozen seeds a year, gain their per-seed advantage by failing to attract enemies a la Janzen-Connell, either in ecological or evolutionary time.

AB This essay addresses the conservation issues facing mangroves in the Anthropocene, defined as the era of human domination over the world. We review the laws, policies, international agreements, and local actions that address the conservation of mangrove forests in the Neotropics and relate them to the Anthropocene. Collaboration between governments, non-governmental organizations, and communities that depend on mangroves for their livelihood will be critical in the Anthropocene. The essay also reviews recent developments in mangrove ecology and ecophysiology that enlighten how mangroves might respond to changes in temperature and rainfall, sea level rise, and other anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Mangroves in the Anthropocene will also face changes in their species composition given the current movement of mangroves species across continental barriers as a result of human activity. These trends will lead to novel mangrove forests and in some cases expand the range of mangroves worldwide. The solution to mangrove persistence in the Anthropocene is not to isolate mangroves from people, but to regulate interactions between mangroves and humans through effective management. We will also have to expand the scope of the ecological analysis of mangrove ecosystems to include the social forces converging on the mangroves through an analytical approach that has been termed Social Ecology.

AB Invasive species usually colonize canopy gaps in tropical and subtropical forests, which results in a loss of native species. Therefore, an understanding of the location and distribution of canopy gaps will assist in predicting the occurrence of invasive species in such canopy gaps. We tested the utility of WorldView-2 (WV-2) with eight spectral bands at 2 m spatial resolution to delineate forest canopy gaps in a subtropical Dukuduku coastal forest in South Africa. We compared the four conventional visible-near-infrared bands with the eight-band WV-2 image. The eight-band WV-2 image yielded a higher overall accuracy of 86.90% (kappa coefficient = 0.82) than the resampled conventional four-band image that yielded an overall accuracy of 74.64% (kappa coefficient = 0.63) in pixel-based classification. We further compared the vegetation indices that were derived from four conventional bands with those derived from WV-2 bands. The enhanced vegetation index yielded the highest overall accuracy in the category of conventional indices (85.59% at kappa coefficient = 0.79), while the modified plant senescence reflectance index involving the red-edge band showed the highest overall accuracy (93.69%) in the category of indices derived from eight-band WV-2 imagery in object-based classification. Overall, the study shows that the unique high-resolution WV-2 data can improve the delineation of canopy gaps as compared to the conventional multispectral bands.

AB With growing concern surrounding global pollinator declines, it is important to understand how habitat destruction and agricultural intensification impact pollinator communities. Euglossine bees are tropical forest-dependent pollinators responsible for pollination of both economically important crops and wild plant species. A growing body of work has focused on the effect of habitat fragmentation on euglossine bees, yet little is known about how these bees are impacted by agricultural intensification. Coffee cultivation is widespread in the tropics, and its management is conducted along a gradient of intensity, which ranges from monoculture (i.e., no shade, high inputs) to polyculture (shade overstory retained, fewer inputs). We used a landscape in Soconusco, Chiapas, Mexico, that allowed for comparison between monoculture and polyculture coffee farms, while holding distance to native habitat, as well as native habitat quality, constant. We found that habitat management influenced abundance, estimated richness, and community composition of euglossine bees. The polyculture coffee farm boasts a more similar community composition to the forest than to the monoculture coffee farm. In addition, the polyculture farm had almost double the euglossine abundance compared with the monoculture farm. Our results suggest that coffee management regimes may strongly impact euglossine communities and that less intensive polyculture approaches may mitigate species losses of this important group of pollinators.

AB QuestionsSpecies-habitat associations may contribute to the maintenance of species richness in tropical forests, but previous research has been conducted almost exclusively in lowland forests and has emphasized the importance of topography and edaphic conditions. Is the distribution of woody plant species in a Peruvian cloud forest determined by microhabitat conditions? What is the role of environmental characteristics and forest structure in habitat partitioning in a tropical cloud forest?
   LocationCloud Forest, north Peruvian Andes.
   MethodsWe examined species-habitat associations in three 1-ha plots using the torus-translation method. We used three different criteria to define habitats for habitat partitioning analyses, based on microtopography, forest structure and both sets of factors. The number of species associated either positively or negatively with each habitat was assessed.
   ResultsHabitats defined on the basis of environmental conditions and forest structure discriminated a greater number of positive and negative associations at the scale of our analyses in a tropical cloud forest.
   ConclusionsBoth topographic conditions and forest structure contribute to small-scale microhabitat partitioning of woody plant species in a Peruvian tropical cloud forest. Nevertheless, canopy species were most correlated with the distribution of environmental variables, while understorey species displayed associations with forest structure.

AB The coexistence of forest tree species has often been linked to differences among species in terms of their response to light availability during the regeneration stage. From this perspective, species coexistence results from growthgrowth or mortalitygrowth trade-offs along spatial light gradients. Experimental evidence of growthgrowth trade-offs in natural conditions is sparse due to various confounding factors that potentially hinder the relationship. This study examined growth hierarchies along light gradients between two tree species with contrasting shade tolerance by controlling potential confounding factors such as seedling size, seedling status, seedling density and species composition.
   Natural regenerated shade-tolerant Fagus sylvatica and shade-intermediate Quercus petraea seedlings were used, and growth rankings over a 4-year period were compared in 8- to 10-year-old tree seedlings.
   No rank reversal occurs between the two species along the light gradient, or along the density, mixture or seedling size gradients. The shade-tolerant species was always the more competitive of the two. Pronounced effects of initial size on seedling growth were observed, whereas the effects of light and competition by neighbours were of secondary importance. The paramount effect of size, which results from the asymmetric nature of interseedling competition, gives a strong advantage to tall seedlings over the long term.
   This study extends previous efforts to identify potential drivers of rank reversals in young tree mixtures. It does not support the classical assumption that spatial heterogeneity in canopy opening explains the coexistence of the two species studied. It suggests that spatial variation in local size hierarchies among seedlings that may be caused by seedling emergence time or seedling initial performance is the main driver of the dynamics of these mixed stands.

AB In habitat mosaics, plant populations face environmental heterogeneity over short geographical distances. Such steep environmental gradients can induce ecological divergence. Lowland rainforests of the Guiana Shield are characterized by sharp, short-distance environmental variations related to topography and soil characteristics (from waterlogged bottomlands on hydromorphic soils to well-drained terra firme on ferralitic soils). Continuous plant populations distributed along such gradients are an interesting system to study intrapopulation divergence at highly local scales. This study tested (1) whether conspecific populations growing in different habitats diverge at functional traits, and (2) whether they diverge in the same way as congeneric species having different habitat preferences.
   Phenotypic differentiation was studied within continuous populations occupying different habitats for two congeneric, sympatric, and ecologically divergent tree species (Eperua falcata and E. grandiflora, Fabaceae). Over 3000 seeds collected from three habitats were germinated and grown in a common garden experiment, and 23 morphological, biomass, resource allocation and physiological traits were measured.
   In both species, seedling populations native of different habitats displayed phenotypic divergence for several traits (including seedling growth, biomass allocation, leaf chemistry, photosynthesis and carbon isotope composition). This may occur through heritable genetic variation or other maternally inherited effects. For a sub-set of traits, the intraspecific divergence associated with environmental variation coincided with interspecific divergence.
   The results indicate that mother trees from different habitats transmit divergent trait values to their progeny, and suggest that local environmental variation selects for different trait optima even at a very local spatial scale. Traits for which differentiation within species follows the same pattern as differentiation between species indicate that the same ecological processes underlie intra- and interspecific variation.

AB To improve our knowledge of how nutrient cycling in Mediterranean environments responds to climate change, we evaluated the effects of the continuous changes in soil nitrogen (N) pools during natural wetting and drying events. We measured soil N pools (microbial biomass [MB-N], dissolved organic nitrogen [DON], NH4+ and NO3-) and N ion exchange resins at weekly intervals for one year in two contrasting Mediterranean ecosystems. All soil N fractions in both ecosystems showed high intraseasonal and interseasonal variability that was greater in inorganic soil fractions than in organic N soil fractions. MB-N, DON and resin-NH4+ showed increased concentrations during wetting events. Only the soil NO3- and resin-NO3- showed the opposite trend, suggesting a different response to water pulses compared to the other soil variables. Our results show that N pools are continuously changing, and that this high variability is not associated with the total amount of organic matter and labile soil carbon (C) and N soil fractions found in each ecosystem. The highest variability was found for inorganic N forms, which suggests that organic N forms are more buffered in soils exposed to wetting-drying cycles. Our results suggest that the changes in wetting-drying cycles expected with global climate change may have a significant impact on the availability and turnover of organic and inorganic N.

AB Environmental conditions experienced by mother plants determine germination patterns. Here, we investigated the germination ecology of Miconia albicans (Melastomataceae), a widespread apomictic shrub, along a soil fertility gradient in the Brazilian Cerrado (a Neotropical savanna). The mosaic of vegetations in the Cerrado ranges from grasslands to woodlands, which present different conditions for seedling establishment. Cerrado grasslands are a more unpredictable environment because they are more prone to disturbances such as fires and prolonged droughts than closed woodlands. We expect lower reproductive investment but increasing germinability, germination speed and synchrony in areas with more dense vegetation, due to prolonged droughts in grasslands and higher soil properties in woodlands. Seeds of M. albicans were collected in grasslands, shrublands and woodlands for three years in a Cerrado area in southeastern Brazil. Seeds collected in all vegetations were set to germinate under identical experimental conditions. According to our prediction, we found a consistent pattern of increasing germinability, mean germination time and synchrony in areas with more closed vegetation. Both slower and asynchronous germination in seeds from grassland plants are likely to increase seedling survival under a more unpredictable environment. On the other hand, seeds from plants in the woodlands germinated at higher rates and germination was more synchronous, thus increases the chances of survival under a more competitive light-limited environment. This pattern was found in all three years of study. Our study suggests that stressful environmental conditions experienced by mother plants in the Cerrado may act as cues signalizing unfavourable conditions for seed germination and help explain functional divergence in germination traits within species. In conclusion, we showed for the first time a temporally consistent pattern of intraspecific variation in the germination traits of M. albicans, with different germination strategies at the extremes of the ecological gradient.

AB To predict the consequences of environmental change on the structure and composition of communities, it is necessary to also understand the regional drivers underlying the structuring of these communities. Here, we have taken a hypothesis-based approach to test the relative importance of niche versus neutral processes using niche overlap, species traits and population asynchrony in two crossed treatments of fertilization and grazing in an alpine meadow community. Our results suggested that the observed species biomass overlap was not significantly different between treatments of grazing, grazing x fertilization and grazer exclusion. In contrast, the species biomass overlap was higher than expected in fertilization treatments when grazers were excluded. On the one hand, we found no relationship between species traits and relative abundance in grazing, grazing x fertilization and grazer-exclusion treatments; on the other hand, mechanistic trait-based theory could be used to predict species relative abundance patterns in fertilization treatments when grazers were excluded. From grazing to fertilization, when grazers were excluded, there was a slight increase in species synchrony, which indicated that the complementary dynamic of species gradually changed from complete independence into synchronously fluctuating with increasing fertilization. Based on the above results, we concluded that stochastic and deterministic processes formed ends of a continuum from grazing to fertilization when grazers were excluded in an alpine meadow plant community, and the importance of niche differences between species in structuring grassland communities increased with increasing fertilization and decreased with grazing.

AB As Africa contributes some 64% of the global extent of area burnt annually, uncertainty concerning fire activity in the continent is an important issue. In this study, we quantify the effect of land-cover conversion from natural vegetation to agriculture on burnt area extent. This is based on the comparison of contemporary fire distribution in 189 protected areas where agricultural activity is largely absent with that occurring in the surrounding regions, where agriculture is practised. Results indicate a decrease in the total area burnt annually in Africa linked to the loss of natural vegetation communities due to expanding agricultural lands. Land-use change within the savanna vegetation units of Africa has led to a decrease in burnt area in the order of similar to 8 x 10(-5) ha year(-1), which corresponds to 0.4% of the area currently burnt in Africa. The resulting decrease in the quantity of biomass burnt in any year would be between 3.4 and 9 Tg, depending on the estimates of aboveground fuel biomass. Deforestation in the humid tropical forest domains may act as a small counterbalance to the trend of decreasing burnt area linked to land-use change in the short term.

AB We develop a hierarchical Bayesian model linking the abundance of individual phytoplankton species with over a decade (1995-2011) of environmental data from the Cariaco Ocean Time Series Program in the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela, to characterize how phytoplankton respond to environmental forcing. Temperature, salinity, irradiance, and macronutrient concentrations account for 39% of the variation in log cell abundance across 67 species. Individual phytoplankton taxa varied widely in their response to these environmental variables. A principal component analysis of the environmental response profiles clearly distinguishes the responses of diatoms and dinoflagellates to environmental forcing. Phytoplankton abundance primarily varied with temperature, pH, and irradiance, with salinity and macronutrient concentrations acting as secondary drivers. In the aggregate, our results demonstrate that environmental changes, whether short-term or a result of climate change, should be expected to have dramatic consequences on the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton communities.

   RESTORATION
AB Tropical forests are experiencing an increase in the proportion of secondary forests as a result of the balance between the widespread harvesting of old-growth forests and the regeneration in abandoned areas. The impacts of such a process on biodiversity are poorly known and intensely debated. Recent reviews and multi-taxa studies indicate that species replacement in wildlife assemblages is a consistent pattern, sometimes stronger than changes in diversity, with a replacement from habitat generalists to old-growth specialists being commonly observed during tropical forest regeneration. However, the ecological drivers of such compositional changes are rarely investigated, despite its importance in assessing the conservation value of secondary forests, and to support and guide management techniques for restoration. By sampling 28 sites in a continuous Atlantic forest area in Southeastern Brazil, we assessed how important aspects of habitat structure and food resources for wildlife change across successional stages, and point out hypotheses on the implications of these changes for wildlife recovery. Old-growth areas presented a more complex structure at ground level (deeper leaf litter, and higher woody debris volume) and higher fruit availability from an understorey palm, whereas vegetation connectivity, ground-dwelling arthropod biomass, and total fruit availability were higher in earlier successional stages. From these results we hypothetize that generalist species adapted to fast population growth in resource-rich environments should proliferate and dominate earlier successional stages, while species with higher competitive ability in resource-limited environments, or those that depend on resources such as palm fruits, on higher complexity at the ground level, or on open space for flying, should dominate older-growth forests. Since the identification of the drivers of wildlife recovery is crucial for restoration strategies, it is important that future work test and further develop the proposed hypotheses. We also found structural and functional differences between old-growth forests and secondary forests with more than 80 years of regeneration, suggesting that restoration strategies may be crucial to recover structural and functional aspects expected to be important for wildlife in much altered ecosystems, such as the Brazilian Atlantic forest.

AB We present a characterization of convective activity at sub-regional scale from two sets of satellite-based microwave observations: the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the combined Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) microwave imager and precipitation radar data, for the period 2001 to 2011. We focus on the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, located at the southern edge of the so-called "Legal Amazon" which has undergone intense land cover transformation in the last 4 decades. The annual cycle of mean convective activity described by AMSU and TRMM are in good agreement, with a correlation close to 0.80. The mean amplitude of convective activity is maximal early in the rainy season, except for AMSU deep convective area, which presents a maximum in January. The diurnal cycle of convection was examined for the period 2003 to 2007, and it was found that convection is maximal near 1500 local time (LT) and minimal around 0700 LT. Unlike the amplitude, the phase shows little intraseasonal and interannual variability. A slight decrease in convective activity in the studied period was found, possibly indicating an extension of the dry season. Comparisons of convective activity between deforested and forested areas showed no significant differences in the phase of the diurnal cycle, but our analysis shows a tendency for increase (decrease) in convection in deforested (forested) areas for the period considered. A longer time series is however necessary in order to strengthen the robustness of our results.

AB Questions: What are the relative effects of burning and herbivory on regrowth and physical and chemical defences in Acacia seedlings? Are effects of herbivory consistent with predictions of the resource availability hypothesis? Do plants growing with adequate resources regrow lost material while those with low resource availability defend themselves tominimize effects of herbivory? Location: Arboretum, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Methods: We performed a two- factor, completely randomized experiment on seven indigenous African Acacia ( Acacia erioloba, A. haematoxylon, A. karroo, A. nilotica, A. robusta, A. sieberiana and A. xanthophloea) with simulated burning using a blowtorch and simulated herbivory by cutting at the first node. We measured seedling regrowth, thorn length and number, and tannin content. Results: New stems were produced for all species. In all seven species, the control ( no fire, no herbivory) produced longer stems than other treatments. Simulated herbivory increased thorn abundance among Acacia species, while burning often led to decreased overall thorn length. Tannin analysis revealed positive and negative responses of individual species to burning and herbivory. Conclusions: We demonstrate that Acacia seedlings are tolerant of disturbance events such as herbivory and burning but these effects cannot be assumed to be substitutable. Importantly, there was a positive response to simulated herbivory and a negative response to fire in most species. The mechanisms behind these changes appear to be mediated by induction of defence responses ( resulting in a positive response to herbivory) and a cost for root storage ( resulting in reduced defences after fire). Only A. robusta displayed regrowth and defence responses consistent with predictions of the resource availability hypothesis. In contrast, the two arid- adapted species invested heavily in regrowth but not in defence, while four of the fivemesic species invested in increased defence.

AB The protection of areas that shelter high evolutionary diversity represented by geographically and phylogenetically isolated lineages is becoming an important conservation strategy. Nevertheless, the spatial distribution of this component of biodiversity is still unknown for most groups, which limits its application for selecting priority areas to conserve. In the present study, we reconstructed the phylogeny of Minaria (Apocynaceae) based on plastid (trnH-psbA, rps16, trnS-trnG and trnD-trnT) and nuclear (ITS and ETS) DNA markers and 34 morphological characters, and analysed the geographic distribution of the phylogenetic diversity (PD) and endemism (PE) in this genus. Minaria includes 21 species that are highly concentrated in the Espinhaco Range, in eastern Brazil, most of which (similar to 75%) are narrowly distributed. The spatial analyses of PD and PE of Minaria indicate four evolutionary relevant areas in this region. The Serra do Cipo and the Diamantina Plateau contain 10 endemic species and present the highest levels of PD. However, the two other areas also deserve special attention. Rio de Contas has high levels of PE, because of two endemic sister species that represent a phylogenetically isolated lineage and the Southern Espinhaco Range houses the most critically endangered species of the genus. Most endemic species of Minaria occur in vegetation islands on rocky outcrops (campos rupestres). These low-fuel areas are less susceptible to fire, suggesting that the Espinhaco Range has served as a historical refuge for fire-sensitive lineages. Our results suggest that conservation units in the Espinhaco Range cover a great proportion of the evolutionary diversity of Minaria and that fire management is probably an important strategy to preserve this endemic biodiversity.

AB 1 . Community assembly theories predict that the success of invading species into a new community should be predictable by functional traits. Environmental filters could constrain the number of successful ecological strategies in a habitat, resulting in similar suites of traits between native and successfully invading species (convergence). Conversely, concepts of limiting similarity and competitive exclusion predict native species will prevent invasion by functionally similar exotic species, resulting in trait divergence between the two species pools. Nutrient availability may further alter the strength of convergent or divergent forces in community assembly, by relaxing environmental constraints and/or influencing competitive interactions.
   2. To investigate how nutrient availability influences forces of divergence and convergence during the invasion of exotic species into native communities, we conducted multivariate analyses of community composition and functional traits from naturally assembled plant communities in long-term nitrogen (N) addition experiments across North America.
   3. Relative abundances of key functional traits differed between the native and exotic plant communities, consistent with limiting similarity or a trait bias in the exotic species pool. Environmental context also played an important role in invasion because sites varied in the identity of the traits that predicted dissimilarity between native and exotic communities. Nitrogen enrichment did not alter these patterns.
   4. Nitrogen enrichment tended to increase exotic abundance, but this result was driven by a dramatic increase in exotics in only a few experiments. When similarity between native and exotic communities was included in the statistical model, N enrichment no longer predicted an increase in exotic relative abundance. Instead, sites with the highest abundance of exotic species were the ones where native and exotic communities had the highest trait similarity.
   5. Synthesis. Our analysis of natural patterns of invasion across herbaceous communities in North America found evidence of both divergent and convergent forces on community assembly with exotic species. Together, these results suggest that while functionally dissimilar exotic species may be more likely to invade, they are unlikely to become abundant unless they have traits pre-adapting them to environmental conditions in their invaded range. Contrary to prior studies, invasion was not consistently promoted by N enrichment.

TI The SAFE index: using a threshold population target to measure relative

SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID EXTINCTION; BIODIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; LOSSES; CRISIS
AB The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List is arguably the most popular measure of relative species threat, but its threat categories can be ambiguous (eg "Endangered" versus "Vulnerable") and subjective, have weak quantification, and do not convey the threat status of species in relation to a minimum viable population target. We propose a heuristic measure that describes a "species' ability to forestall extinction", or the SAFE index. We compare the abilities of the SAFE index with those of another numerically explicit metric - percentage range loss - to predict IUCN threat categories using binary and ordinal logistic regression. Generalized linear models showed that the SAFE index was a better predictor of IUCN threat categories than was percentage range loss. We therefore advocate use of the SAFE index, possibly in conjunction with IUCN threat categories, because the former indicates the "distance from extinction" of a species, while implicitly incorporating population viability as a variable.

AB Ant assemblages are focal ecological indicators of progress in mine-site restoration, often showing increasing species richness with restoration age. Certain functional groups also behave in predictable ways in response to disturbance and changes in the environment. Whether these ant responses can be applied to other types of restoration and ecosystems is unknown, especially in dynamic environments and where gradients may not be as severe as in mine-site restoration. Ant assemblages would be expected to perform poorly as ecological indicators in dynamic environments because such environs are subject to periodic disturbance of important habitat features. Indeed, periodic disturbance may limit the predictive power of any ecological indicator. In this study, we trapped ants on two separate occasions to compare ant assemblages among four riparian habitat types (Unplanted grassland, Young revegetation, Older revegetation and Mature woodland). These habitat types were assumed to represent progressive stages of restoration. In contrast to the findings of others, species richness was variable among replicate locations of the same habitat type, and did not differ among the four habitat types. Also in contrast to what others have found for functional groups, dolichoderines were equally abundant in all habitat types and did not decrease in abundance with vegetation maturity. While generalized myrmicines and opportunists became more common with maturation of the vegetation, they did not replace dolichoderines as the most common ants. Surprisingly, the relative abundance of Subordinate Camponotini, a functional group considered to be of limited use in discriminating structural types, increased across the restoration gradient. There were also fairly distinct species assemblages associated with unplanted grassland and mature woodland. Communities in revegetated habitats were intermediate of these extremes, suggesting there is a level of predictiveness to their response to revegetation in this system. While species richness and a functional group approach would be of little use in this environment, species composition would provide a useful gauge of restoration progress. Ant species richness and functional group metrics have repeatedly been advocated as ecological indicators. Given our results, we caution against the blind application of metrics that have not been validated in the context in which they are to be applied. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Habitat fragmentation is currently the most pervasive anthropogenic disturbance in tropical forests and some species of leaf-cutting ants of the genus Atta (dominant herbivores in the neotropics) have become hyperabundant in forest edges where their nests directly impact up to 6% of the forest area. Yet, their impacts on the regeneration dynamics of fragmented forests remain poorly investigated. Here we examine the potential of Atta cephalotes nests to function as ecological filters impacting tree recruitment. Growth, survival and biomass partitioning of experimentally planted seedlings (six tree species) were examined at eight spatially independent A. cephalotes colonies in a large Atlantic Forest fragment. Seedling performance and fate (leaf numbers and damage) were monitored up to 27 months across three habitats (nest centre, nest edge and forest understorey). Plants at illuminated nest centres showed twice the gross leaf gain as understorey individuals. Simultaneously, seedlings of all species lost many more leaves at nests than in the forest understorey, causing a negative net leaf gain. Net leaf gain in the shaded understorey ranged from zero (Licania and Thyrsodium species) to substantial growth for Copaifera and Virola, and intermediate levels little above zero for Protium and Pouteria. Also seedling survival differed across habitats and species, being typically low in the centre and at the edge of nests where seedlings were often completely defoliated by the ants. Lastly, seedling survival increased strongly with seed size at nest edges while there was no such correlation in the forest. Our results suggest that Atta nests operate as ecological filters by creating a specific disturbance regime that differs from other disturbances in tropical forests. Apparently, Atta nests favour large-seeded tree species with resprouting abilities and the potential to profit from a moderate, nestmediated increase in light availability.

AB KENZO T, YONEDA R, MATSUMOTO Y, MOHAMAD AZANI A & NIX MAJID M. 2011. Growth and photosynthetic response of four Malaysian indigenous tree species under different light conditions. Growth and photosynthetic response of four indigenous tree seedlings, i.e. Dyera costulata, Dipterocazpus baudii, Neobalanocarpus heimii and Gonystylus affinis were studied under different light conditions in a degraded secondary forest. Maximum photosynthesis (A(max)) was measured at 2 and 12 months after planting. The ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence (F-v/F-m) was determined. Leaves measured at 2 and 12 months after planting were old leaves present on the seedlings and new leaves that had expanded after planting respectively. Seedling growth was measured over four years. Changes in the growth rate and A(max) with canopy openness were categorised into two groups. The growth and A(max) of the first group (D. costulata and D. baudii) were maximum at 30-40% canopy openness. This group may be suitable for planting under large canopy gaps. The second group (G. affinis and N. heimii) showed maximum growth and A(max) at relatively low canopy openness (less than 20%). Leaves in the second group suffered chronic photoinhibition under large gap. These species were suitable to be planted under low light conditions.

AB Aim Our aim was to evaluate the extent to which we can predict and map tree alpha diversity across broad spatial scales either by using climate and remote sensing data or by exploiting spatial autocorrelation patterns.
   Location Tropical rain forest, West Africa and Atlantic Central Africa.
   Methods Alpha diversity estimates were compiled for trees with diameter at breast height >= 10 cm in 573 inventory plots. Linear regression (ordinary least squares, OLS) and random forest (RF) statistical techniques were used to project alpha diversity estimates at unsampled locations using climate data and remote sensing data [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Quick Scatterometer (QSCAT), tree cover, elevation]. The prediction reliabilities of OLS and RF models were evaluated using a novel approach and compared to that of a kriging model based on geographic location alone.
   Results The predictive power of the kriging model was comparable to that of OLS and RF models based on climatic and remote sensing data. The three models provided congruent predictions of alpha diversity in well-sampled areas but not in poorly inventoried locations. The reliability of the predictions of all three models declined markedly with distance from points with inventory data, becoming very low at distances > 50 km. According to inventory data, Atlantic Central African forests display a higher mean alpha diversity than do West African forests.
   Main conclusions The lower tree alpha diversity in West Africa than in Atlantic Central Africa may reflect a richer regional species pool in the latter. Our results emphasize and illustrate the need to test model predictions in a spatially explicit manner. Good OLS or RF model predictions from inventory data at short distance largely result from the strong spatial autocorrelation displayed by both the alpha diversity and the predictive variables rather than necessarily from causal relationships. Our results suggest that alpha diversity is driven by history rather than by the contemporary environment. Given the low predictive power of models, we call for a major effort to broaden the geographical extent and intensity of forest assessments to expand our knowledge of African rain forest diversity.

AB Interest in native species is growing across the tropics as reforestation of degraded lands becomes more widespread. In this study four tree species native to Panama - Cedrela odorata, Pachira quinata, Samanea saman, and Tabebuia rosea - were grown on rural farms at two dry tropical sites in Panama for up to five years. Survivorship and growth data at these "on-farm" trials are compared to data recorded from nearby experimental or "species selection" trial sites and evaluated in terms of soil fertility and management. Participant farmers were also asked about their interest in planting trees in general as well as their interest in 61 species grown in the species selection trial.
   Although, on-farm survivorship was variable and generally lower than that found on the species selection trial, one species (S. saman) experienced high and consistent survivorship. High survivorship combined with growth data from farms at both sites for this species suggests it would be a good candidate for extension projects working with rural farmers. Survivorship of other species appears more sensitive to farmer management and/or local site conditions. Generally lower growth on the Los Santos farms as compared to the species-selection trial is attributed to the lower soil fertility (plant available P) at the on-farm sites compared to the species selection trial. In contrast, only one species - P. quinata - had a growth variable found to be significantly lower between the on-farm and species selection trial sites in Rio Hato. C. odorata, P. quinata T. rosea can all be used in on-farm conditions with consideration to specific site and management conditions.
   By 2009, approximately 80% of the farmers planting trees still wished to participate in tree planting activities. All of the farmers no longer wishing to continue with the project expressed slow growth rates of trees as a principal reason. All but one of these farmers had growth rates for his/her trees markedly below those of the species selection trial nearby. Some farmers wishing to continue had very high mortality rates (>70% for all species), suggesting non-tangible benefits for participating in project activities. Other species that were not tested on-farm but grew well in the species-selection trials and were of interest to local farmers are discussed.
   As long as specific site and management conditions are carefully considered, data from species selection trials can be useful in informing tree planting projects with rural farmers; however, care should be taken to manage expectations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Light management and species light plasticity are critical factors for proper crop production in nurseries. So, to assess the light necessities of Rhamnus alaternus, which is a promising native evergreen Mediterranean shrub of ornamental and ecological interest, it was exposed to five shade levels (0%, 32%, 48%, 84% and 93%) for one year (0% of shade received annual mean maximum photosynthetic photon flux density [PPFD] of 1293 +/- 415 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) with a summer mean maximum PPFD of 1541 +/- 225 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) [mean +/- s.d.]). The treatments providing 84% and 94% shading produced less compact plants, with greater height and less stem diameter, greater specific leaf area and higher shoot/root index. In general, the shading produced dark green leaves except the 94% treatment, in which the leaves were lighter because the relative chlorophyll content was reduced. Leaf thickness was reduced in all the shading treatments compared with the control. The stomatal density and pore area were reduced with the 84% and 93% shading treatments, as was photosystem II (PSII) efficiency and the leaf soluble sugar content (falling to 60% of the control level); in contrast, non-photochemical quenching increased. The 93% treatment caused irreversible damages in PSII because dark-adapted PSII efficiency was reduced. The results show that solar radiation can be used as a tool to improve plant quality during the nursery period. We conclude that shading screens providing more than 84% shade are not recommendable in terms of photochemical activity, soluble sugar content and overall plant quality. Shading screens of 32% and 48% improve R. alaternus quality in spring and summer, respectively. As regards its interest as an understory species for reforestation programs, we also conclude that this shrub can be adapted to a wide range of shade intensities, although its proper development would be compromised in very strong shading conditions.

AB In the Amazonian basin, the human populations that traditionally inhabit the forest use its natural resources in various ways. One example is the local fauna which, among several other uses, is an important source of protein. The general aim of our study was to investigate the importance of hunting to the lives of the Amazonian riverine communities and to identify the multiple uses and knowledge about the hunted animals. In this article we focused the study on the razor-billed curassow Pauxi tuberosa, a Cracidae of significant value to the studied community. The investigation was conducted in the "Riozinho do Anfrisio Extractive Reserve", a Brazilian Conservation Unit located at the Altamira municipality, in the state of Para. We used an ethnoecological approach, which included participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Our results show that the razor-billed curassow is used by the "Riozinho do Anfrisio" local population mainly as food, but it also fulfils secondary functions, with the feathers being used as a domestic tool and as magic-religious symbol, some organs as traditional medicine, and some chicks even being raised as pets. Our study also revealed that the traditional ecological knowledge of the riverines about their environment is considerably large, and that the local biodiversity provides various ecosystem services.

AB The majority of bromeliad species are pollinated by vertebrates, mainly hummingbirds and bats. However, bees are among the most frequent visitors in some short-corolla species with ornithophilous features, but only few studies identified insects as pollinators of these bromeliads. The importance of visitors for pollination success in Aechmea caudata (Bromeliaceae) was determined through the frequency and pollination effectiveness (measured as seed set/single visit) of its visitors in a secondary Atlantic forest area in southern Brazil. Aechmea caudata is self-incompatible and therefore pollinator-dependent. A total of 16 species were recorded visiting their flowers. Bees were the most rich and frequent taxon (91% of 647 visits). Bombus mono was the most frequent species (41%). Although the floral features of A. caudata, such as scentless, tubular corollas, yellow and red flowers, and nectar secretion during the whole diurnal anthesis, are related to ornithophily, the single hummingbird species Thalurania glaucopis failed to pollinate the flowers. Its low frequency (2.5%)apparently did not promote the pollen flux between conspecific bromeliads. Pollination tests showed that no seeds developed after hummingbird visits. Seeds were formed only at flowers visited by B. monk). We discuss our findings by contrasting them with the results on the similar and sympatric A. lindenii and by emphasizing the importance of bees for pollination of bromeliads with short corolla. Our results show that pollination effectiveness together with frequency data are necessary to analyze the complex interactions between plants and their flower visitors. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

AB The extent of planted forests has greatly increased in the tropics, but their conservation value while assumed to be low, is largely unknown. We compared the density and microhabitat selection of a nocturnal arboreal primate, the Bengal slow loris (Nycticebus bengalensis), in mostly undisturbed, evergreen tropical forest to those in 15-18 year old Acacia/Leucaena plantations with significant secondary regrowth, and < 15 year old plantations with little regrowth. Based on estimates derived from distance sampling, loris densities in older plantations were nearly identical to primary forest (4.26 vs. 4.00 lorises per square kilometer), although encounter rates were three times higher in the older plantations probably owing to the lower detection probability in the more complex vegetation of the primary forest. The mean density estimate for the younger plantation was one-third of the above habitats (1.27 lorises per square kilometer), although not statistically different. Lorises tended to use larger diameter and taller trees, with a greater crown depth than randomly sampled trees, and tended to avoid habitats with sparsely crowned trees. The older plantations had trees with lower basal area and shorter stems than the primary forest; however, the older plantations contained higher densities of Bauhinia lianas, a commonly eaten food source and did not contain the red giant flying squirrel (Petaurista petaurista), a potential competitor. Although it is unknown whether the Bengal slow loris would persist without the presence of primary forest in the landscape, we suggest that older plantations have conservation value for at least selected species and as such, could be better managed to increase this value.

AB Biogenic structures produced by soil ecosystem engineers influence the soil architecture and mediate soil functions and ecosystem services. Ant mounds in meadow wetlands are important biogenic structures with the potential of altering carbon storage and nutrient cycling in these ecosystems. In this study, we examined the soil nutrient concentrations of ant mounds and their effects on the wetland nutrient storage functions in meadow wetlands of the Sanjiang Plain, in northeastern China. The aims of this study were to investigate C, N and P variation in active ant mounds produced by Formica sanguinea Latreille and Lasius flavus Fabricius to estimate the C, N and P pools of ant mounds in comparison with control soil. The average total N (TN), total P (TP) and available P (AP) concentrations in the ant mounds of both species were higher than in the control soil. Organic carbon (C-org), DOC, NH4+ and NO3- in F. sanguinea mounds were higher than in the control soil, but not for L. flavus mounds. Average concentrations of all the five types of nutrient were higher in F. sanguinea mounds than in L. flavus mounds. The variations in C-org, DOC, TN and TP concentrations in ant mounds were not significant at depths from 0 to 25 cm. NH4+ and NO3- concentrations differed by soil layers for F. sanguinea mounds but not for L. flavus mounds. The C/N ratios were generally lower in the mounds than in the control soil (at 5-25 cm), but no significant differences were found for C/P ratios (except at 10-15 cm). Carbon and DOC pools were smaller, TN and AP pools were larger in ant mounds compared with the control soil, but there was no significant difference for TP pools. NFL4+ and NO3- pools were substantially larger in F. sanguinea mounds, but smaller in L flavus mounds, than those in the control soil. All of the five types of nutrient pools were larger in F. sanguinea than in L flavus mounds. Ant mounds increased the spatial variability of soil nutrient pools in the wetland.

AB The need to avert unacceptable and irreversible environmental change is the most urgent challenge facing society. Landscape ecology has the capacity to help address these challenges by providing spatially-explicit solutions to landscape sustainability problems. However, despite a large body of research, the real impact of landscape ecology on sustainable landscape management and planning is still limited. In this paper, we first outline a typology of landscape sustainability problems which serves to guide landscape ecologists in the problem-solving process. We then outline a formal problem-solving approach, whereby landscape ecologists can better bring about disciplinary integration, a consideration of multiple landscape functions over long time scales, and a focus on decision making. This framework explicitly considers multiple ecological objectives and socio-economic constraints, the spatial allocation of scarce resources to address these objectives, and the timing of the implementation of management actions. It aims to make explicit the problem-solving objectives, management options and the system understanding required to make sustainable landscape planning decisions. We propose that by adopting a more problem-solving approach, landscape ecologists can make a significant contribution towards realising sustainable future landscapes.

AB Although it is common for ant surveys to uncover previously uncollected species, a recent study of subterranean ants in Amazonian Ecuador has indicated that an entire ant fauna may remain largely undiscovered. Here we report on the first systematic investigation of subterranean ants in northern Australia, in order to assess the extent to which the high abundance and diversity of subterranean ants in Amazonia is apparent in tropical Australia. We use a novel sampling technique that combines elements of an attractant bait and a pitfall trap, and allows many traps to be deployed simultaneously. Our main study was conducted at three closely approximated sites in Darwin, where the local ant fauna has been intensively surveyed using conventional (above-ground) sampling techniques. The 720 traps deployed resulted in 421 species records, representing 29 species from 17 genera. Sixteen of these species have cryptobiotic morphology, with four recorded here for the first time. Remarkably, one of these four (a blind species of Solenopsis) was the second most frequently caught species in subterranean traps, with 70 records. Ant abundance, species richness and composition varied markedly between sites, despite site similarity in soils and vegetation. Total ant records were greater in the middle compared with start of the wet season, declined with depth, and were greater after 4 days than one. Sampling at six sites in the Mitchell Falls area of the northern Kimberley region, 1,200 km southwest of Darwin, also revealed several cryptobiotic species new to science, including a new genus record (Pseudolasius) for Western Australia. Our underground sampling has therefore revealed an abundant and diverse subterranean ant fauna in northern Australia, containing many cryptobiotic species not previously collected. We use our results to provide methodological guidelines for most effectively sampling this fauna. Combined with the Amazonian study, our findings indicate that a specialist subterranean ant fauna, including numerous species remaining to be discovered, might be a feature of tropical landscapes throughout the world.

AB The population dynamics of the yellowjacket wasp (Vespula germanica Fabricus) in central Chile were analyzed for the first time. Using a simple Ricker logistic model and adding the effects of local weather variables (temperature and precipitation) and large-scale climate phenomena as El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), we modeled the interannual fluctuations in nest density. The best model according to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) included 1-year-lag negative feedback combined with the positive additive effects of ENSO and SAM. According to this model, yellowjacket nest density was favored by warm and dry winters, which probably influenced the survival of overwintering queens. Large-scale climatic variables [Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and SAM] described the effect of exogenous factors in wasp fluctuations better than local weather variables did. Our results emphasize the usefulness of climate indices and simple theoretical-based models in insect ecological research.

AB The census of vascular plants across a 10-year interval (1995-2005) at the fringe of a neotropical rainforest (Nouragues inselberg, French Guiana, South America) revealed that species richness decreased, both at quadrat scale (2 m(2)) and at the scale of the inselberg (three transects, embracing the whole variation in community composition). Juvenile stages of all tree and shrub species were most severely affected, without any discrimination between life and growth forms, fruit and dispersion types, or seed sizes. Species turnover in time resulted in a net loss of biodiversity, which was inversely related to species occurrence. The most probable cause of the observed species disappearance is global warming, which severely affected northern South America during the last 50 years (+2 degrees C), with a concomitant increase in the occurrence of aridity.

AB 1. Marine biologists are increasingly aware of the impact that even small human populations can have on coral reefs around the world, while conservationists and fisheries managers have a growing appreciation of the importance of culturally informed management strategies in coral reef conservation efforts. Despite these recognitions, however, examples of integrated field studies are limited.
   2. In this paper evidence from various disciplines is used to study the interaction between humans and one of the largest reefs in the Marquesas Islands, at Anaho Bay, Nuku Hiva Island, with the aim of assessing possible anthropogenic impacts over time.
   3. First, it reports on a marine biological survey of the benthic substrates of the bay and the taxonomic composition and spatial distributions of the local fish species. Second, it draws on results from an ongoing archaeological study and integrates these with interviews of village elders to gain a historical perspective on the reef and potential human impacts.
   4. The biological results indicated that the reef is in a state of decline, although fish densities are moderately high. The archaeological evidence, in turn, demonstrates that human populations have occupied this valley for at least the last 700 years. Throughout this period marine resources have been an important source of both food and raw materials for tools. The archaeological study also highlights aspects of landscape change, both natural and human-induced, that probably have been detrimental to reef health.
   5. Using the combined biological and anthropological data, this paper considers the nexus of factors that have led to the current reef conditions and considers management issues for the future. Key in this regard are processes that have initiated erosion and soil run-off, and fluctuations in the local human populations. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Many tropical forests have been converted for agri- or silviculture or a combination of both (agroforestry). Conservation at a landscape scale requires an understanding of the distribution and abundance of native biodiversity in these converted natural ecosystems, of which the knowledge is especially poor for African agroecosystems. We compared species density and species composition of four plant groups (trees and shrubs, epiphytic vascular plants, mosses, and liverworts) among three arboreal land-use types in southwestern Ethiopia (montane rainforest fragments, shade-tree coffee home gardens, and exotic tree plantations). Species density was significantly higher in forests than in coffee home gardens for all plant groups and in exotic tree plantations for all groups except mosses. Home gardens had more vascular epiphytic species than plantations, whereas the reverse was true for mosses and liverworts. The species composition of the forest plots was sometimes more similar to home-garden plots than plantation plots and sometimes vice versa. Fifteen forest plots had, however, cumulatively more species than a random selection of 15 nonforest (coffee home garden and plantation) plots, even if the 2 plot types complemented each other in terms of habitats for forest plants. Tree plantations dominated by Eucalyptus had many small trees and shrubs in common with forests, whereas plantations with Cupressus were important substrates for forests mosses and liverworts. Our results illustrate the importance of undisturbed forests habitats for conservation of species at a landscape scale and that different human-made land-use types may complement each other in their capacity as additional habitats for forest species.

AB Deforestation is a major environmental issue driving the loss of animal and plant species. Afforestation has recently been promoted to conserve and restore Chinese forest ecosystems. We investigated the distribution of small-mammal assemblages in an area where forest and associated deforestation habitats dominate, and in an agricultural area where afforestation is ongoing in the Loess Plateau of southern Ningxia Autonomous Region, P. R. China. Multiple trapping was used. Assemblages were defined based on the multinomial probability distribution and information theory. Species turnover between assemblages of deforested and afforested habitats was high, although no clear effect on species richness was observed. The two assemblages described along the deforestation gradient displayed higher diversity, whereas diversity was lower in assemblages identified in afforested habitats where Cricetulus longicaudatus, a known agricultural pest in various areas of China, clearly dominated. The threatened Sorex cylindricauda and Eozapus setchuanus were recorded along the deforestation gradient but not in plantations. Therefore, habitats present along a deforestation succession in this part of Ningxia sustain a high diversity of small mammals and include species of conservation concern. At the present stage of its process ( maximum 15 years), afforestation in southern Ningxia favours the dominance of an agricultural pest.

AB In nature reserves and habitat conservation areas, monitoring is required to determine if reserves are meeting their goals for preserving species, ecological communities, and ecosystems. Increasingly, reserves are established to protect multiple species and communities, each with their own conservation goals and objectives. As resources are always inadequate to monitor all components, criteria must be applied to prioritize both species and communities for monitoring and management. While methods for prioritizing species based on endangerment or risk have been established, approaches to prioritizing ecological communities for monitoring are not well developed, despite a long-standing emphasis on communities as target elements in reserve design. We established guidelines based on four criteria derived from basic principles of conservation and landscape ecology-extent, representativeness, fragmentation, and endangerment-to prioritize communities in the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan (MSCP). The MSCP was one of the first multiple-species habitat conservation areas established in California, USA, and it has a complex spatial configuration because of the patterns of surrounding land use, which are largely urbanized. In this case study, high priority communities for monitoring include coastal sage scrub (high endangerment, underrepresented within the reserve relative to the region, and moderately fragmented), freshwater wetlands, and coastal habitats (both have high fragmentation, moderate endangerment and representativeness, and low areal extent). This framework may be useful to other conservation planners and land managers for prioritizing the most significant and at-risk communities for monitoring.

AB The Viverridae (Mammalia, Carnivora), one of the least studied groups of carnivorans, include two subfamilies of Asian palm civets: Hemigalinae and Paradoxurinae. The relationships between and within these two subfamilies have never been thoroughly tested using an extensive molecular sample set. In this study, we gathered sequences of four genes (two mitochondrial: Cytochrome b and ND2 and two nuclear: beta-fibrinogen intron 7 and IRBP exon 1) for eight of the eleven extant species representing these two subfamilies. The results showed that: (1) the Asian palm civets (Hemigalinae and Paradoxurinae) have a single origin and form the sister-group of the (Genettinae + Viverrinae) clade, (2) the Hemigalinae (including the otter civet Cynogale bennettii) are monophyletic, (3) the Paradoxurinae are monophyletic and (4) the small-toothed palm civet (Arctogalidia trivirgata) is an early offshoot within the Paradoxurinae. Using a relaxed molecular clock analysis, the differentiation of the (Hemigalinae + Paradoxurinae) was inferred to occur in the Late Oligocene/Early Miocene. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Aim The paradigm that species' patterns of distribution, abundance and coexistence are the result of adaptations of the species to their niches has recently been challenged by evidence that similar patterns may be generated by simple random processes. We argue here that a better understanding of macroecological patterns requires an integration of both ecological and neutral stochastic approaches. We demonstrate the utility of such an integrative approach by testing the sampling hypothesis in a species-energy relationship of forest bird species.
   Location A Mediterranean biome in Catalonia, Spain.
   Methods To test the sampling hypothesis we designed a metacommunity model that reproduces the stochastic sampling from a regional pool to predict local species richness variation. Four conceptually different sampling procedures were evaluated.
   Results We showed that stochastic sampling processes predicted a substantial part (over 40%) of the observed variation in species richness, but left considerable variation unexplained. This remaining variation in species richness may be better understood as the result of alternative ecological processes. First, the sampling model explained more variation in species richness when the probability that a species colonises a new locality was assumed to increase with its niche width, suggesting that ecological differences between species matter when it comes to explaining macroecological patterns. Second, extinction risk was significantly lower for species inhabiting high-energy regions, suggesting that abundance-extinction processes play a significant role in shaping species richness patterns.
   Main conclusions We conclude that species-energy relationships may not simply be understood as a result of either ecological or random sampling processes, but more likely as a combination of both.

AB Rocky intertidal habitats frequently are used by humans for recreational, educational, and subsistence-harvesting purposes, with intertidal populations damaged by visitation activities such as extraction, trampling, and handling. California Marine Managed Areas, particularly regulatory marine reserves (MRs), were established to provide legal protection and enhancement of coastal resources and include prohibitions on harvesting intertidal populations. However, the effectiveness of MRs is unclear as enforcement of no-take laws is weak and no regulations protect intertidal species from other detrimental visitor impacts such as trampling. The goal of this study was two-fold: (1) to determine impacts from human visitation on California mussel populations (Mytilus californianus) and mussel bed community diversity; and (2) to investigate the effectiveness of regulatory MRs in reducing visitor impacts on these populations. Surveys of mussel populations and bed-associated diversity were compared: (1) at sites subjected to either high or low levels of human use, and (2) at sites either unprotected or with regulatory protection banning collecting. At sites subjected to higher levels of human visitation, mussel populations were significantly lower than low-use sites. Comparisons of mussel populations inside and outside of regulatory MRs revealed no consistent pattern suggesting that California no-take regulatory reserves may have limited effectiveness in protecting mussel communities. In areas where many people visit intertidal habitats for purposes other than collecting, many organisms will be affected by trampling, turning of rocks, and handling. In these cases, effective protection of rocky intertidal communities requires an approach that goes beyond the singular focus on collecting to reduce the full suite of impacts.

AB Questions: 1. Is there a trade-off between gap dependency and shade tolerance in each of the life-history stages of three closely related, coexisting species, Acer amoenum ( Aa), A. mono (Am) and A. rufinerve (Ar)? 2. If not, what differences in life-history traits contribute to the coexistence of these non-pioneer species?
   Location: Ogawa Forest Reserve, a remnant ( 98 ha), species-rich, temperate deciduous forest in central Japan ( 36 degrees 56' N, 140 degrees 35' E, 600 - 660 m a. s. l.).
   Methods: We estimated the demographic parameters ( survival, growth rate and fecundity) by stage of each species growing in gaps and under closed canopy through observations of a 6-ha permanent plot over 12 years. Population dynamics were analysed with stage-based matrix models including gap dynamics.
   Results: All of the species showed high seedling and sapling survival rates under closed canopies. However, demographic parameters for each growth stage in gaps and under closed canopies revealed inter-specific differences and ontogenetic shifts. The trade-off between survival in the shade and growth in gaps was detected only at the small sapling stage ( height < 30 cm), and Ar had the highest growth rate both in the shade and in the gaps at most life stages.
   Conclusions: Inter-specific differences and ontogenetic shifts in light requirements with life-form differences may contribute to the coexistence of the Acer species in old-growth forests, with Aa considered a long-lived sub-canopy tree, Am a long-lived canopy tree, and Ar a short-lived, 'gap-phase' sub-canopy tree.

AB Many South African populations of the brown mussel Perna perna have been depleted through over-exploitation by subsistence harvesters. This is problematic because recovery after disturbance is very slow, partly because recruits are largely associated with adult mussels. However, unlike large recruits of 3.5-10 mm that exhibit spatial structure related to that of adults, a very high proportion of settlers and small recruits (0-3.5 mm) occur on foliose algae. We tested the hypothesis that recruits on algae move to adult mussel beds after a period of growth, with the null hypothesis that they die at a certain size. We conducted an indirect field study comparing the ratios of large to small recruits in 100% cover mussel patches at locations with high and low algal cover. A second laboratory experiment analysed whether the size of recruits on algae affects their active movement behaviour in response to nearby mussel patches. Large/small recruit ratios were slightly, but not significantly greater in high than low algal cover locations. Both small (2-2.5 mm) and medium (4.5-5.5 mm) recruits remained on algae and moved very short distances throughout the laboratory experiment, while larger recruits (9-10 mm) moved significantly further distances and more often into mussel patches. The results suggest that very large recruits are able to migrate actively to nearby mussel patches, indicating ontogenetic shifts in this behaviour. However, the absence of a significant difference in ratios between field locations with high and low algal cover suggests many large recruits are accidentally dislodged from the algae and presumably die. Thus settlement of P. perna onto algae is likely to be wasted, with consequences for sustainable management of the mussel resource.

AB Seed production in the endemic New Zealand mistletoe Peraxilla tetrapetala (Loranthaceae) has been shown to be consistently pollen limited, but to date there has been no test of whether the species is also seed limited. If it is not seed limited, then pollen limitation may have no effect on population size. We tested for seed limitation by sowing seeds onto host trees at high and low densities at two sites, and following survival for up to 69 months. Our rationale was that unless there is strong density-dependent seedling mortality sufficient to negate increases in seed supply, the species would be seed limited. We simultaneously measured pollen limitation at both sites using pollen augmentation. Peraxilla tetrapetala was strongly pollen limited at both sites over 7 years at Ohau (mean Pollen Limitation Index 0.62), and 12 years at Craigieburn (mean PLI 0.44), before and during the seed-limitation study. There was no significant overall negative effect of density on survival in sown P. tetrapetala seeds over 42-69 months. There was a significant positive effect: seeds were more likely to adhere to branches when sown at high densities. This initial advantage to high-density seeds was gradually eroded by slightly (but non-significantly) lower survival rates of adhered seeds at high density. By the end of the study there was no significant difference in overall survival in high and low density plantings. This means that P. tetrapetala was apparently both pollen limited and seed limited at both our sites. Hence, reduced densities of native bird pollinators caused by introduced mammalian carnivores are likely to reduce the density of adult mistletoes in the next generation. However, the generality of this result may be affected by the fact that mistletoes do not have a dense 'seedling shadow' under the parent mistletoe.

AB Questions: Is the occurrence of vine species in neotropical rain forests primarily determined by properties of the forest (environmental factors), by properties of the trees (tree species or tree size) or are vines randomly distributed?
   Location: Maya Biosphere Reserve, Guatemala.
   Methods: In five 1-ha plots that span variation from unlogged forest to forest impacted by recurrent human disturbance we recorded the presence of all climbing vine species on every tree. The presence of all free standing vine species and 11 environmental variables were recorded in 100-m(2) subplots. The relationship of host tree diameter and host tree identity on single tree vine species richness was investigated by GLM modelling. Partial redundancy analyses were used to partition the variation in vine species composition on two sources: environmental factors and tree species identity.
   Results: Single tree vine richness increased with increasing host tree DBH and differed significantly among host species. For climbing vines, the ratio of variation in subplot presence explained by tree species and by environmental variables was ca. 4:1 (in the most disturbed logged plots slightly lower), for free standing vines this ratio varied from 1:2 in the most disturbed logged plots to 9:1 in reserve plots, while a ratio of ca. 1:1 was found for all plots analysed together.
   Conclusion: Different tree species have different probabilities of being infested by vines. Vines see both the forest and the trees; the environment is more important in earlier developmental stages, properties of individual trees become more important from the time vines start to climb.

AB How can conservation planners optimally and effectively allocate limited resources between imminently threatened and presently secure areas? Such choices must be made at multiple spatial scales involving a variety of conservation targets. Allocation strategies range from a "fire-fighting" approach, which gives priority to heavily developed areas at high risk of further habitat loss, to a "pre-emptive" approach giving priority to intact habitat tracts before they become threatened. We determined optimal dynamic reserve selection strategies when selections are made in imminently threatened and presently secure areas that will become threatened at uncertain times in the future. The objective was to maximize the expected number of endemic species conserved, predicted with species-area curves. The model was solved for three forms of species-area curve proposed in theoretical studies of habitat loss. Alternative scenarios were considered on the relationship between land prices and development risk. For the most commonly proposed form of the species-area relationship, the fire-fighting approach is optimal even if land prices rise substantially when presently secure areas become threatened. This reflects the assumption that species decline accelerates only after a large proportion of original habitat has been lost. The possibility of large species losses at lower levels of habitat loss justifies at least some pre-emptive conservation, even if land prices are not correlated with threat. if species decline is proportional with habitat loss, the optimal conservation strategy depends strongly on land price dynamics.

AB Commercial volume increment based on permanent plot data has frequently been used to determine cutting cycles and logging intensities that do not deplete forest timber resources, and that are therefore compatible with sustainable forest management. We evaluate three potential sources of increment bias from long-term permanent plot data monitoring forest recovery after reduced-impact logging (RIL) and conventional or predatory logging (CL) in eastern Amazonia: (1) forest monitoring length; (2) minimum diameter at breast height (DBH) included in measurements; (3) defective stems. Short monitoring intervals, inclusion of trees from sub-merchantable size classes, and failure to account for defective stems all lead to overestimates of annual commercial volume increment between first and second harvests. We found that these sources of bias greatly inflated the estimate of volume increment during the projected 30-year cutting cycle. Without controlling for biases, estimated volume increments were 1.14 and 0.18 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) for RIL and CL, respectively; increment corrected for bias decreased to 0.19 and 0 m(3) ha(-1) year 1 over the 30-year period. We propose alternative methods for calculating and reporting commercial volume increment. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Seven-son flower (Heptacodium miconioide) is a prized, useful and well-accepted landscape plant in North America and some European countries but only grows in East China. Unfortunately, the distribution region, population size and individual numbers of seven-son flower rapidly decrease in the wild. It is a particular rare, highly severe endangered and protective plant. Here we investigated the physiological responses of seven-son flower at eight different sites under fragmental habitats in the Beishan mountains (Zhejiang, China), one of two only areas where the communities of seven-son flower currently are discovered. This was to determine the effect of light stress under fragmental habitat on the physiology and to explore the endangering mechanism of seven-son flower. The study shows that strong light brought by habitat fragmentation obviously inhibited the photosynthesis rates reduced antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX)) activities and promoted electrical conductivity and MDA content of seven-son flower leaves. The characteristics of leaves were also affected by light intensity in fragmental habitat. Intense light in fragmental habitat is disadvantageous to photosynthesis and antioxidant enzymes of the flower. Our results suggest that biodiversity conservation of seven-son flower is timely needed and the light intensity should be considered carefully when biodiversity conservation of seven-son flower to be carried out, especially in the transplant conservation of seven-son flower from deteriorative area in the wild.

AB According to the Janzen-Connell model, host-specific natural enemies can promote species coexistence of canopy trees in tropical forests by attacking progeny where they are most concentrated. However, empirical evidence relating negative density-dependent mortality to herbivory and, in particular, attack by specialist herbivores, remains rare. We investigated density dependence in a natural population of Swietenia macrophylla in a south-eastern Amazon forest of Brazil. Across 24 adult trees, we found that initial juvenile densities were positively correlated with basal area of adult conspecifics whereas subsequent survivorship over 1 y for these juveniles declined strongly with increasing basal area of adult conspecifics. For 18 trees with > 5 juveniles surviving for 1 y, further evidence supporting the Janzen-Connell mechanism was obtained in that leaf herbivory and attack by a specialist microlepidopteran moth (Steniscadia poliopliaea) increased, and overall foliar condition decreased, with conspecific basal area. Moreover, when differences in mean juvenile size (number of extant leaves) were accounted for, juvenile survival over 1 y decreased with increased specialist leaf herbivory. Collectively, these results indicate that herbivores, in particular S. poliopliaea, may contribute to density dependence among S. macrophylla juveniles. We conclude that the survival of juveniles and their probability of recruitment into the canopy is decreased where conspecific adults are largest and/or most numerous and find support for the importance of host-specific pests in driving density dependence among tropical trees.

AB Vegetation structure of forest edges and type of adjacent field can affect seed and seedling survival patterns of tree species. We investigated acorn removal and seedling survival of Quercus germana and Q. xalapensis in relation to woody plant density across old field-forest gradients with soft and abrupt edges. Experiments were established along four parallel bands located at 40-50 m in the forest, forest and field edges (0-10 m to each side of the border), and 20-30 m in the old field. Within each band, woody plant and acorn density was measured, and four points for acorn and seedling removal experiments were randomly positioned. In each position, 20 acorns or four seedlings were placed. Survival was monitored during one month. In abrupt edges, acorn density was higher along edges than in forest interior. Also, higher acorn removal and seedling mortality were observed in the adjacent old-field whereas acorn and seedling survival was the highest at the edges. Acorn and seedling survival was positively correlated to woody vegetation density. As the vegetation density of field and forest edges grows, abrupt edges develop into soft edges, and they become more hospitable to oak recruitment and then to forest cover expansion.

AB The establishment of woody fallow systems is an option for the improvement of degraded agricultural landscape within the ecologically deteriorated Aral Sea area in northwest Uzbekistan. Growth and development of ten tree species, differing in tolerance to drought and salinity, were studied over 24 months. To determine species suitability for afforestation, conventional diameter and height measurements were compared to Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and its underlying components, Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), Specific Leaf Area (SLA) and Leaf Weight Ratio (LWR), as well as the Crop Growth Rate (CGR) as a function of NAR and Leaf Area Index (LAI). RGRs varied between 0.46 and 2.16 mg g(-1) day(-1) and showed highly significant differences among species, but also between years, which reduces the parameter's suitability for species selection. The same is true for NAR and SLA. CGR values ranged from 0.01 to 0.71 g m(-2) day(-1), increased with age of the trees, and showed significant species differences. CGR correlated better with NAR (r = 0.89) and SLA (r = 0.86) than RGR. Overall CGR correlated highly with the RGRs in height and diameter (in 80% and 71% of all cases, respectively). Thus, CGR appears to be a suitable indicator complementing RGR, NAR and SLA estimates to decide on species suitability for afforestation. The intensive measurements for RGR should be done later, rather than earlier in the tree life cycle. At an early age, CGR and diameter measurements are more meaningful. A combination of estimates, not a single factor, best assesses the long-term sustainable growth under natural conditions and allows early selection of species suitable for afforestation of degraded patches in the agricultural landscape. Ranking of all parameters concurrently showed the high potential of Elaeagnus angustifolia and Populus euphratica, which matched previous rankings based on total biomass production and financial added value.

AB This work aimed to explore the response of ant species assemblage to contrasting types of forests in a semideciduous stationary rainforest, in the Parque Estadual do Rio Doce, South Eastern Brazil. We compared antropomorphic borders of this park and natural ecotones, such as lake margins continuous with forests, as well as preserved forests far from ecotones. We investigated whether ground-dwelling ant species richness, abundance and composition Would change according to forest types and ecotones. We expected greater species richness in interior tall forest, compared with low forest or ecotone habitats. In addition, we tested the effect of climate seasonality on ant assemblages found in each studied vegetation type. Each forest type was surveyed based on a minimum transect sampling unit of 150 in long summing up 30 pit-falls per unit. Two sampling events, one in dry season(September of 2001) and another in the rainy season (January of 2002) were performed. For both seasons, tall forest presented greater total number of ant species, however lower mean ant species and abundance per trap than other forest types, thus corroborating the prediction that ecotones might present high alpha diversity. Mean species richness and abundance did not differ between interior low forest and lake edge, or between these habitats and reserve border. In general, species composition were not clearly defined by forest types. Results here found Suggest that species loss or community dominance by generalist species, eventually due to deforestation, is probably a much greater problem than previously thought. However, to understand patterns of insect species diversity and distribution in tropical ecosystem should be taken in account much more comprehensive, spatially explicit sampling designs.

AB A biodiversity inventory of trees was carried out in five hitherto understudied inland tropical dry evergreen forests of peninsular India, by establishing a 1-ha permanent plot in each (Araiyapatti-AP, Karisakkadu-KK, Maramadakki-MM, Shanmuganathapuram-SP and Rayapatti-RP). These sites are also sacred groves and forest fragments experiencing various levels of human disturbance and can be classified as relatively undisturbed (AP), moderately disturbed (KR, SP and RP) or highly disturbed (MM). Site disturbances were categorized based on forest encroachment, temple visitors' impact, resource extraction and the degree of cattle and goat browsing. All trees >= 10 cm girth at breast height in the five plots were enumerated, their girth measured and tagged. A total of 60 tree species belonging to 49 genera and 26 families were recorded. Tree species richness was as low as 19 species per hectare in the moderately disturbed site RP to as high as 35 species in the relatively undisturbed site AP. Tree density ranged from 596 stems per hectare in site KR to 1663 trees in site SP and that of basal area from 12.4 m(2) (in RP) to 22.1 m(2) per hectare (in SP). Three species Memecylon umbellatum, Chloroxylon swietenia and Pterospermum conescens scored high importance value index. The Rubiaceae, Mimosaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Rutaceae and Sapindaceae constituted the most-speciose families. Among the five sites, SP exemplified a mono-specific dominant tropical forest, with Memecylon umbellatum occupying 69% of the total forest stand density. In all five sites tree species richness and density decreased with increasing girth class. The stand structure of forest sites displayed a reverse J-shaped curve with the exception of site KR. Spatial patterns of trees in the five sites revealed that the individuals of most species are clumped at the 1-ha scale. The non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination, based on species richness, diversity indices, stand density, basal area, species population density and disturbance scores, organized the sites into three clusters, chiefly influenced by three variables-species richness, density of predominant species and site disturbance score. In the light of the extant biodiversity, forest fragmentation coupled with human disturbance, and also the cultural tradition associated with the local people, the need for conservation of the sites is emphasized.

AB Phyllomedusa tarsius is an arboreal frog species that suspends its eggs on leaves above water in order to achieve the high relative humidity necessary for embryo development. I compared the hatching Success of P. tarsius in ponds located in pasture, Vismia spp. regrowth, Cecropia spp. regrowth, forest fragments and continuous forest at a site in central Amazonia. Reproductive success of P. tarsius is measured as percentage of clutches producing at least one tadpole and number of tadpoles produced per clutch. Reproductive success was higher in Cecropia regrowth, forest fragments and continuous forest, compared to pasture and Vismia regrowth. Desiccation and flooding were the main causes of clutch loss in pasture and Vismia regrowth, while predation was more frequent in forest and Cecropia regrowth. The levels of successful of P. tarsius clutches observed across all habitat types suggests that a landscape mosaic including pasture, secondary growth and forest fragments may allow for recolonization and genetic exchange to occur in isolated forest patches.

AB 1. The effects of prescribed fire on ant community structure were examined in a regenerating longleaf pine savanna in Florida, U.S.A. The presence of ants on 20, 10 x 10 m plots was determined by baiting every 1-3 months from 18 months before a fire until 6 months afterwards.
   2. Expected species richness (based on rarefaction) and species density 6 months post-fire were significantly lower than for the same month (September) 6 months before the fire.
   3. Cluster analysis revealed that the effects of fire were far less important predictors of ant community structure than seasonality and unexplained inter-annual variation. Thus, overall, the impacts of fire were relatively minor and short term at the community level.
   4. Different functional groups of ants (as defined by Andersen, 1997) responded to fire in strikingly different ways. Generalised Myrmicinae (e.g. Pheidole spp., Monomorium viride ) were affected more severely by fire than were the other functional groups. In contrast, the dominant Dolichoderinae (Forelius pruinosus ) exhibited a large increase after the fire and seemed to be responsible for the decline in abundance of several species.
   5. A strong negative correlation between F. pruinosus and other groups of ants immediately after the fire suggested more intense competition among ants at that time. Six months post-fire, the abundance of F. pruinosus decreased markedly and the abundance of other species rebounded.
   6. The rapid post-fire recovery of the ant community probably reflects adaptations of ants to a chronic fire regime.

AB Aside from deforestation and selective logging, mature tropical rain forests appear to be in a state of near-term flux. At plot scales over a 20-year period, forest inventory data (representing areas < 750 ha) have shown stands to be accumulating above-ground biomass pantropically while displaying signs of increasing turnover. To assess whether or not such disequilibrium is manifest at broader spatial scales (i.e. coarser grain sizes and larger extents), we performed a change detection analysis of landscape texture (i.e. the organization of reflective properties), in satellite images of closed-canopy tropical rain forests considered to be anthropically undisturbed. Here we show that fractal properties of pixel spectral values depicting low and high levels of photosynthetic activity underwent significant shifts from the 1970s to the 1980s. Following expectations for aggrading forests, canopy texture became more random throughout the tropics. Although subject to periodic disturbance events such as natural exogenic perturbations and/or synchronous die-off, which should produce no consistent trend, these forested landscapes across the globe exhibited similar dynamics at fine temporal (decadal) intervals. Such biophysical changes (representing areas > 1000 000 ha) directly affect atmospheric boundary layer conditions and could have implications with respect to biodiversity and carbon cycling in these systems.

AB Species-rich old-growth forests dominated by Quercus were extensive in the highlands of Chiapas until a few decades ago. Current land-use is resulting in replacement of Quercus by Pinus spp. in the canopy of the remaining forest fragments, which are less diverse, drier, and more exposed to freezing temperatures. Forest floor and soil are also modified and may limit the regeneration of many woody species. We studied the influence of litter type (pine needles vs. oak leaves), litter depth (0, 3, 6 and 14 cm), and litter cover (3 cm vs. 0 cm of loose litter on top of sowed acorns) on the emergence and growth of seedlings of Quercus rugosa, a dominant tree in pine-oak forests. Seedling emergence and establishment were affected by the interaction of experimental factors. Uncovered acorns on pine litter were more exposed to desiccation; this effect was more evident with deeper litter. Acorns sowed on oak litter were not affected by levels of litter cover and litter depth. The results can be of use in defining further field studies, and practices of direct seeding for restoration of pine-dominated stands.

Between 40 and 62 taxa were identified at each station during the study period. Percentage cover, number of interactions and number of recruits were recorded. Space occupied was found to vary more than 2.5 orders of magnitude between stations and seasons (0.3 - 82 %), Competition for space was most intense during summer, when recruitment was highest. More than 3600 interactions between pairs of species were recorded and competitive matrices are presented for the two stations with the most interactions. Both number of interactions and % cover were significantly higher at sites with greater water Row. The nature and the degree of competition varied between sites, with the most intense competition occurring in the very high flow sites with a large proportion of intraspecific encounters. Colonial species were more evident at the sites with high flow. Certain solitary species (notably Anemia ephippium and Pomatoceres spp.) were successful competitors in encounters with cheilostomatid bryozoans. Solitary species may prevent space monopolisation by the faster-growing bryozoans. 'Typical' early successional species, notably bryozoans such as Celleporella hyalina and Microporella ciliata, were more abundant at the more disturbed sites, implying either a larger adult population and/or preferential settlement of these species at such sites.

AB 1. A published model of constant diurnal energy accumulation by territorial hummingbirds does not accurately reflect the temporal distribution of feeding behaviour of traplining hummingbirds, Phaethornis longirostris (Long-Tailed Hermit Hummingbirds),
   2, In an enclosure study, gross nectar intake by P. longirostris decreased through the day, mirroring nectar production rates in its natural food-flowers and mimicking its natural foraging patterns.
   3. Using a simulation model, the energetic consequences of constant and decreasing net energy intake rates for traplining hummingbirds are compared,
   4. Given natural patterns of nectar production, model birds with decreasing diurnal net intake rates met their energetic needs with fewer flowers than those with constant net intake, and spent less time foraging.
   5, It is concluded that P. longirostris do not satisfy the physiological assumptions of the published model, and that in this way they are different from the territorial species on which the model has previously been tested.

AB The population structure and fecundity of Clibanarius antillensis at the rocky shore of Praia Grande, Sao Sebastiao, Sao Paulo State, southeastern Brazil, was studied. Sexual dimorphism was verified, with males reaching larger sizes than females. Population sex ratio was skewed for females, which predominated in the smallest size classes, while males predominated in the largest ones. Size frequency distribution revealed a bimodal pattern correlated with seasonal differences in crab size. Reproductive season was continuous, with a peak of reproductive activity from November to March. Fecundity was positively correlated with crabs shield length and larger broods were found to be produced in relatively heavier (larger) shells. Thus, shells influenced both crab and consequently, brood size, probably by regulating individual growth and reproductive activity of females.

AB Stand mapping and vertical and oblique tree crown projections were used to study gap characteristics and gap effects on the regeneration and stand development of Larix gmelini. The hypothesis is that waves of advance Larix regeneration are recruited into the canopy layer following the creation of canopy openings. In old-growth Larix forests of the northern Da Xingan Ling Mts., at 52 degrees N, obliquely projected gaps (OPG) begin at a distance of 60 - 80 % of the canopy tree height from the southernmost stems bordering the gap and thus the OPGs may extend beyond the northern boundaries of the vertically projected gaps (VPG). Changes in the environment and resource availability in the OPG result in increased Larix sapling survival. Due to a greater incidence of light, 10 - 30 yr old OPG saplings were more abundant than saplings in either a near-oblique projected gap (NOPG) or in the shadow of obliquely projected crowns (SOPC). The survival of saplings more than 30-yr old was highest when they were found in the OPG of one canopy opening and the VPG of another. This means that, following recruitment into an OPG, saplings then require the space found in a VPG to permit growth into the canopy. Thus, various-sized gaps contribute to the survival of different aged saplings by increasing the complexity of stand structure. Although individuals may regenerate in an OPG, successful recruitment into the canopy requires the available growing space of a VPG. This research suggests that shade intolerant Larix gmelini can maintain its canopy dominance without fire via gap regeneration.

AB There is a latitudinal gradient in the species richness of Decapoda with pelagic larvae. For example, only two species of Brachyura are found around Svalbard, 54 species are known from the English Channel and similar to 100 from the Atlantic coast of the Iberian peninsula. The distributions of many species are limited by effects of temperature. Intermoult times of larvae are inversely related to temperature. In the field the size of larvae is inversely related to temperature, the relationship tending to increase in significance in successive larval stages. The timing of the seasonal occurrence of larvae of decapod species in the plankton is also related to temperature, to a greater extent than are seasonal cycles of the holoplankton. These effects of temperature on larval development influence the biomass and production of the larvae in the plankton. Some potential effects of climate change on the distributions and dynamics of planktonic larvae of decapods and consequent changes in their diversity, biomass and production can be predicted insofar as temperature is a limiting factor.

ID FOREST SUCCESSION; TROPICAL FORESTS; RAIN-FOREST; GAPS
AB The genus Trema includes many species that are fast growing, short living pioneer trees common in early successional vegetation and large recent gaps of many tropical moist forests. They establish themselves and grow in open sites with microclimatic and soil conditions which are contrasting to those prevailing in dense forests. With time they change the environmental conditions by attenuating the wide alternations of soil temperature and lower midday air relative humidity characteristic of open places. At the same time, soil moisture and organic matter content as well as nutrient levels increase due to the reestablishment of an organic cycle in the soil. Consequently they help generating an environment that permits the establishment of mature forest species that often do not survive under the environmental conditions of open places. The propagules of mature forest trees can be reintroduced from conserved areas nearby. The biological and ecological traits related to the potential use of T. micrantha for site amelioration previous to the reintroduction of mature forest trees are presented in this paper. Furthermore, some preliminary experiences in the field are cited. The same use may apply to other fast growing, short living pioneers.

AB Interspecific competitive interactions among sessile epibenthos were studied by suspending PVC panels at Tomioka Bay, south Japan, for a maximum period of 16 mo. Interactions were monitored from photographs of a fixed area of the panels. Four panels were suspended during two different months in autumn 1991, and the development of the community was followed until December 1992. Altogether, 6511 interspecific overgrowth interactions were recorded, of which 37 resulted in standoffs and the rest in overgrowths. The competitive relationship observed in this sessile assemblage followed the pattern of a hierarchy with numerous backloops. Among the 36 species, belonging to the seven taxonomic groups encountered during the study, the colonial ascidian Didemnum moseleyi was recorded as the dominant species (with respect to competitive ability) while the barnacle Balanus trigonus was the weakest species. The month of panel exposure and whether or not the panel surface was shaded had a significant influence on the competitive ability of the sessile organisms. The order of hierarchy of the most dominant species changed with the month of panel submersion and its light conditions. Among the several abundant species tested, longer residence times were recorded for serpulid worms than for the colonial species. A significant, positive relationship was obtained between the areal cover of competitively dominant sessile organisms and the number of their interspecific interactions. From the short residence time of sessile organisms and the significant relationship between their areal cover and number of interspecific interactions, it is concluded that the interspecific interactions played important role in the species succession.

AB Deep-water access is arguably the most effective, but under-studied, mechanism that plants employ to survive during drought. Vulnerability to embolism and hydraulic safety margins can predict mortality risk at given levels of dehydration, but deep-water access may delay plant dehydration. Here, we tested the role of deep-water access in enabling survival within a diverse tropical forest community in Panama using a novel data-model approach.
   We inversely estimated the effective rooting depth (ERD, as the average depth of water extraction), for 29 canopy species by linking diameter growth dynamics (1990-2015) to vapor pressure deficit, water potentials in the whole-soil column, and leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves. We validated ERD estimates against existing isotopic data of potential water-access depths.
   Across species, deeper ERD was associated with higher maximum stem hydraulic conductivity, greater vulnerability to xylem embolism, narrower safety margins, and lower mortality rates during extreme droughts over 35 years (1981-2015) among evergreen species. Species exposure to water stress declined with deeper ERD indicating that trees compensate for water stress-related mortality risk through deep-water access.
   The role of deep-water access in mitigating mortality of hydraulically-vulnerable trees has important implications for our predictive understanding of forest dynamics under current and future climates.

AB Secondary forests are increasing in the Brazilian Amazon and have been cited as an important mechanism for reducing net carbon emissions. However, our understanding of the contribution of secondary forests to the Amazonian carbon balance is incomplete, and it is unclear to what extent emissions from old-growth deforestation have been offset by secondary forest growth. Using MapBiomas 3.1 and recently refined IPCC carbon sequestration estimates, we mapped the age and extent of secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon and estimated their role in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions since 1985. We also assessed whether secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon are growing in conditions favourable for carbon accumulation in relation to a suite of climatic, landscape and local factors. In 2017, the 129,361 km(2)of secondary forest in the Brazilian Amazon stored 0.33 +/- 0.05 billion Mg of above-ground carbon but had offset just 9.37% of old-growth emissions since 1985. However, we find that the majority of Brazilian secondary forests are situated in contexts that are less favourable for carbon accumulation than the biome average. Our results demonstrate that old-growth forest loss remains the most important factor determining the carbon balance in the Brazilian Amazon. Understanding the implications of these findings will be essential for improving estimates of secondary forest carbon sequestration potential. More accurate quantification of secondary forest carbon stocks will support the production of appropriate management proposals that can efficiently harness the potential of secondary forests as a low-cost, nature-based tool for mitigating climate change.

AB To determine the effect of rivers, environmental conditions, and isolation by distance on the distribution of species in Amazonia. Location: Brazilian Amazonia. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Birds, fishes, bats, ants, termites, butterflies, ferns + lycophytes, gingers and palms. We compiled a unique dataset of biotic and abiotic information from 822 plots spread over the Brazilian Amazon. We evaluated the effects of environment, geographic distance and dispersal barriers (rivers) on assemblage composition of animal and plant taxa using multivariate techniques and distance- and raw-data-based regression approaches. Environmental variables (soil/water), geographic distance, and rivers were associated with the distribution of most taxa. The wide and relatively old Amazon River tended to determine differences in community composition for most biological groups. Despite this association, environment and geographic distance were generally more important than rivers in explaining the changes in species composition. The results from multi-taxa comparisons suggest that variation in community composition in Amazonia reflects both dispersal limitation (isolation by distance or by large rivers) and the adaptation of species to local environmental conditions. Larger and older river barriers influenced the distribution of species. However, in general this effect is weaker than the effects of environmental gradients or geographical distance at broad scales in Amazonia, but the relative importance of each of these processes varies among biological groups.

AB Conversion of natural landscapes into agricultural land-uses represents a major threat to global biodiversity. In lotic ecosystems, aquatic insects are among some of the most vulnerable organisms to such alterations, and thus it is important to study and evaluate how habitat integrity is affected by human activities. In this work we review the Habitat Integrity Index (HII): a measure of environmental integrity of streams. Our objective was to evaluate if this index is a reliable tool for environmental monitoring in tropical streams. We synthesize the relationship between HII and aquatic insect communities in 647 streams in Brazil. Our analysis showed a significant relationship between HII and aquatic insect communities, explaining 29% of variation in community composition and structure. Thus, the HII reflects local environmental quality, as well as wider landscape conditions, making it a good predictor for aquatic and semiaquatic organisms. Our results indicate that HII is a good alternative for aquatic biomonitoring in the Brazilian stream and in other countries that have an Amazon rainforest.

AB Our understanding on phytoplankton diversity has largely been progressing since the publication of Hutchinson on the paradox of the plankton. In this paper, we summarise some major steps in phytoplankton ecology in the context of mechanisms underlying phytoplankton diversity. Here, we provide a framework for phytoplankton community assembly and an overview of measures on taxonomic and functional diversity. We show how ecological theories on species competition together with modelling approaches and laboratory experiments helped understand species coexistence and maintenance of diversity in phytoplankton. The non-equilibrium nature of phytoplankton and the role of disturbances in shaping diversity are also discussed. Furthermore, we discuss the role of water body size, productivity of habitats and temperature on phytoplankton species richness, and how diversity may affect the functioning of lake ecosystems. At last, we give an insight into molecular tools that have emerged in the last decades and argue how it has broadened our perspective on microbial diversity. Besides historical backgrounds, some critical comments have also been made.

AB Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) have been studied extensively over the past decade as an important policy tool for coordinating ecological protection and regional socioeconomic development. One of the greatest challenges of PES implementation is to understand where to pay, i.e., spatial targeting, which can directly impact PES effectiveness and efficiency. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of spatial targeting methods based on literature analysis using Citespace. Firstly, peer-reviewed articles related to spatial targeting of PES were selected from the Web of Science database based on keywords. Cases applying PES spatial targeting methods were then chosen and analyzed after all articles were read. In total, 70% of the chosen cases focused on improving the compensation efficiency of biodiversity or another single environmental objective, whereas the remaining cases focused on coordinating trade-offs between equity and efficiency or multiple environmental objectives. The main PES spatial targeting approaches included cost-benefit analysis, multi-objective optimization, data envelope analysis and other methods aimed at specific issues. Of these, cost-benefit analysis has been most widely applied at different scales, including county, regional and watershed scales. Significant differences among the different PES spatial targeting methods were found, including in PES spatial targeting dimensions, efficiency optimization approaches and method application conditions. The practice of PES spatial targeting requires the selection of appropriate methods based on contextual biophysical and socioeconomic conditions as well as relevant environmental issues. The combined application of PES spatial targeting methods, compensation willingness of stakeholders and dynamic implementation of PES spatial targeting should be considered in future research.

AB Decreasing landscape connectivity, due to habitat loss and agricultural expansion, is a threat for species movement and other flux-dependent ecological processes. Tree cover within the agricultural matrix provides perching sites, dispersal routes, and extra habitat for animals. Isolated trees and living fences in tropical pastures add structural complexity to actual matrices, but their role in landscape connectivity is undervalued. Our main objective was to assess the potential value of small (<= 1ha) woody patches for maintaining landscape connectivity in highly fragmented landscapes using birds as focal species. We used high-resolution images and LIDAR data to classify different tree cover types. We assess the probability of connectivity for different hypothetical dispersal distances between woody patches, using a graph-theoretic approach and simulating scenarios that differed in tree cover composition. We estimated the impacts and contribution of tree cover class removals on landscape connectivity. The connectivity index increased widely among scenarios with increasing tree cover composition. The highest connectivity value was obtained in the scenario that included all arboreal elements currently present in the matrix. Small wooded patches and isolated trees contributed from 26% to 59% to overall connectivity. The presence of small (<= 1ha) patches of tree cover greatly enhance landscape connectivity for animals with low vagility and behavioral limitations on crossing gaps. Isolated trees and living fences play a crucial role in increasing habitat reachability within rural landscapes and ensuring and enhancing connectivity for animals that perform daily-movements at short-distances. The spatial distribution of arboreal elements within landscapes could be optimized to increase connectivity and must be considered in conservation planning.

AB The inter-regional payments for ecosystem services (PES) is an important policy to promote regional ecological and environmental cooperation. However, the existing inter-regional PES standard in China may underestimate the value of ecosystem services and omit the value of transferred pollutants due to inter-regional trade. A reasonable framework of inter-regional PES standards is necessary for the policymakers, especially in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region with the most serious environmental problem in China. This paper employed the method of environmental impact evaluation and multi-regional input-output model (MRIO) to build a framework of inter-regional PES estimation, which both contained the regional spillover value of ecosystem services and the regional transfer value of pollutants. Finally, we estimate the amount of inter-regional payment for ecosystem services within BTH region. The results indicated that the PES standards within BTH region were 13.8 billion yuan and 19.2 billion yuan from Beijing, Tianjin to Hebei province in 2012, which accounted for 0.77 % and 1.49 % of their GDP in 2012. These PES standards are effective for regional ecological and environmental cooperation within BTH region and a multi-dimensional marketization mechanism should be implemented to reinforce inter-regional payment for ecosystem services, which may pave the way for other regions or countries.

AB Approximately 20% of the Brazilian Amazon has now been deforested, and the Amazon is currently experiencing the highest rates of deforestation in a decade, leading to large-scale land-use changes. Roads have consistently been implicated as drivers of ongoing Amazon deforestation and may act as corridors to facilitate species invasions. Long-term data, however, are necessary to determine how ecological succession alters avian communities following deforestation and whether established roads lead to a constant influx of new species. We used data across nearly 40 years from a large-scale deforestation experiment in the central Amazon to examine the avian colonization process in a spatial and temporal framework, considering the role that roads may play in facilitating colonization. Since 1979, 139 species that are not part of the original forest avifauna have been recorded, including more secondary forest species than expected based on the regional species pool. Among the 35 species considered to have colonized and become established, a disproportionate number were secondary forest birds (63%), almost all of which first appeared during the 1980s. These new residents comprise about 13% of the current community of permanent residents. Widespread generalists associated with secondary forest colonized quickly following deforestation, with few new species added after the first decade, despite a stable road connection. Few species associated with riverine forest or specialized habitats colonized, despite road connection to their preferred source habitat. Colonizing species remained restricted to anthropogenic habitats and did not infiltrate old-growth forests nor displace forest birds. Deforestation and expansion of road networks into terra firme rainforest will continue to create degraded anthropogenic habitat. Even so, the initial pulse of colonization by nonprimary forest bird species was not the beginning of a protracted series of invasions in this study, and the process appears to be reversible by forest succession.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs are now high in number, if not always in impact. When groups of users pay groups of service providers, establishing PES involves collective action. We study the creation of collective PES institutions, and their continuation, as group coordination. We use framed lab-in-field experiments with hydroservices users and providers within watersheds participating in Mexico's Matching Funds program in Veracruz, Yucatan and Quintana Roo states. We explore the coordination of contributions between downstream users and upstream providers, plus effects of different types of sanctions that can affect expectations for both users and providers. Both information alone and sanctions raise contributions overall, although outcomes varied by site in line with our rankings of 'watershed trust'. For instance, monetary sanctions raise contributions in the watershed we ranked high in trust, yet initially lowered them for the lowest-trust watershed. This suggests that upstream-downstream social capital will be central to new collective local PES, while our overall trends suggest social capital can be raised by successful coordination over time.

AB Vegetation plays an important role in regulating global carbon cycles and is a key component of the Earth system models (ESMs) that aim to project Earth's future climate. In the last decade, the vegetation component within ESMs has witnessed great progress from simple "big-leaf" approaches to demographically structured approaches, which have a better representation of plant size, canopy structure, and disturbances. These demographically structured vegetation models typically have a large number of input parameters, and sensitivity analysis is needed to quantify the impact of each parameter on the model outputs for a better understanding of model behavior. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to diagnose the Community Land Model coupled to the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Simulator, or CLM4.5(FATES). Specifically, we quantified the first-and second-order sensitivities of the model parameters to outputs that represent simulated growth and mortality as well as carbon fluxes and stocks for a tropical site with an extent of 1 x 1 degrees. While the photosynthetic capacity parameter (V-c;max25) is found to be important for simulated carbon stocks and fluxes, we also show the importance of carbon storage and allometry parameters, which determine survival and growth strategies within the model. The parameter sensitivity changes with different sizes of trees and climate conditions. The results of this study highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics of the next generation of demographically enabled vegetation models within ESMs to improve model parameterization and structure for better model fidelity.

AB Tree allometric relationships are widely employed for estimating forest biomass and production and are basic building blocks of dynamic vegetation models. In tropical forests, allometric relationships are often modeled by fitting scale-invariant power functions to pooled data from multiple species, an approach that fails to capture changes in scaling during ontogeny and physical limits to maximum tree size and that ignores interspecific differences in allometry. Here, we analyzed allometric relationships of tree height (9884 individuals) and crown area (2425) with trunk diameter for 162 species from the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama. We fit nonlinear, hierarchical models informed by species traits - wood density, mean sapling growth, or sapling mortality - and assessed the performance of three alternative functional forms: the scale-invariant power function and the saturating Weibull and generalized Michaelis-Menten (gMM) functions. The relationship of tree height with trunk diameter was best fit by a saturating gMM model in which variation in allometric parameters was related to interspecific differences in sapling growth rates, a measure of regeneration light demand. Light-demanding species attained taller heights at comparatively smaller diameters as juveniles and had shorter asymptotic heights at larger diameters as adults. The relationship of crown area with trunk diameter was best fit by a power function model incorporating a weak positive relationship between crown area and species-specific wood density. The use of saturating functional forms and the incorporation of functional traits in tree allometric models is a promising approach for improving estimates of forest biomass and productivity. Our results provide an improved basis for parameterizing tropical plant functional types in vegetation models.

AB Biodiversity in natural systems can be maintained either because niche differentiation among competitors facilitates stable coexistence or because equal fitness among neutral species allows for their long-term cooccurrence despite a slow drift toward extinction. Whereas the relative importance of these two ecological mechanisms has been well-studied in the absence of evolution, the role of local adaptive evolution in maintaining biological diversity through these processes is less clear. Here we study the contribution of local adaptive evolution to coexistence in a landscape of interconnected patches subject to disturbance. Under these conditions, early colonists to empty patches may adapt to local conditions sufficiently fast to prevent successful colonization by other preadapted species. Over the long term, the iteration of these local-scale priority effects results in niche convergence of species at the regional scale even though species tend to monopolize local patches. Thus, the dynamics evolve from stable coexistence through niche differentiation to neutral cooccurrence at the landscape level while still maintaining strong local niche segregation. Our results show that neutrality can emerge at the regional scale from local, niche-based adaptive evolution, potentially resolving why ecologists often observe neutral distribution patterns at the landscape level despite strong niche divergence among local communities.

AB Determining assembly rules of co-occurring species persists as a fundamental goal in community ecology. At local scales, the relative importance of environmental filtering vs. competitive exclusion remains a subject of debate. In this study, we assessed the relative importance of habitat filtering and competition in structuring understory ant communities in tropical forests of French Guiana. Leaf-litter ants were collected using pitfall and Winkler traps across swamp, slope and plateau forests near Saul, French Guiana. We used a combination of univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate trait response of ants to habitat characteristics. Null model analyses were used to investigate the effects of habitat filtering and competitive interactions on community assembly at the scale of assemblages and sampling points, respectively. Swamp forests presented a much lower taxonomic and functional richness compared to slope and plateau forests. Furthermore, marked differences in taxonomic and functional composition were observed between swamp forests and slope or plateau forests. We found weak evidence for competitive exclusion based on null models. Nevertheless, the contrasting trait composition observed between habitats revealed differences in the ecological attributes of the species in the different forest habitats. Our analyses suggest that competitive interactions may not play an important role in structuring leaf-litter ant assemblages locally. Rather, habitats are responsible for driving both taxonomic and functional composition of ant communities.

AB Aim The hypothesis that habitat fragmentation negatively influences biodiversity stems from island biogeography and metapopulation theory which predict negative impacts of decreasing patch size on richness and distribution patterns. Empirical support of this idea is weak in terrestrial systems, though tests of fragmentation effects are typically confounded with landscape composition and potentially obscured by imperfect detection. Here, we used multispecies occupancy models and a mensurative experimental design to test competing hypotheses about how forest fragmentation influences distributions of breeding forest bird species and communities. Location Southern Indiana, USA. Methods During the breeding seasons of 2011-2013, we recorded over 80,000 bird detections in 202 forest fragments using a sampling design that isolated the effects of patch size per se from the effects of forest amount within a 2 km radius, edge distance, local vegetation and sampling area. We modelled the effects of these covariates on distributions of individual species categorized by ecological trait groups (i.e., forest, forest interior or forest edge), and evaluated how forest loss and fragmentation impact species richness. Results Though our results indicated little effect of patch size on total species richness, decreasing patch size had a negative effect on interior species, and a positive effect on edge species. The effects of total forest amount were much more variable, and surprisingly had a negative influence on many species, particularly cavity nesters. Main conclusions Our results do not support theoretical predictions that forest patch size should positively influence bird species richness. However, composition of bird communities shifted towards edge species from interior species with decreasing patch size. Maintaining large forest patches is thus critical for supporting forest interior species, which tend to be of the greatest conservation concern.

AB Tree species selected for planting should exhibit both high survival and fast growth. The growth of a tree or forest plantation is affected by the resource supply (light, water and nutrients), the fraction of resources acquired and resource use efficiency. Leaf traits related to the last two processes have the potential to explain the growth rates. In this study, we evaluated 24 leaf traits (morphological and physiological) at the individual level to investigate whether simple leaf traits can be used to predict the variation in relative growth rates of eight native tree species in a mixed plantation in disturbed areas in Central Amazonia 15 months after planting. Tachigali vulgaris and Trattinnickia rhoifolia exhibited the highest growth rates in both height and diameter, which were approximately three and two times higher than those of Bombacopsis macrocalyx, respectively. Species exhibited different establishment strategies as indicated by the functional leaf trait performance. Tachigali vulgaris, Ochroma pyramidale, Trattinnickia rhoifolia and Ceiba pentandra are efficient resource use species, have high light-saturated photosynthetic rates and are tolerant to high irradiance stress. Endlicheria anomala exhibited the worst performance based on functional traits, with the lowest light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A,) and maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (F-V/F-M). Of all traits analyzed, 12 leaf traits were correlated with the relative growth rate (RGR). Leaf traits related to resource acquisition, such as individual leaf area, chlorophyll content, leaf water potential and leaf nutrient concentration, were not good predictors of growth. Only stomatal conductance (g(s)) was related to the RGR. Leaf traits related to photosynthetic use efficiency (carbon use efficiency and photosynthetic nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiency) explained, on average, 20% and 30% of tree growth in height and diameter, respectively. Resource use efficiency traits were better predictors of growth than the individual physiological traits g(s) and A(max), which explained, on average, 12% and 19% of the growth in height and diameter, respectively. Photosynthetic efficiency-related traits are good predictors of tree growth, and species with high efficiency - such as T. vulgaris, O. pyramidale, T. rhoifolia and C. pentandra - can achieve high growth in Amazonian disturbed areas. The identification of species with better performance during initial establishment can improve the design of mixture plantations in disturbed areas. Additionally, the selection of traits most correlated with growth performance can be more informative for reforestation monitoring; consequently, previous silvicultural interventions can be adopted prior to the reduction in both growth and survival rates.

AB The biogeography of the Peruvian Eastern Pacific coast has been described based on oceanographic parameters and qualitative species occurrence data. This has generated disagreement about the limits and existence of different biogeographic units. In this study, the distribution of rocky-shore macrobenthic communities were recorded over 41 sites along the Peruvian coastline (3.5 degrees S-13.5 degrees S) and analyzed together with historic abiotic data in order to quantitatively evaluate the biogeographic zonation of rocky intertidal communities throughout the region and its relationship with environmental variables to propose an update bioregionalization. Clusters and non-metric multidimensional scaling were performed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices from abundance data to evaluate biogeographic patterns of dissimilarities of rocky-shore communities. Significant turnover of taxa among defined biogeographical units was tested using permutational multivariate dispersion. Relationships between of the biogeographical community's structure and environmental factors were examined using Random Forest analysis on datasets available at Bio-Oracle and Jet Propulsion Laboratory-California Institute of Technology. Variation of community structure of 239 taxa depicted three biogeographical units along the region matching Panamic, transitional and Humboldt provinces. Beta diversity analysis indicated a significant turnover of taxa within the transitional unit. Random forest analysis showed a strong correlation between biogeographic units with phosphate, sea surface temperature, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, cloud fraction, and silicates. Our results set the putative limits of three biogeographic units for rocky-shore communities along the coast of Peru, providing base-line information for understanding further biogeographic changes on communities associated with the ongoing regional coastal cooling and impacts of El Nino events.

AB A central problem in ecology is to understand how human impacts affect plant-animal interactions that lead to effective seed dispersal services for plant communities. Seed dispersal services are the outcome of plant-frugivore interactions that often form local networks of interacting species. Recent work has shown that some frugivorous bird species are more critical to network organization than others. Here, we explore how patch size and the potential local extinctions of obligate frugivorous birds affect the reorganization of seed dispersal networks. We examined the structure of 20 empirical seed dispersal networks documented across tropical avian assemblages occupying widely variable habitat patch sizes, a surrogate of the amount of remaining habitat. Networks within small forest patches consistently supported both lower plant and bird species richness. Forest patch size was positively associated with nestedness, indicating that reductions in patch size disrupted the nested organization of seed dispersal networks. Obligate frugivores, especially large-bodied species, were almost entirely absent from small forest patches. Analysis at the species level showed that obligate frugivores formed the core of interacting species, connecting species within a given seed dispersal network. Our combined results revealed that patch size reduction erodes frugivorous bird diversity, thereby affecting the integrity of seed dispersal networks. We highlight the importance of conserving large forest patches to maintain tropical forest functionality.

AB Biofuel feedstock production can be a significant driver of landscape modification, ecosystem change and biodiversity loss. There is growing body of literature that shows how biofuel landscapes provide various ecosystem services (e.g., feedstock for fuel, carbon sequestration) and compromise other ecosystem services (e.g., food, freshwater services). These effects are context-specific and depend largely on prior land use conditions and feedstock production practices. Changes in the flow of ecosystem services due to the conversion of natural and agricultural areas can have ripple effects on human wellbeing. Despite some recent attempts to apply to biofuel settings concepts and methods rooted in the ecosystem services literature, this is the exception rather than the rule within both the biofuel and the ecosystem services research communities. This paper synthesizes the current knowledge about the impact of biofuels on ecosystem services. It focuses especially on the feedstock production phase and outlines the main mechanisms through which landscape conversion affects the provisions of ecosystem services. It proposes conceptually coherent indicators to reflect these mechanisms and offers a critical discussion of key issues at the interface of biofuels and ecosystem services.

AB Over the past century, humans have cleared the Earth's forests at an alarming rate and intensity. The majority of global forest cover is categorized as secondary forest, and it is becoming increasingly important to consider secondary forests in addition to old-growth forest in conservation planning for biota. We reviewed the literature to synthesize information on amphibian and reptile communities during secondary forest succession. We summarized literature on mechanisms of community change during forest succession and conducted a meta-analysis to estimate effect sizes for species richness and abundance in human-modified landscapes (agriculture, pasture, and plantation) and old-growth forests compared to regenerating secondary forests. Studies reported strong support for differences in species composition among human-modified landscapes, secondary forest, and old-growth forest as well as species-specific responses to successional forest change. Secondary forest generally had higher species richness and abundance than human-modified landscapes, but lower species richness and abundance than old-growth forests. This result was more pronounced in amphibians than reptiles, and effect size of abundance was more variable than richness among studies. Secondary forests have better conservation value than altered habitats, but they do not necessarily hold the same conservation value for species as old-growth forest.

AB Herbivory-induced responses in plants can both negatively affect subsequently colonizing herbivores and mitigate the effect of herbivory on the host. However, it is still less known whether plants exhibit specific responses to specialist and generalist herbivores in non-secondary metabolite traits and how specificity to specialists and generalists differs between invasive and native plant populations. We exposed an invasive plant, Alternanthera philoxeroides, to Agasicles hygrophila (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae; specialist), Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae; generalist), manual clipping, or application of exogenous jasmonic acid and examined both the specificity of elicitation in traits of fitness (e.g., aboveground biomass), morphology (e.g., root:shoot ratio), and chemistry (e.g., C/N ratio and lignin), and specificity of effect on the subsequent performance of A.hygrophila and S.litura. Then, we assessed variation of the specificity between invasive and native populations (USA and Argentina, respectively). The results showed S.litura induced higher branching intensity and specific leaf area but lower C/N ratio than A.hygrophila, whereas A.hygrophila induced higher trichome density than S.litura. The negative effect of induction on subsequent larval growth was greater for S.litura than for A.hygrophila. Invasive populations had a weaker response to S.litura than to A.hygrophila in triterpenoid saponins and C/N ratio, while native populations responded similarly to these two herbivores. The specific effect on the two herbivores feeding on induced plants did not vary between invasive and native populations. Overall, we demonstrate specificity of elicitation to specialist and generalist herbivores in non-secondary metabolite traits, and that the generalist is more susceptible to induction than the specialist. Furthermore, chemical responses specific to specialist and generalist herbivores only exist in the invasive populations, consistent with an evolutionary change in specificity in the invasive populations.

AB Trade-offs between functional traits are ubiquitous in nature and can promote species coexistence depending on their shape. Classic theory predicts that convex trade-offs facilitate coexistence of specialized species with extreme trait values (extreme species) while concave trade-offs promote species with intermediate trait values (intermediate species). We show here that this prediction becomes insufficient when the traits translate non-linearly into fitness which frequently occurs in nature, e.g., an increasing length of spines reduces grazing losses only up to a certain threshold resulting in a saturating or sigmoid trait-fitness function. We present a novel, general approach to evaluate the effect of different trade-off shapes on species coexistence. We compare the trade-off curve to the invasion boundary of an intermediate species invading the two extreme species. At this boundary, the invasion fitness is zero. Thus, it separates trait combinations where invasion is or is not possible. The invasion boundary is calculated based on measurable trait-fitness relationships. If at least one of these relationships is not linear, the invasion boundary becomes non-linear, implying that convex and concave trade-offs not necessarily lead to different coexistence patterns. Therefore, we suggest a new ecological classification of trade-offs into extreme-favoring and intermediate-favoring which differs from a purely mathematical description of their shape. We apply our approach to a well-established model of an empirical predator-prey system with competing prey types facing a trade-off between edibility and half-saturation constant for nutrient uptake. We show that the survival of the intermediate prey depends on the convexity of the trade-off. Overall, our approach provides a general tool to make a priori predictions on the outcome of competition among species facing a common trade-off in dependence of the shape of the trade-off and the shape of the trait-fitness relationships.

AB 1. Invasive organisms often share characteristics that make them successful. Traits such as rapid growth and short generation times are classic "weed" phenotypes, such that invasive species often have r-selected rather than k-selected life histories. Given that invasive species often display "fast" life histories, invasive species may have relatively higher metabolic rates but systematic tests across taxa are lacking.
   2. We compared metabolic rate across 14 sessile invasive and native marine invertebrates. We also investigated the influence of growth form (erect vs. flat species) on the metabolic rate of these species, since growth form can also affect metabolic rate.
   3. For species with an erect growth form, we found an effect of invasive status on mass-specific metabolic rate. Invasive species had much higher mass-specific metabolic rates than native species and this was particularly pronounced for organisms with smaller body masses.
   4. Given that smaller-bodied invasive organisms are typically early-successional, "fugitive" species, a higher metabolic rate may allow a faster pace of life, enhancing their capacity to invade and reproduce in newly created disturbed habitats.

AB Although hunting is a key component of subsistence strategies of many Amazonians, it is also one of the greatest threats to wildlife. Because indigenous reserves comprise over 20% of Amazonia, effective conservation often requires that conservation professionals work closely with indigenous groups to manage resource use. We used hunter-generated harvesting data in spatially explicit biodemographic models to assess the sustainability of subsistence hunting of indigenous Waiwai in Guyana. We collected data through a hunter self-monitoring program, systematic follows of hunters, and semistructured interviews. We used these data to predict future densities of 2 indicator species, spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus) and bearded sakis (Chiropotes sagulatus), under different scenarios of human population expansion and changing hunting technology. We used encounter rates from transect surveys and hunter catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) to validate model predictions. Paca (Cuniculus paca) (198 /year), Currosaw (Crax alector) (168), and spider monkey (117) were the most frequently harvested species. Predicted densities of spider monkeys were statistically indistinguishable from empirically derived transect data (Kolmogorov-Smirnov D = 0.67, p = 0.759) and CPUE (D = 0.32, p = 1.000), demonstrating the robustness of model predictions. Ateles paniscus and C. sagulatus were predicted to be extirpated from <13% of the Waiwai reserve in 20 years, even under the most intensive hunting scenarios. Our results suggest Waiwai hunting is currently sustainable, primarily due to their low population density and use of bow and arrow. Continual monitoring is necessary, however, particularly if human population increases are accompanied by a switch to shotgun-only hunting. We suggest that hunter self-monitoring and biodemographic modeling can be used effectively in a comanagement approach in which indigenous parabiologists continuously provide hunting data that is then used to update model parameters and validate model predictions.

AB Tropical forests are three-dimensional spaces with species and resources heterogeneously distributed. The vertical stratification of tropical forest biotas has been observed for several organisms and regions, but, surprisingly, the vertical structuring of large areas of important tropical forests, such as Brazil's Atlantic Forest, remains poorly studied. Here, we addressed the use of different Atlantic Forest strata by bats, comparing ensemble composition and relative abundance between the understorey and the canopy. A total of 618 bats belonging to 31 species and four families were recorded, including 11 species of frugivores and seven species of gleaning insectivores, the two trophic guilds predominantly represented in our sampling. Fifteen species were captured exclusively in the canopy, and six exclusively in the understorey, and many of those species were represented by a low number of captures (<5). The bat species composition, richness and relative abundance between canopy and understorey strata varied. Chiroderma villosum was exclusively captured in the canopy, Artibeus lituratus was netted predominantly in the canopy and Carollia perspicillata and Desmodus rotundus were mostly captured in the understorey. Although processes such as resource partitioning between species and ecomorphological constraints may explain the differential use of forest strata, this remains little understood because of the scarcity of data for the Atlantic forest canopies.

AB Liana growth following forest disturbance is threatening the tropical carbon sink by delaying or preventing recovery. Tree growth can be stimulated by liana cutting; however, its applicability for conservation management remains uncertain, particularly in Africa (the least-studied continent for ecological restoration) and against pervasive barriers such as wildfires. We conducted a small-scale trial to investigate tree sapling regeneration following liana cutting in a lowland African forest prone to low intensity wildfires. We employed a BACI design comprising eighteen 25m(2) plots of sapling trees in liana-infested areas. After 5years of liana cutting, we saw greater recruitment, stem growth and net biomass. Wildfires caused 51% mortality and probably masked liana cutting influences on species and survival, but may have encouraged stem recruitment through interaction with liana cutting. Incorporating our data into a first quantitative review of previous studies, we found that tree growth, recruitment and net growth rates were all consistently higher where lianas were either absent or removed (respectively: 80%, 215%, 633%; n=14, 3, 4). Tree growth impacts were approximately equivalent across size-classes and continents. We give recommendations for improved plot and sample sizes, but conclude that liana cutting is a promising restoration method for lowland tropical forests, including Africa.

AB The Brazilian Amazon in the past decades has been suffering severe landscape alteration, mainly due to anthropogenic activities, such as road building and land clearing for agriculture. Using a high-resolution time series of land cover maps (classified as mature forest, non-forest, secondary forest) spanning from 1984 through 2011, and four uncorrelated fragmentation metrics (edge density, clumpiness index, area-weighted mean patch size and shape index), we examined the temporal and spatial dynamics of forest fragmentation in three study areas across the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus, Santar,m and Machadinho d'Oeste), inside and outside conservation units. Moreover, we compared the impacts on the landscape of: (1) different land uses (e.g. cattle ranching, crop production), (2) occupation processes (spontaneous vs. planned settlements) and (3) implementation of conservation units. By 2010/2011, municipalities located along the Arc of Deforestation had more than 55% of the remaining mature forest strictly confined to conservation units. Further, the planned settlement showed a higher rate of forest loss, a more persistent increase in deforested areas and a higher relative incidence of deforestation inside conservation units. Distinct agricultural activities did not lead to significantly different landscape structures; the accessibility of the municipality showed greater influence in the degree of degradation of the landscapes. Even with a high proportion of the landscapes covered by conservation units, which showed a strong inhibitory effect on forest fragmentation, we show that dynamic agriculturally driven economic activities, in municipalities with extensive road development, led to more regularly shaped, heavily fragmented landscapes, with higher densities of forest edge.

AB Background: The floodplain forests of Araguaia River, a clear-water river in the southeastern Amazon (Tocantins State, Brazil), are characterized by seasonal flooding up to 3.5 m height, low nutrient levels in the water, and seasonal drought periods of 4-5 months.
   Methods: We studied the forest dynamics (tree diameter growth, tree mortality and recruitment) of this unique forest ecosystem over a 5-year period by repeated censuses in 12 permanent plots established along a flooding gradient.
   Results: The cumulative basal area in the plots increased by 0.84 (+/- 0.45) m(2).ha(-1).yr(-1) (mean +/- SD) in the annually-flooded (AF) plots in lower terrain and by 0.69 (+/- 1.00) m(2).ha(-1).yr(-1) in the higher non-annually flooded (NAF) plots, corresponding to an aboveground biomass increase of 0.81 (+/- 0.57) and 0.69 (+/- 1.58) Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1) in the AF and NAF plots, indicating a recent carbon sink in the biomass. Mean diameter growth rate was 1.8 (+/- 0.44) mm.yr(-1) in the AF and 2.0 (+/- 0.56) mm.yr(-1) in the NAF plots (corresponding to a coarse wood production of 1.53 (+/- 1.29) and 2.02 (+/- 0.52) Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1)), indicating no flooding effect on radial growth. Mean mortality rates in the 5-year period were 1.9 (+/- 0.37)%.yr(-1) in the AF plots and 1.8 (+/- 0.87)%.yr(-1) in the NAF plots with no differences along the flooding gradient. Highest mortalities were registered in the AF plots for the 10-20 cm dbh class (2.4%.yr(-1)), likely as a consequence of flooding, and in the NAF plots for the 40-50 cm dbh class (3.0%.yr(-1)), probably mainly caused by ENSO-related droughts.
   Conclusions: We conclude that these drought-affected tropical floodplain forests have a lower standing biomass and aboveground productivity than central Amazonian floodplain forests in more humid climates, and the imprint of the flooding gradient on stand dynamics is relatively weak, which may result from the lower flooding height and the interaction of flooding with low nutrient supply and periodic drought.

AB Land-acquisition strategies employed by conservation organizations vary in their flexibility. Conservation-planning theory largely fails to reflect this by presenting models that are either extremely inflexibleparcel acquisitions are irreversible and budgets are fixedor extremely flexiblepreviously acquired parcels can readily be sold. This latter approach, the selling of protected areas, is infeasible or problematic in many situations. We considered the value to conservation organizations of increasing the flexibility of their land-acquisition strategies through their approach to financing deals. Specifically, we modeled 2 acquisition-financing methods commonly used by conservation organizations: borrowing and budget carry-over. Using simulated data, we compared results from these models with those from an inflexible fixed-budget model and an extremely flexible selling model in which previous acquisitions could be sold to fund new acquisitions. We then examined 3 case studies of how conservation organizations use borrowing and budget carry-over in practice. Model comparisons showed that borrowing and budget carry-over always returned considerably higher rewards than the fixed-budget model. How they performed relative to the selling model depended on the relative conservation value of past acquisitions. Both the models and case studies showed that incorporating flexibility through borrowing or budget carry-over gives conservation organizations the ability to purchase parcels of higher conservation value than when budgets are fixed without the problems associated with the selling of protected areas.

AB Twelve benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, including pavine and phenanthroindolizidine types, were isolated from a MeOH/CH2Cl2 extract of Cryptocarya laevigata (stem bark) through bioactivity-guided fractionation for antitumor effects. Selected compounds were evaluated for antiproliferative activity against five human tumor cell lines, including a multidrug-resistant subline. Since more common 2,3,8,9-tetrasubstituted pavine alkaloids, such as crychine (3), exhibit very mild or no cytotoxicity, this compound type has not been well investigated for antitumor activity. Thus, this report is the first discovery of a 7-hydroxylated pavine alkaloid, (-)-neocaryachine (1), to demonstrate strong antiproliferative activity, with IC50 values of 0.06 to 0.41 mu M against five tested tumor cell lines, including an MDR subline. Further mechanism of action studies revealed that 1 impacts the cellular S-phase by inducing DNA double-strand breaks.

AB The effectiveness of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) in Mexico may be reduced by a lack of guidance on intra-watershed priority zones and an overemphasis on water supply versus other services such as water quality. We explored the links between land use, water quality, and public health in central Veracruz. We identified zones of high and low cholera prevalence and evaluated the effects of land use on water quality at different scales. Production functions were used to evaluate relationships between water quality and public health. Additionally, using mitigation and defensive costs methods and a combined regression model, we estimated a marginal value per hectare of forest in avoiding public health costs associated with contaminated water. Prevalence of cholera was associated with E. coli. concentrations in streams. Primary forest cover was the land use most strongly correlated with E. coli., particularly within riparian corridors of 100 m width. Our results suggest a value of water quality regulation of at least $US 90 ha(-1) in riparian corridors. These results highlight the importance of targeting PES in priority areas within watersheds and considering both water quality and quantity as a means of increasing program efficiency and potentially broadening financial support for these programs.

AB The fragmentation and isolation of preserved habitat patches within intensive agricultural landscape threaten species survival in steppes. In Ukraine, < 5 % of the original steppe area has survived, mostly in nature reserves, loess ravines and kurgans (burial mounds). The latter are small, but relatively numerous objects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether plant species density (= the number of species per plot) within small steppe patches on kurgans differs from that within large steppe enclaves in southern Ukraine. Another aim was to determine the influence of patch area, isolation and heat load index on species density on kurgans. Presence-absence data for vascular plant species were collected on plots of a size of 100 and 1 m(2). Thirty kurgans and ten sites within large steppe enclaves were sampled. Every noted species was classified as specialist or generalist. For kurgans data on area and degree of isolation were collected. Additionally the heat load index for plots on kurgans was calculated. The density of habitat specialists was higher in larger steppe enclaves than on kurgans at both spatial scales. On kurgans the most important predictors of specialist density were isolation (negative) and kurgan area (positive). The density of generalists was positively affected by the heat load index. Kurgans can provide refuges for steppe plant species. However, our results show that over a longer time period, proximity to larger steppe refuges is important to maintain species diversity within these small patches.

AB Soil food web research has long recognized that real webs include a number of complexities often hidden in research focused on aboveground grazing webs. These complexities include nutrient recycling, omnivory (consuming more than one prey item) and multiple reticulated channels through which energy and resources flow. Increasing evidence in real and modeled food webs suggests a critical complexity of all webs is the presence of multi-channel feeding. Multi-channel feeding, or multi-channel omnivory, occurs when a consumer feeds across two energy channels: such as a consumer that eats both roots and detritus or bacteria and fungi. As growing empirical research has documented that multi-channel omnivores are the most common type of consumer in real webs, modeling studies have also highlighted that such omnivory can be stabilizing. Here I briefly review the evolving paradigm of multi-channel feeding in food webs and outline several major areas of research that could advance predictions of how common multi-channel feeding should be in soil food webs and its impacts on stability and trophic dynamics.

AB Over a 3 yr period fine-scale (m) movements of red snapper Lutjanus campechanus were estimated with the Vemco VR2W Positioning System (VPS) on 3 artificial reefs, and wider scale (km) movements were estimated with surrounding receivers (n = 23). Tagged red snapper (n = 56) were tracked for extended periods (17-1096 d). Residency (23 mo) and site fidelity (82% yr(-1)) showed that red snapper maintained a close association with the artificial reef structure (34.5 +/- 44.0 m). Fine-scale monthly home range (95% kernel density estimates [KDE]) and core areas (50% KDE) were positively correlated with water temperature. In the winter, all red snapper showed less movement, and during the warmer months most (63%, 29 out of 46) fish used a secondary reef site. Over diel periods, fish showed significantly greater movements during day hours on 2 reef sites and during night hours on 1 reef site. The surrounding receiver array validated 88% (15 of 17 fish) of the VPS-determined emigrations. Many (53%, n = 9) fish moved short distances (similar to 1.5 km) to nearby reefs, and some red snappers (n = 3) that emigrated returned to their original release site. Red snapper showed some prey-like behaviors, e. g. close association with reef structure, quick movements over open habitat, and paired emigrations to nearby sites. These behaviors suggested that red snapper are subject to predation by larger apex predators, and as stocks increase, such factors will become increasingly more important for future management.

AB We aimed to understand the effect of rock outcrops on the growth of Podocarpus lambertii within a microrefuge. Our hypothesis holds that the growth and survival of this species depend on the regional climate decoupling provided by rock outcrops. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the microclimate of (1) surrounding vegetation, (2) rock outcrop corridors, and (3) adjacencies. We assessed population structure by collecting data of specimen stem diameter and height. We also assessed differences between vegetation associated or not with outcrops using satellite imaging. For dendrochronological analyses, we sampled 42 individuals. Tree rings of 31 individuals were dated, and climate-growth relationships were tested. Rock outcrops produce a favorable microclimate by reducing average temperature by 4.9 degrees C and increasing average air humidity by 12 %. They also reduce the variability of atmospheric temperature by 42 % and air humidity by 20 % supporting a vegetation with higher leaf area index. Within this vegetation, specimen height was strongly constrained by the outcrop height. Although temperature and precipitation modulate this species growth, temperature-induced stress is the key limiting growth factor for this population of P. lambertii. We conclude that this species growth and survival depend on the presence of rock outcrops. These topography elements decouple regional climate in a favorable way for this species growth. However, these benefits are restricted to the areas sheltered by rock outcrops. Although this microrefuge supported P. lambertii growth so far, it is unclear whether this protection would be sufficient to withstand the stress of future climate changes.

AB Global marine biodiversity peaks within the Coral Triangle, and understanding how such high diversity is maintained is a central question in marine ecology. We investigated broad-scale patterns in the diversity of clownfishes and their host sea anemones by conducting 981 belt-transects at 20 locations throughout the Indo-Pacific. Of the 1508 clownfishes encountered, 377 fish occurred in interspecific cohabiting groups and cohabitation was almost entirely restricted to the Coral Triangle. Neither the diversity nor density of host anemone or clownfish species alone influenced rates of interspecific cohabitation. Rather cohabitation occurred in areas where the number of clownfish species exceeds the number of host anemone species. In the Coral Triangle, cohabiting individuals were observed to finely partition their host anemone, with the subordinate species inhabiting the periphery. Furthermore, aggression did not increase in interspecific cohabiting groups, instead dominant species were accepting of subordinate species. Various combinations of down fish species were observed cohabiting (independent of body size, phylogenetic relatedness, evolutionary age, dentition, level of specialization) in a range of anemone species, thereby ensuring that each clownfish species had dominant reproductive individuals in some cohabiting groups. Clownfishes are obligate commensals, thus cohabitation is an important process in maintaining biodiversity in high diversity systems because it supports the persistence of many species when host availability is limiting. Cohabitation is a likely explanation for high species richness in other obligate commensals within the Coral Triangle, and highlights the importance of protecting these habitats in order to conserve unique marine biodiversity.

AB The combined effect of ocean acidification and warming is expected to have significant effects on several traits of marine organisms. The gastropod Concholepas concholepas is a rocky shore keystone predator characteristic of the south-eastern Pacific coast of South America and an important natural resource exploited by small-scale artisanal fishermen along the coast of Chile and Peru. In this study, we used small juveniles of C. concholepas collected from the rocky intertidal habitats of southern Chile (39 degrees S) to evaluate under laboratory conditions the potential consequences of projected near-future levels of ocean acidification and warming for important early ontogenetic traits. The individuals were exposed long-term (5.8 months) to contrasting pCO(2) (ca. 500 and 1400 mu atm) and temperature (15 and 19 degrees C) levels. After this period we compared body growth traits, dislodgement resistance, predator-escape response, self-righting and metabolic rates. With respect to these traits there was no evidence of a synergistic interaction between pCO(2) and temperature. Shell growth was negatively affected by high pCO(2) levels only at 15 degrees C. High pCO(2) levels also had a negative effect on the predator-escape response. Conversely, dislodgement resistance and self-righting were positively affected by high pCO(2) levels at both temperatures. High tenacity and fast self-righting would reduce predation risk in nature and might compensate for the negative effects of high pCO(2) levels on other important defensive traits such as shell size and escape behaviour. We conclude that climate change might produce in C. concholepas positive and negative effects in physiology and behaviour. In fact, some of the behavioural responses might be a consequence of physiological effects, such as changes in chemosensory capacity (e.g. predator-escape response) or secretion of adhesive mucous (e.g. dislodgement resistance). Moreover, we conclude that positive behavioural responses may assist in the adaptation to negative physiological impacts, and that this may also be the case for other benthic organisms.

AB Although genetics in a single species is known to impact whole communities, little is known about how genetic variation influences species interaction networks in complex ecosystems. Here, we examine the interactions in a community of arthropod species on replicated genotypes (clones) of a foundation tree species, Populus angustifolia James (narrowleaf cottonwood), in a long-term, common garden experiment using a bipartite genotype-species network perspective. We combine this empirical work with a simulation experiment designed to further investigate how variation among individual tree genotypes can impact network structure. Three findings emerged: (1) the empirical genotype-species network exhibited significant network structure with modularity being greater than the highly conservative null model; (2) as would be expected given a modular network structure, the empirical network displayed significant positive arthropod co-occurrence patterns; and (3) furthermore, the simulations of genotype-species networks displayed variation in network structure, with modularity in particular clearly increasing, as genotypic variation increased. These results support the conclusion that genetic variation in a single species contributes to the structure of ecological interaction networks, which could influence ecological dynamics (e.g., assembly and stability) and evolution in a community context.

AB Central European calcareous grasslands are considered biodiversity hotspots, but are severely threatened by the change in land-use and by habitat fragmentation. Coniferous forests are typical adjacent habitats to calcareous grasslands, as abandoned calcareous grasslands are often afforested or develop into coniferous forests by succession. To investigate spillover between calcareous grasslands and coniferous forests, a total of 144 pitfall traps for carabid beetles were placed at three different distances (1, 5, 20 m) from the edge in both habitats at eight locations from April to late August. We found that both habitats had a distinct species assemblage and a decrease in spillover with increasing distance from the habitat edge into the adjacent habitat. Calcareous grasslands were more affected by spillover from the adjacent coniferous forests than vice versa because more forest specialists penetrated into calcareous grasslands than grassland specialists penetrated into coniferous forests. We conclude that spillover into small and isolated habitats can severely change species assemblages, which has to be considered in conservation measures. The protection of large sites with small edge-interior ratios can reduce negative effects on species assemblages in endangered calcareous grasslands.

AB The diversity-stability relationship has been under intense scrutiny for the past decades, and temporal asynchrony is recognized as an important aspect of ecosystem stability. In contrast to relatively well-studied interannual and seasonal asynchrony, few studies investigate the role of circadian cycles for ecosystem stability. Here, we studied multifunctional redundancy of diurnal and nocturnal ant communities in four tropical rain forest sites. We analyzed how it was influenced by species richness, functional performance, and circadian asynchrony. In two neotropical sites, species richness and functional redundancy were lower at night. In contrast, these parameters did not differ in the two paleotropical sites we studied. Circadian asynchrony between species was pronounced in the neotropical sites, and increased circadian functional redundancy. In general, species richness positively affected functional redundancy, but the effect size depended on the temporal and spatial breadth of the species with highest functional performance. Our analysis shows that high levels of trophic performance were only reached through the presence of such high-performing species, but not by even contributions of multiple, less-efficient species. Thus, these species can increase current functional performance, but reduce overall functional redundancy. Our study highlights that diurnal and nocturnal ecosystem properties of the very same habitat can markedly differ in terms of species richness and functional redundancy. Consequently, like the need to study multiple ecosystem functions, multiple periods of the circadian cycle need to be assessed in order to fully understand the diversity-stability relationship in an ecosystem.

Tree ring width chronologies of Tectona grandis (teak) and Pinus caribaea (Caribbean pine) trees were compared with local (Water Requirement Satisfaction Index-WRSI, Standardized Precipitation Index-SPI, and Palmer Drought Severity Index-PDSI) and large-scale climate indices that analyze the equatorial pacific sea surface temperature (Trans-Nino Index-TNI and Nino-3.4-N3.4) and atmospheric circulation variations in the Southern Hemisphere (Antarctic Oscillation-AAO). Teak trees showed positive correlation with three indices in the current summer and fall. A significant correlation between WRSI index and Caribbean pine was observed in the dry season preceding tree ring formation. The influence of large-scale climate patterns was observed only for TNI and AAO, where there was a radial growth reduction in months preceding the growing season with positive values of the TNI in teak trees and radial growth increase (decrease) during December (March) to February (May) of the previous (current) growing season with positive phase of the AAO in teak (Caribbean pine) trees. The development of a new dendroclimatological study in Southeastern Brazil sheds light to local and large-scale climate influence on tree growth in recent decades, contributing in future climate change studies.

AB Biochar incorporation in agricultural soils has been proposed as a climate change mitigation strategy and has proved to substantially increase crop productivity via physical, chemical and biological mechanisms. The changes induced in soil properties are known to have a direct impact on soil ecosystem with consequences for soil biota community that, in turn, can influence biochar aging in soil. Despite several studies investigated in the interplay between biochar and soil microbiology, there is a clear lack of information on groups that live in the most superficial ground layers: soil meso and macro fauna. These groups are of great importance if we consider that biochar application should ideally be located in the soil's surface layer (0-30 cm). Our study is the first attempt to investigate the interactions between biochar soil amendments and aboveground soil macro-meso fauna in a field crop. This was made setting-up a randomized-block experiment on a processing tomato crop in northern Italy, using three different biochar types and periodically monitoring soil parameters and fauna abundances along the crop growing cycle in summer 2013. Results show that the impact of biochar application on soil fauna as a whole is small when compared to that of agricultural management, suggesting that this amendment does not have short-term ecological interferences. Nevertheless, ants exhibited variations in abundances and distribution connected to properties of amended soils such as temperature, pH and humidity, proving that they can be effectively used as a target group in the study of interactions between biochar and soil biota.

AB Although patellid limpets are influential grazers on many shores, few studies have characterised their diets in detail. These key species can be found as dominant grazers on rocky shores, but this ecosystem is being transformed due to the increase in infrastructures such as jetties, breakwaters or seawalls by commercial, residential and tourist activities. Increasing knowledge about the ecological effects of these artificial substrates on marine environments is available, and many papers have reported that urban infrastructures support different biota and assemblages and do not act as a surrogate for natural rocky shores. However, little is known about the effect of artificial substrata on marine trophic ecology. The aim of the study was to explore the influence of artificial substrata (breakwaters) on the dietary composition of the common grazer Patella caerulea, to provide data about food resource availability, and its influence on the trophic ecology of limpets. A nested design was used to explore potential differences between natural and artificial shores in Algeciras Bay (Strait of Gibraltar). Additionally, the dietary composition of the endangered limpets Cymbula safiana and Patella ferruginea was studied in a single site. Analyses of the chlorophyll a concentration of the substrate did not show differences between substrata. The analysis of the rock surface by SEM indicated a general prevalence of diatoms and cyanoprokaryotes on all of the substrata. P. caerulea specimens collected from artificial substrata showed a lower number of consumed taxa than those collected from natural rocky shores, whereas the assemblages found in the gut contents also differed between artificial and natural substrata. The diet richness of the three species might be due to the differences in the position of the species on the shore. Our results suggest that limpets are a key group in the top-down control of meiofaunal and macrofaunal populations, due to the presence of several animal taxa in their gut contents in this study, despite the fact that they have traditionally been considered herbivorous grazers that regulate only algal populations in the intertidal regions.

AB Conversion of agricultural land to forest plantations is a major driver of global change. Studies on the impact of forest plantations on biodiversity in plantations and in the surrounding native vegetation have been inconclusive. Consequently, it is not known how to best manage the extensive areas of the planet currently covered by plantations. We used a novel, long-term (16 years) and large-scale (30,000 ha) landscape transformation natural experiment (the Nanangroe experiment, Australia) to test the effects of land conversion on population dynamics of 64 bird species associated with woodland and forest. A unique aspect of our study is that we focused on the effects of plantations on birds in habitat patches within plantations. Our study design included 56 treatment sites (Eucalyptus patches where the surrounding matrix was converted from grazed land to pine plantations), 55 control sites (Eucalyptus patches surrounded by grazed land), and 20 matrix sites (sites within the pine plantations and grazed land). Bird populations were studied through point counts, and colonization and extinction patterns were inferred through multiple season occupancy models. Large-scale pine plantation establishment affected the colonization or extinction patterns of 89% of studied species and thus led to a comprehensive turnover in bird communities inhabiting Eucalyptus patches embedded within the maturing plantations. Smaller bodied species appeared to respond positively to plantations (i.e., colonization increased and extirpation of these species decreased in patches surrounded by plantations) because they were able to use the newly created surrounding matrix. We found that the effects of forest plantations affected the majority of the bird community, and we believe these effects could lead to the artificial selection of one group of species at the expense of another.

AB Burnings, which cause major changes to the environment, can be effectively monitored via satellite data, regarding both the identification of active fires and the estimation of burned areas. Among the many orbital sensors suitable for mapping burned areas on global and regional scales, the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), on board the Terra and Aqua platforms, has been the most widely utilized. In this study, the performance of the MODIS MCD45A1 burned area product was thoroughly evaluated in the Brazilian savanna, the second largest biome in South America and a global biodiversity hotspot, characterized by a conspicuous climatic seasonality and the systematic occurrence of natural and anthropogenic fires. Overall, September MCD45A1 polygons (2000-2012) compared well to the Landsat-based reference mapping (r(2) = 0.92) and were closely accompanied, on a monthly basis, by MOD14 and MYD14 hotspots (r(2) = 0.89), although large omissions errors, linked to landscape patterns, structures, and overall conditions depicted in each reference image, were observed. In spite of its spatial and temporal limitations, the MCD45A1 product proved instrumental for mapping and understanding fire behavior and impacts on the Cerrado landscapes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Agroforestry systems are widely recognized as an important way to address numerous environmental challenges in tropical areas. They represent a sustainable alternative form of land-use for small-scale agriculture, responding to the economic development needs of communities and offering a number of ecosystem services. This article presents an evaluation of the short- and medium-term profitability of two experimental agroforestry systems where fruit trees are predominant, which were established in 2009 in the Tapajos region of the Brazilian Amazon, state of Para. An analysis of net present value (NPV) confirms that the two experimental systems studied recover their total implementation and operating costs within a 20 years time horizon. These results underlie that prices of inputs are stable and farmers have access to markets, credit, and agricultural knowledge. The two experimental systems are compared to plots under traditional slash- and-burn cultivation, and Bragantino system. The results support changes to public policies in order to facilitate alternatives to slash- and-burn cultivation by supporting access to credit, knowledge of alternative agricultural practices, transportation systems, and industries that transform agricultural products. The consideration of ecosystem services should add a supplementary argument in favour of policies that promote agroforestry systems and thus limit the practice of slash- and-burn subsistence agriculture.

AB Leaf-cutting ants modify the properties of the soil adjacent to their nests. Here, we examined whether such an ant-altered environment impacts the belowground fungal communities. Fungal diversity and community structure of soil from the fungus garden chambers of Atta sexdens rubropilosa and Atta bisphaerica, two widespread leaf-cutting ants in Brazil, were determined and compared with non-nest soils. Culture-dependent methods revealed similar species richness but different community compositions between both types of soils. Penicillium janthinellum and Trichoderma spirale were the prevalent isolates in fungus chamber soils and non-nest soils, respectively. In contrast to cultivation methods, analyses of clone libraries based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region indicated that richness of operational taxonomic units significantly differed between soils of the fungus chamber and non-nest soils. FastUnifrac analyses based on ITS sequences further revealed a clear distinction in the community structure between both types of soils. Plectania milleri and an uncultured Clavariaceae fungus were prevalent in fungus chamber soils and non-nest soils, respectively. FastUnifrac analyses also revealed that fungal community structures of soil from the garden chambers markedly differed among ant species. Our findings suggest that leaf-cutting ants affect fungal communities in the soil from the fungus chamber in comparison to non-nest soils.

AB Tree species richness changes along elevation gradients in response to underlying environmental conditions. Our hypothesis was that richness is associated with climatic variables and decreases with elevation. The objective was to identify trends in species, genus and family richness, diversity and vegetation structure in relation to climate variables along an elevation gradient with successive types of forest in Veracruz, Mexico. Trees were identified and measured in 0.1 ha at 15 sites located from 140 to 4000 m a.s.l. Generalized linear models were used to fit richness, diversity, basal area and density as a function of elevation; the best model was selected using Akaike's Information Criterion. Multivariate analyses were used to explore climatic variables associated to composition of groups of sites along the gradient. Along the entire elevation gradient, species, genus and family richness decreased unimodally, and diversity decreased monotonically. Richness was positively correlated with temperature but not with precipitation. Basal area increased monotonically and highest basal area was associated with high humidity and certain tree species (Quercus and Abies). Ordinations indicated three groups of sites: lower elevation dry forest associated with temperature seasonality, mid-elevation cloud forest associated with precipitation-related variables, and coniferous forest at the top of the gradient associated with elevation. Our study shows that different plant communities are associated with certain climatic conditions and harbour different tree species, genera and families. The results support the hypothesis that species richness is associated with climate, and decreases with elevation.

AB QuestionIn fragmented forests, edge effects lead to changes in the distribution of plant species. In particular, tropical forest edges are increasingly dominated by lianas. Will this increase in lianas lead to changes in their interactions with other plant morphological groups? If so, will this alter the local distributions and abundance of other species?
   LocationPlots located at increasing distances from the nearest forest edge and in remnant fragments of rain forest in the Atherton Tablelands, far northeast Queensland, Australia.
   MethodsWe mapped the distribution of trees, lianas and epiphytic ferns to better understand the role of forest disturbance in shaping their competitive and facilitative interactions. We then used specific spatial point-process analyses to examine the effects of the spatial distribution of trees on the presence and abundance of lianas and epiphytic ferns.
   ResultsTree aggregation near forest edges was lower than that in the interior. The higher abundance of lianas near edges was associated with increased spatial segregation between lianas and epiphytic ferns. This segregation suggests there is competition between these two functional groups, and that lianas, being much more abundant, probably outcompete epiphytic ferns.
   ConclusionsThe ability of lianas to thrive in disturbed tropical rain forests appears to reduce the abundance of epiphytic ferns, probably via direct competition for space. Epiphytic ferns provide unique microclimates and harbour much biodiversity, and their decline could negatively affect many animals and plants that rely upon them.

AB Understanding the ecological factors regulating exploited natural communities is important in establishing conservation and management strategies. Since the 1960s, artisanal fishermen have harvested up to 300 000 dry tons yr(-1) of wild populations of Lessonia spp. kelps. Adult kelps form a key habitat on the rocky shores of Chile, and benthic grazers regulate kelp populations by grazing or bulldozing microscopic and juvenile stages. To establish the role of the grazer assemblage in the recovery of kelp stands following harvesting, we conducted a manipulative experiment simulating artisanal kelp extraction and then manipulating the presence of grazers. We followed community succession and spatial distribution of L. berteroana recruits in manipulated and control rocky shore platforms for ca. 12 mo. Inter-individual distances of recruits and spatial autocorrelation analyses showed that the presence of grazers determined a patchy distributional pattern of L. berteroana. The aggregated spatial pattern of kelp recruits in the presence of grazers was followed by numerous coalescence events between small holdfasts, but no coalescence events were observed between recruits in the grazer removal areas. Our results suggest that grazing and recruit coalescence play an important role in the recovery of kelp stands following artisanal harvesting. Incorporating these processes into conservation and management strategies may bolster current strategies, which are based solely on the spatial structure of kelp stands.

AB A long standing hypothesis in biogeography is that latitudinal gradients in plant defenses (LGPD) should arise because selection for plant defenses is greater in the tropics compared to temperate areas. Previous studies have focused on plant traits thought to confer resistance, yet many traits may not actually confer resistance (putative resistance) or interact to influence herbivore performance. In this study, I used a multi-trophic approach to examine relationships between latitude, herbivore pressure, and plant resistance (measured as the growth rates of herbivores) of two old-field plant species (Solanum carolinense and Solidago altissima) using a field survey across a 12 degree gradient in the eastern US combined with laboratory bioassays measuring the performance of generalist and specialist herbivores. I used structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect pathways by which latitude influences herbivore pressure and plant resistance. A latitudinal gradient in plant damage was observed in the expected direction for S. caroliense (damage decreased with latitude), but the opposite relationship was observed for S. altissima. Damage to both plant species was mediated by herbivore abundances, which was in turn influenced by predator abundances. Resistance to herbivores also varied with latitude but the form of the relationship was dependent on herbivore and plant species. There were direct, non-linear relationships between latitude and resistance (for Spodoptera exigua and Schistocerca americana feeding on S. altissima; S. exigua and Manduca sexta feeding on S. carolinense). Herbivore growth rates were also mediated by the density of S. carolinense for Leptinotarsa juncta and S. americana feeding on S. carolinense. There was no relationship between plant resistance and herbivore pressure and no indication of feedbacks. Results from this study indicate that latitudinal variation in plant resistance is complex, possibly constrained by resource availability and tradeoffs in plant defenses.

AB The district of Kodagu, also called Coorg, in the Western Ghats of India produces 2% of the world's coffee, the expansion and intensification of which have reduced the forest cover by more than 30% in 20 years. Innovative actions are therefore urgently required to link economic development and biodiversity conservation, and stakeholders are exploring three strategies to add value to coffee from Coorg and prevent further biodiversity erosion: registration of trademarks; geographical indications; and environmental certification, via eco-labels. This article analyses their respective strengths and weaknesses and discusses the synergies between them.

AB Aim Patterns that relate species richness with fragment area (the species-area relationship, SAR) and with isolation (the species-isolation relationship, SIR) are well documented. However, those that relate species density - the number of species within a standardized area - with fragment area (D-SAR) or isolation (D-SIR) have not been sufficiently explored, despite the potential for such an analysis to disentangle the underlying mechanisms of SARs and SIRs. Previous spatial theory predicts that a significant D-SAR or D-SIR is unlikely to emerge in taxa with high dispersal limitation, such as plants. Furthermore, a recent model predicts that the detection and the significance of D-SARs or D-SIRs may decrease with grain size. We combined a literature review with grain size-dependent sampling in a fragmented landscape to evaluate the prevalence and grain size-dependent nature of D-SARs and D-SIRs in plants. Location Worldwide (review) and a semi-arid agro-ecosystem in Israel (case study). Methods We combined an extensive literature review of 31 D-SAR studies of plants in fragmented landscapes with an empirical study in which we analysed grain size-dependent D-SARs and D-SIRs using a grain size-dependent hierarchical sampling of species density and species richness in a fragmented, semi-arid agro-ecosystem. Results We found that significantly increasing D-SARs are rare in plant studies. Furthermore, we found that the detection of a significant D-SAR is often possible only after the data have been stratified by species, habitat or landscape characteristics. The results from our case study indicated that the significance and the slopes of both D-SARs and D-SIRs increase as grain size decreases. Main conclusions These results call for a careful consideration of scale while analysing and interpreting the responses of species richness and species density to fragmentation. Our results suggest that grain size-dependent analyses of D-SARs and D-SIRs may help to disentangle the mechanisms that generate SARs and SIRs and may enable early detection of the effects of fragmentation on plant biodiversity.

AB Questions
   At millennial scales, is the historic evolution of tropical plant communities the result of 'random walk'? Are presence and abundance of taxa independent of environmental variability?
   Location
   Lake Peten-Itza, Guatemala, Central American lowlands.
   Methods
   We use an 86000-yr-long pollen record to study the relative contribution of neutral mechanisms and environmental determinism in configuring vegetation in the Central American lowlands. By using variance ratios, we evaluated the role of neutral drift at community and functional group levels. Additionally, regression analyses were applied to explain persistence and abundance of individual taxa as a function of regional moisture availability and fire frequency.
   Results
   Environmental fluctuations drove vegetation dynamics in the Central American lowlands during the late Pleistocene. When the data set was stratified according to moisture availability and fire frequency, variance ratios further supported our findings. Regression analyses revealed that whereas species' presence was independent of both moisture availability and fire frequency, their abundance was closely associated with both.
   Conclusions
   Neutrality, probably expressed in the face of stressors, through factors such as the existence of microrefugia, survival of relictual individuals and phenotypic and phenologic plasticity, was probably crucial in preventing biodiversity losses. Climate, however, was the main driver of vegetation dynamics in the Yucatan Peninsula during the late Pleistocene.

AB In arid ecosystems, evapotranspiration generally exceeds precipitation, preventing deep drainage and groundwater recharge. We propose that vegetation changes associated with the establishment of pastoralist settlements (i.e. livestock stations) can disrupt the ecological and hydrological linkages in arid groundwater-coupled ecosystems of the Monte desert (Argentina), allowing local groundwater recharge and nitrate leaching to the aquifer, affecting groundwater quality. We tested this hypothesis by analysing vegetation, land use indicators, water and nitrate dynamics in three pairs of livestock stations and relatively undisturbed control woodlands. Livestock stations had lower vegetation and dead wood but higher dung covers than control woodlands, indicating soil and vegetation changes associated to land use. Water and nitrate dynamics were also affected by land use. Soil nitrate and water contents sampled down to the water table were higher, and soil chloride and salinity were lower in livestock stations, indicating higher water percolation and N input/transport rates. Higher groundwater nitrate concentrations in livestock stations indicate that these areas behave as foci of N and water export from ecosystems to the phreatic aquifer. Our study supports the idea that vegetation in arid areas prevents downward surface-groundwater interactions, but it also indicates that human modifications of vegetation disrupt this control, reducing soil water consumption and allowing vertical movement of water and solutes to the aquifer, which can modify groundwater quality. Disruptions of ecological processes by livestock activities clearly affect the hydrological links between surface and groundwater. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The vertical zonation patterns of intertidal organisms have been topics of interest to marine ecologists for many years, with interspecific food competition being implicated as a contributing factor to intertidal community organization. In this study, we used behavioral bioassays to examine the potential roles that interspecific aggression and food competition have on the structuring of intertidal hermit crab assemblages. We studied two ecologically similar, sympatric hermit crab species, Clibanarius digueti [1] and Paguristes perrieri [2], which occupy adjacent zones within the intertidal region of the Gulf of California. During the search phase of foraging, C. digueti showed higher frequencies of aggressive behaviors than P. perrieri. In competition assays, C. digueti gained increased access to food resources compared to P. perrieri. The results suggest that food competition may play an important role in structuring intertidal hermit crab assemblages, and that the zonation patterns of Gulf of California hermit crab species may be the result of geographical displacement by the dominant food competitor (C. digueti).

AB Edge effects are an inevitable and important consequence of forest loss and fragmentation. These effects include changes in species biology and biogeography. Here we examine variations in body mass and morphometrics for 2 sympatric species of mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus and M. ravelobensis) between edge and interior habitats in the dry deciduous forest at Ankarafantsika National Park. Between May and August 2012, we conducted mark-recapture experiments on mouse lemurs trapped along edge and interior forest transects within continuous forest adjacent to a large savannah. Of the 34 M. murinus captured during our study, 82% (n = 28) were trapped in interior habitats. Conversely, 72% (n = 47) of M. ravelobensis were captured in edge habitats. We found that mean body mass of M. murinus and M. ravelobensis did not differ between edge and interior habitats. However, female M. ravelobensis weighed significantly more in edge habitats (56.09 +/- 1.74 g) than in interior habitats (48.14 +/- 4.44 g). Our study provides some of the first evidence of sex differences in edge responses for a primate species. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Logging in tropical forests may create large canopy openings. These gaps provide suitable conditions for some opportunistic shrubs and herbs to take advantage of the surge in resources and rapidly colonize disturbed sites. This dense plant cover may limit forest regeneration by interfering with tree seedling establishment, growth, and survival by altering the light and nutrients available to seedlings, modifying herbivore behavior, or a number of other factors. In Kibale National Park (Uganda), old logging sites are mainly covered by dense stands of Acanthus pubescens Engl., which appear to inhibit tree regeneration. We wanted to identify the ecological processes underlying this regeneration collapse. To do so, we designed a factorial experiment to evaluate the influences of herbivory and vegetation cover on the growth and survival of tree seedlings. We compared the survival and growth of transplanted tree seedlings in A. pubescens stands and logged forests, in the presence or absence of the understory vegetation layer (logged forest) or vegetation cover (A. pubescens), and with or without herbivory. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that herbivory is significantly higher under dense A. pubescens cover. Seedling survival was not influenced by the environment. Seedling growth, however, was positively influenced by the removal of A. pubescens, suggesting that changes in resource availability associated with the presence of A. pubescens, may be important for regeneration. Our results suggest that sustained cutting of A. pubescens cover could foster the growth of established seedlings and could lead to tree regeneration and habitat restoration.

AB Tree mortality in tropical forests is a complex ecological process for which modelling approaches need to be improved to better understand, and then predict, the evolution of tree mortality in response to global change. The mortality model introduced here computes an individual probability of dying for each tree in a community. The mortality model uses the ontogenetic stage of the tree because youngest and oldest trees are more likely to die. Functional traits are integrated as proxies of the ecological strategies of the trees to permit generalization among all species in the community. Data used to parametrize the model were collected at Paracou study site, a tropical rain forest in French Guiana, where 20,408 trees have been censused for 18 years. A Bayesian framework was used to select useful covariates and to estimate the model parameters. This framework was developed to deal with sources of uncertainty, including the complexity of the mortality process itself and the field data, especially historical data for which taxonomic determinations were uncertain. Uncertainty about the functional traits was also considered, to maximize the information they contain. Four functional traits were strong predictors of tree mortality: wood density, maximum height, laminar toughness and stem and branch orientation, which together distinguished the light-demanding, fast-growing trees from slow-growing trees with lower mortality rates. Our modelling approach formalizes a complex ecological problem and offers a relevant mathematical framework for tropical ecologists to process similar uncertain data at the community level.

AB We examined the relationships between distance-to-edge and environmental factors inferred from mean plant indicator values across large distance-to-edge and patch size gradients. Floristic composition, landscape metrics and site variables (climate, soil and forest management) were collected on 19,989 plots in 1,801 forest patches in Northern France using the French National Forest Inventory. Statistical models were applied to mean plant indicator values (MIV) from Ellenberg and Ecoplant databases for soil pH, soil nitrogen (N), soil humidity (F), light (L) and air temperature (Ta) using distance-to-edge and forest patch size as predictors. The five mean indicator values significantly varied with distance-to-edge and MIV pH, N and Ta decreased over distances in excess of 500 m. Consistent very long edge-to-interior gradients were also detected for site variables. The distance-to-edge effect remained significant after controlling for site differences, especially for MIV pH and N. Significant edge-to-core gradients of MIV were detected over much larger ranges than previously recognised. Neither the presence of an ecological boundary between forest and the surrounding matrix, nor microclimate, soil or forest management heterogeneity within forest patches can fully explain this long edge-to-interior gradient observed in MIV. Two hypotheses are discussed for MIV pH and N: (1) soil eutrophication, due to atmospheric N deposition, which could occur deeper into forest-cores than previously acknowledged; (2) land use legacies, as the periphery of ancient forests is more often occupied by recent forests where former agricultural practices have irreversibly modified topsoil properties. Land use history data would help identify the drivers underlying these long-range edge gradients.

AB Recruitment limitations determine forest community regeneration patterns. Source limitation and dispersal limitation contribute to overall seed limitation, while environmental conditions and habitat associations influence establishment limitation. Several hypotheses have made contradictory predictions for how the relative importance of these limitations should vary with diversity. However, comparative data have not been available for low-diversity tropical forests. We quantified recruitment limitations using 2.5 yrs of seed rain and seedling distribution data collected within a 4 ha forest dynamics plot in low-diversity native-dominated Hawaiian wet forest. We further quantified seedling irradiance and substrate habitat associations and niche overlap (using Pianka's niche overlap index). Additionally, we compared recruitment limitations and the frequency of seedling habitat associations across forests using the few available published data from sites employing similar field and analytical methods. In Hawaiian wet forest, seed dispersal more strongly limited recruitment than did establishment limitation across species, with 11 of 18 species completely seed limited (i.e., no seeds found). However, the relative importance of limitations varied greatly among species. For the three most abundant species, habitat conditions more strongly limited regeneration than did seed arrival, especially for the dominant canopy species, Metrosideros polymorpha, which was not seed limited. Most species were significantly associated with specific ranges of irradiance and/or substrates. Although habitat associations may indicate niche differentiation, Hawaiian species also showed significant niche overlap. Across the three forests compared, community-wide mean seed and establishment limitation values were similar, despite wide variation in diversity. However, recruitment limitations differed strongly among species within forests due to species' life-history differences. While seed limitation in Hawaiian forest was as high as in high-diversity forests, mechanisms may differ; seed limitation in Hawaii may arise from loss of pollinators and dispersers rather than from a high proportion of rare species as occurs in high-diversity forests. The strong habitat associations in Hawaiian forest relative to high-diversity forests supported theoretical expectations that lower species diversity should increase the importance of habitat associations. However, these habitat associations were not linked to niche differentiation in Hawaii. Our findings suggest that high recruitment limitation may facilitate coexistence despite niche overlap in low-diversity Hawaiian forest.

AB Conservation of undisturbed natural forests, which are important for biodiversity, carbon storage, and other ecosystem services, affects agricultural production and cropland expansion. We analyze the economic impacts of undisturbed natural forest conservation programs on agriculture and the magnitude of avoided deforestation and avoided carbon emissions in the tropics. We apply a global agricultural land use model to estimate changes in agricultural production costs for the period 2015-2055. Our forest conservation scenarios reflect two different policy goals: either maximize forest carbon storage or minimize impacts on agricultural production. In all the scenarios, the economic impacts on agriculture are relatively low. Production costs would increase due to forest conservation by a maximum of 4%, predominantly driven by increased investments in agricultural productivity increase. We also show regional differences in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, due to different growth rates in food demand, land availability and crop productivity. The area of avoided deforestation does not exceed 1.5 million ha yr(-1) in the period 2015-2055, while avoided carbon emissions reach a maximum of 1.9 Gt CO2 per year. According to our results on the potential changes in agricultural production costs, undisturbed natural forest conservation appears to be a low-cost option for greenhouse gas emission reduction.

AB Periodic matrix models are frequently used to describe cyclic temporal variation (seasonal or interannual) and to account for the operation of multiple processes (e.g., demography and dispersal) within a single projection interval. In either case, the models take the form of periodic matrix products. The perturbation analysis of periodic models must trace the effects of parameter changes, at each phase of the cycle, on output variables that are calculated over the entire cycle. Here, we apply matrix calculus to obtain the sensitivity and elasticity of scalar-, vector-, or matrix-valued output variables. We apply the method to linear models for periodic environments (including seasonal harvest models), to vec-permutation models in which individuals are classified by multiple criteria, and to nonlinear models including both immediate and delayed density dependence. The results can be used to evaluate management strategies and to study selection gradients in periodic environments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Temperature is a primary determinant for species geographic ranges. In the context of global warming, most attention focuses upon the potential effects of heat stress on the future distribution of ectothermic species. Much less attention has, however, been given to cold thermal stress although it also sets species thermal window limits, hence distribution ranges. This study was conducted in winter on a South-Australian rocky shore in order to investigate the potential thermal benefits of the aggregation behavior observed in the dominant gastropod Nerita atramentosa. Thermal imaging was used to measure the body temperatures of 3681 aggregated individuals and 226 solitary individuals, and surrounding substratum temperature. N. atramentosa aggregates and solitary individuals were significantly warmer than their surrounding substratum. The temperature deviation between aggregates and substratum was, however, ca. 2 degrees C warmer than the one observed between solitary individuals and substratum. This result is critical since a body temperature increase of only a few degrees might enhance individual performance, hence organismal fitness, and could potentially drive changes in interspecific relationships. Besides, the potential higher thermal inertia of aggregates might increase the snail adaptive ability to abrupt environmental changes. We further investigate the potential thermal heterogeneity within an aggregate in order to identify any thermally advantageous position. Patch centers are significantly warmer than their edges, hence snails experience greater thermal advantages in the aggregate center. Finally, we examined the potential effect of aggregate size on snail temperature and thermal spatial heterogeneity. We identified an aggregate size threshold (216 individuals) beyond which all snails had equal thermal benefits, regardless of their spatial positions within an aggregate. While the determinism of this aggregate size threshold requires further investigations, the present work uniquely identified the thermal benefits of aggregation behavior for intertidal ectotherms under cold weather conditions. The implications of the present finding are discussed in the general framework of the ability of ectothermic populations to face environmental changes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation as a consequence of human activities is a worldwide phenomenon and one of the major threats to global biodiversity. Habitat loss and fragmentation is particularly a concern in the biodiverse tropics, where deforestation is occurring at unprecedented rates. Although insects are one of the most diverse and functionally important groups in tropical ecosystems, the quantitative effect of landscape features on their gene flow remains unknown. Here, we used a robust landscape genetics approach to quantify the effect of ten landscape features (deforestation, mature forests, other forest types, the River Chagres, streams, stream banks, roads, sea, lakes and swamps) and interactions between them, on the gene flow of a neotropical forest keystone species, the army ant Eciton burchellii. The influence of landscape on E.burchellii's gene flow reflected the different dispersal capability of its sexes; aerial for males and pedestrian for females, and the different depths of population history inferred from microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA. In contrast to the gene flow-facilitating effect of mature forests, deforested areas were found to be strong barriers for E.burchellii's gene flow. Other forest types were found to be gene flow facilitators but only when interacting with mature secondary forests, therefore indicating the importance of mature forests for the survival of E.burchelii and its associate species. The River Chagres was identified as a major historical gene flow barrier for E.burchellii, suggesting that an important loss of connectivity may occur because of large artificial waterways such as the Panama Canal.

AB Tropical secondary forests form an important part of the landscape. Understanding functional traits of species that colonize at different points in succession can provide insight into community assembly. Although studies on functional traits during forest succession have focused on trees, lianas (woody vines) also contribute strongly to forest biomass, species richness, and dynamics. We examined life history traits of lianas in a forest chronosequence in Costa Rica to determine which traits vary consistently over succession. We conducted 0.1 ha vegetation inventories in 30 sites. To examine the establishment of young individuals, we only included small lianas (0.51.5 cm diameter at 1.3 m height). For each species, we identified seed size, dispersal mode, climbing mode, and whether or not the seedling is self-supporting. We found a strong axis of variation determined by seed size and seedling growth habit, with early successional communities dominated by small-seeded species with abiotic dispersal and climbing seedlings, while large-seeded, animal-dispersed species with free-standing seedlings increased in abundance with stand age. Contrary to previous research and theory, we found a decrease in the abundance of stem twiners and no decrease in the abundance of tendril-climbers during succession. Seed size appears to be a better indicator of liana successional stage than climbing mode. Liana life history traits change predictably over succession, particularly traits related to seedling establishment. Identifying whether these trait differences persist into the growth strategies of mature lianas is an important research goal, with potential ramifications for understanding the impact of lianas during tropical forest succession.

Because heat exchange through conduction or evaporation is limited in air-exposed, withdrawn eulittoral-fringe snails, studies on their thermoregulation have centered on the ways they counter direct solar irradiance on the shell (shell colour, etc.). However, these snails must also be significantly heated by convective flow from the boundary layer air (BLA) above the solar-heated rock surface (<4 mm). Here we explore the contributions of direct and indirect solar influences on the heating of the eulittoral fringe. Echinolittorina malaccana, and assess the significance of a thermoregulatory behaviour that apparently alleviates convective heat gain. We studied shell attachment behaviour that results in the aperture being orientated perpendicularly to the rock surface (hereafter, standing). Using biomimetic models that were either exposed in the field directly to the sun or shaded (on sun exposed rocks) in standing or flat postures, we found that the sun's direct effect was relatively minor. The average thermal differential between the sunned models (direct and convective effects) and the shaded models (convective effect only) was maximally 2.1 degrees C. Standing maximally lowered the average operative temperature (T-b) below that of flat snails by 6 degrees C, by reducing convective heat gain from the boundary air. This potentially ensures the body temperature is kept below the critical thermal limit. Follow up laboratory experiments using live snails showed standing required a temperature gradient in the BLA, and was not observed when snails were heated in the absence of this gradient. Our findings link for the first time thermoregulatory behaviour and habitat BLA temperatures in rocky shore organisms. Furthermore, these results have implications for other small rock-dwelling ectotherms exposed to sunlight and having limited contact with the surface. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The potential population and community level impacts of fishing have received considerable attention, but little is known about how fishing influences communities' functional diversity at regional scales. We examined how estimates of functional diversity differed among 25 regions of variable richness and investigated the functional consequences of removing species targeted by commercial fisheries. Our study shows that fishing leads to substantial losses in functional diversity. The magnitude of such loss was, however, reduced in the more speciose regions. Moreover, the removal of commercially targeted species caused a much larger reduction in functional diversity than expected by random species deletions, which was a consequence of the selective nature of fishing for particular species traits. Results suggest that functional redundancy is spatially variable, that richer biotas provide some degree of insurance against the impact of fishing on communities' functional diversity and that fishing predominantly selects for particular species traits. Understanding how fishing impacts community functional diversity is key to predict its effects for biodiversity as well as ecosystem functioning.

AB Understanding what traits determine the extinction risk of species has been a long-standing challenge. Natural populations increasingly experience reductions in habitat and population size concurrent with increasing novel environmental variation owing to anthropogenic disturbance and climate change. Recent studies show that a species risk of decline towards extinction is often non-random across species with different life histories. We propose that species with life histories in which all stage-specific vital rates are more evenly important to population growth rate may be less likely to decline towards extinction under these pressures. To test our prediction, we modelled declines in population growth rates under simulated stochastic disturbance to the vital rates of 105 species taken from the literature. Populations with more equally important vital rates, determined using elasticity analysis, declined more slowly across a gradient of increasing simulated environmental variation. Furthermore, higher evenness of elasticity was significantly correlated with a reduced chance of listing as Threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. The relative importance of life-history traits of diverse species can help us infer how natural assemblages will be affected by novel anthropogenic and climatic disturbances.

AB Climbing plants are a key component of rainforests, but mechanistic approaches to their distribution and abundance are scarce. In a southern temperate rainforest, we addressed whether the dominance of climbing plants across light environments is associated with the expression of ecophysiological traits. In mature forest and canopy gaps, we measured leaf size, specific leaf area, photosynthetic rate, and dark respiration in six of the most abundant woody vines. Mean values of traits and their phenotypic change (%) between mature forest and canopy gaps were predictor variables. Leaf size and specific leaf area were not significantly associated with climbing plant dominance. Variation in gas-exchange traits between mature forest and canopy gaps explained, at least partly, the dominance of climbers in this forest. A greater increase in photosynthetic rate and a lower increase in dark respiration rate when canopy openings occur were related to the success of climbing plant species. Dominant climbers showed a strategy of maximizing exploitation of resource availability but minimizing metabolic costs. Results may reflect phenotypic plasticity or genetic differentiation in ecophysiological traits between light environments. It is suggested that the dominant climbers in this temperate rainforest would be able to cope with forest clearings due to human activities.

AB 1. Seed dispersal is a key biological process that remains poorly documented because dispersing seeds are notoriously hard to track. While long-distance dispersal is thought to be particularly important, seed-tracking studies typically yield incomplete data sets that are biased against long-distance movements. 2. We evaluate an analytical procedure developed by Jansen, Bongers & Hemerik (2004) to infer the tail of a seed dispersal kernel from incomplete frequency distributions of dispersal distances obtained by tracking seeds. This censored tail reconstruction (CTR) method treats dispersal distances as waiting times in a survival analysis and censors nonretrieved seeds according to how far they can reliably be tracked. We tested whether CTR can provide unbiased estimates of long-distance movements which typically cannot be tracked with traditional field methods. 3. We used a complete frequency distribution of primary seed dispersal distances of the palm Astrocaryum standleyanum, obtained with telemetric thread tags that allow tracking seeds regardless of the distance moved. We truncated and resampled the data set at various distances, fitted kernel functions on CTR estimates of dispersal distance and determined how well this function approximated the true dispersal kernel. 4. Censored tail reconstruction with truncated data approximated the true dispersal kernel remarkably well but only when the best-fitting function (lognormal) was used. We were able to select the correct function and derive an accurate estimate of the seed dispersal kernel even after censoring 5060% of the dispersal events. However, CTR results were substantially biased if 5% or more of seeds within the search radius were overlooked by field observers and erroneously censored. Similar results were obtained using additional simulated dispersal kernels. 5. Our study suggests that the CTR method can accurately estimate the dispersal kernel from truncated seed-tracking data if the kernel is a simple decay function. This method will improve our understanding of the spatial patterns of seed movement and should replace the usual practice of omitting nonretrieved seeds from analyses in seed-tracking studies.

AB In spite of the controversy that they have generated, neutral models provide ecologists with powerful tools for creating dynamic predictions about beta-diversity in ecological communities. Ecologists can achieve an understanding of the assembly rules operating in nature by noting when and how these predictions are met or not met. This is particularly valuable for those groups of organisms that are challenging to study under natural conditions (e.g., bacteria and fungi). Here, we focused on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities and performed an extensive literature search that allowed us to synthesize the information in 19 data sets with the minimal requisites for creating a null hypothesis in terms of community dissimilarity expected under neutral dynamics. In order to achieve this task, we calculated the first estimates of neutral parameters for several AMF communities from different ecosystems. Communities were shown either to be consistent with neutrality or to diverge or converge with respect to the levels of compositional dissimilarity expected under neutrality. These data support the hypothesis that divergence occurs in systems where the effect of limited dispersal is overwhelmed by anthropogenic disturbance or extreme biological and environmental heterogeneity, whereas communities converge when systems have the potential for niche divergence within a relatively homogeneous set of environmental conditions. Regarding the study cases that were consistent with neutrality, the sampling designs employed may have covered relatively homogeneous environments in which the effects of dispersal limitation overwhelmed minor differences among AMF taxa that would lead to environmental filtering. Using neutral models we showed for the first time for a soil microbial group the conditions under which different assembly processes may determine different patterns of beta-diversity. Our synthesis is an important step showing how the application of general ecological theories to a model microbial taxon has the potential to shed light on the assembly and ecological dynamics of communities.

AB Half of the world's land base is grazed by domesticated livestock. Because of the important functional role of ants in grasslands, it is important to understand the effect of livestock grazing on ant abundance and diversity. The objectives of this study were to examine the effect of cattle grazing and site productivity on the abundance, species richness, and species diversity of ants in Lac du Bois Grasslands Provincial Park, British Columbia, Canada. We hypothesized that the measured ant variables would be lowest in grazed areas and at low site productivity. Pitfall trapping was conducted at four sites: two at each low and high site productivity levels. At each site an ungrazed (fenced exclosure) and grazed transect was sampled during May, July, and August of 2008. Captured ants were preserved in ethanol and identified. Eight genuses of ants were collected: Tapinoma, Camponotus, Formica, Lasius, Aphaenogaster, Myrmica, Solinopsis, and Temnotharox. The mean number of ants per pitfall was higher at high site productivity sites that were grazed (15.10 +/- 2.96 SE) compared to high productivity sites ungrazed (3.28 +/- 0.47 SE); grazing at low productivity reduced numbers of ants from 5.07 (+/- 0.70 SE) to 2.20 (+/- 0.39 SE) (F = 21.806; P < 0.001). Tapinoma sessile and A. occidentalis had the greatest numbers in the pitfall traps. Species richness (F = 23.330, P < 0.001) and diversity (F = 11.764, P = 0.001) followed a similar trend. Because productivity and cattle grazing affect ant diversity and abundance, and ants impact ecosystem functioning, these factors should be considered in management of grasslands.

We evaluated the effects of the structural connectivity of forest patches (i.e., distance between patches) and matrix class (land-cover type) on the functional connectivity of 3 bird species (the White-crested Elaenia [Elaenia albiceps], the Green-backed Firecrown Hummingbird [Sephanoides sephaniodes], and the Austral Thrush [Turdus falklandii]). We measured functional connectivity as the rate at which each species crossed from one patch to another. We also evaluated whether greater functional connectivity translated into greater ecological connectivity (dispersal of fruit and pollen) by comparing among forest patches fruit set of a plant pollinated by hummingbirds and abundance of seedlings and adults of 2 plants with bird- and wind-dispersed seeds. Interpatch distance was strongly associated with functional connectivity, but its effect was not independent of matrix class. For one of the bird-dispersed plants, greater functional connectivity for White-crested Elaenias and Austral Thrushes (both frugivores) was associated with higher densities of this plant. The lack of a similar association for the wind-dispersed species suggests this effect is linked to the dispersal vector. The abundance of the hummingbird-pollinated species was not related to the presence of hummingbirds. Interpatch distance and matrix class affect animal movement in fragmented landscapes and may have a cascading effect on the distribution of some animal-dispersed species. On the basis of our results, we believe effort should be invested in optimizing patch configuration and modifying the matrix so as to mitigate the effects of patch isolation in fragmented landscapes.

AB We investigated the conservation concern of Azorean forest fragments and the entire Terceira Island surface using arthropod species vulnerability as defined by the Kattan index, which is based on species rarity. Species rarity was evaluated according to geographical distribution (endemic vs. non endemic species), habitat specialization (distribution across biotopes) and population size (individuals collected in standardized samples). Geographical rarity was considered at 'global' scale (species endemic to the Azorean islands) and 'regional' scale (single island endemics). Measures of species vulnerability were combined into two indices of conservation concern for each forest fragment: (1) the Biodiversity Conservation Concern index, BCC, which reflects the average rarity score of the species present in a site, and (2) one proposed here and termed Biodiversity Conservation Weight, BCW, which reflects the sum of rarity scores of the same species assemblage. BCW was preferable to prioritise the areas with highest number of vulnerable species, whereas BCC helped the identification of areas with few, but highly threatened species due to a combination of different types of rarity. A novel approach is introduced in which BCC and BCW indices were also adapted to deal with probabilities of occurrence instead of presence/absence data. The new probabilistic indices, termed pBCC and pBCW, were applied to Terceira Island for which we modelled species distributions to reconstruct species occurrence with different degree of probability also in areas from which data were not available. The application of the probabilistic indices revealed that some island sectors occupied by secondary vegetation, and hence not included in the current set of protected areas, may in fact host some rare species. This result suggests that protecting marginal non-natural areas which are however reservoirs of vulnerable species may also be important, especially when areas with well preserved primary habitats are scarce.

AB Low light availability under a forest canopy often limits plant growth; however, sudden increase in light intensity may induce photoinhibition of photosynthesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ecophysiological changes that occur in potted plants of Minquartia guianensis and Swietenia macrophylla during the acclimation process to full sunlight. We used six full-sun independent acclimation periods (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days) and a control kept in the shade. Shading was obtained by placing plants under the canopy of a small forest. The F-v/F-m ratio, net photosynthetic rate (P (N)), the maximum carboxylation velocity of Rubisco (V (cmax)), maximum electron transport rate (J (max)), specific leaf area (SLA), and growth were assessed at the end of each of the six acclimation periods. Plant exposure to full sunlight caused a sudden decrease in the F-v/F-m ratio (photoinhibition) particularly in Minquartia. Photooxidation (necrotic patches) of the leaf tissue was observed in upper leaves of Minquartia. The higher P (N) values were observed in Swietenia under full sun, about 12 mu mol(CO2) m(-2) s(-1). V (cmax25) values were higher after 90 days of acclimation, about 14 mu mol(CO2) m(-2) s(-1) for Minquartia, and 35 mu mol(CO2) m(-2) s(-1) for Swietenia. At the end of a 180-d acclimation period J (max25) was 35 mu mol(electron) m(-2) s(-1) for Minquartia and 60 mu mol(electron) m(-2) s(-1) for Swietenia. SLA was higher in Swietenia than in Minquartia. In Minquartia, monthly rate of leaf production per plant (MRLP) was positive (0.22 leaf month(-1)) after four months in the open. Whereas, in Swietenia MRLP was positive (0.56 leaf month(-1)) after an acclimation period of two months. After six months in the open, height growth rates were 3.5 and 28 mm month(-1) for Minquartia and Swietenia, respectively. The greater acclimation capacity of Swietenia was associated to an enhanced photosynthetic plasticity under full sun. In Minquartia, transition to full-sun conditions and lack of physiological adjustment resulted in severe photoinhibition and loss of leaves.

AB We studied hummingbirds and their food plants in an area of caatinga vegetation. We specifically examined their seasonal use of this habitat, migratory and non-migratory status, their foraging strategies and community roles The study was conducted in an area of arboreal-shrub caatinga, located in the Serra do Para, municipality of Santa Cruz do Capibaribe, state of Pernambuco in northeastern Brazil. Field work was undertaken during 12 expeditions on a monthly basis between June, 2007 and May, 2008. Five species of hummingbirds were recorded visiting flowers in the community studied. Three were considered residents: Chlorostilbon lucidus (Shaw, 1812), Eupetomena macroura (Gmelin, 1788), and Heliomaster squamosus (Temminck, 1823). Hummingbirds visited 31 species of plants, of which only five presented attributes related to ornithophily. C. lucidus visited 29 plant species, including all ornithophilous species, and it was the most aggressive, defending territories. Among hummingbirds, C. lucidus may be considered the principal pollinator. Hummingbirds may also be acting as pollen vectors for some of the plant species not identified as ornithophilous. The hummingbird guilds varied among the plant species used as floral resources, as well as in their frequency of visits. Differences in plant species abundance, hummingbird preference, competitive exclusion or flowering seasonality are factors likely to influence those variations.

AB Interactions between species in groups are often ignored in studies of the effects of anthropogenic change on species' persistence, and yet, given their global ubiquity, mixed-species groups have the potential to be models for community ecology. In this paper we examine the impacts of rural community activities that are pervasive in tropical regions on mixed-species flocks of birds in a unique coastal tropical dry forest ecosystem, with the aim of advancing both our understanding of mixed-species associations and how best to conserve them. We examined the effects of small-scale clearing of trees and livestock grazing on mixed flocks in two vegetation types in the highly threatened Tumbesian region of Ecuador. Because the fitness benefits of flocking come from a reduced risk of predation or enhanced feeding efficiencies, or both, habitat degradation could lead to changes in the benefits of flocking and thus flock characteristics. We predicted that, in more disturbed vegetation, flocks would have fewer species and individuals and that species would show lower flocking propensities and feeding efficiencies. Based on observations of 431 flocks, we found that these predictions were supported in tropical dry forest but not always in arid scrub vegetation. Less disturbed tropical dry forest had greater mean species richness per flock than more disturbed tropical dry forest, but mean species richness per flock did not differ between more and less disturbed arid scrub. Flock species richness and composition differed across the disturbance levels in tropical dry forest, but not in arid scrub. Many species had their highest flocking propensities and greatest foraging efficiencies in less disturbed, compared to more disturbed, vegetation. We show that existing park management, which allows community development and livestock grazing within national park borders, leads to degradation of the vegetation and disrupts species' interactions in tropical dry forest. We provide specific conservation recommendations to mitigate these disruptive influences. Examining intraspecific associations across diverse communities is of the utmost importance to both answering basic theoretical questions in community ecology and conserving species diversity in the face of anthropogenic landscape change.

AB The current rapid decline in biodiversity in human-dominated agricultural landscapes, both in Europe and worldwide, impacts on the provision of environmental services essential to human well-being. There is, therefore, a pressing need to develop and implement incentive-based conservation policies to counteract the ongoing loss of biodiversity. This paper presents results of a regionally-scaled conservation procurement auction, a type of incentive-based payments for environmental services (PES), targeted at the conservation of arable plant diversity. By matching arable fields that were participating in the PES scheme to control fields that were not enrolled in the PES scheme, two critical key characteristics were addressed, namely additionality and bid prices. Additionality was addressed by evaluating whether fields for which PES were issued had significantly higher arable plant diversity than the matched control fields. The cost-effectiveness of a conservation auction increases if payments compensate just farmers' opportunity costs (in terms of forgone production); bid prices of participating farmers were thus also evaluated to determine whether they were related to their individual opportunity costs. The PES scheme proved to be highly effective in ensuring environmental services delivery through enhanced arable plant diversity on participating fields. In contrast, the potential of the proposed conservation auction design to raise cost-effectiveness has to be questioned, because bid prices submitted in this scheme substantially exceeded individual farmers' opportunity costs. Therefore, bid prices were most likely influenced by socioeconomic factors other than opportunity costs. This case study illustrates potentials and pitfalls associated with the implementation of a PES scheme and, by evaluating the effectiveness of the scheme, contributes to an improved understanding of incentive-based mechanisms for both policymakers and practitioners involved in PES scheme design and implementation.

AB The objective of our work was to verify the value of the vegetation corridor in the conservation of small mammals in fragmented tropical landscapes, using a model system in the southeastern Minas Gerais. We evaluated and compared the composition and structure of small mammals in a vegetation corridor, forest fragments and a coffee matrix. A total of 15 species were recorded, and the highest species richness was observed in the vegetation corridor (13 species), followed by the forest fragments (10) and the coffee matrix (6). The absolute abundance was similar between the vegetation corridor and fragments (F = 22.94; p = 0.064), and the greatest differences occurred between the vegetation corridor and the matrix (F = 22.94; p = 0.001) and the forest fragments and the matrix (F = 22.94; p = 0.007). Six species showed significant habitat preference possibly related to the sensitivity of the species to the forest disturbance. Marmosops incanus was the species most sensitive to disturbance; Akodon montensis, Cerradomys subflavus, Gracilinanus microtarsus and Rhipidomys sp. displayed little sensitivity to disturbance, with a high relative abundance in the vegetation corridor. Calomys sp. was the species least affected by habitat disturbance, displaying a high relative abundance in the coffee matrix. Although the vegetation corridors are narrow (4 m width), our results support the hypothesis in which they work as a forest extension, share most species with the forest fragment and support species richness and abundance closer to forest fragments than to the coffee matrix. Our work highlights the importance and cost-effectiveness of these corridors to biodiversity management in the fragmented Atlantic Forest landscapes and at the regional level.

AB Many attempts have been made to confirm or reject the unimodal relationship between disturbance and diversity stated by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). However, the reasons why the predictions of the IDH apply or fail in particular systems are not always obvious. Here, we use a spatially explicit, individual-based community model that simulates species coexistence in a landscape subjected to disturbances to compare diversity-disturbance curves of communities with different coexistence mechanisms: neutrality, trade-off mechanism and intraspecific density dependence. We show that the shape of diversity-disturbance curves differs considerably depending on the type of coexistence mechanism assumed: (1) Neutral communities generally show decreasing diversity-disturbance curves with maximum diversity at zero disturbance rates contradicting the IDH, whereas trade-off communities generally show unimodal relationships confirming the IDH and (2) density-dependent mechanisms do increase the diversity of both neutral and trade-off communities. Finally, we discuss how these mechanisms determine diversity in disturbed landscapes.

TI Universal Ecological Patterns in College Basketball Communities

DT Article
ID SPECIES ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTIONS; NEUTRAL THEORY; RELATIVE ABUNDANCE;
   DIVERSITY
AB The rank abundance of common and rare species within ecological communities is remarkably consistent from the tropics to the tundra. This invariant patterning provides one of ecology's most enduring and unified tenets: most species rare and a few very common. Increasingly, attention is focused upon elucidating biological mechanisms that explain these species abundance distributions (SADs), but these evaluations remain controversial. We show that college basketball wins generate SADs just like those observed in ecological communities. Whereas college basketball wins are structured by competitive interactions, the result produces a SAD pattern indistinguishable from random wins. We also show that species abundance data for tropical trees exhibits a significant-digit pattern consistent with data derived from complex structuring forces. These results cast doubt upon the ability of SAD analysis to resolve ecological mechanism, and their patterning may reflect statistical artifact as much as biological processes.

AB Brown-headed spider monkeys (Ateles fusciceps), endemic to the Choco-Darien forests and lower Andean forests of NW Ecuador, are considered critically endangered. Unfortunately, scientific data regarding the actual status of populations is lacking. We combined satellite image analysis, species-specific habitat assessment, and a field survey technique using playback to focus conservation efforts for this species. First, we identified remaining forest via a LANDSAT mosaic and then applied species-specific criteria to delineate remaining forest with potential to hold populations. By combining this with the historical distribution from ecological niche modeling and predicted hunting intensity we generated a species-specific landscape map. Within our study area, forest capable of sustaining Ateles fusciceps covers 5872 km(2), of which 2172 km(2) (40%) is protected. Unprotected forest considered suitable for Ateles fusciceps extends to 3700 km(2) but within this only 989 km(2) (23%) is under low hunting pressure and likely to maintain healthy populations of Ateles fusciceps. To overcome problems of sampling at low primate density and in difficult mountain terrain we developed a field survey technique to determine presence and estimate abundance using acoustic sampling. For sites under low hunting pressure density of primates varied with altitude. Densities decreased from 7.49 individuals/km(2) at 332 masl to 0.9 individuals/km(2) at 1570 masl. Based on combining data sets in a gap analysis, we recommend conservation action focus on unprotected lowland forest to the south and west of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve where hunting pressure is low and population densities of Ateles fusciceps are greatest.

AB Conservation-development interactions intensified as a consequence of environmental and land-use changes in Latin America during the 1985-2008 period. This study examines predominant changes in five countries (Mexico, Costa Rica, Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia). Multifold increase of protected areas for environmental conservation occurred together with agricultural growth and intensification. Conservation and agricultural trends were fraught with conflicts and contradictions, yet they also showed partial compatibility in the search for sustainability. Conservation, indigenous, and social movement organizations operating at multiple scales (local, national, and international) contributed to distinctly configured national conservation "booms" and sustainability discourses in the five countries. Neoliberal governments and global organizations sanctioned protected-area conservation via increased state institutions, national and subnational administrative mechanisms, widely publicized sustainability rationales, expanded territorial management and a property rights focus, spatial devolution, and official multiculturalism-the 1990s were a heyday of these activities. Subsequently Latin American conservation and sustainability efforts have evolved both as a global center of governance through payment for environmental services and under increased and diverse social agendas.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) increases with time as landscape is restored. Studying SOM development along restored forest chronosequences would be useful in clarifying some of the uncertainties in quantifying C turnover rates with respect to forest clearance and ensuing restoration. The development of soil organic matter in the mineral soils was studied at four depths in a 16-year-old restored jarrah forest chronosequence. The size-separated SOM fractionation along with delta C-13 isotopic shift was utilised to resolve the soil C temporal and spatial changes with developing vegetation. The restored forest chronosequence revealed several important insights into how soil C is developing with age. Litter accumulation outpaced the native forest levels in 12 years after restoration. The surface soils, in general, showed increase in total C with age, but this trend was not clearly observed at lower depths. C accumulation was observed with increasing restoration age in all three SOM size-fractions in the surface 0-2 cm depth. These biodiverse forests show a trend towards accumulating C in recalcitrant stable forms, but only in the surface 0-2 cm mineral soil. A significant reverse trend was observed for the moderately labile SOM fraction for lower depths with increasing restoration age. Correlating the soil delta C-13 with total C concentration revealed the re-establishment of the isotopically depleted labile to enriched refractory C continuum with soil depth for the older restored sites. This implied that from a pedogenic perspective, the restored soils are developing towards the original native soil carbon profile.

AB In this research work, we specifically address post-dispersal Spanish black pine (Pinus nigra Arn. ssp salzmannii) seed predation at two different locations, one being the most common and representative location for the species and the other located on areas at their ecological limit of distribution in Cuenca Mountain (Spain). A modelling approach was employed to analyze the effect of stand and site characteristics and climate variables on the post-dispersal predation process. Each predator group (ants, rodents and birds) was evaluated by excluding the other two with different experimental devices. Our study demonstrates that the percent of removal was related with the seed rain patterns being lower in the high seed rain year of 2006 (mean +/- se 11.15 +/- 3.7% of removed seeds) than in the low seed rain years of 2005 and 2007 (81.71 +/- 6.0% and 87.29 +/- 6.6% of removed seeds respectively). In high seed production years, birds were the most important predators and rodents were the less important predator group in both Los Palancares y Agregados and Ensanche de Las Majadas. No conclusion can be obtained in low seed production years due to the high seed removal percentage by all predator groups. Experimental site and overstory density were no significant with respect to seed predation. Modelling approach show that the seed removal percentage is influenced by seed production year (Mast Y) a temporal effect within the year, measured by the day variable (Day) and a climatic variable (accumulated averaged maximum air temperatures 20 days before survey date, AaMAT). Further developments include the construction of stochastic models to predict the effects of climate-related variables or microhabitat characteristics on seed losses, contributing to reduce uncertainty in post-dispersal Spanish black pine seed predation dynamics and to provide credible tools to decision-makers and forest managers.

AB The contribution of vertebrate animals to nutrient cycling has proven to be important in various ecosystems. However, the role of large bodied primates in nutrient transport in neotropical forests is not well documented. Here, we assess the role of a population of woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagothricha lugens) as vectors of nutrient movement through seed dispersal. We estimated total seed biomass transported by the population within and between two habitats (terra firme and flooded forests) at Tinigua Park, Colombia, and quantified potassium (K), phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) content in seeds of 20 plant species from both forests. Overall, the population transported an estimated minimum of 11.5 (+/- 1.2 SD) g of potassium, 13.2 (+/- 0.7) g of phosphorus and 34.3 (+/- 0.1) g nitrogen, within 22.4 (+/- 2.0) kg of seeds ha(-1) y(-1). Approximately 84% of all nutrients were deposited in the terra firme forest mostly through recycling processes, and also through translocation from the flooded forest. This type of translocation represents an important and high-quality route of transport since abiotic mechanisms do not usually move nutrients upwards, and since chemical tests show that seeds from flooded forests have comparatively higher nutrient contents. The overall contribution to nutrient movement by the population of woolly monkeys is significant because of the large amount of biomass transported, and the high phosphorus content of seeds. As a result, the phosphorus input generated by these monkeys is of the same order of magnitude as other abiotic mechanisms of nutrient transport such as atmospheric deposition and some weathering processes. Our results suggest that via seed dispersal processes, woolly monkey populations can contribute to nutrient movement in tropical forests, and may act as important nutrient input vectors in terra firme forests.

AB This study assesses the impact of hunting on the densities of nonhuman primates in two indigenous Tikuna territories (Mocagua and San Martin), overlapping Amacayacu National Park in the Colombian Amazon. Large-bodied primates were once favored prey by Tikunas, but are now rarely hunted owing to the diminishing primate populations. We evaluate the effect of a hunting ban on woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagothricha) by the residents of Mocagua, using qualitative and quantitative methods. Hunting records showed that from February 2005 to February 2009, a total of 25,142 kg of mammal bushmeat were harvested in Mocagua and San Martin. Primates constituted 345 kg of the total harvest. From 223 kg of large-bodied primates extracted for subsistence purposes, 160 kg were hunted in San Martin and 64 kg in Mocagua. Large-bodied primates made up 70% of the total primate biomass in Mocagua (398 kg/km(2)) and 22% in San Martin (199 kg/km(2)). From dietary records, we found bushmeat constituted 30% of protein consumption in Mocagua and 37% in San Martin. Primates were absent in records from Mocagua, and appeared only three times in those from San Martin suggesting inconsistencies with hunting data. Despite its moderate consumption, bushmeat was identified as a highly valued food source during focus group activities. Primate pet-keeping and part utilization were observed in San Martin but not in Mocagua, possibly as a consequence of fewer primates being hunted. We suggest that Mocagua provides an example of how community-based conservation strategies can be achieved, where opportunities for employment in tourism and alternative food sources are available.

AB This paper reviews what is known about the factors affecting the distribution of barnacle species of the genus Chthamalus Ranzani at global, regional, local and microhabitat spatial scales. The genus is almost worldwide in distribution, on tropical and temperate shores, with currently over twenty recognised species. The majority of members of this genus commonly occur in the middle and upper intertidal. At the global scale (1000s km), the four currently recognised informal groups of Chthamalus exhibit a regional endemicity that has probably resulted from tectonic events during the last 70-90 Ma. The 'challengeri' and 'fissus' groups are thought to be the most ancestral within Chthamalus. Their extant distributions derive from the late Cretaceous. The 'malayensis' and 'stellatus' groups are assumed to be more derived and are probably sister taxa. The latter two groups exhibit overlap with the apparently more ancient 'challengeri' and 'fissus' groups. Abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, desiccation, aspect, winds and fetch) together with biotic factors (e.g. supply-side) all affect the distribution of Chthamalus species at regional (100s km) and local (1-10s km) scales. The relationship between these factors and Chthamalus distributions has best been studied in the north-east Atlantic species C. stellatus and C. montagui and to a lesser extent in the western Atlantic species C. fragilis. Microhabitat (within shore) patterns of distribution in Chthamalus barnacles are controlled by biotic (e.g. supply-side, competition, predation and grazer/algal interactions) and abiotic (e.g. shading and run-off) factors. The highly fluctuating temperatures and desiccation stress that Chthamalus species experience when aerially exposed at low tide appear to have a major deterministic effect on species distributions, often limiting the vertical distribution of Chthamalus species on the shore. On sheltered shores, the abiotic stress due to minimal wave splash may be more important than biotic factors, while on moderately exposed and exposed shores, that can be supplied with many propagules and where density-dependent factors come into play, biotic factors may be more important. Abiotic factors may also scale up to explain large scale patterns of distribution, such as trends in Chthamalus abundance between NE and SE Atlantic coasts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB We examined fine-scale heterogeneity of environmental conditions in a primary rain forest in French Guiana to describe variation in microhabitats that plants may experience during establishment. We characterized both the range as well as the spatial structuring of 11 environmental factors important for seedling establishment in six hexagonal sampling grids, one each in gap and understory sites at three points representing the predominant geomorphic units in this primary forest. Each grid contained 37 sampling points separated by 31 cm-20 m. Monte-Carlo tests of semivariograms against complete spatial randomness indicated that for many variables in all six sampling grids, spatial dependence did not exceed 1 m. A principal component analysis of all sampling points revealed a lack of spatial microhabitat structure, rather than homogeneous patches associated with canopy structure or geomorphology. Our results suggest that ample fine-scale spatial heterogeneity exists to support the coexistence of plant species with differential abiotic requirements for regeneration.

AB Montane cloud forests that occur along protected ravines have a fragmented distribution in western Mexico. These forests contain high species richness, and a number of endemic species and relict species. We identify montane cloud forests in western Mexico that deserve priority for conservation and in situ preservation. We rank the montane cloud forests based on tree species richness, the number of endemic vascular plants, the number of species with protection status, and the presence of relict tree species. We place tree species richness and floristic composition of montane cloud forests from western Mexico in a world context, comparing them with 110 forests throughout the world. Then, using Ward's dendrogram, we identify similarities in the floristic composition. Also, we determine which species in the montane cloud forests of western Mexico are protected by the Mexican Species Act, CITES, or IUCN Red List. Our results indicate that the montane cloud forest at Ojo de Agua del Cuervo in the state of Jalisco is unique in that it contains larger numbers of tree species, endemic vascular plants, and endangered plants than similar Asian forests containing ancient species. Ojo de Agua del Cuervo is floristically related at the generic level to forests in Asia, as well as those in Mexico containing Tertiary relict tree species. We propose a 56,395 ha biosphere reserve that includes Ojo de Agua del Cuervo and its surroundings. This proposed reserve would increase the number of preserved montane cloud forests, which are currently underrepresented among Mexican protected natural areas.

AB In this study I document the growth rate and age of trees in an old-growth montane Hawaiian wet forest and use these results to evaluate the cyclic Succession model for forest dynamics. I used two methods to estimate the age of trees - the crown-class model and radiocarbon dating. Over 6000 trees belonging to eight species were tagged and Measured over 7 y on Hawaii island. Growth rates for the dominant tree (Metrosideros polymorpha) were relatively low (mean = 1.3 mm y(-1)) and varied with tree size and crown class. C-14-based age estimates For 27 M. polymorpha trees loosely corroborated estimates based on the crown-class method. The oldest tree dated by C-14 had a median age of 647 y BP. placing it among the oldest documented angiosperm trees in the northern hemisphere. C-14 dating revealed that the upper canopy may be comprised of three distinct age groups of M. polymorpha trees of similar size. with the median age of each group separated by 200-250 y. The high density of large, very old trees in Multiple groups is Unusual for it tropical forest and indicates Chat forest development may occur through gap-phase regeneration at a fine scale and stand-level mortality at it coarser scale.

AB 1. Although Chile is at the forefront in evaluating experimentally the importance of human harvesting impacts on coastal biodiversity, there are no evaluations of such impacts on a long-term historical basis (tens to thousands of years). Different types of archival information (i.e. contemporaneous, archaeological, and palaeontological) were used to carry out a research programme based on the historical assessment of the impacts and intensity of resource extraction on coastal biodiversity along the Chilean coast.
   2. In addition to recent scientific literature, different sources of contemporaneous information (e. g. museum collections, old reports and accounts) can reveal the human impacts observed in the more recent past. Furthermore, the large number of prehistoric shell middens along the entire Chilean coast offer access to similar to 11 000 years of history along the entire coast, although the faunal composition, structure, and dynamics of most of them remain largely unstudied.
   3. Finally, the rich and widespread fossil record of some marine groups provides the opportunity to reconstruct the structure and dynamics of benthic communities during different phases of human influence (e. g. pre-human, prehistoric harvesting, and modern harvesting).
   4. Preliminary comparisons of fossil versus modern bivalve assemblages suggest marked changes in the species composition. Human impacts seem very recent and shifts in the structure of benthic assemblages may have occurred only a few centuries/decades ago.
   5. In contrast, prehistoric harvesting, although intense, was apparently not enough to cause a profound impact on coastal ecosystems. The approach herein envisaged can provide the basis to build a historical baseline to evaluate the human impacts on the coastal biodiversity in the region. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Sub-adult individuals of Aporrectodea caliginosa were incubated for 16 weeks under laboratory cultures in a soil treated with 0%, 10% or 50% of a Populus nigra half-decomposed leaves, respectively. Growth was maximum in the 50% organic matter treatment and cocoon production occurred. Average soil ingestion rates decreased from 1.56 g/g(-1) fresh weight of worm per day(-1) in control soil to 1.17 and 0.5 g, respectively, in treatments with 10% and 50% half-decomposed litter. Surface casts never comprised more than 10% of total cast production. Near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS)signatures of digested and non-ingested soil significantly differed and showed a rather constant effect of digestion, independent of the organic matter content (p < 0.01). These results confirm the value of NIRS spectral signatures as indicators of the origin of soil aggregates and biological processes involved in soil aggregation.

AB Tropical forest fragmentation affects animal and plant populations in different ways. For plants, early stages (seed to seedling) are more sensitive to habitat alteration than adults, and can shape their future spatial patterns. Therefore, studying how seed germination and seedling growth and survival vary at different spatiotemporal scales enhances our understanding about plant recruitment in fragmented ecosystems. in this study we examine if, and to what extent, recruitment at early life-stages of Xymalos monospora (Monomiaceae), a bird-dispersed Afrotropical tree, differs between and within forest fragments that vary in size, surrounding matrix and microhabitats. Three years of field experiments (20042006) in south-east Kenya, revealed that patterns of seed germination and seedling survival and growth were largely inconsistent, both in space and time. Recruitment was not consistently higher in larger or less disturbed fragments. At smaller spatial scales within forest fragments, recruitment was subject to high between-year variation too, with decreased germination in gaps only in the dry year of 2004. However, performance of seeds and seedlings was consistently better away from than under conspecific fruiting trees. Our results imply that fragmented tree populations of X. monospora may become age-structured, or ultimately go extinct, if recruitment fails in subsequent years. This may especially affect populations in small, disturbed forest fragments, where seed dispersal and buffering against stochastic processes are generally reduced. Exotic plantations bordering indigenous forest fragments may provide suitable conditions for native tree recruitment; hence, forest expansion through enrichment planting should be considered in future conservation plans.

AB The structure and floristic composition of an understory under a Pinus radiata D. Don plantation in the coastal area of the central Chilean Maule Region (35 degrees 27'43.3" S; 72 degrees 23'56" W) is documented. Based on nine vegetation samples the vascular flora was inventoried determining species richness, frequency, cover-abundance, and values of importance as well as phytogeographic origin and life forms. The vascular flora comprises 48 taxa with a high representation of native and endemic species (19 each), including Adesmia bijuga Phil. (Fabaceae) as an endemic to the coastal mountain range of Maule Region and only 11 exotic species. The studied shrub community shows a vertical organization in layers of which the herbaceous ground layer shows the highest diversity, whereas Pinus radiata, Adesmia bijuga, and Escallonia pulverulenta Pers. show highest frequency levels. All Raunkiaer life forms are represented, being phanerophytes and hemicryptophytes the dominant life forms. The exotic species Aira caryophyllea L. and Pinus radiata have the highest importance values. We interpret the shrub community structure to be variable and complex due to the artificiallity of the vegetation composition of a planted P radiata stand that replaced the native vegetation. Adesmia bijuga shows that the vital cycle could help to its conservation in situ under the canopy, but in a regime of risk threats its survival. In spite of little representativeness in the area the specie is outside the regional units of the SNASPE and is not considered in the Chilean Red Data Book.

AB Aim To test whether a direct relationship exists between the relative abundance of woody plant genera and precipitation regime along the north-south climate gradient of the western Amazon.
   Location Lowland rain forests in the western Amazon.
   Methods Floristic data on 91 woody plant genera, from 39 0.1-ha plots across the western Amazon, and precipitation data from a 0.5 degrees global data set were used to test for correlations between plant relative abundance (defined as percentage number of stems >= 2.5 cm diameter at breast height for each woody plant genus per plot) and derived dry-season variables. Moisture preference was then assessed in terms of pioneer and shade-tolerant life-history strategy.
   Results There were significant associations between the distribution of plant relative abundances and seasonal precipitation variables in 34% of genera analysed. Significant differences were identified in size-class distribution between dry affiliates and generalists. Dry affiliates were not dominant in any size class in any plot type, whereas climate generalists dominated most of the size classes in the dry plots and the mid-range size classes in the wet plots. Dry-affiliate genera were a minority, even in dry forests. Wet-affiliate genera were correlated with shade tolerance, whereas genera with no rainfall affiliation were often pioneers.
   Main conclusions The results suggest that moisture variable seasonality influences community composition in a manner that can be related to the life-history trade-off between shade tolerance and pioneer ranking. One possible reason for higher diversity in wetter forests is that high rainfall amplifies the niche space available to shade-tolerant plants. Determining which plant groups are constrained by which environmental variables can contribute to our understanding of how forest composition may be changing now, and how it may change under future climate: if shade-tolerant trees are also drought-intolerant, community structure in wet forests may be more vulnerable to future increases in moisture stress.

AB The species pool hypothesis claims that the large-scale regional species pool is the chief parameter in determining small-scale species richness through filtering of species that can persist within a community on the basis of their tolerance of the abiotic environment. Accordingly, different environmental conditions give rise to different species assemblages. From a taxonomic perspective, under the assumption of trait conservatism, co-occurring species that experience similar environmental conditions are likely to be more taxonomically similar than ecologically distant species. The next step consists in understanding how commonness and rarity of individual species produce the observed taxonomic diversity. In this paper, the importance of environmental filtering in regulating the taxonomic structure of rare and common plant species in the urban floras of Brussels (Belgium) and Rome (Italy) is tested. First, we computed the taxonomic diversity of the rare and common species of Brussels and Rome based on the branching topology of the Linnaean taxonomic trees. Next, using a randomization procedure, we determined whether the taxonomic diversity of the rare species was significantly higher than the diversity of the common species. Results show that, for both urban floras, common species that shape the community matrix and experience similar environmental conditions have a taxonomic diversity that is significantly lower than that of the rare species that represent a relatively incidental set of species of more 'disperse' origin. Finally, from a conservation/management perspective our results imply that, given their high taxonomic heterogeneity, the protection of rare species is a central issue for preserving high levels of diversity in urban areas.

AB We explored the influence of a common practice in tropical countries, namely illegal logging for household consumption (ILHC), as well as that of characteristics of habitat structure on the variation of tree species richness across 10 cloud forest remnants of a Colombian Andean landscape. We estimated species richness for total, early and late successional tree species for each forest fragment. We also generated a binomial ILHC variable and six quantitative habitat descriptors related to patch size, shape and isolation. The data were analyzed with generalized linear models (GLMs) and model selection techniques based on Information Theory, complemented with partial regression analyses. We found that the presence of ILHC decreased the number of species for all tree groups, being this variable the major driver of richness variation across forest remnants. Our analyses also indicated that landscape characteristics played secondary roles in determining tree richness in all cases. Additionally, stronger negative impacts of ILHC on late successional tree species suggest that these logging activities are likely to move back ecological succession towards earlier stages of this process. As far as we know, this is the first study documenting the relative importance of ILHC practices against landscape structure for tree species richness. Our results strongly emphasize the need to consider ILHC in investigations and conservation initiatives involving tree species richness in fragmented tropical landscapes.

AB 1. Plant ecologists have long since realized that the persistence of many facultative biennial plants depends upon disturbance. However, we still have a limited knowledge of the population-level effects of disturbance, and the connection between adult and seed bank dynamics.
   2. Using data from a 3-year demographic study combined with experimental gap-opening in a large population of Digitalis purpurea, we parameterized stochastic transition matrix models in 'disturbed' vs. 'undisturbed' areas. We simulated different gap sizes (fraction of population that was disturbed) and temporal disturbance patterns (constant, random, regular and irregular return intervals) and evaluated the effects on population growth rate and seed bank dynamics. To explore seed bank importance we used two alternatives for seed bank survival rate (0.75/0.35) and three alternatives for seed bank recruitment fraction (0.9/0.5/0.1).
   3. Observed background recruitment levels were insufficient to ensure a positive population growth rate. Increased amounts of gap-opening led to higher growth rates, and population persistence was predicted at moderate disturbance levels if seed bank survival was high (0.75).
   4. Temporal disturbance pattern affected model results; random and interval scenarios resulted in lower population growth rates and higher extinction risks than constant scenarios of the same average disturbance level. Small and frequent disturbances led to considerably higher growth rates than large and rare disturbances.
   5. Stochastic elasticity analyses identified the seed bank as the most important life cycle stage with respect to population growth and persistence in most scenarios, and its relative impact was positively related to seed bank survival rate and negatively related to disturbance level. Variation in the recruitment fraction from seed bank vs. seed rain affected both population growth rate and elasticity patterns, indicating the large impact of spatial variation in seed bank density.
   6. Synthesis: Despite the existence of a large seed bank, our data suggest that recruitment may be locally seed-limited due to a patchy seed bank structure. Local population development may consequently differ widely from gap to gap. These results illustrate how spatial structures in both seed bank, adult population and gap formation interact to shape plant population dynamics, as well as the occurrence of microsite- vs. seed-limitation.

AB We investigated the effects of both seed density and distance from conspecific adult trees on the survivorship of seeds of Shorea laxa and Dipterocarpus tempehes. We examined whether those species support predictions of the escape hypothesis of distance- and density-dependent mortality. We placed seeds on the forest floor using a matrix of distance from the parent tree (5, 20, and 80 m) and seed density (2, 10, and 50 m(-2)). The fates of seeds and seedlings were recorded 5 days, 2 weeks, and I month after the seeds were exposed. Camera-traps at quadrats 5 and 80 m from the parent trees were used to identify mammalian seed and seedling predators and to examine the frequency of their appearance. The proportion of seedlings surviving after 1 month was very small, 32.0 and 4.0% for S. laxa and D. tempehes, respectively. The main cause of mortality for both species was predation and removal by mammals. Total mortality and mortality caused by mammal predation were highest at the greatest distance from the parent tree. Camera-traps revealed that the diversity of mammalian predators was highest 5 m from the parent trees, while the total frequency of mammalian predator appearance was higher at 80 m than at 5 m for S. laxa. Thus, S. laxa and D. tempehes exhibited distance-dependent mortality, but the highest mortality occurred at the greatest distance from the parent trees. This is the inverse of the pattern predicted by escape hypothesis and instead supports the "McCanny pattern". Those results would be caused by "predator satiation" near the seed-bearing trees where foods were concentrated, while seeds more distant from the parent tree were exhausted by predation.

AB Organic mounds of the red wood ants (Formica rufa group; RWA) have been shown to be "hot spots" of carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux from the European forest soils. However, little information is available on the variability of CO2 effluxes from RWA mounds and on the factors regulating CO2 efflux. We assessed the seasonal and diurnal changes in CO2 effluxes, temperatures and volumetric water contents from mounds of Formica aquilona, the important RWA of the boreal forests in Finland. The daily average CO2 efflux from RWA mounds ranged 1.1-6.9 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1) during the active ant season (May-September), and from 0.2 to 1.1g CO2 m(-2) h(-1) during their dormant period (October-April). Mound CO2 efflux from May to September was 3.6-6.0 times higher than from the surrounding forest floors, and most likely came from RWA respiration. Seasonal changes in mound CO2 effluxes were significantly correlated with mound temperature, but not with volumetric water content (7% on average). The high CO2 efflux associated with increased volumetric water content (up to 34%) after a RWA mound was abandoned indicated that these dry mound conditions restrict microbial decomposition of mound organic matter. CO2 effluxes were highest at night and lowest during the day, which is likely due to an increased ant activity or numbers in the mound at night. Diurnal changes in mound CO2 efflux were negatively correlated with air temperature, and positively correlated with the difference between the mound and air temperature. This suggests that thermal convection of warmer mound air to the colder outside air at night might be also a cause of the diurnal changes. We conclude that seasonal and diurnal variations in mound CO2 effluxes are dependent on RWA activities and fluctuation in RWA mound and outside temperatures. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Despite increasing efforts to re-establish forest cover in landscapes that have been previously cleared, the relative ability of different styles of reforestation to contribute to conservation and support forest biota is poorly known, particularly for invertebrates. We investigated the use of different types of reforested habitat by ground-active rainforest beetle assemblages on land, which had been previously cleared of rainforest, in the tropics and subtropics of eastern Australia. Between five and ten replicate sites within each of five reforestation styles were selected in each region: un-managed regrowth, young mono-species timber plantations, young mixed-species timber plantations, ecological restoration plantings, and old mono-species timber plantations, together with reference sites in pasture and in intact rainforest. Ground-active beetles were sampled using pitfall traps, and assemblages were compared among site-types. In both regions, beetle assemblages in all styles of reforestation were intermediate in species composition between pasture and rainforest. The similarity of beetle assemblages to intact rainforest increased with the age and structural complexity of reforested sites. The most rainforest-like beetle assemblages were from older reforestation sites (38-70 year plantations in tropics, and 30-40 year regrowth in subtropics) and in younger (6-22 years) but floristically and structurally diverse ecological restoration plantings in both regions. Assemblages in younger (5-20 year) sites of regrowth, mono-species timber plantations, and mixed-species timber plantations were more similar to pasture than rainforest. We conclude that achieving high canopy cover and sufficient structural complexity are important factors associated with the restoration of rainforest-like beetle assemblages to reforested sites.

AB Biodiversity issues in Brazil have reached a critical point. On one hand, biodiversity science is increasing in quality and quantity, however on the other, habitat destruction in all major biomes still maintain alarmingly high rates. This paradox, from a scientific perspective, has two central tenets that scientists should focus on. First, although science related to biodiversity is of high standard in Brazil as compared to that of peers in the world, it is still not at the leading edge of research. Second, the wealth of information built up by strong research programmes, such as Biota/Fapesp - to which this special issue of Scientia Agricola is dedicated - is beginning to help decision-makers to improve precision and quality of their decisions concerning the environment, but still much is left to be done in this respect. Therefore, I discuss some of the biodiversity issues that remain controversial and demand fast scientific growth. Tackling them Brazil may finally reach the leading edge of biodiversity research. Finally, I discuss how communication between scientists and decision-makers and the general public may be improved, highlighting how a strong education project is urgently needed from kindergarten to graduate programmes in order to solve the two problems above mentioned and definitely crack the paradox biodiversity knowledge vs. biodiversity destruction.

AB High shore littorinid snails exhibit complex spatial distribution patterns, forming dense aggregations both in crevices and on crevice-free sections of rocky shores. To understand how these patterns may form, an individual-based computer simulation of littorinid behaviour, similar to those used to model social insects, was used to mimic snail movement on rocky shores. Individual littorinid movement patterns were simulated, along with chance interactions with other littorinids, their trails, crevices and any resultant decisions made by the littorinids when these interactions occurred. The simulation investigated how simple behavioural rules can predict spatial aggregation patterns and the persistence and variation of these aggregation patterns over timescales of several tidal cycles. Morisita's index of dispersal showed good agreement between the simulation and observed patterns of littorinids on-shore. Trail-following was vital in the simulation, since points where trails intersected with crevices, or points where 2 or more trails met, formed the site of aggregations. Both in the simulation and in reality, aggregations often occurred in identical positions over several tidal cycles, both within and outside crevices. This temporal predictability may be due to the persistence of mucus trails on the shore over successive tidal cycles. Removal of the influence of past mucus trails from the simulation resulted in far lower persistence of aggregations over time. The simulation, therefore, is an important tool in examining behavioural mechanisms of intertidal animals. It provides insights into how simple behaviour of grazing animals can explain complex population patterns and subsequently the community dynamics of algal-herbivore interactions.

AB We review the published information on the raptor species present in the temperate forests of southern South America, focusing our efforts in the four forest-specialist species, that is, forest-depending species especially for nesting. We examined nine categories of ecological knowledge: distribution, habitat/habitat selection, movements, abundance, diet, breeding, behavior, parasites, and conservation status. Our objectives are: 1) generate a data base on raptors of the southern temperate forests; 2) detect gaps in the knowledge on raptors; and 3) establish research priorities on raptor ecology based on the amount of information referring to the above detailed categories.

AB The phylogenetic diversity of extant lemurs represents one of the most important but least studied aspects of the conservation biology of primates. The phylogenetic diversity of a species is inversely proportional to the relative number and closeness of its phylogenetic relatives. Phylogenetic diversity can then be used to determine conservation priorities for specific biogeographic regions. Although Malagasy strepsirhines represent the highest phylogenetic diversity among primates at the global level, there are few phylogenetic data on species-specific and regional conservation plans for lemurs in Madagascar. Therefore, in this paper the following questions are addressed for extant lemurs: 1) how does the measure of taxonomic uniqueness used by Mittermeier et al. U9921 Lemurs of Madagascar; Gland, Switzerland: IUCN) equate with an index of phylogenetic diversity, 2) what are the regional conservation priorities based on analyses of phylogenetic diversity in extant lemurs, and 3) what conservation recommendations can be made based on analyses of phylogenetic diversity in lemurs? Taxonomic endemicity standardized weight (TESW) indices of phylogenetic diversity were used to determine the evolutionary component of biodiversity and to prioritize regions for conserving lemur taxa. TESW refers to the standardization of phylogenetic diversity indices for widespread taxa and endemicity of species. The phylogenetic data came from recent genetic studies of Malagasy strepsirhines at the species level. Lemur species were assigned as being either present or absent in six biogeographic regions. TESW indices were combined with data on lemur complementarity and protected areas to assign conservation priorities at the regional level. Although there were no overall differences between taxonomic ranks and phylogenetic rankings, there were significant differences for the top-ranked taxa. The phylogenetic component of lemur diversity is greatest for Daubentonia madagascariensis, Allocebus trichotis, Lepilemur septentrionalis, Indri indri, and Mirza coquereli. Regional conservation priorities are highest for lemurs that range into northeast humid forests and western dry forests. Expansion of existing protected areas in these regions may provide the most rapid method for preserving lemurs. In the long term, new protected areas must be created because there are lemur species that: 1) are not found in existing protected areas, 2) exist only in one or two protected areas, and 3) are still being discovered outside the current network of protected areas. Data on the population dynamics and feeding ecology of phylogenetically important species are needed to ensure that protected areas adequately conserve lemur populations in Madagascar.

AB Assembly rules are measures of community structure that link observed patterns with ecological processes, and as such may help to elucidate the mechanisms by which species coexist. We apply two approaches to a lawn community-limiting similarity and guild proportionality-hoping that agreement between them might give robust conclusions. We tested for agreement between these two assembly rules using functional characters that are related to two aspects of species fimction-light capture and response to defoliation.
   We combined point quadrat data and a null model approach to test for limiting similarity-a tendency for species differing in functional characters to co-occur more often than expected at random-in turves extracted from the lawn community. Examining the variance in the characters of the species co-occuring at each point, evidence for limiting similarity was found for mowing removal (the proportion of leaf area removed in mowing events). There was greater variation between the species co-occurring at a point than expected at random (i.e., under an appropriate null model). However, no such evidence was found for characters related uniquely to light capture, such as specific leaf area and pigment concentrations.
   In a previous study in the same community, "intrinsic" guilds had been determined from co-occurrences within the lawn community and from a competition experiment, as those effective in determining species assembly and co-existence. These intrinsic guilds are shown by t-test to differ in the proportion of their biomass removed in mowing (MRI), which is of course related to the height at which their leaf area is held. However, again no differences were seen in characters related uniquely to light capture.
   Thus, the two different approaches to assembly rules-guild proportionality and limiting similarity-agree that differences in response to mowing are responsible for species co-existence in the lawn community. The agreement between these two approaches, tested on independent datasets of quite different type from the same community, gives possibly the strongest evidence so far that niche differentiation may be responsible for local co-existence in plant communities. However, although MRI is related to this co-existence the lack of correlation with light-capture characters leads to speculation that the effects might be via the below-ground behaviour of the species.

AB The effects of neighboring vegetation and soil fertility on the establishment, survival and growth of tree species were studied in a subtropical old-field area in south Brazil. Seed damage, germination and seedling establishment of four tree species plus growth and survival of two transplanted tree species were monitored under factorial combinations of the following treatments: (1) pioneer vegetation (presence and absence); (2) soil fertility (addition of NPK and control). Facilitation was the main process affecting plant performance. The presence of pioneer vegetation significantly improved germination, establishment, growth and survival of most study species. Around 90% of sown seeds were damaged and the removal of pioneer vegetation significantly increased seed damage for all species studied, decreased germination in three out of four species, and decreased establishment in one species. Moreover a significantly higher seedling growth rate of Inga virescens was found after the first year of the experiment in plots where vegetation was present. The presence of vegetation significantly increased seedling survival of I. virescens by protecting seedlings from leaf loss due to winter frosts. Competition was detected by the second year when a higher growth of transplanted seedlings of the species Araucaria angustifolia occurred in plots where vegetation was present and fertilizer were applied. A lower growth rate was detected in plots where vegetation was present but fertilizer was not applied. These results indicate a balance between competition for soil nutrients and protection by neighbor vegetation. Damage of seedlings by leaf cutter ants was an important barrier for plant survival. Damage occurred in 80% of the A. angustifolia seedlings and 58% of these damaged seedlings died. The presence of neighboring vegetation tended to protect seedlings from ant damage. Although competition occurred, facilitation seems to be the main process driving early successional changes in this subtropical old field. This was mainly due to the improvement of local microclimatic conditions and protection against herbivores by neighboring vegetation. Facilitation occurred during establishment and growth phases in a subtropical area that is considered a productive, low stress environment. Our results indicate that facilitation may be more frequent in productive environments than previously thought.

AB Sustainable use of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) can be affected by levels of extractions as well as by other anthropogenic influences such as fire and grazing. We examined the effects of fire on the demography of Phyllanthus emblica, an important NTFP in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, India. We then assessed demographic responses to the combined effects of fire and current fruit harvesting patterns. Fruits of Phyllanthus are commercially harvested by an indigenous forest dwelling people. Using matrix population models, we compared demographic indices across a chronosequence of time since last fire. Population growth rates (lambda) ranged from 0.7692 to 1.1443 across the five times since last fire. lambda was the lowest at times since last fire of 2 and 3 yr. Frequent fires increased time to maturity by altering growth and survival rates, thereby causing a demographic shift from growth to regressions or negative growth. Elasticity analysis revealed that stasis of adults makes the biggest contribution to lambda. Simulations of periodic and stochastic fire regimes suggest that higher lambda and population persistence can be achieved at fire-return intervals of >= 7 and >= 9 yr, respectively. These fire-return intervals became longer when the simulations included harvesting and fire. Extinction probabilities under the current fire regimes (every 2-3 yr) suggest that populations will decline to lower densities. Our findings provide critical information for developing guidelines for sustainable use and management of NTFPs in Biligiri Rangan Hills, and demonstrate the need to incorporate various human-generated physical regimes in assessing sustainability of NTFPs.

AB Question: The aim of the present study is to determine whether seed/seedling predation will increase and Fagus survival will decline with the recovery of the Sasa cover.
   Methods: We examined Fagus crenata regeneration for seven years in an old-growth Fagus-Sasa forest near Lake Towada, northern Japan. by examining the effects of simultaneous death of Sasa, tree canopy gap formation, mast seeding of Fagus and seed and seedling predation by rodents on the survival of Fagus seeds and current year seedlings. We established four types, of sites differing in forest canopy (closed or Gap) and Sasa status (dead or alive) following the simultaneous flowering, and death of Sasa kurilensis (dwarf bamboo) in 1995.
   Results: Fallen Fagus seed was abundant in 1997 and 2000 (mast years). In sites with alive Sasa, survival from the first growing season was low due to hi-h seed and seedling predation. In sites with dead Sasa. seed survival under the canopy was high for both mast years, but in gaps it varied between years. Seedling survival was highest in canopy Gaps with dead Sasa (gap-dead) in 1998, because of higher light levels and lower predation by rodents. However, seedling survival in these plots was low in 2001, apparently because rapid Sasa recovery favoured rodent predation. In both mast years, Sasa die-back had significant positive effects on seed and seedling survival tinder closed canopies because the seedlings there were more successful in escaping predation.
   Conclusion: The change in successful sites for the early stage of regeneration of Fagus appears to reflect the combined effects of canopy gap, seed/seedling predation and revegetation of Sasa.

AB Recruitment limitation, which occurs when species either fail to reach regeneration sites or the number of suitable regeneration sites is limited, has been proposed as an important factor that controls population dynamics and species coexistence in tropical moist forests. Dwarf palms in some Neotropical forests dominate the understory strata, and their umbrella-like architecture may intensify understory shade and make the site less suitable for seedling regeneration. In this study we surveyed seedlings under dwarf palms in four habitats at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We compared seedling recruitment in both 2001 and 2002 at non-palm microsites vs microsites under 1) tall dwarf palms, 2) short dwarf palms, and 3) short palms surrounded by dwarf palms. Light environments at non-palm and under-palm sites were quantified with hemispherical photos. Seedling growth, survivorship, density, and species richness all differed significantly among microsites, and were all greatest at non-palm sites and lowest at dense palm sites. Overall, seedling growth, survivorship, density, and species richness were 30%, 50%, 50%, and 40%, respectively, less at under-palm than at nonpalm sites. The main restriction by dwarf palms occurred on post-cotyledonous and woody seedlings. Percent canopy openness differed among microsites, and was greatest at non-palm sites and lowest at dense palm sites. However, seedling responses were only weakly correlated with percent canopy openness. These results revealed significant reduction in seedling recruitment under individual dwarf palms, with greatest negative effects where a palm was surrounded by palms. Dwarf palms occur at high density (2611 individuals/ha) and cover 21% of the understory in the four habitats (alluvium, residual flat area, residual slope area, swamp) of the primary forest. Therefore, this negative impact by individual dwarf palms is significant at the landscape scale as well, based on the great dwarf palm density and coverage in the four habitats.

AB We investigated the ecology and foraging behavior of Acanthina monodon, a muricid gastropod that inhabits in the intertidal rocky shores of central Chile. In the field, we studied temporal variation of their spatial distribution. density. and diet composition. While in the laboratory, we quantified the consumption rate, alimentary preferences, ingestion times and energy profitability obtained with different types of prey using experiments and video recording. High densities of A. monodon individuals were observed in the intertidal fringe near at the level tide zero. In the field, A. monodon actively foraged at night preying mainly on mussels (95 %) and barnacles (5 %). Temporal variation in diet composition of A. monodon was caused mostly by changes in the cover of different mussel species during the two years of sampling. In the laboratory, individual of A. monodon showed significant preference for the Mussel Semimytilus algosus. In these experiments, A. monodon's foraging behavior maximized the net gain of energy by selecting species and sizes of prey that provided the greatest energy profitability.

AB Seed predation is an important factor in determining the rate of tree establishment in abandoned agricultural land. Edges, through altered habitat use by small mammals, may influence the spatial pattern of forest regeneration in these successional sites. To determine the spatial pattern of seed predation across a forest-old field edge, we used a grid that began 30 m inside the forest and extended 60 m into the old field. Seed stations were placed at regular 10-m intervals and were monitored for removal of Acer rubrum seed for 50 d. This design was repeated over four years (1995-1998). Small mammal trapping was conducted in the final year of the study to determine the spatial pattern of seed predators within the site. Removal rates varied among the four years of the study with years of high and low removal rates. However, the spatial pattern of seed removal rate was similar in all years. Final survival ranged from 0.7-15.5% of seeds, with lower final survival in years with faster rates of seed removal (1996 and 1998). Seed removal rates and rates of discovery were greatest at the forest edge and decreased with distance into the old field. The number of seeds surviving to the end of the experiment also varied across the edge gradient, with highest survival at greater distances into the old field in low predation years. Seed removal rate covaried with spatial pattern of Peromyscus leucopus captures within the site. Seed removal and discovery was also higher under the exotic shrub Rosa multiflora, which may have provided cover for foraging seed predators. These indirect effects of edges on plant communities can potentially alter the rate and spatial pattern of tree invasion into disturbed lands and illustrate the importance of understanding plant-animal interactions in the context of habitat fragmentation.

AB Researchers studying forest edge effects in fragmented landscapes have begun to move beyond merely documenting changes along the edge itself to examining the dynamic influences that edges may have on processes in adjacent areas. One such "edge-mediated effect" is the influence that edges may have on canopy gap replacement processes within the forest interior by acting as seed sources for shade-intolerant plant species. In this paper, we coupled analyses of woody species composition in gap and non-gap areas within the interior of an Ohio hardwood forest with a simple cellular automata model of forest dynamics. Non-gap composition was primarily correlated with disturbance history and site conditions (topographic position and slope) while a comparable analysis using a 24-year time series of composition in gaps showed that gap composition was, related most strongly to the proximity of edge communities for the first 10-15 years. However, after 15-20 years of gap succession, composition was correlated with essentially the same variables and to the same degree as non-gap vegetation, suggesting that the influence of edge proximity on interior stand dynamic processes was transient. These results were used to develop a simple mathematical model of stand dynamics that showed that losses of interior forest area may be much greater than typically predicted by core-area models, which do not consider dynamic, edge-mediated effects. Further, our findings suggest the importance of considering disturbance interval in mediating edge-interior relationships, particularly as it may interact with forest size and shape.

AB Stress protein (heat shock protein, hsp70) response is involved in protecting organisms from the detrimental effects of environmental stressors, such as radiation and high temperatures. Tropical chitons can briefly tolerate high temperatures. However, they minimize the effects of elevated temperature during daylight hours and periods of tidal air exposure by remaining in rocky intertidal microhabitats along the shoreline of tropical waters. To study the natural variability of the hsp70 level, individuals of the polyplacophoran species Acanthopleura granulata Gmelin, 1791 were sampled every 4 h on two days in spring of 1999. Hsp70 levels were separately measured in the supernatant of the intestinal tract and foot muscle homogenates with a standardized immunoassay. The hsp70 level in the intestinal tract was highest in the early morning, decreased during the mid-morning hours and dropped to a comparatively low level in the afternoon, before increasing again during the night. The stress protein level in the foot muscle followed the daily air temperature curve with a time delay of a few hours, reaching the highest level in the afternoon and the lowest level in the early morning. The stress protein response can be interpreted as a sign of heat tolerance development and may play a role in allowing A. granulata to tolerate the temperature variability typical of its intertidal habitat.

AB Composite series of ENSO indices recorded over 36 months preceding major fire years in four National Parks in northern Patagonia were compared with series of these indices for individual years over the period 1950-1996 by means of an additive temporal phase coherence index. Logistic regressions of the dichotomous variable high vs low regional fire occurrence against the coherence index gained highest significant classificatory power using an index based on SST anomaly data between January of year -3 to August of year -1, Thus, warnings of extreme fire seasons could be declared as early as 3 months before the full fire season starts (i.e. early September). A regional fire season readiness index is proposed based on the periodicity of the Southern Oscillation, strong links with climate at particular regions of the globe, and empirically derived climatic controls on fine fuel buildup and coarse fuel desiccation. This long-range alerting tool could help decision-makers prepare preventative measures to mitigate the effects of large, high intensity wildfire seasons. However, it should be used with caution given that differences in timing in the onset of ENSO events and instability in teleconnection patterns could change climatic sequences, differentially affecting fire susceptibility.

TI A typology of spatial and temporal scale relations
SO GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB A simple typology of relations between any two geographical scales is established by qualitatively comparing their respective grains and extents. This typology is applied to spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal scales. It describes seven relations between any two scales in either space or tithe. These basic relations yield a set of 169 qualitatively different spatioteomporal scale relations, a subset of which is portrayed diagrammatically. If it is possible to transform processes or patterns front. one scale in the relation to the oilier, up to four scaling methods may need to be simultaneously applied, depending on the relation. Scaling methods might be classed as forms of grain generalization, grain decomposition, extent extrapolation, or extent selection. This typology may also provide a framework for investigations of dependencies between scales, as well as a reference scheme for observations of scale nonstationarity. The possibility is offered that any relation that forms a nonintersecting hierarchy in either space or time is a relation between essentially independent scales. However; the use of this typology is contingent on a number of factors, and it is offered as a tool, rather than a solution, for problems of scale.

AB We studied the resource allocation process of a large-seeded species, Dryobalanops lanceolata, during germination and early stages of seeding growth in Sarawak, East Malaysia. The seeds contained high contents of starch (73.3% of the total 1.57 g mean dry weight of the cotyledon) and lipid (15.0%). All of these reserves were eahausted by the time the first two pairs of leaves had developed (about 10 d after planting), but relatively little had been reserved in leaf or root by that time. This suggests that the large amount of seed reserved of D. lanceolata is necessary just to form a certain size of stern and the necessary number of leaves to set the plant up, for photosynthesis. After seed reserves were exhausted, shoot elongation and new leaf production stopped, and most photosynthate was allocated to the expansion of the root system and to storage in the root as starch. The storage reserves in the root are thought to Ld used for the nest growing stage, not to act as insurance for sprouting in case of shoot damage.

AB Ants are known to concentrate phosphorus (P) inside their nests via collection of food and litter. To elucidate the possible effects on long-term availability of soil P, five anthills abandoned by Red wood ant (Formica polyctena Forster) >5-20 years ago were characterized for soil P forms in a temperate Danish deciduous forest. Sequentially extracted P fractions and liquid-state P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained on surface samples (0-10 cm) from abandoned anthills and adjacent topsoil; in addition one representative soil profile in an abandoned anthill was investigated. The results show that different inorganic and all organic P fractions were enriched by a factor of 2.0-3.3 inside anthills relative to die surrounding soil. The soil underneath the abandoned anthill had higher P contents until 50-cm depth. Phosphorus composition was less affected by former anthill construction. Only the younger anthills revealed a preferential accumulation of labile organic P forms such as Na-HCO3 extractable P or diester P. The accumulation of the stable and moderate labile P forms, however, persisted for greater than or equal to 20 years after abandonment. We concluded that former ant activity enhanced long-term P availability of soil due to high local P inputs, whereas changes of the P form distribution lasted 5-10 years after nest abandonment.

AB The Ebro Delta is a wetland area partially covered by rice fields.The viperine snake Natrix maura, is a common colubrid snake in this ecosystem. Males delayed feeding activity by one month, and foraged for a shorter time, compared to females. Diet consisted mainly of fish and frogs, although size-related and sexual differences were found: immature snakes had a more diverse diet than adults, and adult females ate more frogs than adult males. Males captured larger numbers of smaller fish than females. Like other water snakes, large viperine snakes avoid small prey. The biomass ingested is higher in large females, providing supplementary resources for reproduction. These dietary differences may be related to the ecological needs of each category of snakes and reflect the influence of the rice cycle on diet dynamics.

AB Seed-bank dynamics of C. controversa, a common tree in Japanese temperate forests, were investigated at Ogawa Forest Reserve by direct measurement of seed input, soil seed density, and seedling output (germination of soil seeds), together with two field experiments on postdispersal seed mortality. Soil seed density varied from 4 to 233 m(-2) in the site near conspecific adults (<5 m horizontally from crown edge), and 0 to 18 m(-2) in far sites (greater than or equal to 5 m) during the 1988-92 period. Seed input occurred only in 1988 and 1990: 190-740 m(-2) at the sites near conspecific adults, and 4-20 m(-2) at the far sites. Seedling output was observed every year and accounted for 0-15% of the loss from the seed bank, occasionally 30-60%. Seeds buried at 5-cm depth suffered moderate mortality (c. 0.2 year(-1)) by fungal pathogens. In contrast, seeds experimentally placed on the ground suffered higher mortality (0.5-1 year(-1)) through predation by ground mammals, probably wood mice. In the experiment, seeds whose mesocarp was removed survived much better. On the other hand, distance itself did not appear to affect post-dispersal mortality of seeds. Seeds in canopy gaps also tended to suffer higher mortality. Current spatial pattern and mode of seed dispersal should decrease the potential ability of the seed bank of this species to colonize safe sites. Rare and unpredictable events might increase the contribution of the seed-bank strategy to regeneration in this forest.

AB In this research, we attempt to quantify the factors structuring woody species composition within forest gaps in the interior of Hueston Woods Nature Preserve, Ohio. Our results indicate that composition is related nor only to factors commonly cited in other studies, including disturbance history, topographic position, and environmental factors (e.g., gap age, soil pH, slope, and aspect), but also to the proximity of forest edge communities. Partitioning of species variation to environmental factors, spatial factors, and spatially structured environmental factors reinforces the importance of both environment and edge proximity in explaining gap composition. These findings underscore the need for a more complete understanding of the potential impacts of edge effects in fragmented landscapes.

AB Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are a conspicuous group of ectotherms whose behavior, distribution, physiology, and fitness are regulated by temperature. Consequently, interest in traits like thermal tolerance that enable ants to survive and thrive in variable climates has increased exponentially over the past few decades. Here, we synthesize the published literature on the thermal tolerance of ants. We begin our review with discussion of common metrics: critical thermal limits, lethal thermal limits, knock-down resistance, chill-coma recovery, and supercooling. In particular, we highlight the ways each thermal metric is quantified and offer a set of methodological caveats for consideration. We next describe patterns and hypotheses for ant thermal tolerance along spatial and temporal temperature gradients. Spatially, we focus on relationships with latitude, elevation, urbanization, and microclimate. Temporally, we focus on seasonal plasticity, daily variation, dominance-thermal tolerance tradeoffs, and acclimation. We further discuss other sources of variation including evolutionary history, body size, age, castes, and nutrition. Finally, we highlight several topics of interest to ant thermal biologists, ranging in scope from methods development to the impacts of climate change.

AB We examine deforestation processes in Apui, a deforestation hotspot in Brazil's state of Amazonas and present processes of land-use change on this Amazonian development frontier. Settlement projects attract agents whose clearing reflects land accumulation and the economic importance of deforestation. We used a mixed-method approach in the Rio Juma Settlement to examine colonization and deforestation trajectories for 35 years at three scales of analysis: the entire landscape, cohorts of settlement lots divided by occupation periods, and lots grouped by landholding size per household. All sizes of landholdings are deforesting much more than before, and current political and economic forces favoring the agribusiness sector foreshadow increasing rates of forest clearing for pasture establishment in Apui. The area cleared per year over the 2013-2018 period in Apui grew by a percentage more than twice the corresponding percentage for the Brazilian Amazon as a whole. With the national congress and presidential administration signaling impunity for illegal deforestation, wealthy actors, and groups are investing resources in land grabbing and land accumulation, with land speculation being a crucial deforestation factor. This paper is unique in providing causal explanations at the decision-maker's level on how deforestation trajectories are linked to economic and political events (period effects) at the larger scales, adding to the literature by showing that such effects were more important than aging and cohort effects as explanations for deforestation trajectories. Additional research is needed to deepen our understanding of relations between land speculation, illegal possession of public lands, and the expansion of agricultural frontiers in Amazonia.

AB The remarkable biodiversity of the Brazilian Amazon is poorly documented and threatened by deforestation. When undocumented areas become deforested, in addition to losing the fauna and flora, we lose the opportunity to know which unique species had occupied a habitat. Here we quantify such knowledge loss by calculating how much of the Brazilian Amazon has been deforested and will likely be deforested until 2050 without having its tree flora sufficiently documented. To this end, we analysed 399 147 digital specimens of nearly 6000 tree species in relation to official deforestation statistics and future deforestation scenarios. We find that by 2017, 30% of all the localities where tree specimens had been collected were mostly deforested. Some 300 000 km(2)(12%; 485 25 x 25 km grid cells) of the Brazilian Amazon had been deforested by 2017, without having a single tree specimen recorded. An additional 250 000-900 000 km(2)of severely under-collected rainforest will likely become deforested by 2050. If future tree sampling is to cover this area, sampling effort has to increase two- to six-fold. Nearly 255 000 km(2)or 7% of rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon is easily accessible but does yet but remain under-collected. Our study highlights how progressing deforestation increases the risk of losing undocumented species of a hyper-diverse tree flora.

AB Understanding species' tolerance to recurrent extreme droughts is key to predict species' performance and forest dynamics under ongoing climate change. Inter-specific differences in juvenile responses can largely shape forest composition and structure. However, the vulnerability of tree species is typically evaluated in adult canopy dominant individuals. The question of whether inter-specific differences in drought tolerance vary between adult and young trees remains largely unexplored. We sampled canopy dominant trees and saplings of three co-occurring pine species with different drought tolerance (Pinus pinaster, P. nigra and P. sylvestris) in a relict forest in the Northern Iberian plateau. Using basal area increment in canopy dominant trees and shoot elongation in saplings, we reconstructed annual growth for the period 2000-2015 and calculated resilience and resistance indices to two consecutive extreme droughts (2005 and 2012). We used generalized least square models to analyze species-specific differences in resistance and resilience in adults and saplings, respectively after accounting for tree size and stand basal area effects. In addition, we recorded living and dead saplings to assess inter-specific dissimilarities after the drought events. Drought events strongly reduced the growth of both adults and saplings (40% on average), but they were more resilient to the 2005 than to the 2012 drought. Increased magnitude and frequency of drought events led to inter-specific differences in drought responses, which were revealed in saplings rather than adults after the 2012 drought. P. pinaster saplings were more resilient than P. nigra and P. sylvestris, consistently to the drought stress experienced by each species in the dry-edge of their natural ranges. Moreover, a greater recruitment and similar sapling mortality confirm P. pinaster as the most successful pine species from a demographic perspective. In addition, tree size reduced resilience whereas basal area in the tree neighborhood did not show any significant effect on pine tolerance to drought. In conclusion, we showed that increased the magnitude and frequency of drought events uncovers species-specific differences in drought resilience in saplings rather than adults. Our results suggest potential shifts in the dominance of P. pinaster as the expense of P. nigra and P. sylvestris under climate change in this relict forest. This highlights the need to include juveniles and demographic rates in models aiming to describe and predict species responses to climate change in dry-edge forests.

AB A synthetic model is presented to enlarge the evolutionary framework of the General Dynamic Model (GDM) and the Glacial Sensitive Model (GSM) of oceanic island biogeography from the terrestrial to the marine realm. The proposed 'Sea-Level Sensitive' dynamic model (SLS) of marine island biogeography integrates historical and ecological biogeography with patterns of glacio-eustasy, merging concepts from areas as diverse as taxonomy, biogeography, marine biology, volcanology, sedimentology, stratigraphy, palaeontology, geochronology and geomorphology. Fundamental to the SLS model is the dynamic variation of the littoral area of volcanic oceanic islands (defined as the area between the intertidal and the 50-m isobath) in response to sea-level oscillations driven by glacial-interglacial cycles. The following questions are considered by means of this revision: (i) what was the impact of (global) glacio-eustatic sea-level oscillations, particularly those of the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial episodes, on the littoral marine fauna and flora of volcanic oceanic islands? (ii) What are the main factors that explain the present littoral marine biodiversity on volcanic oceanic islands? (iii) How can differences in historical and ecological biogeography be reconciled, from a marine point of view? These questions are addressed by compiling the bathymetry of 11 Atlantic archipelagos/islands to obtain quantitative data regarding changes in the littoral area based on Pleistocene sea-level oscillations, from 150 thousand years ago (ka) to the present. Within the framework of a model sensitive to changing sea levels, we discuss the principal factors affecting the geographical range of marine species; the relationships between modes of larval development, dispersal strategies and geographical range; the relationships between times of speciation, modes of larval development, ecological zonation and geographical range; the influence of sea-surface temperatures and latitude on littoral marine species diversity; the effect of eustatic sea-level changes and their impact on the littoral marine biota; island marine species-area relationships; and finally, the physical effects of island ontogeny and its associated submarine topography and marine substrate on littoral biota. Based on the SLS dynamic model, we offer a number of predictions for tropical, subtropical and temperate volcanic oceanic islands on how rates of immigration, colonization, in-situ speciation, local disappearance, and extinction interact and affect the marine biodiversity around islands during glacials and interglacials, thus allowing future testing of the theory.

AB Habitat complexity conferred by vegetation characteristics mediates key processes that govern the assemblage of insect communities. Thus, species within the community should only persist if their functional traits are well-matched to the conditions of their environment. Here, we compared ant assemblages between habitats in terms of species richness and functional-trait distribution at the species and the assemblage level. Ants were collected from 36 sites representing different degrees of habitat complexity mediated by standing vegetation. We found fewer ant species in simpler habitats, supporting the "habitat-heterogeneity" hypothesis. We measured key functional traits of ants that reflect their foraging and dispersal strategies, such as body size, femur length, antenna scape length, and head length / width. Interactions of species traits with measured habitat complexity variables were assessed at the species and the assemblage level using a fourth-corner approach. Ant traits were closely related to environmental complexity. In wooded habitats, ants were larger and had broader heads, while ants with longer antenna scapes prevailed in habitats with a dense herb / grass layer. Our study suggests that vegetation structural complexity can act as an environmental filter, driving ant assemblages in terms of both species numbers and functional traits. Our results can be used to predict turnover patterns in ant assemblages due to changes in management practices.

AB Coffee agroforestry systems are a promising approach to the challenge of sustaining both biodiversity and livelihoods in tropical landscapes. However, coffee farmers' response to the unrelenting coffee leaf rust (CLR) outbreak may have repercussions for the potential of coffee agroforestry systems to contribute to biodiversity conservation. Adaptations in management practices could affect the extent to which farmers rely on ecological processes vs. external inputs (e.g., agrochemicals) to support production. This study investigates farmers' response to CLR outbreak through a study in a forest frontier in a Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico. We conducted household surveys and fieldwork before the CLR outbreak in 2011-2012 (n = 59), and follow-up surveys after the outbreak in 2016 (n = 48). Before CLR outbreak, farmers were cultivating Arabica coffee varieties in agroforestry systems and generally following agroecological approaches. Most farmers (82%) were certified organic and did not employ synthetic agrochemicals. Farmers (66%) had plans to expand their Arabica coffee agroforests either into forest (35%) or fallow (31%) in response to high farm gate prices. After CLR outbreak, 94% of farmers had CLR-resistant hybrid coffee varieties (HCV) in their possession and were either incorporating them by substituting affected Arabica coffee plants in existing fields, or by establishing new coffee fields with HCV at lower elevations. In attempts to control CLR, farmers (54%) also applied agrochemicals at least once and, to a lesser extent (19%), removed shade trees. Among the farmers (63%) who were planning on expanding coffee production with HCV, more farmers were planning on expanding on fallow (46%) than forest (17%) compared to the period before CLR outbreak (p-value < 0.05). Public and private actors promoted and distributed saplings of HCV and agrochemicals along with technical assistance. The promotion of HCV along with fertilizers may result in a substitution of ecosystem functions with agrochemicals, and the need to acquire seeds and saplings outside of farmers' own resource base and networks. This shift in management strategies generates new instabilities and risks by introducing a new market for HCV about which little is known and by making external agents the holders of productive resources and knowledge.

AB Wind erosion exerts a fundamental influence on the biotic and abiotic processes associated with ecosystem carbon (C) cycle. However, how wind erosion under different land use scenarios will affect ecosystem C balance and its capacity for future C sequestration is poorly quantified. Here, we simulated different intensities of land uses in Inner Mongolia: control, 50% of vegetation mowed (50M), 100% vegetation mowed (100M), and tillage (TI). We monitored abiotic C flux caused by wind erosion, net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and soil characteristics from 2013 to 2016. We found that the frequency of heavy wind exerts a fundamental control over the severity of soil erosion, and its interaction with precipitation and vegetation characteristics explained 69% of the variation in erosion intensity. With increases in land use intensity, the abiotic C flux induced by wind erosion increased rapidly, equivalent to 33%, 86%, 111%, and 183% of the NEE of natural steppe in the control, 50M, 100M, and TI sites, respectively. The erosion-induced decrease in fine fraction soils led to 31%, 43%, and 85% permanent losses of C sequestration potential in the surface soil for 50M, 100M, and TI sites. Overall, our study demonstrates that the abiotic C flux associated with wind erosion is too large to be ignored. The loss of C-enriched fine particles not only reduces the current ecosystem C content but also results in an irreversible loss of future soil C sequestration potential. These dynamic soil characteristics need to be considered when projecting future ecosystem C balance in aeolian landscapes.

AB A positive biodiversity - aboveground biomass relationship is often attributed to the niche complementarity hypothesis. This hypothesis has received much less support when based on functional trait diversity and when tested in complex natural forests. Here, we hypothesized that niche complementarity (high trait diversity) in the understorey and niche overlap (low trait diversity) in the overstorey would drive whole-community aboveground biomass. To test this hypothesis, we used multiple linear regression models to evaluate how functional trait diversity (functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion) of overstorey, understorey, and whole community determine aboveground biomass across 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest of Eastern China. A structural equation model was used to evaluate whether the functional trait diversity of overstorey affects the relationships between understorey functional trait diversity and whole-community aboveground biomass while considering for the effect of environmental factors. We additionally considered the effects of mass ratio (i.e. community-weighted mean of trait values) and stand structural complexity. The strong negative effect of overstorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass provides support to the functional dominance and/or niche overlap rather than niche complementarity effect. The negative effect of overstorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass was also partially mediated by its direct negative effect on understorey functional evenness. The weak positive effect of understorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass provides support to the niche complementarity effect. We conclude that functional evenness of overstorey and understorey strata affect whole-community aboveground biomass differently through opposing mechanisms, regardless of the effects of mass ratio and stand structural complexity.

AB 1. Evergreen broad-leaved forests are widely distributed in eastern Asia with evergreen broad-leaved (EBL) and deciduous broad-leaved (DBL) tree species coexisting under the same climatic regime, raising questions as to the underlying mechanisms. Since EBL and DBL species differ in leaf life span, a key component of resource economic strategies, their coexistence might be attributed to regeneration niche partitioning across habitats varying in resource supply.
   2. We investigated the effects of variation in insolation and topography on regeneration of EBL and DBL species in a subtropical EBL forest of eastern China after an ice storm that caused severe canopy disturbance.
   3. Using a mixed-effects modelling framework and census data from 2011 to 2014 on 8,548 wild seedlings of 123 species, we quantified habitat preferences of EBL and DBL species during post-disturbance regeneration and how their survival and height relative growth rates varied among habitats.
   4. The relative density of DBL seedlings (proportional to all seedlings) was greater in habitats with greater (canopy gaps) compared to habitats with lesser (understorey) insolation and increased with canopy gap size. However, DBL seedlings were not more frequent in higher (valleys) compared to lower (ridges) fertility habitats. Although DBL seedlings exhibited larger differences in growth between higher and lower resource habitats than EBL seedlings, their growth rates did not increase with canopy gap size. Seedlings of EBL species had high survival in all habitats, but larger DBL seedlings survived equally well on ridges. Consequently, the relative density of DBL seedlings declined in valleys, so that by 2014 it became more similar in valley and ridge habitats, whereas it remained higher in gaps than in the understorey, and especially in larger gaps.
   5. Synthesis. Specialization on contrasting topographic habitats is considered the primary mechanism mediating coexistence between deciduous broad-leaved and evergreen broad-leaved species. Our results, however, suggest this may not always be true, since seedlings of deciduous broad-leaved and evergreen broad-leaved species partitioned regeneration niches based on light more so than topography. We propose that coexistence of deciduous broad-leaved and evergreen broad-leaved species can strongly depend upon canopy disturbance to create a mosaic of habitat patches, including high light gaps favouring regeneration of deciduous broad-leaved species.

AB Varzea forests account for 17% of the Amazon basin and endure an annual inundation that can reach 14 m deep during 6-8 months. This flood pulse in combination with topography directly influences the varzea vegetation cover. Assemblages of several taxa differ significantly between unflooded terra firme and flooded varzea forests, but little is known about the distribution of medium and large sized terrestrial mammals in varzea habitats. Therefore, our goal was to understand how those habitats influence mammalian species distribution during the dry season. Specifically, we: (1) compared the species composition between a terra firme (Amana Sustainable Development Reserve) and a varzea forest (Mamiraua A Sustainable Development Reserve); and (2) tested the influence of the varzea habitat classes on the number of records, occurrence and species composition of mammalian assemblages. The sampling design in each reserve consisted of 50 baited camera trap stations, with an overall sampling effort of 5015 camera trap days. We used Non-Metric Multidimension Scaling (NMDS) to compare species composition between terra firme and varzea forests, and used Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to assess how habitat types and a habitat diversity index affect mammal distributions. We recorded 21 medium and large sized mammalian species, including 20 species in terra firme and only six in varzea (3443 records). Flood pulse and isolation in varzea forest drove the dissimilarity between these two forest types. In varzea forest, medium size mammals, in general, avoided habitats associated with long flooding periods, while jaguars (Panthera onca) appeared to prefer aquatic/terrestrial transition zones. Habitats that remain dry for longer periods showed more mammalian occurrence, suggesting that dispersion via soil is important even for semi-arboreal species. This is the first study to evaluate differential use of varzea habitats by terrestrial mammalian assemblages.

AB 1. Tropical conservation strategies traditionally focus on large tracts of pristine forests but, given rapid primary forest decline, understanding the role of secondary forest remnants for biodiversity maintenance is critical. Until now, the interactive effects of changes in forest amount, configuration and disturbance history (secondary vs. primary forest) on the conservation value of tropical landscapes have remained unknown, hampering the incorporation of these global change drivers into local and global conservation planning.
   2. We disentangled effects of landscape-wide forest amount, fragment size and forest age (old growth vs. secondary forest) on abundance, beta-diversity, beta-diversity (biotic homogenization) and community shifts of bird communities in human-dominated landscapes of southern Costa Rica. Utilizing two complementary methods, yielding 6,900 individual detections and 223 species, we characterized bird communities in 49 forest fragments representing independent gradients in fragment size (<5 ha vs. >30 ha) and forest amount (5%-80%) in the surrounding landscape (within 1000 m).
   3. Abundance and beta-diversity of forest specialists and insectivores declined by half in small fragments, but only in landscapes with little old-growth forest. Conversely, secondary forest at the landscape scale showed no such compensation effect. Similarly, a null-model approach indicated significant biotic homogenization in small vs. large fragments, but only in landscapes with little old-growth forest, suggesting forest amount and configuration interactively affect beta-diversity in tropical human-dominated landscapes. Finally, dramatic abundance-based community shifts relative to intact forests are largely a result of landscape-scale loss of old growth rather than changes in overall forest cover.
   4.Policy implications. Our study provides strong evidence that retaining old growth within tropical human-modified landscapes can simultaneously curb erosion of avian forest specialist beta-diversity, mitigate collapse of beta-diversity (biotic homogenization) and dampen detrimental avian community shifts. However, secondary forests play, at best, a subordinate role to mitigate these processes. To maintain tropical forest biodiversity, retaining old-growth forest within landscapes should be first priority, highlighting a land-sparing approach.

AB We used point pattern analysis (pair-correlation function, K2 function, distance to kth neighbor D-k, and spherical contact distribution function HO to describe the process of plant pattern formation for five dominant tree species with different life strategies in a mixed-forest stand with Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et. Zucc.) in the southern part of the Sikhote-Alin mountain range (southeastern Russia). We subdivided each species pattern using an ontogenetic classification of individuals: immature, virginal, and generative. We also analyzed stump pattern structure, which marks canopy gap formation locations in recent decades. We also studied the shade tolerance changes of pre-generative plants during their development. As a result, we found similarities between the processes of pattern transformation for the different species. Namely, they transform from pronounced aggregated distributions of plants at several spatial scales (immature plants) to a random pattern (middle-aged and old generative plants). This transformation of pattern structure occurs because the immature plants accumulate under a canopy and require significantly improved light conditions that can only be found in gaps to transition into the virginal and young-generative stage. In turn, the process of gap formation is stochastic, and the stand is characterized by a low-intensity disturbance regime. Thus, the pre-generative plant patterns are filtered by randomly formed gaps, and thus only individual randomly distributed plants reach the middle-aged and old generative ontogenetic states.

AB While a significant effort has been made to understand how human activities influence biodiversity, less attention has been given to the consequences of tropical forest disturbance on belowground functional processes and its linkages with environmental drivers. Here, we demonstrate how selective logging influenced dung beetle communities and two associated ecological processes - namely, dung consumption and incidental soil bioturbation - in the eastern Brazilian Amazon, using a robust before-and-after control-impact design. We tested hypotheses about logging-induced changes on environmental condition (canopy cover, leaf litter and soil texture), community metrics (e.g. dung beetle species richness and biomass) and beetle-mediated faecal-detritus processing; and on the importance of the environment for beetle communities and functional processes. We show that post-logging changes in canopy openness do not necessarily mediate logging impacts on dung beetle diversity and biomass, which were directly influenced by reduced impact logging (RIL) operations. Although neither environmental condition (leaf litter or soil sand content) nor faecal consumption and incidental soil bioturbation were directly affected by RIL, the relationships between environmental condition and biological components were. By showing that selective logging alters the linkages among belowground ecological processes and environmental drivers, we provide support that logged forests can retain some important functioning processes, in particular faecal consumption, even when the dung beetle diversity and biomass are impoverished. These results provide support for the resistance of functional processes to logging-induced changes in biodiversity.

AB Past climate changes provide important clues for advancement of studies on current global change biology. We have tested large-scale biogeographic patterns through four marine groups from twelve Atlantic Ocean archipelagos and searched for patterns between species richness/endemism and littoral area, age, isolation, latitude and mean annual sea-surface temperatures. Species richness is strongly correlated with littoral area. Two reinforcing effects take place during glacial episodes: i) species richness is expected to decrease (in comparison with interglacial periods) due to the local disappearance of sandy/muddy-associated species; ii) because littoral area is minimal during glacial episodes, area per se induces a decrease on species richness (by extirpation/extinction of marine species) as well as affecting speciation rates. Maximum speciation rates are expected to occur during the interglacial periods, whereas immigration rates are expected to be higher at the LGM. Finally, sea-level changes are a paramount factor influencing marine biodiversity of animals and plants living on oceanic islands.

AB The host range of a plant virus is the number of species in which it can reproduce. Most studies of plant virus host range evolution have focused on the genetics of host-pathogen interactions. However, the distribution and abundance of plant viruses and their hosts do not always overlap, and these spatial and temporal discontinuities in plant virus-host interactions can result in various ecological processes that shape host range evolution. Recent work shows that the distributions of pathogenic and resistant genotypes, vectors, and other resources supporting transmission vary widely in the environment, producing both expected and unanticipated patterns. The distributions of all of these factors are influenced further by competitive effects, natural enemies, anthropogenic disturbance, the abiotic environment, and herbivory to mention some. We suggest the need for further development of approaches that (i) explicitly consider resource use and the abiotic and biotic factors that affect the strategies by which viruses exploit resources; and (ii) are sensitive across scales. Host range and habitat specificity will largely determine which phyla are most likely to be new hosts, but predicting which host and when it is likely to be infected is enormously challenging because it is unclear how environmental heterogeneity affects the interactions of viruses and hosts.

AB Aim: Biotic interactions have traditionally been predicted to be stronger towards the tropics. However, all previous studies about the latitudinal gradient in seed predation were either based on single species or compiled data from studies that used different methods in different ecosystems. Our goal was to provide the first broad-scale quantification of the latitudinal gradient in seed predation at both cross-species and within-species levels.
   Location: Twenty-five sites spanning 28 degrees of latitude on the east coast of Australia.
   Methods: Using consistent protocols, we measured pre-dispersal seed predation for 256 species x site combinations (including a total of 170 species) and post-dispersal seed removal for 126 species x site combinations (including a total of 91 species), as well as removal of standard rice grains at each site. The relationships between seed predation and latitude were quantified using generalized mixed-effects models and meta-analyses.
   Results: Contrary to expectations, the proportion of seeds lost to pre-dispersal seed predation increased with latitude at the cross-species level and showed no latitudinal trend at the within-species level. There was no significant relationship between latitude and the proportion of seeds lost to post-dispersal seed removal, either within species or across species. We found significantly higher removal of standard rice grains at lower latitudes, but this trend reversed if we excluded the four island sites from analysis.
   Main conclusions: Seed predation on natural seeds was not higher at lower latitudes. Thus, our study joins a growing body of evidence contrary to the idea that tropical species suffer greater losses to herbivores than do temperate species. The latitudinal gradient in removal rates for standard rice grains suggests that natural seeds from low latitudes may have achieved a similar predation rate to high-latitudinal species through increased investment in defenses. However, additional data will be necessary to test this hypothesis.

AB The rapidly declining tropical forests of Asia support a diversity of felid species, many of which are rare and little known. We used camera traps in Dampa Tiger Reserve (TR), Mizoram, northeastern India, to estimate population density and describe activity patterns of 2 rare felids, the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) and marbled cat (Pardofelis marmorata). With a survey effort of 4,962 trap nights, we obtained 84 photo-captures of clouded leopards and 36 of marbled cats. We used spatially explicit capture-recapture methods to estimate population densities of both species. Using the Bayesian approach implemented in SPACECAP, we derived estimates of 5.14 (+/- 1.80 SD)/100 km(2) for clouded leopards and 5.03 (+/- 2.07 SD)/100 km(2) for marbled cats. Using camera-trap images, we compared diel activity patterns and activity overlaps for these 2 rare felids, together with 3 other sympatric carnivores, by estimating a coefficient of overlap between species. Among felids, clouded leopards and golden cats (Catopuma temminckii) displayed the highest overlap in activity, whereas marbled cats and leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) showed the lowest, with marbled cats being primarily diurnal and leopard cats nocturnal. Our study provides the first density estimates from continental Southeast Asia for marbled cats and one of the highest recorded densities for clouded leopards. These results are of special significance since Dampa sustains an ecosystem that has in recent times undergone near extirpation of large predators.

AB We performed a literature review in order to improve our understanding of how landscape and climate drivers affect HCPS outbreaks. Anthropogenic landscape changes such as forest loss, fragmentation and agricultural land uses are related with a boost in hantavirus reservoir species abundance and hantavirus prevalence in tropical areas, increasing HCPS risk. Additionally, higher precipitation, especially in arid regions, favors an increase in vegetational biomass, which augments the resources for reservoir rodents, also increasing HCPS risk. Although these relationships were observed, few studies described it so far, and the ones that did it are concentrated in few places. To guide future research on this issue, we build a conceptual model relating landscape and climate variables with HCPS outbreaks and identified research opportunities. We point out the need for studies addressing the effects of landscape configuration, temperature and the interaction between climate and landscape variables. Critical landscape thresholds are also highly relevant, once HCPS risk transmission can increase rapidly above a certain degree of landscape degradation. These studies could be relevant to implement preventive measures, creating landscapes that can mitigate disease spread risk.

AB From an ecological perspective, urban green roofs can be viewed as green islands embedded in an urban matrix. Island biogeography theory suggests that species richness on an island is the outcome of dynamic equilibrium between immigration and extinction. Immigration is affected by the size of an island and distance of an island from a colonizing source. In the context of green roofs, building height and horizontal distance from green areas can potentially be a limiting factor for many species. Here, we considered two distance components of green roofs - vertical (building height) and horizontal (distance of building from open green areas). Based on island biogeography theory, we would expect species richness or community similarity to be negatively related to horizontal or vertical distances from colonizing sources. The green roof literature addressing such questions is currently sparse. In our review comprised of 10 studies, we were unable to identify consistent statistically significant richness-distance or community similarity-distance (vertical or horizontal) relationships. The absence of statistically significant relationships could be due in large part to low statistical power as a consequence of both the paucity of roofs and limited range of vertical distances in many of the existing studies. In addition, these roofs differ in numerous aspects (e.g. roof size, age, substrate type, plant composition and building height). The low number of replicates, combined with the lack of homogeneity among replicates combines to reduce statistical power and our ability to detect differences.

AB Variation in diet breadth among organisms is a pervasive feature of the natural world that has resisted general explanation. In particular, trade-offs in the ability to use one resource at the expense of another have been expected but rarely detected. We explore a spatial model for the evolution of specialization, motivated by studies of plant-feeding insects. The model is neutral with respect to the causes and consequences of diet breadth: the number of hosts utilized is not constrained by trade-offs, and specialization or generalization does not confer a direct advantage with respect to the persistence of populations or the probability of diversification. We find that diet breadth evolves in ways that resemble reports from natural communities. Simulated communities are dominated by specialized species, with a predictable but less species-rich component of generalized taxa. These results raise the possibility that specialization might be a consequence of stochastic diversification dynamics acting on spatially segregated consumer-resource associations rather than a trait either favored or constrained directly by natural selection. Finally, our model generates hypotheses for global patterns of herbivore diet breadth, including a positive effect of host richness and a negative effect of evenness in host plant abundance on the number of specialized taxa.

AB Regional species diversity generally increases with primary productivity whereas local diversity-productivity relationships are highly variable. This scale-dependence of the biodiversity-productivity relationship highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms that govern variation in species composition among local communities, which is known beta-diversity. Hypotheses to explain changes in beta-diversity with productivity invoke multiple mechanisms operating at local and regional scales, but the relative importance of these mechanisms is unknown. Here we show that changes in the strength of local density-dependent interactions within and among tree species explain changes in beta-diversity across a subcontinental-productivity gradient. Stronger conspecific relative to heterospecific negative density dependence in more productive regions was associated with higher local diversity, weaker habitat partitioning (less species sorting), and homogenization of community composition among sites (lower beta-diversity). Regional processes associated with changes in species pools had limited effects on beta-diversity. Our study suggests that systematic shifts in the strength of local interactions within and among species might generally contribute to some of the most prominent but poorly understood gradients in global biodiversity.

AB The response of tropical forests to anthropogenic climate change is critically important to future global carbon budgets, yet remains highly uncertain. Here, we investigate how precipitation, temperature, solar radiation and dry-and wet-season lengths are related to annual tree growth, flower production, and fruit production in three moist tropical forest tree species using long-term datasets from tree rings and litter traps in central Panama. We also evaluated how growth, flower, and fruit production were interrelated. We found that growth was positively correlated with wet-season precipitation in all three species: Jacaranda copaia (r = 0.63), Tetragastris panamensis (r = 0.39) and Trichilia tuberculata (r = 0.39). Flowering and fruiting in Jacaranda were negatively related to current-year dry-season rainfall and positively related to prior-year dry-season rainfall. Flowering in Tetragastris was negatively related to current-year annual mean temperature while Trichilia showed no significant relationships of reproduction with climate. Growth was significantly related to reproduction only in Tetragastris, where it was positively related to previous year fruiting. Our results suggest that tree growth in moist tropical forest tree species is generally reduced by drought events such as those associated with strong El Nino events. In contrast, interannual variation in reproduction is not generally associated with growth and has distinct and species-specific climate responses, with positive effects of El Nino events in some species. Understanding these contrasting climate effects on tree growth and reproduction is critical to predicting changes in tropical forest dynamics and species composition under climate change.

AB The resource availability hypothesis (RAH), the most successful theory explaining plant defence patterns, predicts that defence investment is related to the relative growth rate (RGR) of plant species, which is associated with habitat quality. Thus, fast-growing species should show lower resistance than slow-growing species, which would lead fast growers to sustain higher herbivory rates, but the fitness consequences of herbivory would be greater for slow growers. The latter is often assumed but rarely tested. In a temperate rainforest, we tested the expected pattern of tolerance to herbivory derived from the RAH: that fast-growing species should be more tolerant than slow growing species. We also evaluated whether other plant features covary with RGR (leaf lifespan, shade tolerance and leaf toughness) and thus could also contribute to the patterns of tolerance to herbivory. As expected, seedlings from tree species with higher RGR showed greater tolerance to herbivory. Among the three plant features included, only leaf lifespan showed a significant association with RGR, but RGR was the best predictor of tolerance. We argue that plant tolerance to herbivory must be evaluated to properly verify the assumptions of the RAH.

AB We present evidence that populations of an invasive plant species that have become re-associated with a specialist herbivore in the exotic range through biological control have rapidly evolved increased antiherbivore defences compared to populations not exposed to biocontrol. We grew half-sib families of the invasive plant Lythrum salicaria sourced from 17 populations near Ottawa, Canada, that differed in their history of exposure to a biocontrol agent, the specialist beetle Neogalerucella calmariensis. In a glasshouse experiment, we manipulated larval and adult herbivory to examine whether a population's history of biocontrol influenced plant defence and growth. Plants sourced from populations with a history of biocontrol suffered lower defoliation than naive, previously unexposed populations, strongly suggesting they had evolved higher resistance. Plants from biocontrol-exposed populations were also larger and produced more branches in response to herbivory, regrew faster even in the absence of herbivory and were better at compensating for the impacts of herbivory on growth (i.e. they exhibited increased tolerance). Furthermore, resistance and tolerance were positively correlated among genotypes with a history of biocontrol but not among naive genotypes. Our findings suggest that biocontrol can rapidly select for increased defences in an invasive plant and may favour a mixed defence strategy of resistance and tolerance without an obvious cost to plant vigour. Although rarely studied, such evolutionary responses in the target species have important implications for the long-term efficacy of biocontrol programmes.

AB Biotic homogenization-the erosion of biological differences between ecosystems owing to human perturbation-is a trait of the global biodiversity crisis that can affect tropical dry forest biodiversity. We tested whether biotic homogenization was occurring in resident forest bird communities in west-central Mexico. We conducted point-count surveys to assess biotic dissimilarity between resident bird communities in tropical deciduous and oak forests in the upper Balsas River basin across 3 levels of anthropogenic perturbation: primary forest, second-growth forest, and human settlements. We detected a reduction in species richness and taxonomic dissimilarity with increasing anthropogenic effects, due to a directional pattern in which lowland species expanded their elevational distributions up into oak forests. These results point to a need to change agricultural strategies to mitigate impacts on natural vegetation cover and biodiversity.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation influence species distributions and therefore ecological processes that depend upon them. Pollination may be particularly susceptible to fragmentation, as it depends on frequent pollinator movement. Unfortunately, most pollinators are too small to track efficiently which has precluded testing the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation reduces or eliminates pollen flow by disrupting pollinator movement. We used radio-telemetry to examine space use of the green hermit hummingbird (Phaethornis guy), an important 'hub' pollinator of understory flowering plants across substantial portions of the neotropics and the primary pollinator of a keystone plant which shows reduced pollination success in fragmented landscapes. We found that green hermits strongly avoided crossing large stretches of non-forested matrix and preferred to move along stream corridors. Forest gaps as small as 50 m diminished the odds of movement by 50%. Green hermits occurred almost exclusively inside the forest, with the odds of occurrence being 8 times higher at points with >95% canopy cover compared with points having <5% canopy cover. Nevertheless, surprisingly. the species occurred in fragmented landscapes with low amounts of forest (similar to 30% within a 2 km radius). Our results indicate that although green hermits are present even in landscapes with low amounts of tropical forest, movement within these landscapes ends up strongly constrained by forest gaps. Restricted movement of pollinators may be an underappreciated mechanism for widespread declines in pollination and plant fitness in fragmented landscapes, even when in the presence of appropriate pollinators.

AB REDD+ holds potential for mitigating emissions from tropical forest loss by providing financial incentives for carbon stored in forests, but its economic viability is under scrutiny. The primary narrative raised in the literature is thatREDD+ will be of limited utility for reducing forest carbon loss in Southeast Asia, while the level of finance committed falls short of profits from alternative land-use activities in the region, including large-scale timber and oil palm operations. Here we assess the financial costs and carbon benefits of various REDD+ strategies deployed in the region. We find the cost of reducing emissions ranges from $9 to $75 per tonne of avoided carbon emissions. The strategies focused on reducing forest degradation and promoting forest regrowth are the most cost-effective ways of reducing emissions and used in over 60% ofREDD+ projects. By comparing the financial costs and carbon benefits of a broader range of strategies than previously assessed, we highlight the variation between different strategies and draw attention to opportunities where REDD+ can achieve maximum carbon benefits cost-effectively. These findings have broad policy implications for Southeast Asia. Until carbon finance escalates, emissions reductions can be maximized from reforestation, reduced-impact logging and investing in improved management of protected areas. Targeting cost-efficient opportunities for REDD+ is important to improve the efficiency of national REDD+ policy, which in-turn fosters greater financial and political support for the scheme.

AB Dasypus kappleri is the largest species of the genus Dasypus and is restricted to the Amazonian rainforest biome. Over the last century, related taxa have been described and synonymized without comprehensive analyses, and the current classification involving two subspecies, Dasypus k. kappleri and Dasypus k. pastasae, has never been revised. The aim of this work is to clarify the taxonomy of Dasypus kappleri through integrative morphological and morphometric analyses. We examined 70 specimens housed in scientific collections as well as photographs of the type specimens of five nominal taxa. Three methodologies (discrete characters, linear and geometric morphometrics) were employed. All results converged on the recognition of three allopatric groups, each with diagnostic qualitative and quantitative traits, that we recognize as full species: Dasypus kappleri Krauss, 1862, occurs in the Guiana shield; Dasypus pastasae (Thomas, 1901) is distributed from the eastern Andes of Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela south of the Orinoco River into the western Brazilian Amazon; and Dasypus beniensis Lonnberg, 1942, occurs in the lowlands of Amazonian Brazil and Bolivia to the south of the Madre de Dios, Madeira, and lower Amazon rivers. This revision raises to nine the number of living species of Dasypus.

AB The neutral theory of biodiversity assumes that coexisting organisms are equally able to survive, reproduce, and disperse (ecological equivalence), but predicts that stochastic fluctuations of these abilities drive diversity dynamics. It predicts remarkably well many biodiversity patterns, although substantial evidence for the role of niche variation across organisms seems contradictory. Here, we discuss this apparent paradox by exploring the meaning and implications of ecological equivalence.
   We address the question whether neutral theory provides an explanation for biodiversity patterns and acknowledges causal processes. We underline that ecological equivalence, although central to neutral theory, can emerge at local and regional scales from niche-based processes through equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms. Such emerging equivalence corresponds to a weak conception of neutral theory, as opposed to the assumption of strict equivalence at the individual level in strong conception. We show that this duality is related to diverging views on hypothesis testing and modeling in ecology. In addition, the stochastic dynamics exposed in neutral theory are pervasive in ecological systems and, rather than a null hypothesis, ecological equivalence is best understood as a parsimonious baseline to address biodiversity dynamics at multiple scales.

AB A negative relationship between stand biomass and the density of stems is expected to develop during the self-thinning process in resource-limited forests; this leads to a large proportion of the total biomass occurring in large trees. Nevertheless, frequent disturbance regimes can reduce self-thinning and the accumulation of large trees. We investigated size-density relationships and the contribution of large trees (dbh70cm) to stand biomass in 55 1-ha plots along a 600km transect in central-southern Amazonia. The effects of natural-disturbance gradients (frequency of storms and soil characteristics) and seasonality on forest-structure components (density of stems and mean individual mass) and stand biomass were examined. Contrary to self-thinning predictions, stand biomass increased in forests with higher stem densities. Large trees contained only an average of 5% of stand biomass, and half of the stand biomass was represented by small trees with diameters <27cm. These findings indicate that persistent or strong disturbance plays a critical role in forest structure and biomass in the central-southern Amazon. Frequent storms were identified as an important source of disturbance in the region. Forests under higher frequency of storms had trees with lower individual mass and higher stem packing. More physically restrictive soils seem to magnify the effects of exogenous disturbances limiting individual tree size. Forests in areas with longer dry seasons had lower stem densities; however, individual mass was higher in these areas. These structural components of biomass seem to counterbalance each other in generating total stand biomass. Seasonality affected forest structural components but not stand biomass.Synthesis. Forests of central-southern Amazonia are not resource limited and accumulate most part of their biomass in small- to mid-sized trees. The effects of environmental gradients on specific structural components of stand biomass differ such that strong positive effects on one component can mitigate strong negative effects on other component. Future work on the determinants of stand biomass should investigate forest structure and the contributions of individual components to stand biomass.

AB The muricid gastropods Concholepas concholepas (loco or false abalone), endemic to Chile and Peru, and Haliotidae Haliotis spp. (abalone) are highly priced seafood delicacies traded in Asian markets. Historical catches, management strategies, production, prices, and revenues are analyzed for these wild and farmed gastropods. Wild abalone prices have a positive effect (P < 0.01), landings a negative effect (P = 0.01), and farmed aquaculture production a negative effect (P = 0.09) on Chilean loco export prices. This underscores the high degree of market integration and the direct price relationship for these gastropods between Chilean and the Asian seafood markets. Drops in the Chilean export prices of locos had a negative effect on official loco landings in Chile, affecting the small-scale territorial user rights for fishery comanagement scheme developed for the species. The study shows evidence of distal connections (telecoupling) between production and market forces, that can jeopardize fishery management efforts. Aquaculture being developed in certain parts of the world can impact quite specifically on the attempts to achieve sustainable fisheries in other geographically distinct areas. Because of large market fluctuations, and a global drive to develop large-scale farming of marine gastropods, there is an urgent need to strengthen the adaptive capacity for diversification, and to add value to resources, so as not to hamper the long-term development of traditional coastal fishing communities.

AB Soil phosphorus (P) utilization may be affected by agricultural complexity, in particular when combining annual crops and livestock grazing on the same land area and at overlapping times. Our objectives were to qualify and quantify soil organic and inorganic P compounds using sodium hydroxide-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (NaOH-EDTA) extraction and P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-31 NMR) in response to increasing complexity with integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) in subtropical Brazil. Soil at a depth of 0-5 cm was collected from three long-term (7 to 12 years) cropping studies with and without ruminant grazing of cover crops. All sites were managed under no tillage, and treatments with livestock were managed with moderate grazing intensity. In these agro-ecosystems, grazing compared with no-grazing had greater soil P content as total and bioavailable orthophosphate and lower soil organic P and fewer monoesters, including inositol phosphates. Grazing increased P bioavailability and reduced recalcitrant organic P concentration in soil; therefore, cropping systems that integrate livestock (ICLS) can be a sustainable alternative to improve P use in farming systems of subtropical Brazil.

AB Protected areas form a quintessential component of the global strategy to perpetuate tropical biodiversity within relatively undisturbed wildlands, but they are becoming increasingly isolated by rapid agricultural encroachment. Here we consider a network of 788 forest protected areas (PM) in the world's largest tropical country to examine the degree to which they remain intact, and their responses to multiple biophysical and socioeconomic variables potentially affecting natural habitat loss under varying contexts of rural development. PAs within the complex Brazilian National System of Conservation Units (SNUG) are broken down into two main classes-strictly protected and sustainable use. Collectively, these account for 22.6% of the forest biorries within Brazil's national territory, primarily within the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest, but are widely variable in size, ecoregional representation management strategy, and the degree to which they are threatened by human activities both within and outside reserve boundaries. In particular, we examine the variation in habitat conversion rates in both strictly protected and sustainable use reserves as a function of the internal and external human population density, and levels of land use revenue in adjacent human-dominated landscapes. Our results show that PAs surrounded by heavily settled agro-pastoral landscapes face much greater challenges in retaining their natural vegetation and that strictly protected areas are considerably less degraded than sustainable use reserves, which can rival levels of habitat degradation within adjacent 10-km buffer areas outside.

AB QuestionsOur study tests the relative importance of different attributes of isolated trees in explaining the properties of the regeneration assemblage beneath their crowns to evaluate their effect on the composition of early successional stages and understand the processes underlying this effect. We asked: (1) does the regeneration assemblage contain a high proportion of individuals conspecific with the isolated tree; (2) how does the landscape surrounding an isolated tree influence the properties of the regeneration assemblage; and (3) what is the respective importance of structural variables and functional traits of isolated trees for their influence on the properties of the regeneration assemblage?
   LocationThree pasture sites in Guanacaste Province, a tropical seasonally dry area, Costa Rica.
   MethodsNinety isolated trees were characterized by their position in the landscape relative to patches of trees, individual structural variables related to tree and crown size, and species functional traits. The assemblage of woody plants regenerating under their crowns was characterized by number of individuals and species, and taxonomic and functional composition. To understand the mechanisms underlying the facilitative effect of isolated trees on regeneration, correlations between their attributes and properties of the regeneration assemblage were assessed.
   ResultsWe found that a low proportion of regenerating individuals were conspecific with the isolated trees beneath which they have established. Landscape factors influenced the regeneration but their effects were site-dependent. The attributes of isolated trees correlated well with the functional composition of the regeneration assemblage: their structure and phenological habits with traits associated with drought tolerance, and their dispersal syndrome with the dispersal syndrome of the regeneration assemblage. However, isolated tree attributes correlated poorly with the regeneration assemblage's taxonomic composition.
   ConclusionsOur study shows that an approach based on functional composition can provide a better understanding of community assembly mechanisms than does a taxonomic approach. Two main mechanisms are suggested to explain the influence of isolated trees on the regeneration assemblage: modification of micro-scale environmental conditions (shade and moisture) and influence on dispersal agents. The effect of attributes of isolated trees on the properties of the regeneration assemblage predicts a long-term legacy of the early stages of succession.

AB The atmosphere is populated by a diverse array of dispersing insects and their predators. We studied aerial insect communities by tracking the foraging altitudes of an avian insectivore, the Purple Martin (Progne subis). By attaching altitude loggers to nesting Purple Martins and collecting prey delivered to their nestlings, we determined the flight altitudes of ants and other insects. We then tested hypotheses relating ant body size and reproductive ecology to flight altitude. Purple Martins flew up to 1,889 meters above ground, and nestling provisioning trips ranged up to 922 meters. Insect communities were structured by body size such that species of all sizes flew near the ground but only light insects flew to the highest altitudes. Ant maximum flight altitudes decreased by 60% from the lightest to the heaviest species. Winged sexuals of social insects (ants, honey bees, and termites) dominated the Purple Martin diet, making up 88% of prey individuals and 45% of prey biomass. By transferring energy from terrestrial to aerial food webs, mating swarms of social insects play a substantial role in aerial ecosystems. Although we focus on Purple Martins and ants, our combined logger and diet method could be applied to a range of aerial organisms.

AB As old-growth forests are converted into edge-affected habitats, a substantial proportion of tropical biodiversity is potentially threatened. Here, we examine a comprehensive set of community-level attributes of fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages inhabiting edge-affected habitats in a fragmented Atlantic forest landscape devoted to sugar cane production. We also explored whether the consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation can interact and cause cascading ecosystem changes, with the pervasive simplification of tree assemblages inhabiting edge-dominated habitats, altering fruit-feeding butterfly persistence. Butterflies were sampled in three forest habitats: small fragments, forest edges and patches of forest interior of a primary forest fragment. Assemblage attributes, including taxonomic composition, correlated to some patch (patch size) and landscape (such as forest cover) metrics as well as habitat structure (tree density and richness). Fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages in the forest interior differed from those in small fragments due to an increased abundance of edge-specialist species. On the other hand, several forest-dependent species were missing in both small fragments and forest edges. Our results suggest that edge-affected habitats dominated by pioneer tree species support taxonomically distinct assemblages, including the presence of disturbance-adapted species, and butterfly community structure is highly sensitive to fragmentation- and plant-related variables, such as forest cover and pioneer tree species. In this way, while the establishment of human-modified landscapes probably results in the local extirpation of forest-dependent species, it allows the persistence of disturbance-adapted species. Thus, forest-dependent species conservation and the plant-animal interaction webs they support could be improved by retaining a significant amount of core forest habitat.

AB Novel solutions to conserve biodiversity whilst allowing for resource harvesting are urgently needed. In marine systems, Territorial User Rights for Fisheries (TURFs) are promoted to enable sustainable use of resources. We investigate the potential for synergies between nature-based tourism and TURFs on Chile's central coast. Of 135 recreational divers surveyed, 77% indicated that the fish species they preferred sighting were declining and 80% indicated that they would dive more often in TURFs, which have higher abundance of favoured species. Regression analysis shows that respondents that perceive that TURFs fulfil a conservation function are more willing to pay to dive in a TURF. However, respondents who understand the bureaucratic functioning of a TURF are less willing to pay, and there is diversity in how divers feel payments should be made. A participatory approach is required to navigate these complexities to achieve synergies between nature-based tourism and resource harvesting in TURFs.

AB The structure and underlying functions of the majority of the world's tropical forests have been disrupted by human impacts, but the potential biodiversity and conservation value of regenerating forests is still debated. One review suggests that on average, regenerating tropical forests hold 57% (+/- 2.6%) of primary forest species richness, raising doubt about a viable second chance to conserve biodiversity through rainforest regeneration. Average values, however, likely underestimate the potential benefit to biodiversity and conservation because they are drawn from many studies of short-term regeneration and studies confounded by ongoing human disturbance. We suggest that the true potential biodiversity and conservation value of regenerating rainforest could be better assessed in the absence of such factors and present a multi-taxa case study of faunal biodiversity in regenerating tropical forest in lowland Amazonia. We found that biodiversity of this regenerating site was higher than might have been expected, reaching 87% (+/- 3.5%) of primary forest alpha diversity and an average of 83% (+/- 6.7) of species estimated to have occurred in the region before disturbance. Further, the regenerating forest held 37 species of special conservation concern, representing 88% of species of highest conservation importance predicted to exist in primary forest from the region. We conclude that this specific regenerating rainforest has high biodiversity and conservation value, and that whilst preserving primary forest is essential, our results suggest that under a best-case scenario of effective conservation management, high levels of biodiversity can return to heavily disturbed tropical forest ecosystems.

AB Bioautography has been used as rapid and easy strategy to detect and identify bioactive fractions/molecules in the never before investigated Hedyosmum sprucei Solms (Chloranthaceae) essential oil (EO). The antioxidant activity, performed through DPPH bioautographic assay and spectrophotometric evaluations (IC50 = 230 +/- 10 mu g/mL), seemed to be mainly due to alpha-cadinol and alpha-muurolol. (HP) TLC bioautography, focused on antimicrobial capacities, pointed out alpha-cadinol, alpha-muurolol, tau-muurolol, caryophyllene oxide, and methyleugenol as the most effective compounds against Staphylococcus aureus, considered as testing strain. Moreover, the microdilution method, assessed among a wide panel of microorganisms, revealed Listeria grayi and Staphylococcus aureus as the most sensitive among human tested strains and Clavibacter michiganensis among phytopathogens. GC-MS chemical profile showed that bioactive molecules represented only a small quantity of the whole EO: germacrene D (23.16%), beta-caryophyllene (15.53%), delta-cadinene (5.50%), alpha-copaene (5.08%), and alpha-phellandrene (3.48%) were the main compounds, highlighting an uncommon composition among the genus Hedyosmum. Finally, H. sprucei EO was checked for cytotoxic potential against A549 (lung cancer) and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines showing promising cytotoxic effects against both cell lines after 48 h (IC50 A549 = 44.05 +/- 2.35 mu g/mL; IC50 MCF-7 = 32.76 +/- 4.92 mu g/mL) and 72 h (IC50 A549 = 43.55 +/- 2.80 mu g/mL; IC50 MCF-7 = 33.64 +/- 0.43 mu g/mL).

AB Understanding biological invasions patterns and mechanisms is highly needed for forecasting and managing these processes and their negative impacts. At small scales, ecological processes driving plant invasions are expected to produce a spatially explicit pattern driven by propagule pressure and local ground heterogeneity. Our aim was to determine the interplay between the intensity of seed rain, using distance to a mature plantation as a proxy, and microsite heterogeneity in the spreading of Pinus contorta in the treeless Patagonian steppe. Three one-hectare plots were located under different degrees of P.contorta invasion (Coyhaique Alto, 45 degrees 30S and 71 degrees 42W). We fitted three types of inhomogeneous Poisson models to each pine plot in an attempt for describing the observed pattern as accurately as possible: the dispersal models, local ground heterogeneity models, and combined models, using both types of covariates. To include the temporal axis in the invasion process, we analyzed both the pattern of young and old recruits and also of all recruits together. As hypothesized, the spatial patterns of recruited pines showed coarse scale heterogeneity. Early pine invasion spatial patterns in our Patagonian steppe site is not different from expectations of inhomogeneous Poisson processes taking into consideration a linear and negative dependency of pine recruit intensity on the distance to afforestations. Models including ground-cover predictors were able to describe the point pattern process only in a couple of cases but never better than dispersal models. This finding concurs with the idea that early invasions depend more on seed pressure than on the biotic and abiotic relationships seed and seedlings establish at the microsite scale. Our results show that without a timely and active management, P.contorta will invade the Patagonian steppe independently of the local ground-cover conditions.

AB Primates along with many other animal taxa are forced to cope with large shifts in basic ecological conditions because of rapid anthropogenically induced changes of their habitats. One of the coping strategies for primates is to adjust their diet to these changes, and several studies have demonstrated the importance of fallback resources for this. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, might be particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation because of their high dependence on fruit availability. Little is known, however, about bonobo feeding ecology in fragmented habitats and their use of fallback resources. In this study, we investigate diet seasonal variation and the exploitation of preferred and fallback foods in a bonobo population living in forest-savannah mosaics. Results show that bonobos have adapted to this fragmented habitat by feeding on only a few fruit species, including an important number of non-tree species ( liana, herb and savannah shrub), in comparison to populations living in dense forests. These non-tree plants have been defined as fallback and non-preferred foods, which are most probably consumed to maintain high frugivory. Interestingly, we identified that preferred foods are all typical of mature forests while fallback resources are mainly found in forest edges or disturbed areas. This finding indicates that bonobos prefer to use mature forests when feeding, as they do for nesting, but extend their range use to forest areas in close proximity to humans when the availability of preferred fruits is low. Finally, we show that bonobo diet relies heavily on two abundant fallback fruits: Musanga cecropioides and Marantochloa leucantha. Other studies have demonstrated that the selection of abundant fallback resources enables primates to subsist at high densities and to maintain cohesive groups, as observed at this study site. Our findings suggest that bonobos living in forest-savannah mosaics can be considered as staple fallback food consumers. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Gap phase dynamics are the dominant mode of forest turnover in tropical forests. However, gap processes are infrequently studied at the landscape scale. Airborne lidar data offer detailed information on three-dimensional forest structure, providing a means to characterize fine-scale (1 m) processes in tropical forests over large areas. Lidar-based estimates of forest structure (top down) differ from traditional field measurements (bottom up), and necessitate clear-cut definitions unencumbered by the wisdom of a field observer. We offer a new definition of a forest gap that is driven by forest dynamics and consistent with precise ranging measurements from airborne lidar data and tall, multi-layered tropical forest structure. We used 1000 ha of multi-temporal lidar data (2008, 2012) at two sites, the Tapajos National Forest and Ducke Reserve, to study gap dynamics in the Brazilian Amazon. Here, we identified dynamic gaps as contiguous areas of significant growth, that correspond to areas > 10 m(2), with height < 10 m. Applying the dynamic definition at both sites, we found over twice as much area in gap at Tapajos National Forest (4.8 %) as compared to Ducke Reserve (2.0 %). On average, gaps were smaller at Ducke Reserve and closed slightly more rapidly, with estimated height gains of 1.2 m y(-1) versus 1.1 m y(-1) at Tapajos. At the Tapajos site, height growth in gap centers was greater than the average height gain in gaps (1.3 m y(-1) versus 1.1 m y(-1)). Rates of height growth between lidar acquisitions reflect the interplay between gap edge mortality, horizontal ingrowth and gap size at the two sites. We estimated that approximately 10% of gap area closed via horizontal ingrowth at Ducke Reserve as opposed to 6 % at Tapajos National Forest. Height loss (interpreted as repeat damage and/or mortality) and horizontal ingrowth accounted for similar proportions of gap area at Ducke Reserve (13% and 10 %, respectively). At Tapajos, height loss had a much stronger signal (23 % versus 6 %) within gaps. Both sites demonstrate limited gap contagiousness defined by an increase in the likelihood of mortality in the immediate vicinity (similar to 6 m) of existing gaps.

AB The use of well-sampled regions and insightful environmental gradients can provide important theoretical knowledge for understanding the drivers of tropical forest patterns and processes, which are necessary for biological conservation. We investigated the variation in tree species composition across a vegetation gradient in the Subtropical Atlantic Forest, as well as various predictors that could impact such patterns. The exploratory and confirmatory analyses included 178 sampling units distributed among 13 different forest types containing binary occurrence records for 935 species from 25,546 trees. Confirmatory analyses were conducted considering spatial autocorrelation, a well-known factor responsible for type I error inflations. The floristic heterogeneity of the study area was revealed by clear patterns of floristic differentiation between vegetation types, as well as by the significant improvements in local models (GWR-geographically weighted regressions) over global models (OLS-ordinary least squares). We found that the observed floristic variation has most likely been driven by humidity from the Atlantic Ocean, low temperature extremes and geographic distance. The latter was revealed by the high contribution of spatial components to the partial models. These results from a shrinking biological hotspot, particularly those concerning the importance of temperature extremes, represent crucial data for identifying conservation priorities, especially considering the seriousness of the temperature shifts predicted by global climate change scenarios.

AB Recent phylogenetic studies in Sapotaceae have demonstrated that many genera need to be redefined to better correspond to natural groups. The Neotropical genus Pradosia is believed to be monophyletic and includes 26 recognized species. Here we reconstruct the generic phylogeny by a species-tree approach using *BEAST, 21 recognized species (36 accessions), sequence data from three nuclear markers (ITS, ETS, and RPB2), a relaxed lognormal clock model, and a fossil calibration. We explore the evolution of five selected morphological characters, reconstruct the evolution of habitat (white-sand vs. clayish soils) preference, as well as space and time by using a recently developed continuous diffusion model in biogeography. We find Pradosia to be monophyletic in its current circumscription and to have originated in the Amazon basin at similar to 47.5 Ma. Selected morphological characters are useful to readily distinguish three clades. Preferences to white-sand and/or clay are somewhat important for the majority of species, but speciation has not been powered by habitat shifts. Pradosia brevipes is a relative young species (similar to 1.3 Ma) that has evolved a unique geoxylic life strategy within Pradosia and is restricted to savannahs. Molecular dating and phylogenetic pattern indicate that Pradosia reached the Brazilian Atlantic coast at least three times: at 34.4 Ma (P. longipedicellata), at 11.7 Ma (P. kuhlmannii), and at 3.9 Ma (weakly supported node within the red-flowered clade).

AB The stable isotopes of carbon were analysed in total wood and cellulose from the tree-rings of the tropical wood species Cariniana micrantha (Ducke). The aim was to examine the isotopic relationship between total wood and its cellulose over the last two and a half centuries. Although the correlation for the whole time period is very high (r = 0.96) it is remarkable that different sub-periods deviate strongly from this close relationship. Consequently, a good correlation from the subset of a longer isotopic record cannot necessarily prove its validity for the whole record. The study indicates that changes of the carbon isotopes of cellulose and of total wood show sometimes during short sub-periods different isotope patterns presumably caused by different environmental effects. Thorough calculations indicate that strong variations within the isotopic record especially changes of the isotopic level along a chronology lead to high correlations between delta C-13(wood) and delta C-13(cel). Contrary thereto subsections with low isotopic variability lead to low correlations. The results imply that long term trends provide similar patterns. Therefore, if long term trends are of interest such as e.g. in climate reconstruction then total wood can be analysed in favour of cellulose, thus saving a tremendous amount of work. However, if short term aspects from a longer record are of interest, cellulose and total wood may sometimes provide different information. In addition it is hypothesized that during intervals of low isotopic variability the proportions of the various wood components may change relative to each other, leading for certain time intervals to different isotope patterns.

AB Forest regeneration may reduce the current loss of species due to tropical deforestation, but little is known about the extent and inter-specific variability of this effect. We compared the probability with which nine parrot species use old-growth and secondary forests in a similar to 400 km(2) Amazonian landscape, while considering two types of habitat use: perching and flyover use. Perching use, when individuals stop at a sampling site, implies resting, foraging, or breeding activities; flyover merely implies that parrots fly through, above the canopy at a site. We established 155 sampling sites spanning old growth and approximately 30-year-old secondary forest, and sampled them repeatedly using autonomous audio recorders. Perching and flyover use were distinguished based on the temporal variation of intensity in parrot vocalization sonograms. We modeled our data with a set of species-specific, multi-state occupancy models that estimate the probability of each type of use for both habitats while accounting for imperfect species detection. Models were fit in a maximum likelihood framework and ranked according to the Akaike information criterion. All but one species fly over both habitats with the same probability, while seven out of nine show a higher probability of perching in old growth than in secondary forest. Interspecific variation in response to habitat change was not explained by variation in body mass or relative brain size. After three decades of forest regeneration in our study area, there are still measurable differences in habitat use, with a broad tendency for parrots to favor old growth over secondary forest.

AB The proper balance between costly monitoring and non-compliance have often been studied, however, the costs of monitoring from landowners' perspective have only received little attention. We designed a Choice Experiment where landowners expressed their willingness to accept afforestation contracts with varying attributes, one of them being the likelihood of being monitored. Based on agency and social preference theory, respectively, we formulated a model allowing us to test alternative hypotheses regarding landowners' behaviour. The first hypothesis was that landowners may plan not to comply if optimal, which makes monitoring increasingly unwelcome as the contract sum increases. The second hypothesis was that landowners plan to comply and consider monitoring increasingly fair as the contract sum increases. The hypotheses were tested using a discrete mixture RPL model, where three parameters were estimated for an interaction effect between monitoring probability and contract sum (one fixed to zero and two varied freely). Both free parameters were positive and significant, indicating that landowners tend to find monitoring less of a negative feature, the higher the contract sum - suggesting that a group of landowners show social preferences. A latent class model further corroborated that conclusion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   zonation; Checklist; Cryptic habit
AB Decapods play a crucial role within the reef ecosystem and the development of scuba diving as a survey tool has allowed researchers the opportunity to study the decapod-reef relationship more comprehensively. The present study describes the differences in decapod assemblages in intertidal and subtidal zones at a tropical coastal reef system in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean and reports the importance of scuba diving as a survey technique. A total of 71 decapods were recorded during the research; 42 in the intertidal zone mainly formed by small endobenthic species and 39 in the subtidal zone primarily large species only 10 were found to frequent both sample zones. The study extends the range of Brachycarpus holthuisi Fausto Filho 1966 in Brazil; and also demonstrates how scuba diving can be used to complement traditional methodologies and vice versa. The research shows the advantages of using scuba diving when studying trade endangered decapods, as the methodology allows access to cryptic habitats such as reef caves and underwater cavities which were inaccessible when using traditional techniques. In conclusion scuba diving represents a revolutionary non-destructive survey tool allowing the researcher to directly access a specific decapod assemblage in fragile reef environments and in protected marine areas.

AB Rapid climate change poses complex challenges for conservation, especially in tropical developing countries where biodiversity is high while financial and technical resources are limited. The complexity is heightened by uncertainty in predicted effects, both for ecological systems and human communities that depend heavily on natural resource extraction and use. Effective conservation plans and measures must be inexpensive, fast-acting, and able to increase the resilience of both the ecosystem and the social-ecological system. We present conservation practitioners with a framework that strategically integrates climate change planning into connectivity measures for tropical mountain ecosystems in Costa Rica. We propose a strategy for doubling the amount of habitat currently protected in riparian corridors using measures that are relatively low cost and fast-acting, and will employ and expand human capital. We argue that habitat connectivity must be enhanced along latitudinal gradients, but also within the same elevational bands, via a lattice-work corridor system. This is needed to facilitate range shifts for mobile species and evolutionary adaptation for less mobile species. We think that conservation measures within the elevational bands must include conservation-friendly land uses that improve current and future human livelihoods under dynamic conditions. Key components include community involvement, habitat priority-setting, forest landscape restoration, and environmental services payments. Our approach is fundamentally adaptive in that the conservation measures employed are informed by on-the-ground successes and failures and modified accordingly, but are relatively low risk and fast-acting. Our proposal, if implemented, would satisfy tenets of climate-smart conservation, improve the resilience of human and ecological communities, and be a model for other locations facing similar challenges.

AB Several reviews of dung beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) behavior and ecology, as well as numerous research reports, have either implicitely or explicitely indicated that predation on dung scarabs is rare or absent and thus of minimal or no importance to the biology of the group. This review presents 610 records of predation on dung beetles by 409 species of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians from around the world. The involvement of invertebrates as predators on dung scarabs is also documented. It is concluded that this data establishes predation as a potentially major factor in the evolution and current behavior and ecology of dung beetles. The data presented also represents a considerable underestimation of predation on the group.

AB In order to reveal the mechanism of succession in subtropical forest along a light gradient, we investigated photosynthetic physiological responses to three light environments in five tree species including a pioneer species Pinus massoniana Lamb., two mid-successional species Schima superba Gardn. et Champ. and Castanopsis fissa (Champ. ex Benth.) Rehd. et Wils., and two late-successional species Cryptocarya concinna Hance. and Acmena acuminatissima (BI.) Merr et Perry) that were selected from Dinghu Mountain subtropical forest, South China. Results showed that, among the three kinds of species in all light conditions (100%, 30% and 12% of full sunlight), the pioneer species had the highest photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), light saturation point (LSP), carboxylation efficiency (CE) and maximum utilisation rate of triose phosphate (TPU) that characterised a strong photosynthetic capacity and high carbon dioxide uptake efficiency. However, a higher light compensation point (LCP) and dark respiration (R-d) as well as lower apparent quantum yield (AQY) indicated that the pioneer specie cannot adapt to low light conditions. Mid-successional species had photosynthetic characteristics in between pioneer and late-successional species, but had the greatest effective quantum yield of PSII (phi(PSII)) and light use efficiency (LUE, expressed in terms of photosynthesis). In contrast to pioneer and mid-successional species, late-successional species had lower photosynthetic capacity and carbon uptake efficiency, but higher shade tolerance and high-light heat dissipation capacity, as characterised by higher levels of total xanthophyll cycle pigments (VAZ) and de-epoxidation state of xanthophyll cycle (DEPs). These results indicate that photosynthetic capacity decreases along the successional axis and that late-successional species have more responsive heat dissipation capability to compensate for their inferior photosynthetic capacity.

AB The deforestation of eastern Paraguay is a relatively recent phenomenon, starting as early as the 1940s. Assuming that larger forest fragments retain mechanisms and patterns of biodiversity resembling the original forests, understanding these patterns is valuable for comparative, management, and conservation purposes. In this study, I document diversity patterns in four of the largest reserves of subtropical rainforest in eastern Paraguay as part of a 3-year field study. Forty grids, totaling 31,600 trap nights per reserve, resulted in 19 captured species. Spearman correlations were used to understand effects of distance to edge, and various diversity metrics and multivariate analyses were implemented to compare assemblages between remnants. Trapping revealed an increase in biodiversity toward forest edges. Medium-sized remnants showed the highest diversity (D) and evenness (J). Statistically significant differences were found between and among forest fragments. Given that biodiversity includes both richness and abundances, high biodiversity metrics are not the best indicator for ecosystem "health," as population explosions closer to edges result in greater biodiversity. More edge, more biodiversity. Thus, more emphasis needs to be given to understanding the natural history of native fauna and common assemblage patterns when addressing conservation and management strategies.

AB Knowledge of tree age-size relationships is essential towards evaluating the sustainability of harvest regulations that include minimum diameter cutting limits and fixed-length cutting cycles. Although many tropical trees form annual growth rings and can be aged from discs or cores, destructive sampling is not always an option for valuable or threatened species. We used an individual-based population model developed for big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla, Meliaceae) in southeast Amazonia, Brazil to simulate stem age-size relationships and examine forest management implications of mortality and diameter increment growth. Growth trajectories of 10,000 simulated mahogany trees were consistent with growth trajectories reconstructed from 32 mahogany discs with annual rings. Trajectories were highly variable and strongly autocorrelated; diameter was a poor predictor of tree age even when accounting for up to 10 years of previous growth history. Commercial-sized trees (60 cm diameter) ranged in age from 33 to 180 years (74 yr median). Only 12.5% of seedlings survived to this size, but survival and time to reach commercial size depended strongly on early growth history (first 10 years of life). A tree grown at the 75th percentile growth rate throughout its lifetime requires 70 years to attain commercial size, but Brazilian forest management regulations imply a rotation length of 60 years. These results demonstrate that individual-based models parameterized with typical census data can incorporate individual variation and growth autocorrelation and realistically simulate tree growth and mortality. In the absence of tree ring data, such models can be used to evaluate the consequences of long-term growth and mortality for sustainable management. In the case of mahogany, our results suggest that non-detrimental harvests cannot be achieved without lengthening cutting cycles, increasing commercial tree retention rates, and regularly applying silvicultural treatments designed to increase stem diameter growth rates. Forest managers can have the greatest effect on the rate of commercial recruitment in the first 10 years after a harvest by implementing treatments ensuring that adequate numbers of new stems establish and recruit to dominant positions in recovering canopy gaps. Regrettably, sustainable mahogany management systems developed based on understanding of the species' ecology will not be as simple as current harvest regulations in Brazil imply.

AB Questions
   Does the importance of biotic interactions between tree species increase during secondary forest succession? Do functional trait values become increasingly divergent from early towards late successional stages and how is functional diversity affected by trait identity, species identity and species richness effects?
   Location
   Gutianshan National Nature Reserve, Zhejiang Province, southeast China.
   Methods
   Based on 26 leaf and wood traits for 120 woody species, we calculated functional diversity, using Rao's formula for quadratic entropy, trait dissimilarity, defined as half the mean trait-based distance of all species in the community, and functional evenness, defined as the degree to which functional diversity is maximized. We employed randomization techniques to disentangle the effects of trait identity, species identity and species richness on these three components of functional diversity.
   Results
   Against expectations, functional diversity did not show any successional trend because the communities compensated for a loss in trait dissimilarity by distributing the trait values more evenly among the resident species, thus increasing functional evenness. Randomization tests showed that functional diversity was not affected by trait identity, by species identity or by species richness, which indicates that functional diversity was neither determined by particular single traits or by single species with outstanding trait values.
   Conclusions
   The constant functional diversity suggests constant functionality in this subtropical forest, which might temporally maintain stable immigration conditions during the course of succession, and thus provides an explanation why these subtropical forests become more species-rich with time.

AB The carbon balance is defined here as the partitioning of daily whole-plant gross CO2 assimilation (A) in C available for growth and C required for respiration (R). A scales positively with growth irradiance and there is evidence for an irradiance dependence of R as well. Here we ask if R as a fraction of A is also irradiance dependent, whether there are systematic differences in C-balance between shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species, and what the causes could be. Growth, gas exchange, chemical composition and leaf structure were analyzed for two shade-tolerant and three shade-intolerant herbaceous species that were hydroponically grown in a growth room at five irradiances from 20 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (1.2 mol m(-2) day(-1)) to 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (30 mol m(-2) day(-1)). Growth analysis showed little difference between species in unit leaf rate (dry mass increase per unit leaf area) at low irradiance, but lower rates for the shade-tolerant species at high irradiance, mainly as a result of their lower light-saturated rate of photosynthesis. This resulted in lower relative growth rates in these conditions. Daily whole-plant R scaled with A in a very tight manner, giving a remarkably constant R/A ratio of around 0.3 for all but the lowest irradiance. Although some shade-intolerant species showed tendencies toward a higher R/A and inefficiencies in terms of carbon and nitrogen investment in their leaves, no conclusive evidence was found for systematic differences in C-balance between the shade-tolerant and intolerant species at the lowest irradiance. Leaf tissue of the shade-tolerant species was characterized by high dry matter percentages, C-concentration and construction costs, which could be associated with a better defense in shade environments where leaf longevity matters. We conclude that shade-intolerant species have a competitive advantage at high irradiance due to superior potential growth rates, but that shade-tolerance is not necessarily associated with a better C-balance at low irradiance. Under those conditions tolerance to other stresses is probably more important for the performance of shade-tolerant species.

   plan riparian forest restoration with relocated communities in
   Alcantara, Eastern Amazon
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; BRAZILIAN AMAZONIA; DEFORESTATION; CONSERVATION
AB Background: Riparian forests provide ecosystem services that are essential for human well-being. The Pepital River is the main water supply for Alcantara (Brazil) and its forests are disappearing. This is affecting water volume and distribution in the region. Promoting forest restoration is imperative. In deprived regions, restoration success depends on the integration of ecology, livelihoods and traditional knowledge (TEK). In this study, an interdisciplinary research framework is proposed to design riparian forest restoration strategies based on ecological data, TEK and social needs.
   Methods: This study takes place in a region presenting a complex history of human relocation and land tenure. Local populations from seven villages were surveyed to document livelihood (including 'free-listing' of agricultural crops and homegarden tree species). Additionally, their perceptions toward environmental changes were explored through semi-structured interviews (n = 79). Ethnobotanical information on forest species and their uses were assessed by local-specialists (n = 19). Remnants of conserved forests were surveyed to access ecological information on tree species (three plots of 1,000 m(2)).
   Results included descriptive statistics, frequency and Smith's index of salience of the free-list results. Results: The local population depends primarily on slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture to meet their needs. Interviewees showed a strong empirical knowledge about the environmental problems of the river, and of their causes, consequences and potential solutions. Twenty-four tree species (dbh > 10 cm) were found at the reference sites. Tree density averaged 510 individuals per hectare (stdv = 91.6); and 12 species were considered the most abundant (density > 10ind/ha). There was a strong consensus among plant-specialists about the most important trees. The species lists from reference sites and plant-specialists presented an important convergence.
   Conclusions: Slash-and-burn agriculture is the main source of livelihood but also the main driver of forest degradation. Effective restoration approaches must transform problems into solutions by empowering local people. Successional agroforestry combining annual crops and trees may be a suitable transitional phase for restoration. The model must be designed collectively and include species of ecological, cultural, and socioeconomic value. In deprived communities of the Amazon, forest restoration must be a process that combines environmental and social gains.

AB Quercus insignis has some of the largest acorns of any oak in the world and according to current red lists is considered critically endangered in Mexico and near threatened in Guatemala and Panama. In spite of this there have been no studies of its regeneration ecology with the aim of implementing species recovery plans. In this study, one-year-old seedlings were introduced into an abandoned grassland where Q. insignis adults were present in small remnant forest patches. A total of 1044 seedlings were planted and their survival and growth monitored over four years. An experiment was designed to test the relative effects of seeding location (open area vs. under vegetation cover) and soil treatment (native soil vs. soil with compost). After 50 months, only 26% of the seedlings planted survived; plants growing in shade had higher survival (34.4 vs. 18.6%) and increased more in height (0.0264 +/- 0.010 vs. 0.0207 +/- 0.011 cm cm(-1) -month(-1), respectively) than seedlings growing in full light (P < 0.05). Seedlings growing in full light died more rapidly than seedlings growing under vegetation cover (P < 0.05). Mortality was due to several interacting factors, mainly herbivory by voles and gophers, and desiccation under extreme temperatures. A higher proportion of the dead seedlings had been damaged by gophers and voles in the open area compared to seedlings growing under vegetation cover (P < 0.05). The implications of these results are discussed with respect to conservation and restoration strategies for this species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB REDD+ presents novel options for conservation in the tropics, yet it is unclear how biodiversity- focused organizations or actors should react to these carbon-focused opportunities. Here, we critically assess for the first time the expected outcomes of five contrasting scenarios of engagement between a biodiversity actor and REDD+. We discover that in the Berau regency, Indonesia, it is usually beneficial for a biodiversity actor to react in some way to REDD+, but the preferred reaction depends on whether a REDD+ project is already developing in the region, and the scale and type of conservation objectives. In general, from a strict biodiversity perspective, the most cost efficient reaction to the presence of REDD+ is to use biodiversity funds to protect areas neglected by REDD+. Our results demonstrate that if biodiversity actors fail to adapt the way they pursue conservation in the tropics, REDD+ opportunities could go largely untapped.

AB Denitrification is an anaerobic respiration that reduces nitrogen (N) oxides (NO3-, NO2-) to N gases (N2O, N-2). Our hypothesis suggests that this process might be an important process in depleting nitrogen in dryland soils, based on the idea that the intensity of microbial respiration following infrequent rainfall events and floods, is high enough to deplete soil O-2 concentrations and allow denitrification to occur. We tested our hypothesis by analyses of soil surface samples, collected along a rainfall gradient. This enabled us to evaluate the relationship between rainfall amount and denitrification potential. Soils were collected from beneath dominant shrubs and from the biological soil crusts (BSC) in the spaces between them. In incubated soils respiration decreased rapidly after 12 h while denitrification peaked at 24 h. Both respiration and denitrification were higher in soils beneath shrubs than in the BSC. However, BSC account for up to 88% of the land cover at the drier end and 60% in the wetter end of the gradient and may therefore contribute the majority of soil gaseous emissions. Denitrification:respiration increased, in soil samples collected, as rainfall gradient decreased, suggesting that denitrification is an increasingly important component of microbial respiration as aridity increases.(C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB The effects of tides on littoral marine habitats are so ubiquitous that shorelines are commonly described as 'intertidal', whereas waves are considered a secondary factor that simply modifies the intertidal habitat. However mean significant wave height exceeds tidal range at many locations worldwide. Here we construct a simple sinusoidal model of coastal water level based on both tidal range and wave height. From the patterns of emergence and submergence predicted by the model, we derive four vertical shoreline benchmarks which bracket up to three novel, spatially distinct, and physically defined zones. The (1) emergent tidal zone is characterized by tidally driven emergence in air; the (2) wave zone is characterized by constant (not periodic) wave wash; and the (3) submergent tidal zone is characterized by tidally driven submergence. The decoupling of tidally driven emergence and submergence made possible by wave action is a critical prediction of the model. On wave-dominated shores (wave height >> tidal range), all three zones are predicted to exist separately, but on tide-dominated shores (tidal range >> wave height) the wave zone is absent and the emergent and submergent tidal zones overlap substantially, forming the traditional "intertidal zone". We conclude by incorporating time and space in the model to illustrate variability in the physical conditions and zonation on littoral shores. The wave: tide physical zonation model is a unifying framework that can facilitate our understanding of physical conditions on littoral shores whether tropical or temperate, marine or lentic.

AB Mineral licks are sites where a diverse array of mammals and birds consume soil or drink water, likely for mineral supplementation. Many of those same animals are targets of hunters. Camera traps triggered by heat and motion were used to document use of mineral licks by birds and mammals over approximately 2 months at two lowland forest sites in eastern Ecuador, one that has experienced considerable hunting by indigenous Waorani (four mineral licks) and one that is largely unaffected by hunting (five licks). We obtained 264 photographs representing nine mammal species and one photograph of a bird at the hunted site; 1123 photographs of 12 mammal species and 73 of three bird species were obtained at the site without hunting. Photographs were counted if at least 30min elapsed between photographs of the same species at the same camera location. Activity (photographs/100 trap-days) was higher at all licks at the site without hunting (mean=436; range 276-665/100 trap-days) than at the hunted site (mean=123; range 89-151/100 trap-days). Diurnal activity was, overall, lower at the hunted site, particularly during the middle of the day. Species not recorded at the hunted site included two primates (white-bellied spider monkey Ateles belzebuth; Venezuelan red howler monkey Alouatta seniculus), white-lipped peccary, Tayassu pecari and two large-bodied birds (common piping-guan, Pipile pipile; Salvin's curassow, Mitu salvini); all are common prey of local hunters. Red brocket deer, Mazama americana was the most frequently photographed species at both sites, but was less active during the day at the hunted site.

AB Methods' and their devices have been conventionally viewed as the means through which the move from world to representation (and back again) might be reliably performed. An alternative view, perhaps most clearly exemplified by the post-ANT empirical programme of material semiotics', sees methods and devices as integral to the ways particular realities' are enacted in practices of inscription and intervention. Drawing upon this latter work, the present paper examines the role of satellite images, GIS and GPS data and devices in the methods utilized in the location, identification and classification of illegal deforestation' in Brazilian Amazonia. Here we witness how efforts to render deforestation' into a stable object of knowledge, singular and coordinated, are countered by attempts to render it multiple and irreconcilable as methods and devices become entangled in the conflicts and antagonisms of social life.

AB In many intertidal gastropods, the formation of aggregations and closing of the opercular opening are behaviors commonly assumed to be associated with water conservation and maintenance of body temperature during tidal emersion periods. In the laboratory, we quantified the relationship between these two behaviors in a littorinid snail common to the north-central shores of Chile, Echinolittorina peruviana, and evaluated any benefit of these behaviors during desiccating conditions. We predicted that solitary individuals would maintain their opercula open for less time than aggregated snails when exposed to drier conditions due, at least in part, to differences in evaporative water loss. In laboratory trials, where relative humidity was manipulated, we observed that aggregated snails maintained their opercula open for longer periods of time than solitary snails under increasingly drier conditions. These results, together with observations of body temperature, suggest that aggregated animals may able to maintain gaseous exchange with their environment for longer periods of time than solitary individuals in response to desiccation stress. Our results suggest an interactive effect of two behaviors that confer physiological benefits when confronted with extreme physical conditions experienced during periods of emersion.

AB Controversy on whether local (deterministic) or regional (stochastic) factors control the structure of communities persists after decades of research. The main reason for why it has not been resolved may lie in the nature of evidence which largely comes from realized natural communities. In such communities assembly history leaves a mark that may support either set of factors. To avoid the confounding effects of assembly history we controlled for these effects experimentally. We created a null community by mixing 17 rock pool communities. We then divided the null community into replicates and distributed among treatments representing a gradient of factors from local to regional. We hypothesized that if deterministic factors dominate the assembly of communities, community structures should show a corresponding gradient from being very similar and convergent to dissimilar and divergent. In contrast, if local processes are predominantly stochastic in nature, such a gradient of community configurations should emerge even in the homogeneous setting. Our results appear to partially support both hypotheses and thus suggest that both deterministic and stochastic processes contribute to the assembly of communities. Furthermore, we found that to satisfactorily explain patterns observed in natural communities environmental heterogeneity and regional processes must also be considered. In conclusion, although deterministic mechanisms seem to be important in the assembly of communities, in natural systems their signal may be diluted and masked whenever other factors exert meaningful influence. Such factors increase the number of possible paths to the point that the number of paths equals the number of communities in a metacommunity.

The frequency and size of these gaps have important implications for forest ecosystem processes as they can influence the functional trait distribution of tree communities, stand-level aboveground biomass and productivity. However, we still know little about the relative importance of environmental drivers of gap disturbance regimes because existing studies vary greatly in criteria used for defining gaps, in the spatial extent of the study area, and the spatial resolution of canopy height measurements. Here we use lidar (light detecting and ranging) to explore how forest age, topography and soil type affect canopy disturbance patterns across a 1500 ha tropical forest landscape in central Panama. We characterize disturbance based on the frequency distribution of gap sizes (the "gap size distribution"), and the area of the forest affected by gaps (the "gap area fraction"). We found that slope and forest age had significant effects on the gap size distribution, with a higher frequency of large gaps associated with old-growth forests and more gentle slopes. Slope and forest age had similar effects on the gap area fraction, however gap area fraction was also affected by soil type and by aspect. We conclude that variation in disturbance patterns across the landscape can be linked to factors that act at the fine scale (such as aspect or slope), and factors that show heterogeneity at coarser scales (such as forest age or soil type). Awareness of the role of different environmental factors influencing gap formation can help scale up the impacts of canopy disturbance on forest communities measured at the plot scale to landscape and regional scales.

AB Understanding how biological conservation and socioeconomic development can be harmonized in social-ecological systems is at the core of sustainability science. We present the case of a Mediterranean marine protected area (MPA), the Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo MPA, that exhibits high ecological performance under intense pressure from fishing, tourism, and coastal development. This case study illustrates how socioeconomic development and significant conservation benefits can coexist, even in a challenging context. Based on this case study, we present a framework for what elements and interactions have determined the high ecological performance of this MPA, and highlight the key leverages that have enabled ecosystem recovery. In particular, the most critical elements underlying high performance were sufficient leadership and knowledge to identify a conservation vision and to catalyze some key actors in the implementation of this vision. Thus, success was ultimately determined by the ability of the leadership of the MPA to devise and implement an effective strategy, with the support and participation of key actors that were external to the MPA organization. The insights from this case study may be applicable to improving MPA management in other systems with similar characteristics, including high human pressures and the presence of an MPA authority.

AB One of the greatest concerns in community ecology is to find how species composition patterns are related to different environmental and spatial conditions. This approach is especially interesting when applied to high diversity heterogeneous forests such as the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest sensu lato. The present study aims to verify the existence of indicator species in four southern Atlantic Rainforest formations and identify relationships among distributions of tree species with environmental and spatial variables. For that, tree species density data of 21 phytosociological surveys were collected from the literature. The data were analyzed using indicator species and partial canonical redundancy analysis (partial RDA). Sandy coastal formation contained the greatest number of indicator species (17), followed by Atlantic rainforest (10), cloud forest (4) and Araucaria forest (3). The partial RDA analysis explained 22% of total data variation, of which 11% was assigned to the environment, 5% to space, 6% to spatial component of environment influence, and 78% remained undetermined. The forest formations present different sets of indicator species suggesting replacement of species along the forest formations. The largest and significant fraction of variation in the composition and abundance of tree species explained by environmental variables reflects the heterogeneity and complexity of habitats throughout the region of Atlantic Forest. The low spatial influence and the environmental results indicate a pattern of structured communities due to different requirements of niches by species (niche theory).

AB Arthropods are the most diverse and abundant group of animals found in tropical lowland forests, and in light of ongoing global change phenomena, it is essential to better understand their responses to anthropogenic disturbances. Here we present a review of arthropod responses to forest deforestation and fragmentation based on studies conducted at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP), located in central Amazonia. These studies involved a wide range of arthropod groups. All but one of the studies evaluated changes in total species number or species density in relation to fragment size, (i.e. area effects), and one-third also evaluated edge effects. Our review indicates that almost every arthropod group studied showed some kind of response to reduction in forest area, including altered abundances, species richness or composition in comparisons of different-sized fragments, fragmented and non-fragmented areas, or comparisons of forest edges and forest interiors. These responses tended to be idiosyncratic, with some groups showing predicted declines in abundance or diversity in the fragments while others show no response or even increases. However, some of the observed effects on arthropods, or on the ecological processes in which they are involved, were transient. The most likely explanation for this was the rapid development of secondary growth around fragments, which greatly increased the connectivity between fragments and the remaining forest. Although the BDFFP has provided many insights regarding the effects of forest fragmentation on arthropod assemblages, many diverse groups, such as canopy arthropods, have received scant attention. For those that have been studied, much remains to be learned regarding the long-term dynamics of these assemblages and how landscape context influences local biodiversity. The BDFFP remains an exceptional site in which to investigate how the ecological interactions in which arthropods are engaged are altered in fragmented landscapes.

AB Although tropical forests have been rapidly converted into human-modified landscapes, tree species response to forest edges remains poorly examined. In this study, we addressed four pioneer tree species to document demographic shifts experienced by this key ecological group and make inferences about pioneer response to forest edges. All individuals with dbh = 1 cm of two short-lived (Bellucia grossularioides and Cecropia sciadophylla) and two long-lived species (Goupia glabra and Laetia procera) were sampled in 20 1-ha forest edge plots and 20 1-ha forest interior plots in Oiapoque and Manaus, Northeast and Central Amazon, respectively. As expected, pioneer stem density with dbh = 1 cm increased by around 1017-fold along forest edges regardless of species, lifespan, and study site. Edge populations of long-lived pioneers presented 8494 percent of their individuals in sapling/subadult size classes, whereas edge populations of short-lived pioneers showed 5697 percent of their individuals in adult size classes. These demographic biases were associated with negative and positive net adult recruitment of long- and short-lived pioneers, respectively. Our population-level analyses support three general statements: (1) native pioneer tree species proliferate along forest edges (i.e., increased density), at least in terms of non-reproductive individuals; (2) pioneer response to edge establishment is not homogeneous as species differ in terms of demographic structure and net adult recruitment; and (3) some pioneer species, particularly long-lived ones, may experience population decline due to adult sensitivity to edge-affected habitats.

AB Euglossa cyanochlora Moure, 1996 (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Euglossina) is known from only two specimens and is considered as one of the rarest bees. An intensive search for this species in its expected area of occurrence in eastern Brazil was carried out during three consecutive summers and involved over 1,000 h of active sampling in 50 sites distributed among 20 forest remnants. Almost 15,000 orchid bee males were attracted to scent baits and collected, but only 24 of them belonged to E. cyanochlora. Some degree of mitochondrial gene (COI, cytB, and 16S) variation was observed in this species. Although no intra-specific variation was identified at the 16S locus, three and six haplotypes were characterized at the COI and cytB genes, respectively. Combined data from field work and molecular analysis suggest that the species southernmost distribution limit is close to its type locality, near Parque Nacional do Monte Pascoal, in southern Bahia. The conservation status of E. cyanochlora is discussed and measures for its protection are here proposed.

AB Areas of co-occurrence between two species (sympatry) are often thought to arise in regions where abiotic conditions are conducive to both species and are therefore intermediate between regions where either species occurs alone (allopatry). Depending on historical factors or interactions between species, however, sympatry might not differ from allopatry, or, alternatively, sympatry might actually be more extreme in abiotic conditions relative to allopatry. Here, we evaluate these three hypothesized patterns for how sympatry compares to allopatry in abiotic conditions. We use two species of congeneric spadefoot toads, Spea multiplicata and S. bombifrons, as our study system. To test these hypotheses, we created ecological niche models (specifically using MAXENT) for both species to create a map of the joint probability of occurrence of both species. Using the results of these models, we identified three types of locations: two where either species was predicted to occur alone (i.e., allopatry for S. multiplicata and allopatry for S. bombifrons) and one where both species were predicted to co-occur (i.e., sympatry). We then compared the abiotic environment between these three location types and found that sympatry was significantly hotter and drier than the allopatric regions. Thus, sympatry was not intermediate between the alternative allopatric sites. Instead, sympatry occurred at one extreme of the conditions occupied by both species. We hypothesize that biotic interactions in these extreme environments facilitate co-occurrence. Specifically, hybridization between S. bombifrons females and S. multiplicata males may facilitate co-occurrence by decreasing development time of tadpoles. Additionally, the presence of alternative food resources in more extreme conditions may preclude competitive exclusion of one species by the other. This work has implications for predicting how interacting species will respond to climate change, because species interactions may facilitate survival in extreme habitats.

AB Large-seeded plants are especially vulnerable to the loss of seed dispersers in small forest fragments. The palm Attalea humilis goes against this trend by reaching high abundances in small remnants. Productivity, seed dispersal and seed predation of A. humilis were investigated in two large (2400 and 3500 ha) and three small (19, 26 and 57 ha) Atlantic Forest fragments in southeastern Brazil. Palms in the small fragments produced more female inflorescences, resulting in a higher fruit production in these places. Seed dispersal rates were higher in the large fragments, where scatter hoarding was more frequent. Scolytine beetles were the main seed predators and damaged a larger number of seeds in small fragments, but predation by rodents and bruchine beetles was low irrespective of fragment size. As scolytines do not necessarily kill the seeds, low predation by bruchines and rodents, together with its own high productivity, allow A. humilis to be more abundant in small fragments despite the scarcity of its main dispersers. This increased abundance, by its turn, can increase competitive interactions between A. humilis and other plants in small fragments. Thus, abundance patterns of A. humilis are a good example of fragmentation affecting the balance of ecological interactions in a complex way, emphasizing the role of preserving ecological processes for conserving biodiversity in fragmented tropical landscapes.

AB Habitat fragmentation is a process involving splitting of continuous habitats into smaller, and more isolated habitat patches. To assess the effects of small-scale habitat patchiness and isolation without the confounding effect of habitat loss on benthic macrofauna, two field experiments were conducted in the Archipelago Sea, SW Finland. Using artificial seagrass units (ASUs) we contrasted continuous patches ("C") with fragmented patches ("F") of the same combined area as the continuous patches. The fragmentation treatment involved two isolation distances (0.5 and 3.0 m) between the ASUs ("F 0.5") and ("F 3.0"). This design was repeated in two consecutive experiments where the patch area was 0.25 and 0.0625 m(2), respectively. Mobile epifauna were allowed to colonize patches for 12 days in both experiments. In both experiments, the total epifaunal density was significantly higher in the "F 0.5" treatment than in the "C" treatment, and the three dominant taxa showed positive or neutral responses to the habitat configuration. No fragmentation effect on the number of species was detected in either of the experiments, but fragmentation had a negative effect on the epifaunal diversity (Shannon's H') in the experiment with the largest patch area. Epifaunal diversity was significantly lower in "F 3.0" treatment than in "C" or "F 0.5" treatments in the first experiment, indicating stronger effect of isolation instead of fragmentation per se. Edge effects were indirectly tested by comparing epifaunal densities with patch edge: area ratios. The results suggest that edge effects may have a more important role than patch size for the total densities of epifaunal taxa, and that small, isolated patches have equal or higher habitat value compared to larger fragments.

AB To test the hypothesis that rhizosphere acidification would enhance the hydrolyzation of organic phosphates by increasing phosphatase activity. A Petri dish experiment with sterile agar and a pot experiment with a low P soil were used. In the Petri dish experiment, roots of each plant were cultured in two compartments, each of which contained agar with one of three nitrogen combinations: NH (4) (+) /N0 (N0 = nitrogen free), NH (4) (+) /NO (3) (-) , and NO (3) (-) /N0. Phytin was supplied as the sole phosphorus (P) source to all compartments. In the pot experiment, the soil in each pot was treated with N0, KNO(3), or (NH(4))(2)SO(4)) together with 0 or 75 mg kg(-1) phytin-P. Dry weight, P concentration, and P content of roots were highest in the NH (4) (+) compartments in the Petri dish experiment. In the pot experiment, dry weight, P concentration, and P content of both shoots and roots were higher with NH (4) (+) than with NO (3) (-) . NH (4) (+) treatments reduced rhizosphere pH, promoted the hydrolization of phytin, enhanced acid phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere, and increased phytin-P utilization relative to N0 and NO (3) (-) treatments. Phosphatase activity was negatively correlated with rhizosphere pH but was positively correlated with plant P content in both experiments. Rhizosphere acidification optimized the activity of acid phosphatase excreted by maize roots and promoted phytin mineralization. NH (4) (+) -induced acidification in the maize rhizosphere improved the growth of maize roots by improving P uptake from phytin; the improved growth, in turn, increased NH (4) (+) uptake and acidification.

AB Although birds and mammals play important roles in several mechanisms hypothesized to maintain plant diversity in species-rich habitats, there have been few long-term, community-level tests of their importance. We excluded terrestrial birds and mammals from fourteen 6 x 7.5 m plots in Australian primary tropical rain forest and compared recruitment and survival of tree seedlings annually over the subsequent seven years to that on nearby open plots. We re-censused a subset of the plots after 13 years of vertebrate exclusion to test for longer-term effects. After two years of exclusion, seedling abundance was significantly higher (74%) on exclosure plots and remained so at each subsequent census. Richness was significantly higher on exclosure plots from 1998 to 2003, but in 2009 richness no longer differed, and rarefied species richness was higher in the presence of vertebrates. Shannon's diversity and Pielou's evenness did not differ in any year. Vertebrates marginally increased density-dependent mortality and recruitment limitation, but neither effect was great enough to increase richness or diversity on open plots relative to exclosure plots. Terrestrial vertebrates significantly altered seedling community composition, having particularly strong impacts on members of the Lauraceae. Overall, our results highlight that interactions between terrestrial vertebrates and tropical tree recruitment may not translate into strong community-level effects on diversity, especially over the short term, despite significant impacts on individual species that result in altered species composition.

AB For organisms involved in specialized ecological interactions, the potential exists to have congruent evolutionary histories, such that diversification within one lineage of organisms parallels diversification within another. This model of shared evolutionary history has most often been explored in a bitrophic context, particularly with plants and specialized herbivorous insects, though also with other ecological partners such as vertebrate hosts and their invertebrate parasites. Recently, the possibility has been raised that evolutionary histories might be shared across more than two trophic levels, a phenomenon that we term a phylogenetic cascade. We review previous work on tritrophic diversification and discuss outstanding questions, with an emphasis on plants, caterpillars, and parasitoids, in diverse tropical communities.

AB To conserve tropical forests, it is crucial to characterise the disturbance threshold beyond which populations of tropical trees are no longer resilient. This approach is still not widely employed, especially with respect to the effects of moderate disturbances. Compensation effects, such as positive interactions among plants, are addressed even more rarely. We attempt to identify the extents to which the distribution of the keystone palm tree Ceroxylon echinulatum is regulated by various regimes of deforestation in a threatened tropical montane cloud forest in the North-West Andes of Ecuador. The demographic structure of this palm tree was examined in three habitats: old-growth forest, forest disturbed by selective logging, and deforested pasture. Patterns were related to stand structure, microclimate, and soil composition. Seedling desiccation owing to severe aboveground water stress led to the absence of juvenile palms in pastures, and thus was predictive of a near extinction of the species in this habitat. However, shade provided by dominant bunchgrass in pastures considerably reduced above- and belowground water stress by diminishing light intensity. Selective logging resulted in a higher density of individuals in disturbed forests than in old-growth forests, but was associated with a spoiled spatial structure. Therefore, the protection of residual old-growth forests is a prerequisite for the conservation of C. echinulatum, although secondary forests might act as provisional refuges that promote its resilience. The reduction of water stress by nurse grasses in pastures represents a promising approach to promote the resilience of tropical tree species and their associated communities after deforestation.

AB We analyzed the flowering phenodynamics of 43 Asteraceae species co-occurring in natural populations of Chaco Serrano forests in central Argentina. We explored the potential influence of factors such as photoperiod and climate (variations in temperature, rainfall, and frost), animal-plant interactions (richness of floral visitors, frequency of visits), some plant attributes (plant growth form, seed dispersal mechanism), and evolutionary relationships among species on flowering phenodynamics. Cluster Analysis (CA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were the multivariate statistical methods used to analyze emerging patterns associated with these co-occurring species. Null-model analyses were used to evaluate whether flowering times are aggregated, segregated, or random. Results showed that flowering phenology was significantly correlated with the seasonal variation in temperature, photoperiod, rainfall, and frost. The multivariate statistical methods separated all the species in three groups: 1) species with short flowering time, large plant floral display, high frequency of visits by a large number of species of floral visitors, anemochorous fruits, and shrubby growth form, with a tendency to a segregated flowering pattern; 2) species with long flowering time, small plant floral display, low frequency of visits by few insect species, anemochorous fruits, and herbaceous growth form; and 3) species with long flowering time, small plant floral display, intermediate values for frequency of visits and number of species of floral visitors, seed dispersal mechanisms other than anemochory, and herbaceous growth form. In addition, all but one species belonging to early-branching tribes (tribes phylogenetically close to the root of the Asteraceae tree) were grouped together and clustered in the same region of the two-dimensional PCA ordination. All species belonging to the late-branching tribes (Asteroideae subfamily tribes) included in group 1 were separated from the other Asteroideae species in the PCA. In conclusion, it seems that climatic factors restrict the phenological period of most species, and that plant attributes and taxonomic membership are strongly related to flowering phenodynamics in this group of Asteraceae studied.

AB The tropical Andes rank first among the world's 25 "hotspots" of biodiversity and endemism yet are threatened and little studied. We contrast population trends in avian diversity in montane cloud forest (bosque altoandino) and similar forest degraded by the planting of introduced tree species (bosque introducido) in the Mazan Reserve, Ecuador. We describe changes in bird diversity and abundance in these habitats over 12 years and evaluate the nature of change within these avian communities. On the basis of 2976 count detections and 419 net captures of 76 species of landbirds, indices of similarity between the habitats were low, with only 47.6% of species occurring in both forest types. From 1994-95 to 2006-07, species richness decreased from 54 to 31 in bosque introducido and from 67 to 30 in bosque altoandino. Capture rates also declined from 56.0 to 28.5 birds per 100 mist-net hr in bosque introducido and from 38.0 to 22.4 birds per 100 mist-net hr in bosque altoandino. We explore various potentially interacting factors that might have caused the observed changes in bird communities, including changes in vegetation within the Mazan Reserve and environmental changes resulting from global warming. But our results also suggest that local and regional changes in habitat outside of the Mazan Reserve were likely responsible for some community changes within the reserve. We argue for increased population monitoring to verify trends and to strengthen the effectiveness of conservation efforts in the Andes.

AB Aim
   The Chilean long-tailed snake (Philodryas chamissonis) has a wide distribution across different latitudes and ecosystems in Chile ranging from the south of the Atacama Desert (26 degrees S) to the extremely humid Valdivian temperate rain forest (40 degrees S). Throughout this vast distribution, which is isolated by the Andes mountain range on the east and the Pacific Ocean on the west, there are biogeographical boundaries and large geographical barriers that must have played an important role in the distribution of genetic diversity within this species. This study aimed at elucidating the evolutionary history of P. chamissonis in Chile by analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences.
   Location
   Chile (29 degrees 41'-38 degrees 23' S).
   Methods
   We extracted DNA from 66 tissue samples collected across different latitudes and amplified and sequenced the mitochondrial DNA control region and the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene for phylogenetic and population analysis.
   Results
   Four distinct haplogroups were identified for P. chamissonis. These are highly consistent with a latitudinal geographic pattern, different ecosystems and the increase in topography towards central Chile. Three of the four haplogroups are concentrated in central Chile (33 degrees S latitude) where the highest herpetofaunal diversity of the country is found. The Maipo River acts as historical geographical barrier for the species influenced by Pleistocene glaciation cycles, leading to a marked phylogeographical boundary. A strong population structure was found for the species (Theta(st) = 0.78, P < 0.0001), with a high haplotype diversity (h = 0.97 +/- 0.01) and nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.0151 +/- 0.0077).
   Main conclusions
   At least three evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) were designated for the species, and these should be taken into account for conservation plans. Three of the four haplogroups found within P. chamissonis are already threatened because their distribution along central Chile overlaps with most of the largest cities in the country.

AB Hemisphere scale events such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can alter rainfall regimes worldwide, with important effects on species abundance and distribution. The evidence of ENSO effects on terrestrial communities is, however, restricted to a few ecosystem types. We explored the effects of ENSO episodes on plant/terrestrial-herbivore interactions through changes in the rainfall regime in a southwestern Atlantic salt marsh (Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon, Argentina. 37 degrees 40'S, 57 degrees 23'W). Surveys showed a positive relationship between winter rainfall and the abundance of the wild guinea pig Cavia aperea. The highest salt marsh abundances of C. aperea were associated with rainy periods during El Nino episodes, and the lowest ones were associated with the driest La Nina episodes. Rainfall was negatively associated with marsh sediment salinity, and experiments revealed that increased salinity reduces growth and increases mortality of cordgrass (Spartina densiflora). Salt increase also causes the highest percentage of dry area in S. densiflora leaves and reduced carbon content, and more salt content and secretion in S. densiflora stems. A factorial experiment in which we manipulated C. aperea presence and salinity along the edges of S. densiflora patches showed that plants can asexually invade unvegetated areas when salinity is reduced and C. aperea is excluded. Conversely, S. densiflora edges retracted when salinity was increased or there was C. aperea herbivory. Changes in nutritional quality of S. densiflora could explain the low herbivory of (and lack of impacts from) C. aperea in plots with high salinity. Thus, plant distribution responds directly to climate oscillations through changes in salt stress, and indirectly, through changes in plant-herbivore interactions. Herbivores respond indirectly to climate oscillations through changes in plant food quality, which suggests that top-down effects increase when bottom-up stressors are relaxed. ENSO events have direct and indirect effects on marsh communities that modulate the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up effects and have a considerable effect on the primary productivity of S. densiflora marshes.

AB Planning for the restoration of degraded ecosystems has a strong basis in facilitation successional theory, which, as applied in restoration practice, states that planting of structurally dominant tree species will assist the entry of other native species into a restored community. In Australia, tree planting has been widely applied in restoration of grassy woodland ecosystems. Trees have been postulated to reduce the cover and diversity of weed species, thus facilitating recolonization of native woodland species (indirect facilitation). The expected outcomes of this process include reduced species richness and abundance of exotic plant species and increased species richness and abundance/dominance of natives in areas beneath tree canopies, with these trends strengthening with time. To assess whether this was occurring, we carried out a comparative analysis of species assemblages found underneath and outside of planted tree canopies in sites replanted with juvenile canopy tree species 3-5 or 8-10 years previously. We sampled revegetated stands of Cumberland Plain Woodland, an endangered ecological community in Western Sydney, Australia. We found that neither the number nor abundance of native ground layer species beneath canopies increased as a result of trees being planted at sites of both ages. Where seed is limited, we predicted an increase in abundance of existing native species under planted tree canopies. On this point, the results were mixed and showed some natives with an increased abundance while others decreased. Exotic species richness showed the reverse of the expected pattern, being greater under tree canopies. These findings lend no support to the theory of indirect facilitation. We conclude that simple facilitation models may be inadequate to support planning of grassy woodland restoration and that those models incorporating successional time lags and restoration barriers are likely to be more informative about the development of communities initiated by tree planting.

AB Invasion by exotic species is among the most important global-scale problems experienced by natural ecosystems. Studies document that floristic changes that emerge after habitat fragmentation may be due to invasion by exotic weeds. When either habitat modification or the introduction of foreign species results in changes in the community, then native species populations could undergo local decline or extinction. The present study provides a qualitative and quantitative overview of the effects of habitat fragmentation on the invasive success of Lantana camara is well as the subsequent effects of this invader on ecosystem structure and function in the Vindhyan dry deciduous forest of India.

AB Questions
   Fire is a strong filter in fire-prone communities and is expected to assemble closely related species when functional traits are conserved in plant lineages. Do frequent fires assemble savannas with closely related species (phylogenetic clustering)? If so, what are the clades pruned by fire in the phylogenetic trees? Are species of semi-deciduous seasonal forests, where fires are not frequent, less related than expected by chance (phylogenetic over-dispersion)? Are life forms conserved in the phylogeny of the species?
   Location
   Central and SE Brazilian savannas (Emas National Park, 18 degrees 18'S, 52 degrees 54'W; Brasilia, 15 degrees 56'-15 degrees 57'S, 47 degrees 53'-47 degrees 56'W and Corumbatai-Itirapina, 22 degrees 13'-22 degrees 15'S, 47 degrees 37'-47 degrees 39'W); and close semi-deciduous seasonal forests (in Pirenopolis, 15 degrees 45'S, 49 degrees 04'W; Brasilia, 15 degrees 33'S, 47 degrees 51'W; and Sao Carlos, 21 degrees 55'S, 47 degrees 48'W).
   Methods
   We recorded woody species in savannas under different fire regimes and in semi-deciduous seasonal forests. We obtained data from the literature and from field sampling. We compared mean phylogenetic distance of species of savanna and of nearby semi-deciduous seasonal forest sites. We obtained significance by randomizing the species among the tips of phylogenetic trees. We also assessed whether life forms were evolutionary conserved across phylogeny of the studied plants (phylogenetic signal) with tests based on the variance of phylogenetic independent contrasts.
   Results
   Some sites of savanna under high fire frequency were characterized by phylogenetic over-dispersion of woody species whereas, in contrast, some sites of semi-deciduous seasonal forest were characterized by phylogenetic clustering. We found phylogenetic signals in the traits across the phylogeny of the 801 species investigated.
   Conclusion
   Fire may have different roles in assembling plant species in Brazilian savannas than in other fire-prone communities. We postulate that the absence of phylogenetic clustering in the cerrado is mainly due to the persistence of long-lived resprouting species from different plant lineages.

AB The activity pattern of mammalian carnivores is influenced by several factors, including environmental conditions, interference from competitors, and behavioral thermoregulation. Facing extreme environmental conditions the activity rhythm of animals may change. The activity patterns of Geoffroy's cats (Leopardus geoffroyi) were studied during a period of prey scarcity in a scrubland area of central Argentina, based on five individuals radio-collared and monitored by radio-telemetry. Activity readings were recorded every 15 min during 6- to 24-h observation periods, and a total of 3121 fixes totaling 780.3 h of monitoring were gathered for these cats. Geoffroy's cats were significantly more active during daytime (58.1 +/- 9.4% of active fixes) than during the night (33.6 +/- 2.9%). Although they were active at any time of the day, an activity peak was recorded from 12.00 to 17.00 h. This pattern is opposite to those observed in other areas or even to that recorded for this species in the same area during a period of higher prey abundance. This apparent shift toward diurnal activity could be a response to a combination of ecological (prey availability, predators or competition avoidance) and physiological (energy saving) factors. Geoffroy's cats are behaviorally flexible, but this ability may not be enough to maintain survival (and population size) under harsh environmental conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB 1. This study demonstrates that feedback loops between plants and insects contribute to both plant and insect diversity. Synthesis of several studies reveals that both bottom-up and top-down forces are important for plant and insect communities.
   2. Feedback loops between plants and soil organisms contribute to plant and soil diversity. An analysis of multiple systems reveals that pathogens, mutualists, and a wide variety of soil fauna directly influence, and are influenced by, plant diversity.
   3. The connection of plant-insect and soil-plant feedback loops leads to the maintenance of all three groups, and the maintenance of these feedback loops crucially affects insect diversity. Examples of the influence of soil community diversity on insect diversity, and the influence of insect diversity on soil community diversity, as well as feedbacks through all three trophic levels are provided.
   4. Finally, means of conserving and restoring soil communities to influence the conservation and restoration of insect communities are discussed.

AB Aim Pathways linking grazing and detrital subsystems of terrestrial ecosystems are important for ecosystem processes and function, but remain poorly understood. The invasion of a generalist predator creates a unique opportunity to study the effects of predation across these subsystems. We examine here, the effects of a non-native generalist predator, the little red fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata, Roger) on both grazing and detrital invertebrate communities and ecosystem processes in a rain forest understorey.
   Location Gamba Protected Area Complex, south-western Gabon, Africa.
   Methods We measured abundances and diversities of understorey grazing and detrital invertebrate communities, soil nutrients, herbivory, litter fragmentation rates and leaf chemistry of a dominant understorey shrub inside and outside of 19 separate invasion fronts. We then explored possible trophic cascades and pathways of interaction using path analysis.
   Results Results suggest that invasive ants may alter herbivory regimes, grazing and detrital communities, and may indirectly alter litter decomposition and nutrient cycling in the soil by suppressing important microbivore and detritivore populations with consequences for leaf chemistry.
   Main conclusions These results demonstrate that generalist predators may be major drivers of both grazing and detrital subsystems by inducing strong shifts in adjacent communities that ultimately affect ecosystem processes.

AB With increased human populations and subsequent pressure to develop or farm land, the rate of fragmentation of tropical rainforests has accelerated in the past several decades. How native organisms respond to such fragmentation has been the subject of intense study in temperate ecosystems and at several tropical sites in Central and South America, but there has been little study of this phenomenon in Mexico, the country bridging the Neotropics and temperate North America. A reason for this neglect is an apparent lack of long-term data; however, such data can be obtained from "non-traditional" sources, such as birders and tour leaders. We make innovative use of such data, combining them with more traditional data (e.g., museum specimens) to create a record of occurrence for Palenque, Mexico, from 1900 to 2009, including a near-continuous presence-absence record since 1970. We analyzed these data using logistic regression and, importantly, recent statistical advances expressly for sighting records. As recently as the 1960s Palenque's forest was contiguous with that of Selva Lacandona to the east, but the protected area surrounding the famous ruins is now a forested island. As a result, various species formerly known from the site have disappeared, including species both large (Crax rubra, Penelope purpurascens, and Ara macao) and small (Notharchus hyperrhynchos, Malacoptila panamensis, Microrhopias quixensis, and Pachyramphus cinnamomeus). By contrast, several species of open areas or second growth have apparently colonized the area (e.g., Thryothorus modestus, Mimus gilvus, Euphonia affinis). Some species turnover has occurred within particular families, such as Columbidae, Trochilidae, and Troglodytidae. Losses and declines we documented at Palenque correspond with those reported from other sites in Mesoamerica, suggesting the soundness of our approach and the general vulnerability of certain species. Compilation and analysis of sighting record data holds great promise for tracking trends in many regions and across many taxa for which long-term census data are lacking.

AB Understanding the dynamics of forest regeneration on abandoned agricultural land in the Amazon has often been restricted by limited knowledge of historical land use. This study compared time-series classifications of mature forest, nonforest, and regrowth generated from Landsat sensor data for areas north of the Brazilian cities of Manaus (1973-2003) and Santarem (1984-2003) to chronicle land histories and forest age. At Manaus, active land use prior to abandonment ranged from <1 year with no burning to >10-15 years with burning. Few forests were recleared on more than three occasions. From the mid-1980s, land was increasingly abandoned and, in 2003, over 75% of the deforested area supported regenerating forests, with several being older than 20 years. South of Santarem, forests were cleared up to seven times. In 2003, few regenerating forests were older than 10 years, and all land covers, but particularly mature forest, were damaged by extensive wildfires in 1993 and 1998. Based on previous research, the study concludes that the capacity of regenerating forests to recover biomass and tree species diversity will be reduced where prior land use is more intense, as in Santarem and some clearings north of Manaus.

AB We examined the effect of traditional swidden agriculture on biodiversity using the litter arthropod top predator, the army ant Aenictus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) as an indicator species in and around an intact tropical rain forest in Sarawak, Borneo, Malaysia. We compared the encounter rates with Aenictus colonies among five forest types: continuous primary forest, isolated primary forest, old secondary forest (> 20 years elapsed after abandonment of the fields), young secondary forest (5 years after abandonment), and new fallow (2 years after abandonment) by intensive area searching in 2003 and 2005. In total, seven Aenictus species (15 colonies) and six Aenictus species (11 colonies) were encountered in 2003 and 2005, respectively. The encounter rates were the highest in continuous and isolated primary forests, intermediate in old and young secondary forests, and the lowest in new fallow. Year and the interaction between year and forest type were not significant. That is, abundance of top predators, which is rare and likely to be vulnerable to disturbance, has never fully recovered even 20 years after the termination of cultivation. We discuss forest management strategies to sustain biological diversity.

AB We analyzed the growth and photosynthetic behavior of Gallesia integrifolia ('pau-d'alho') and Schinus terebinthifolius ('aroeirinha') under shade, seeking to obtain ecophysiological information for introducing seedlings of those species in previously established cacao agroforestry systems. Considering that light intensity under the shade of cacao trees varied between 5 and 10% daylight, 5 months old seedlings were exposed to four irradiance levels (25, 17, 10 and 5% daylight) for 92 days. With shade increase both species displayed trends of decrease leaf mass per unit leaf area, leaf area per plant (LA), relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR), and increase leaf area ratio (LAR). The mean values of light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (P (nmax)) in 25 and 5% daylight were 12.8 and 8.0 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) for G. integrifolia and 17.9 and 7.4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively, for S. terebinthifolius. Based on the measurements of photosynthetic photon flux density and estimated values of photosynthetic saturated irradiance (Is) we concluded that, in all shaded conditions, the leaves of both species were under sub optimal light conditions to reach P (nmax). In spite of the lowest P (nmax) values, RGR and NAR were significantly higher for G. integrifolia in all irradiance levels. Differences in growth rates can be explained by the higher values of LA, LAR and leaf mass ratio (LMR), as well as by the lower values of Is, photosynthetic compensation irradiance and dark respiration rates observed for G. integrifolia. Even though seedlings of G. integrifolia presented higher capacity to adapt under conditions of dense shade, we concluded that both species were under stress conditions induced by shade in light environments below 25% daylight. On a practical point of view it is possible to conclude that seedlings of both species should be introduced in light gaps, formed after the fall of big trees, or in places in which cacao trees are cultivated using large plant spacing.

AB We summarise the main issues related to Community-Based Natural Resource Management which were discussed at an International Workshop organized in Niamey, Niger, in March 2008. The objective of the workshop was to compare and contrast different development-oriented biodiversity conservation and natural resource management approaches as they exist across Africa. These approaches were explored following (1) the fundamentals of natural resource management in relation to local development and livelihoods and (2) the multi-functional nature of land use. The major topics subject to debate were the dichotomy between strictly protected areas and conservation areas including human activities; the importance of legitimate, people-centred conservation, as opposed to legal (drawn from the law) conservation; the key role of market instruments, participatory approaches, interdisciplinarity and local governance; and finally the strong relationships between agriculture and biodiversity conservation, especially at landscape level. We then provide a short summary of the 12 papers addressing the above topics and selected for the Special Issue of Biodiversity and Conservation on "Natural Resource Management and Local Development'' (Vol xx, No xx, 2009).

AB Habitat clearance and fragmentation is increasingly threatening the biodiversity of tropical rainforests, however, the response of many insect species, even of key organisms, is still little understood. Using an extensive data set spanning over four years, we analyzed the effects of clearance and fragmentation of a Congo-Guinean rainforest in western Kenya on the abundance and the raid rates of two species of swarm-raiding army ants, which are considered keystone organisms of tropical rainforests. The abundance of army ants was measured by transect monitoring and by short-term pitfall trapping while raid rates were measured by long-term pitfall trapping over a period of five months. Dorylus wilverthi was the most abundant army ant in undisturbed rainforest and its abundance and raid rate strongly declined in small forest fragments. In contrast, the abundance of Dorylus molestus increased with decreasing fragment size and compensated for the decline of D. wilverthi in terms of abundance and ecological functionality (i.e. raiding rates). D. molestus appears to have a higher ability of using the agricultural land surrounding the Kakamega Forest than D. wilverthi, which may explain the species-specific differences in the susceptibility to habitat fragmentation. Our study demonstrates that habitat fragmentation may have a differential effect on two ecologically highly similar keystone species. Moreover, it shows that species compensation might help in maintaining an important ecosystem function (i.e. raiding by swarm-raiding army ants) in fragmented tropical rainforests.

AB Species' functional traits may help determine rates of carbon gain, with physiological and morphological trade-offs relating to shade tolerance affecting photosynthetic capacity and carbon allocation strategies. However, few studies have examined these trade-offs from the perspective of whole-plant biomass gain of adult trees. We compared tree-level annual diameter increments and annual above-ground biomass (AGB) increments in eight long-term plots in hyper-diverse northwest Amazonia to wood density (rho; a proxy for shade tolerance), whilst also controlling for resource supply (light and soil fertility). rho and annual diameter increment were negatively related, confirming expected differences in allocation associated with shade tolerance, such that light-demanding species allocate a greater proportion of carbon to diameter gain at the expense of woody tissue density. However, contrary to expectations, we found a positive relationship between rho and annual AGB increment in more fertile sites, although AGB gain did not differ significantly with rho class on low-fertility sites. Whole-plant carbon gain may be greater in shade-tolerant species due to higher total leaf area, despite lower leaf-level carbon assimilation rates. Alternatively, rates of carbon loss may be higher in more light-demanding species: higher rates of litterfall, respiration or allocation to roots, are all plausible mechanisms. However, the relationships between rho and AGB and diameter increments were weak; resource availability always exerted a stronger influence on tree growth rates.

AB I quantified the occurrence of all vascular plant species inhabiting 43 Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don trees in a temperate rainforest in British Columbia, Canada, to test whether (i) epiphyte species richness increased with tree diameter, and (ii) epiphyte distributions showed evidence for nestedness, checkerboard distributions, or compartmentalization. Nine vascular plant species were observed growing epiphytically. One species (Polypodiun glycyrrhiza Eat.) is an obligate epiphyte, while the remainder typically occurred on the forest floor. Smaller host trees (<0.5 m in diameter) lacked vascular epiphytes, and species richness increased with host diameter. No evidence for nested or checkerboarded distributions was observed. However, epiphyte distributions were compartmentalized, owing to five similar shrub species that tended to co-occur jointly, generating sharp turnover in species composition between host trees with and without shrubs. The lack of co-occurrence patterns indicative of interspecific interactions among epiphytes indicates that the epiphyte meta-community is structured stochastically from species that normally grow terrestrially.

DT Article
DE Congo basin; reduced impact logging; forest management; certification
ID FOREST; DEFORESTATION; BIODIVERSITY
AB Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) has traditionally been described as a set of forest management practices that reduce logging impacts and improve productivity. In this paper, we review the evolution of the logging sector in the Congo basin since the early 20th century. We argue that logging in the Congo basin has been little influenced by RIL until the recent regional Forestry Law reforms that started in Cameroon in 1994. RIL has not been integrated into the logging sector of the region as an independent body of knowledge, but more as a complement of the new mandatory management plans. in spite of its proven environmental and economic advantages, the role of RIL in improving forest management has been poorly understood, and we identify some causes of this situation. Finally, based on a regional study of 30 concessions, we analyse the frequency of some RIL-related practices and their relation with markets and certification schemes. We conclude that a clear definition of what RIL techniques are embraced by the logging sector is needed if RIL is to fully benefit from the recent development of new market and logging schemes based on certification, improved logging efficiency and a more transparent chain of custody.

AB Seedling recruitment is a multi-phased process involving seed production, dispersal, germination, seedling establishment and subsequent survival. Understanding the factors that determine success at each stage of this process is of particular interest to scientists and managers seeking to understand how invasive species spread and persist, and identify critical stages for management. To understand the factors and processes influencing recruitment of the invasive species Berberis darwinii Hook. (Darwin's barberry), temporal and spatial patterns of seed dispersal, germination and seedling establishment were examined. Seed dispersal from a large source population was measured over two fruiting seasons, and subsequent patterns of seedling emergence and survival within each cohort were measured. Seed longevity was tested under both natural and artificial conditions. Seeds were widely dispersed by birds, up to 450 m from the source population. Dispersal was essential to seedling establishment, as few seedlings survived beneath the parent canopy. Seeds were relatively short-lived in the soil under both field and glasshouse conditions, with few surviving for more than 1 year. Patterns of newly emerged seedlings largely reflected patterns of seed rain, but seedling survival was significantly affected by distance from source population, seedling density and light environment. These results suggest that recruitment of B. darwinii is dependent on dispersal of seeds to favourable microsites. Management priorities should include the removal of fruiting plants, and seedling control in highlight areas.

AB Lianas are frequently considered as light demanding plants due to their proliferation in gaps and forest edges. Since lianas are exposed to a very heterogeneous light environment, they could be expected to express morphological and physiological plasticity in response to changes in the light environment, as high as that found in pioneer trees. We compared the biomass allocation and photosynthetic responses of seedlings of three species of lianas and two species of pioneer trees to increased light availability. Seedlings were transferred from medium (4-5 mol m(-2) d(-1)) to high irradiance (12-15 mol m(-2) d(-1)) in a controlled environment. In general the three liana species allocated fewer resources to the stem in comparison with the trees. The difference in the response between irradiance regimes was similar among the species, with no strong differences between trees and lianas probably due the early stage of the plants. With increase in irradiance plants accumulated more biomass, allocated more resources to the roots and less to the leaves, reduced the leaf area ratio (LAR) and specific leaf area (SLA). The photosynthetic rates recorded were not related to the rates of growth as measured by the increase in dry biomass (RGRm). Regardless of the life form, plants under higher irradiance increased their light compensation point (Lcp) and attained light saturation (Lsp) at higher levels of irradiance, while the saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)) did not show a clear pattern, and dark respiration (R-d) and quantum yield (Q) were not affected by the transference. The understanding of liana and tree seedlings responses to the light environment may have important implications in the dynamics of tropical forest regeneration. (c) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Rhododendron arboreum Sm. ssp. nilagiricum (Zenker) Tagg, a tree species endemic to the southern Western Ghats of peninsular India, is restricted to a narrow topographic and bioclimatic niche. Since information on ecological and geographic extent of the species is lacking, we used Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP), an ecological niche modelling (ENM) method to model its spatial distribution. The model is developed based on its occurrence in the Western Ghats, in relation to topographic and environmental variables. Prediction of R. arboreum ssp. nilagiricum in the Western Ghats is strongly related to local climatic conditions in terms of annual temperature, precipitation and diurnal temperature ranges and not so much dependent on altitudinal variations. The numerous bioclimatic, topographic and anthropogenic factors have led to the formation of islands of species distribution, restricted to the Nilgiri, Anamalai, Palni and Meghamalai hills of the Western Ghats. Predictions allow identification of key areas for in situ conservation of the species and prioritize areas falling in the ecological extent of the species for conservation.

AB Variations in environmental temperature have both direct and indirect effects that affect organisms at levels ranging from intra-cellular physiological processes to ecological patterns. These variations are especially important for intertidal marine ectotherms such as littorinids since they alternate between periods of immersion in seawater, and must also experience long periods of emersion. In central Chile, Echinolittorina peruviana is one of the most conspicuous species on rocky intertidal shores, occurring at high tidal levels and in the splash zone. The species is known to resist direct exposure to the sun for long periods, although juveniles tend to be restricted to protected microhabitats. Adults show seasonal variations in abundance and vertical distribution and may form aggregations that have been shown to help reduce water loss and body temperature. In this study, we evaluate the relationship between daily thermal variations throughout the vertical distribution of this species and how these affect the patterns of density and aggregation. Our results suggest that one of the leading determinants of the spatio-temporal variation of density in E peruviana may be operative temperature (TO: the amount of stored heat resulting from the balance between heat fluxes into and out of the body, measured with taxidermic mounts mimicking heat transfer properties of the snail). To showed a strong negative relationship with density and a strong positive relationship with aggregation in the highest intertidal level monitored. The strength of these relationships decreased in importance at lower levels. While To alone cannot explain the abundance of E peruviana throughout its range of distribution, our results show that it does have a strong influence that should be considered in addition to other ecological factors affecting the density of intertidal littorinids.

AB Ecotourism can capture biodiversity values and provide incentives for conservation, and many integrated conservation and development projects include an ecotourism component. One key assumption behind this strategy is that ecotourism businesses can achieve financial viability. This paper presents a financial case study of the well-known community-based ecotourism lodge 'Casa Matsiguenka', owned by an indigenous Matsigenka population in Manu National Park (Peru), only the second such project to be thoroughly analysed in the literature. Built and financed from 1997 to 2003 with German official aid, the lodge's revenues have only just exceeded operating costs and have not covered the costs of infrastructure replacement, thereby failing to secure long-term business sustainability. Wages and income from handicraft sales have covered about a third of individual cash needs in the two participating communities, but communal income from lodge operating profits (for example to pay for community infrastructure, health care or education) has been minimal. The lodge's difficulties are attributed largely to a flawed business plan in which the lodge has sold its services to its own competitors, a group of ecotourism agencies that have used. their lobbying power to create a cartel in Manu. In a narrow analysis, the return on investment for this project has been approximately one-third of what could have been achieved to date by merely investing the start-up grant monies in a bank account and paying the interest directly to the Matsigenka communities in exchange for conservation actions. Broader analysis indicates the modest income and slow pace of business so far has permitted gradual social and economic adaptation on the part of culturally conservative indigenous communities. Moreover, the lodge project has generated processes of social and political organization, and sustained positive contact with Peruvian national society, which can be counted among its successes. The lodge has helped produce dialogue between the Park administration and the Matsigenka communities, a process that could ultimately result in co-management agreements that help to resolve people-park conflicts in the Park.

AB Sea level rise can affect the biodiversity of coastal areas through alterations of features of the substratum, including the geometry of shorelines. Field measurements on the rocky shore of Calafuria (NW Mediterranean Sea) showed that a rise in sea level in the range of 5 to 50 cm would increase the availability of steep substrata (>40 degrees) for assemblages of algae and invertebrates by Lip to 58%, compared to current conditions. Comparisons between assemblages on horizontal and vertical Substrata revealed clear differences in the composition and abundance of common taxa. Clearing experiments replicated on vertical and gently Sloping Surfaces at 2 heights on the shore were performed to test hypotheses about the role of recruitment and post-recruitment processes in maintaining differences between substrata. Comparisons of recolonizing assemblages with unmanipulated controls allowed LIS to test the hypothesis that a change in slope of the substratum affected the ability of assemblages to recover after a disturbance. Results indicated that differences in the structure of assemblages between vertical and horizontal substrata were maintained by a combination of recruitment and post-recruitment processes, although the relative importance of these processes differed among taxa. Nonetheless, patterns of recovery of assemblages were comparable between the 2 substrata. These findings suggested that sea level rise, by increasing the proportion of vertical Substrata at the expense of horizontal surfaces, will lead to the expansion of assemblages dominated by encrusting coralline algae and grazing gastropods, and the reduction of abundance of filamentous forms and barnacles. The resilience of assemblages, however, appeared unaffected by the aspect of the substratum.

AB Few studies of plant-pollinator interactions in fragmented landscapes evaluate the consequences of floral visitor variation on multiple stages of plant reproduction. Given that fragmentation potentially has positive or negative effects on different organisms, and that self-incompatible plant species depend on pollinators for sexual reproduction, differences in floral visitor assemblages may affect certain plant reproductive stages. We evaluated how pollinator assemblage, availability of floral resources, pollination, reproductive output, and seed and seedling performance of Psychotria suterella Muell. Arg. varied among three fragmentation categories: non-fragmented habitats, fragments connected by corridors, and isolated fragments. Richness and frequency of floral visitors were greater in fragments than in non-fragmented sites, resulting mainly from the addition of species typically found in disturbed areas. Although 24 species visited Psychotria suterella flowers, bumblebees were considered the most important pollinators, because they showed the highest frequency of visits and were present in eight out of ten sites. Additionally, the number of pollen tubes per flower per visit was lower in areas without bumblebees. The increased visitation in fragments seemed to enhance pollination slightly. However, fruit and seed output, germination, and seed and seedling mass were similar in non-fragmented sites, connected sites, and isolated fragments. Our results suggested that, even for a self-incompatible species, responses to habitat fragmentation at different stages of plant reproduction might be decoupled from the responses observed in floral visitors, if fruit set is not pollen limited. If all reproductive stages were considered, variation on the small scale was more important than the variation explained by fragmentation category. In spite of its self-incompatible breeding system, this plant-pollinator system showed resilience to habitat fragmentation, mainly as a result of high availability of potential mates to P. suterella individuals, absence of pollen limitation, and the presence of bumblebees (Bombus spp.) throughout this highly connected landscape.

AB 1. Tropical rain forest trees have been classified according to the importance of canopy disturbances for their life histories. To assess gap-dependence vs. shade tolerance, we propose using demographic analysis of the degree to which gaps are critical for population growth.
   2. Population growth is the composite of the successes and failures of individuals experiencing different life-cycle pathways (i.e. gap, building, and mature forest patches). To assess the contribution of each pathway, it is necessary to study patch dynamics.
   3. We use stage and patch structured matrix models and loop analysis to assess the life-history strategies of two Neotropical mangrove trees, Avicennia germinans and Rhizophora mangle. We use data from field studies in Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, that were specifically designed to parameterize these models.
   4. In R. mangle, seedling to juvenile progression was limited to high light patches (> 20% canopy openness), even though they comprised < 10% of the area, and population growth depended entirely on gaps. A. germinans seedlings progressed to juveniles from all light patches, and progression rates increased with light level. However, low and medium light patches (< 20% openness) were most important to population growth because they were most frequent. We suggest that R. mangle is gap-dependent while A. germinans is shade-promoted (i.e. shaded patches are demographically more important to A. germinans population growth even though seedling progression rates increase with canopy openness).
   5. Previous studies considered R. mangle shade-tolerant because its propagules can establish and initially survive in the shade, but our classification was based on its entire life cycle. For A. germinans, the important measure was not the growth response to light, but the frequency and demographic importance of different light patches.
   6. Synthesis: These examples show that observations of a plant's germination biology or photosynthetic/growth response to light do not necessarily translate into demographic behaviour because physiology can be decoupled from demography by patch dynamics. Thus, it is critical to consider the entire life cycle in the context of forest patch dynamics when assessing the life-history strategies of tropical trees.

AB Although exotic species may have a negative impact on native organisms, they can in some cases provide abundant resources. Use of these resources may have important implications for habitat use, movement, and space requirements of native animals, and ultimately for population dynamics. We describe the diet of a population of the narrowly endemic Cauca Guan (Penelope perspicax) in the Colombian Andes. This guan demonstrates plasticity in its eating habits, feeding on ail exotic tree species during periods of food scarcity. Based on direct observations and analysis of fecal samples over a one-year cycle, we found that guans fed on 89 species of fruits but also included foliage, flowers, and invertebrates in their diets. Guans fed on fruit species in proportion to their availability but favored some species with high fruit production or prolonged fruiting. Fruit availability, measured both in numbers of species and biomass, varied throughout the year, with a low in September-December. During the period of low fruit availability, guans congregated in large numbers at a Chinese ash (Fraxinus chinensis) plantation, where they fed on young leaves in large quantities. Ash was planted at this site over 40 years ago as part of a reforestation program, and plantations are invaded by native vegetation. Guans are abundant at this site, and seasonal consumption of ash foliage, a concentrated and abundant food source, may have influenced local population dynamics.

AB We investigated the influence of position on a slope (plot relative elevation) and vegetation disturbance (the tallest tree height per plot) on community composition and diversity in a SE Brazilian Seasonal Semideciduous Forest (46 degrees 55' W, 22 degrees 50' S). Trees with dbh >= 5 cm were sampled in one hundred 10 x 10 m plots randomly placed in a 6.5-ha stand. Through partial Mantel test, floristic dissimilarities among plots (Jaccard index computed with species abundance in each plot) were correlated with environmental distances among plots (Euclidian distance index computed with relative elevation and the tallest tree height values in each plot). Relative elevation and the tallest tree per plot height were individually correlated with floristic gradients expressed by PCA axes scores using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Through resampling, we compared diversity (richness, Berger-Parker D and Shannon H') among plots in the drier (up) and moister (low) ends of the slope. Floristic dissimilarities were significantly correlated with environmental distances even after geographic distances among plots have been partialled out (r (m) = 0.1274, p < 0.001). The first two PCA axes accounted for 22% of the total variance. After Bonferroni and Dutilleul's corrections, axis 1 showed a marginally significant correlation with plot relative elevation (r = -0.4097, p = 0.0309), and axis 2 was significantly correlated with the tallest tree height per plot (r = 0.2953, p = 0.0106). Position on the slope and vegetation disturbance were reliable predictors of community composition, thus suggesting the operation of niche assembly organizing processes. Richness and diversity (H') decreased and dominance (D) increased with elevation on the slope. Dominance increase from D ((300)) = 0.11 (confidence interval = 0.091-0.131) to D ((300)) = 0.19 (CI = 0.165-0.210) surpassed the expected dominance increase based on the reduction of richness alone: D-(300) = 0.13 (CI = 0.110-0.140), thus highlighting the niche partitioning assembly of the community, especially among abundant species. Given the great amount of floristic variability remaining unexplained, stochastic processes, such as those related to dispersal limitation, may also have influence on the community composition. Therefore, both niche assembly and chance events can operate even on a fine local scale.

AB In order to assess the importance of seed dispersal (escape and colonization hypotheses), I used transplant experiments for seeds and seedlings of 5-11 plant species with fleshy fruits in a lowland tropical forest (Tinigua National Park, Colombia). I controlled seed density, distance to parental tree, and habitat type. I monitored seed removal, seedling survival, and seedling growth during the first year of development for an average of 554 seeds and 169 seedlings for each species. I supplemented the experimental results with measurements of natural recruitment. I found little support for the escape hypothesis during the seed and seedling stages. For six species that showed differences in seed removal associated with distance, five showed highest removal away from, than close to parent trees, suggesting predator satiation. Seedling survival during the first year was not consistently associated with low densities and long distances from parent trees. For the majority of species, seedlings did not survive flooding in low basins, and there was growth advantage for most plant species in canopy gaps. These differences imply advantages for seed dispersal to adequate habitats, as predicted by the colonization hypothesis. In contrast to experiments, strong negative distance-dependent effects were evident when analyzing natural recruitment patterns. The ratio between saplings and seedlings was higher away from parent trees for the species with enough recruitment to be analyzed and this suggests that a negative distance-dependent effect may also occur after seedling establishment. This pattern is suspected for several other species, but an analysis with some of the other most common trees showed a variety of negative, neutral, and positive distance dependent effects. This study emphasizes the importance of long-term studies to asses the role of seed dispersal.

ID LEAF-LITTER FROGS
AB Elachistocleis bicolor is a poorly known South American microhylid frog. Although it has been claimed to be an ant specialist, there have been no detailed studies of ontogenetic diet change and prey selectivity in this species. We analysed the diet of 114 individuals of this frog through the post-metamorphic ontogeny. We also studied the anurans' morphometric relationships to prey size, and compared diet with prey availability, estimating predation tactics. All prey categories were consumed out of proportion relative to their availability in the environment. The results suggest that the three stages of E. bicolor are selective foragers with a strong preference for ants, although the prey spectrum includes other taxa. The diet of subadults was more similar to that of juveniles, and had the widest diet overlap. Juveniles ate smaller prey, and this could be reducing food competition with older stages. Although the three stages are selective ant foragers, as frogs grow up, there is a partial and gradual change in prey category captured.

AB 1 We examined the factors determining synchrony in reproduction in nine Acacia and six other tree species in the Serengeti ecosystem.
   2 We test two hypotheses: (i) an abiotic hypothesis where the primary determinant of synchrony is an adaptation to water availability; and (ii) biotic hypotheses where these adaptations to water can be further refined by additional adaptations to avoid predators, or attract seed and fruit dispersers.
   3 Flowering and fruiting were recorded monthly for individually marked trees during 1997-2004. Flowering in different species occurs semi-annually, annually or, in the case of one species, once every 2 years. For most species synchrony of flowering was correlated with seasonal rainfall, with lags related to the mean height of the species; small species flowered during the rains while larger species flowered in the dry season. Fruiting seasons occurred at the end of the rains irrespective of the flowering season.
   4 Most species showed flowering synchrony greater than expected from the distribution of rainfall. This may be related to avoidance of insect seed predators through predator satiation. Two Acacias showed multi-annual fruiting (masting), possibly as a predator avoidance mechanism. Acacia tortilis has two flowering seasons: a dry season flowering with early abortion of pods and a wet season flowering producing successful fruits.
   5 Two species of Commiphora appeared to be synchronized so as to attract birds that disperse seeds. Acacia tortilis produced indehiscent pods attractive to ungulates, possibly to kill bruchid beetles during digestion and so increase seed viability.
   6 Our results suggest that synchrony in these trees is caused by a strong interaction between abiotic and biotic factors. Closely related species have different reproductive patterns of synchrony that seem to be adapted to different combinations of rainfall, predators and dispersers. Rainfall is the primary determinant but the activities of predators and dispersers increase the degree of synchrony.

AB Tropical forests of the Amazon Basin are being rapidly converted to agricultural land uses and fallow land, resulting in accelerating rates of forest loss in one of the world's most biodiverse ecoregions. This process has been extensively described and modelled, but as yet there has been no formal test of how the spatial patterns of deforested and fragmented areas change with the spatial scale of forest clearings. It was hypothesised that different land-use practices are driving small and large clearings, with small-scale cultivators often creating small, irregularly shaped clearings and large-scale ranchers and soy farmers creating larger, more regular-shaped clearings. To quantitatively test this hypothesis, Mandelbrot's theory of fractals was applied to deforested areas in the Brazilian Amazon to test for scale-invariance in deforestation patterns. The spatial pattern of deforestation differed between small and large clearings, with the former creating more complex landscapes and with a threshold occurring at c. 1200 ha in area. As a consequence, the sizes and shapes of forest clearings, and hence the relative vulnerability of the remaining forest to edge, area and isolation effects, may differ systematically between landscapes with different deforestation drivers. Further tests of this hypothesis are needed to assess its efficacy in other tropical landscapes and geographical locations.

AB Forest fragmentation can create negative edge effects that reduce the reproductive success of birds nesting near the forest/nonforest interface, and threaten bird populations deeper in remnant forest habitats. Negative edge effects may be more pronounced in landscapes that are moderately fragmented, particularly where agriculture is the primary land-use fragmenting forests. Information about the extent and strength of edge effects at a site can help guide conservation actions, and determine their effectiveness. We examined edge effects for birds breeding in a nearly contiguous forest fragmented by relatively narrow agricultural corridors in Illinois (USA). We measured rates of nest predation and brood parasitism for Acadian Flycatchers (Empidonax virescens) over a continuum of distances from the edge of an agricultural inholding. Nest predation and brood parasitism were highest near the edge and decreased with increasing distance from the edge. Given the cumulative effects of nest predation and brood parasitism on reproductive success, we determined that forest within 600 in of the inholding was sink habitat. We found, however, that deeper forest interior areas currently serve as source habitat, and that conversion of the entire 205 ha agricultural corridor to forest would add 1350 ha of source habitat for Acadian Flycatchers. Such results provide support for a local conservation strategy of forest consolidation and establish baseline measures necessary to determine the relative effectiveness of any subsequent reforestation efforts.

AB Long-term (> 50 years) extinction patterns and processes in isolated tropical forest Patches are poorly understood. Considering that forest fragments are rapidly becoming the common feature of most tropical landscapes, data on the long-term conservation value of such fragments are urgently needed. We report on avifaunal turnover in a tropical woodlot (Bogor Botanical Gardens; 86 ha; 54% native and 46% introduced plants; mean 83,649 visitors/month) that has been surveyed several times before and after its isolation in 1936 By 2004 the original avifaunal richness of this woodlot declined by 59% (97 to 40 species) and its forest-dependent avifauna declined by 60% (30 to 12 species). Large-bodied birds were particularly prone to extinction before 1987, but following this time none of the species traits we studied could be considered predictive of extinction proneness. All seven forest-dependent bird species that attempted to colonize this woodlot by 1987 perished thereafter Our results show that area reduction, isolation, intense human use, and perverse management (e.g., understory removal) of this patch have probably negatively affected the long-term sustainability of its forest avifauna.

AB Human exploitation of intertidal organisms in South Africa is an ancient activity based principally on mussels. We studied mussel populations and patterns of exploitation along a 160-km stretch of the south coast. Photographs (100 per site) were taken of the intertidal rocks at each of 14 sites, covering a range of exploitation intensities. Percentage cover was negatively correlated with number of mussel patches and positively correlated with mean shell width. PCA analysis identified groups of sites: a) accessible and unprotected sites: low cover, small mussels, patchy distribution; b) inaccessible sites and sites next to, or within, nature reserves: high percentage cover, large animals, less patchy distributions. Affluent coastal settlements also seem to confer protection against harvesting. Harvester distribution was examined by aerial surveys and combined with information on distance to the nearest beach access point and number of households within 7 km for each site. Sites within reserves and inaccessible sites had low densities of collectors, whereas sites near urban areas and in the Ciskei had the highest densities. All correlations between indicators of human exploitation and condition of mussel populations were non-significant. However, number of collectors showed positive trends with number of patches and negative trends for the two other variables. The results indicate much lower levels of exploitation than in the neighouring Transkei region, and suggest a high degree of background variability in mussel population structure.

AB We investigated the diversity of ants in a tropical savanna area, searching for differences according to environment variables (landscape and seasonality). The ant fauna sampling was made monthly in open cerrado and in closed cerrado. The samples were made with sardine baits in four distinct combined conditions (soil/vegetation, diurnal/nocturnal), during two periods (dry and wet season). A total of 72 ant species were collected, (18 genera and six subfamilies) Camponotus and Pheidole were the most common genera. The major diversity values were found for open areas, diurnal period and for vegetation substrate. Assembly analyses revealed the composition of two groups, the genera that were most frequent in the soil and the other group that was most frequent in vegetation. There was no seasonal difference in the occurrence of genera. Compared to other savannas, the ant fauna in this area can be considered relatively rich.

AB We examined the relationships between seed predation and the habitat into which a seed falls, abundance of rodents within that habitat, and foraging pattern of rodents within that habitat. Using seed plots, we assessed seed predation in burned and unburned tallgrass prairies at biweekly intervals between May and September in 2001 and 2002. Significantly more seed was removed from plots in burned than unburned prairies. Rodent abundance did not differ between burned prairie and unburned prairie, although the abundance of omnivorous-granivorous rodents (herbivores excluded) was greater in burned than unburned prairie. Proportion of seed removed in burned and unburned prairies was independent of both total rodent abundance and abundance of omnivorous-granivorous rodents. We also measured giving-up density (GUD) of rodents in burned and unburned prairies during the spring and summer of 2002. GUDs did not differ significantly in burned and unburned prairies. However, rodents had a higher GUD in uplands than in limestone breaks or lowland habitats. Our results suggest that rodent foraging in tallgrass prairie is affected by microhabitat and that rodent abundance is not sufficient to predict seed predation.

AB The present study examines relative growth rate (RGR) and its determinants in seedlings of nine Eucalyptus species. Species were selected from mesic (1,800 mm a(-1) rainfall) through to semi-arid habitats (300 mm a(-1)), and thus, notionally vary in "stress" tolerance. Seedlings were grown in a glasshouse during early summer and received between 33 mol and 41 mol PAR m(-2) day(-1). The mean RGR varied among species-from a minimum of 66 mg g(-1) day(-1) in E. hypochlamydea to a maximum of 106 mg g(-1) day(-1) in E. delegatensis. RGR was positively related to rainfall at the sites of seed collection. Neither specific leaf area (SLA) nor net assimilation rate was related to rainfall or RGR. While the absence of relationships with SLA and net assimilation rate contrasts with other studies and species, we cannot rule out the effects of sample size (n=9 species) and modest ranges in SLA and RGR. The ratio of leaf mass to total mass (LMR) varied from 0.49 +/- 10.07 g g(-1) in E. socialis to 0.74 +/- 0.04 g g(-1) in E. delegatensis and was strongly positively related with rainfall (r(2)=0.77). Interspecific differences in RGR were strongly related to LMR (positive relationship, r(2)=0.50) and the rate of dry matter production per mol of leaf nitrogen (positive relationship, r(2)=0.64). Hence, the slow RGR of low-rainfall species was functionally related to a lower growth rate per mol of leaf nitrogen than high-rainfall species. Furthermore, slow RGR of low-rainfall species was related to greater allocation to roots at the expense of leaves. Increasing allocation to roots versus leaves is likely an adaptation to soil and atmospheric water deficits, but one that comes at the expense of a slow RGR.

AB Despite the alarming rate of tropical deforestation, the long-term conservation value of forest fragments remains poorly understood. We report on the avifaunal turnover in an isolated 4 ha tropical forest fragment in Singapore (i.e. Singapore Botanic Gardens rainforest fragment (SBGRF)) between 1898 and 1998. Over 100 years, the SBGRF lost 18 (49%) species and gained 20 species. More forest-dependent species (3) were lost from the SBGRF than survived (1) or colonised it (no species). Conversely, significantly more introduced species (4) colonised the fragment than were previously recorded (I species). Significantly more nectarivores survived (8 species) or colonised (9 species) than were lost (two species). In essence, while the avian species richness in the SBGRF remained relatively constant after a century, its species composition underwent significant changes. The avian species composition in the SBGRF in 1998 appeared to be more similar to that of the contemporary smaller and younger Singaporean secondary forest patches than to either the larger and older forest reserves or to the SBGRF 100 years ago. Our study suggests that small isolated tropical forest fragments may have limited long-term conservation value for native forest bird species.

AB We censused primate populations at three non-hunted 'terra firme' forests of south-eastern Colombian Amazonia. The aggregate biomass densities of diurnal primates at all sites were amongst the lowest recorded for any non-hunted forest in western Amazonia and elsewhere in the Neotropics. Densities of red howler monkeys were low, as is typical in Amazonian terra firme forests far removed from white-water rivers, and densities of woolly monkeys were 1.5-3.5 times lower than those estimated for this species in central-western Brazilian Amazonia. Densities of small to mid-sized primates except for brown capuchins (Cebus apella) and white-faced capuchins (Cebus albifrons) were similar to those of other oligotrophic Amazonian forest sites. Our results are in agreement with other studies showing that terra firme forests of lowland Amazonia typically sustain a low biomass density of primates and other mid-sized to large vertebrates. Large reserves are therefore required to assure the viability of primate populations in oligotrophic systems. Given the escalating negative impacts of human habitat disturbance and hunting in Colombian Amazonia, we urge that a baseline sampling protocol to quantify the abundance and distribution of the harvest-sensitive vertebrate fauna be established within protected areas and the large indigenous reserves so that conservation efforts can be defined and implemented, Copyright (c) 2005 S.

AB Tropical rain forests, some of the most diverse natural communities, have been characterized either as inherently stable or as extremely fragile. Theoretically, complex food webs allow for alternative pathways and overlapping functions within and among trophic levels, such that cascading effects are buffered and perturbation is resisted. On the other hand, strong interdependence among species and trophic levels in these same systems can make them vulnerable to perturbation. To assess the ability of a tropical rain forest community to resist perturbation or to amplify perturbation through trophic cascades, we measured changes in overall vegetative cover and species richness of understory plants in response to the experimental addition of a top predator beetle.
   In August 2000, 30 randomly located patches of naturally occurring Piper cenocladum shrubs were found at sites with variable soil quality and light availability, and top predator addition treatments were randomly assigned to half the patches. Using an 8-m(2) subplot within each P. cenocladum patch, we estimated (nondestructively) vegetative cover of understory plants for nine months and measured herbivore damage, plant longevity and plant species richness for similar to1.5 years.
   For all understory species in our subplots, vegetative cover and total numbers of leaves declined significantly more in predator addition patches than in control patches. Understory cover also declined significantly more on poor soils than on rich soils. Mortality of small plants was high overall, but longevity was significantly greater in control patches than in patches with top predators. Herbivore damage was lowest, plant establishment highest, and the accumulation of new plant species highest in control plots on rich soils. The cumulative effect of top predators interacted with plant resources, such that plant species richness was suppressed when beetles were present in understory communities on rich soils. Patterns of herbivore damage suggest that trophic cascades from apex predators through ant predators to herbivores altered the structure of understory vegetation. The presence of indirect effects supports the characterization of rain forests as vulnerable ecosystems whose integrity may be threatened by the slow erosion of complex tight interactions among species.

AB Blowflies have sanitary and forensic importance, and different levels of association with human settlements (synanthropy). Therefore, specific diversity changes in each site could be used as an indicator of the anthropic impact. In this study, the community of Calliphoridae in Hudson (Argentina) was sampled in three sites with different degrees of Synanthropy (natural, rural and urban). Flies were attracted with bait and collected with an insect net. Twelve samples were collected in each site and both Simpson and Shannon diversity indexes were calculated. The Natural area was the most diverse. The other two areas showed no significant differences between them. The diversity was higher in the middle of spring and in late summer, and lower at the end of spring and in the beginning of summer. Alterations due to human settlements affect diversity by decreasing the abundance of some species.

ID BRAZILIAN AMAZON; FOREST SECTOR; ENVIRONMENT
AB This paper analyzes the possibility of producing bio-fuel in the Amazon degraded lands. The aim here is to combine environmental concerns with an improvement of local people well-being. Firstly, a historical analysis is conducted in order to figure out the major deforestation driving forces in Amazon and to help to arrive at a feasible energy choice.
   Secondly, the geographical area is chosen. It is the spatial boundaries of Carajas Iron Ore Program in the southeastern Amazon where most of the deforestation has taken place in the last few decades. For this specific context, palm oil is chosen as a technological energy alternative due to its social production structure, its environmental benefits and its productivity.
   A quantified analysis is realized in terms of income generation (2000-3000 US$/family/yr), job creation (200,000-300,000 families settled), land required and restored (2-3.2 million ha), and carbon emission from fossil fuel avoided (13.1 Mt C). Some recommendations related to institutional and economic barriers are proposed in order to encourage the technology penetration in the market. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Forest fragmentation results in population declines and extinctions for many forest vertebrates, but little is known about the mechanisms causing declines in fragments. We investigated potential causes of declines in forest fragments for an Amazonian forest frog (Colostethus stepheni) at an experimental fragmentation study site in central Amazonian Brazil using field estimates of abundance and vital rates coupled with population simulations. Although adult male survival was not reduced by fragmentation, mean clutch size was reduced by 17%. Population simulations demonstrate that a reduction in clutch size of this magnitude is sufficient to cause the observed magnitude of population declines in fragments. Female snout-vent length was also reduced in fragments and may be related to the observed reduction in clutch size. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies on the effects of nonindigenous invasive species and habitat fragmentation on native ecosystems have become priorities for conservation biologists. This is relevant particularly for islands with high degrees of endemism. In the present paper the role of fragmentation and possible effects of introduced Rattus rattus on endemic rodents (Macrotarsomys bastardi and Eliurus spp.) and the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) were assessed for dry deciduous forests in Madagascar. Capture rates of endemic rodents declined significantly with declining fragment size. Macrotarsomys bastardi was never caught in primary forest fragments < 600 ha or outside the primary forest but captures of M. bastardi were correlated to changes in vegetation structure associated with fragmentation rather than to fragment size per se. Eliurus spp. were also found in small primary-forest fragments and in secondary forests close to primary forests, suggesting that secondary forests can serve as buffer zones or corridors for this species. The lemur M. murinus was caught in all types of primary and secondary forest. This species did not seem to respond to fragmentation of primary forests. Even though it was found in most secondary-forests, capture rates declined as these secondary forest formations increased in size. This indicates that secondary forests are suboptimal habitats for M. murinus. Rattus rattus were caught in all vegetation formations except for the open savanna. Their capture rates increased as forest fragments became smaller, indicating that mosaics of different habitat types are beneficial for introduced rats. There was no significant relation between capture rates of R. rattus and the endemic species. In conclusion, these results suggest that (1) native Malagasy rodents of the dry deciduous forest are more sensitive towards forest disturbance than M. murinus: (2) there is no indication for negative interactions between introduced rats and the native small-mammal fauna.

AB Hummingbird flower mites and hummingbirds may compete intensely for the nectar secreted by their host plants. Here, we present the results from field experiments in which flower mites were excluded from flowers of six hummingbird-pollinated plants with contrasting flower longevities. Nectar measurements were taken on flowers from which mites were excluded and those without mite exclusion over their lifespans. The exclusion of mites had a significant positive effect on the amount of nectar available in plants with long-lived flowers. In contrast, nectar availability in short-lived flowers was not significantly reduced after mite exclusion. The significance of the mite-exclusion treatment was independent of floral morph and flower age. Results also suggest that the magnitude of the mite-exclusion treatment depends on the volume of nectar produced by the flower throughout its lifetime. The treatment effect was detected when nectar consumption, presumably by flower mites, exceeded 13% of the nectar produced by the flowers; nectar availability was not significantly reduced when nectar volume was < 7 &mu;L per flower. It appears that flower mites consume proportionately more nectar in long-lived flowers than in short-lived flowers. Parasitic hummingbird flower mites seem to be preferentially taking advantage of plant-pollinator interactions in which flowers last several days and produce large volumes of nectar. The consequences of this finding concerning plant-hummingbird-mite interactions await further investigation. As a working hypothesis, we propose that nectar production has increased over evolutionary time not only by the selective pressures imposed by the pollinators, but also to compensate for the reduction they suffer after exploitation by nectar robbers and thieves such as flower mites.

AB Density-dependence in tree population dynamics has seldom been examined in dry tropical forests. Using long-term data from a large permanent plot, this study examined 16 common species in a dry tropical forest in southern India for density-dependence, Employing quadrat-based analyses, correlations of mortality, recruitment and population change with tree densities were examined. Mortality in 1-10 cm diameter trees was largely negatively correlated with conspecific density, whereas mortality in > 10 cm diameter trees was positively correlated. Mortality was, however, largely unaffected by the basal area and abundance of heterospecific trees. Recruitment was poor in most species, but in Lagerstroemia microcarpa (Lythraceae), Tectona grandis (Verbenaceae) and Cassia fistula (Fabaceae), species that recruited well, strong negative correlations of recruitment with conspecific basal area and abundance were found. In a few other species that could be tested, recruitment was again negatively correlated with conspecific density. In Lagerstroemia, recruitment was positively correlated with the basal area and abundance of heterospecific trees, but these correlations were non-significant in other species. Similarly, although the rates of population change were negatively correlated with conspecific density they were positive when dry-season ground fires occurred in the plot. Thus, the observed positive density-dependence in large-tree mortality and the negative density-dependence in recruitment in many species were such that could potentially regulate tree populations. However, repeated fires influenced density-dependence in the rates of population change in a way that could promote a few common species in the tree community.

AB Regeneration processes associated with gap-building-phase sites are described for the tropical montane cloud forest of the El Cielo Biosphere Reserve in Tamaulipas, Mexico. Twelve gap-building-phase sites c. 20 y old were selected within the forest according to their gap size and severity of disturbance (i.e. number of fallen logs). All flowering plants were recorded within the sites and specimens were identified to species level. Species were related to genera geographical affinity and growth form. Abundance, individual height and aerial crown cover were also recorded for all species. The composition for these sites was 121 vascular plant species grouped in 96 genera and 60 families. Results suggest that the advanced regeneration of shrub and tree species of the medium canopy, such as Eugenia capuli, Ternstroemia sylvatica, Turpinia occidentalis, Meliosma oaxacana, Myrsine coriacea and Podocarpus reichei, was favoured by the disturbance regime prevailing in this forest community. All of these woody species belong to tropical genera and are structurally dominant in the gap-building-phase sites. A differential response of the vegetation was obtained in these sites as a function of the severity of disturbance and gap size. This response was revealed by the dominance-diversity relationships. Small gaps (45-95 m(2)) or gaps created by two treefalls showed a higher diversity and density compared to larger gaps (95-150 m2) or those created by four fallen logs, which had a lower species diversity and significantly lower tree and vine densities. These results imply that gap size and the severity of disturbance have a significant effect on the regeneration of these disturbed sites.

AB Occurrences of densely packed benthic organisms in extant reefs are of two types: 1) live-live interactions, where two living organisms interact, and 2) live-dead associations, where only one is alive and uses the other as a substrate. The latter are common in reef deposits due to biostratinomic feedback, i.e. dense skeletal accumulations provide hard substrates for clonal recruitment, thus facilitating greater frequency of live-dead encounters than in lower biomass level-bottom communities dominated by solitary organisms. Differentiating between these two types in ancient reefs is difficult, often impossible.
   Most live-live interactions among clones in extant reef communities involve competition for space. Clonal spatial competition is divisible into four types: 1) direct-aggressive: encrusting overgrowth; 2) indirect-passive: depriving neighbors of resources, chiefly sunlight, by growth above them; 3) stand-off: avoidance of competition by organisms adopting positions that avoid or minimize direct polyp/zooid contact; and 4) overwhelming: one clone/ species volumetrically or numerically overwhelms the other, meeting minimal resistance. Despite class-order level differences in taxa, our results indicate that extant analogs, based on the arrangement and distortion of skeletons, are valuable for recognizing live-live interactions in Silurian and Carboniferous reefs and interpreting the types of spatial competition represented.
   Comparison of overhead (plan) views of live-live coral competition in Polynesian reefs with vertical sections of Silurian and Carboniferous sponge-dominated reefs and biostromes suggests that direct-aggressive competition is more common among extant than among Paleozoic reef-builders. Stand-offs showing clone margin distortion and overwhelming with minor skeletal distortion are most common in our fossil examples and probably relate to the dominance of these reefs by sponges. Success by extant sponges in spatial competition is largely due to allelochemical deterrence which may explain the predominance of stand-off and overwhelming confrontations in fossil sponges rather than tentacle-mesentery based direct aggression among extant corals and bryozoans.

AB The ophiuroid communities on the continental slope off central California were examined using box cores and trawls. Box cores were taken between 550 and 3085 m at sites southwest of the Farallon Islands, and otter and beam trawls were used below 2300 m at three sites between the Farallon Islands and Point Sur. Eighteen ophiuroid species from six families were identified. Eighty percent of the individuals collected with box cores belonged to two species, Ophiura leptoctenia and Ophiacantha normani, which were dominant between 1000 and 2000 m, The largest ophiuroid faunal break occurred at around 2000 m and was associated with elevated dissolved oxygen levels, decreasing sediment grain size, and increasing sediment organic content. A comparison of box-core and trawl data from below 2300 m showed that box cores undersampled the ophiuroid community on the continental slope, missing almost 50% of the species collected by trawls within the same area, whereas trawls underestimated ophiuroid densities, reporting on average 243 times fewer ophiuroids per m(2) than did box cores. There was a change in species relative abundance patterns between sampling locations. Ophiuroids exhibited patchy spatial distribution patterns on both a small scale of around 0.1 m(2) and a large scale on the order of 100-1000 s of square meters. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB We devised a "random-clearing model" to predict effects of habitat loss on plant communities and populations. The model yields the probability that a species will be extirpated by land clearing, based on only two parameters: its density and the percentage of the landscape that has been cleared. It can also be used to predict species richness of plant communities following clearing, so long as densities of individual species are known.
   We tested the model using data on the distributions of 200 tree species (greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh) within two 9-ha experimental landscapes in central Amazonia. Deforestation levels ranging from 20% to 99% of the landscape were simulated randomly, with the actual persistence of each species being the number of times it remained in the landscape after 1000 runs. The model was effective in all cases, explaining 83-99% of the total variability in species persistence on each plot. Species' distribution patterns explained some residual variation in persistence but were of negligible importance compared to the predictions of the model.
   We also used the model to predict species richness, simulating both random and realistically contagious patterns of deforestation. Again, the model was highly effective, explaining 96% to 98% of the total variation in richness. Surprisingly, there was little difference in richness between random and contagious clearing patterns.
   These results suggest that, at least at the limited spatial scale of our analysis, the effects of deforestation on plant persistence and richness can be predicted using a simple model that assumes random species distributions and deforestation patterns. The model makes four predictions: (1) Density has an overriding influence on the susceptibility of species to clearing, while distribution patterns are usually of much lesser importance. (2) The relationship between density and persistence is nonlinear. (3) Rare species (less than or equal to 1 tree/ha) become exceptionally vulnerable in heavily degraded landscapes and in small forest remnants. (4) The distinction between high (e.g., 95%) and very high (e.g., 99%) levels of habitat clearing in terms of species persistence is often dramatic.

AB The growth of nine multipurpose woody legumes was evaluated in nursery conditions. These species, belonging to the genera Acacia, Leucaena, Lysiloma, Prosopis and Pithecellobium, inhabit both primary and secondary tropical deciduous and thorn forests. The total length of the experiments was 165 days. At a variable frequency, the following four variables were measured: (1) relative growth rate (RGR), (2) root/shoot ratio (R/S), (3) root length/root dry weight ratio (RL/RDW), and (4) stem length (SL). The temporal behavior of these variables differed greatly among species. A direct relationship between seed weight and initial biomass production was initially found; however, the effect of seed size on biomass production was lost as plants aged. At the initial harvest, RGR values did not differ significantly among species, but they did at the end of the experiment; Pithecellobium dulce had the lowest final RGR. The three Acacia species had the highest biomass productions and highest R/S ratios but the lowest RL/RDW ratios; A. farnesiana and Lysiloma divaricata had the largest mean SL, whereas the smallest mean SL corresponded to the two Leucaena species and to Lysiloma acapulcensis. Several recommendations concerning the management of plants in the nursery and the optimal timing for transplanting the seedlings to reforestation sites are provided. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB New leaf production in seasonal tropical forests may result from changes in water or light availability. In this study, the relationship between leaf flushing, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and rainfall was examined for understorey saplings in a moist tropical forest over one year. During the wet season, weeks with greater PAR were correlated with a greater proportion of saplings flushing new leaves during subsequent weeks in nine out of ten species. Rainfall was negatively correlated with subsequent leafing during the wet season for six of ten species. However, during the dry season, rainfall was positively correlated with leafing during the following weeks for six species, but the relationship was much weaker. PAR in the dry season was negatively correlated with flushing in eight species. These results support the hypothesis that under well-watered conditions, light limits leaf production, and peaks in insolation result in greater leaf production.

AB Organisms in free-living populations are normally subjected to stressful environments, especially hydrological extremes followed by nutritional inadequacy. Although adaptation to increased desiccation stress can occur, reduced fitness is a cost restricting the potential for spread into extreme habitats. Selection for stress resistance should be lower-in captive populations reducing survival on release into free-living conditions. Therefore in developing protocols to promote conservation I recommend monitoring stress response traits of direct ecological importance emphasizing outlier populations close to extinction. This approach gains support from evidence that genetic variability in some stressed outlier populations is not lacking but may be enhanced.

AB Barrow Island, which lies about 90 km north of Onslow off the arid Western Australian Pilbara coast, experienced its driest year on record in 1990 with a total of only 122.4 mm of rain. Golden bandicoots captured in November 1990 evidenced poor condition and mean body mass was a low 242.6 +/- 10.9 g with-a total body water content (TBW) of 76.3 +/- 1.4%. Despite this substantial loss of body water and solids, the animals maintained water and electrolyte balance during the period of turnover [water influx 79.5 +/- 6.9 v. efflux 83.3 +/- 5-7 mL (kg0.82 day)-1 and sodium influx 4.9 +/- 0.7 v. efflux 5.3 +/- 0.7 mmol (kg day)-1]. By April 1991, although only a further 37.4 mm of rain had been recorded on Barrow Island, the condition of the bandicoots had improved markedly, as a result of exploitation of insect resources, and their mean body mass had increased to 306.5 +/- 22.6 g and TBW decreased to 62.5 +/- 1.4% (both P < 0.001), the latter reflecting enhanced fat stores. This general improvement in condition of the bandicoots was in marked contrast to that of other herbivorous marsupials on the island. Rates of water and sodium turnover of the golden bandicoots were, however, not significantly different from those measured in the previous November, Field Metabolic Rates (FMRs), measured with doubly labelled water ((HHO))-H-3-O-18, were extremely low, averaging only 0.45 +/- 0.26 mL CO2 (g h)-1, which is very close to laboratory estimates of 0.35 +/- 0.09 mL O2(g h)-1 for the basal metabolic rate of this species. A major cyclone struck Barrow Island on 3 March 1992, with 162 mm of rain falling in 24 h, and turnover measurements in May of that year revealed a substantial increase in rates of water flux. Mean body mass further increased to 332.6 +/- 8.5 g and TBW averaged 61.8 +/- 1.1%. Water turnover rates were significantly elevated when compared with April of the previous year with an influx of 112.5 +/- 7.3 and an efflux of 119.0 +/- 7.6 mL (kg0.82 day)-1 respectively (both P = 0.001). Rates of sodium turnover, however, were only slightly lower at 3.6 +/- 0.5 and 4.1 +/- 0.5 mmol (kg day)-1 for influx and efflux respectively (P = 0.056 for influx only), suggesting a slight decrease in the average sodium content of the diet. The volume of water required to maintain hygric balance was estimated by regression analysis at 26.7 mL day-1 [=88.3 mL (kg0.82 day)-1] in November 1990, and 33-9 mL day-1 [=85.2 mL (kg0.82 day)-1] in May 1992, following rain. The FMR of eight bandicoots was very significantly elevated to 1.39 +/- 0.23 mL CO2 (g h)-1 after rain, which is substantially higher than even the FMR of 0.91 +/- 0.07 mL CO2(g h)-1, or 644 kJ day-1, reported for the closely related southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) studied in the region of Perth by Nagy et al. (1991). Turnover rates of water and sodium for two rodent species, the Barrow Island mouse (Pseudomys nanus) and the rock rat (Zyzomys argurus), were very similar to those recorded for golden bandicoots in the dry period, but FMRs were a little higher at 0.80 +/- 0.26 and 0.59 +/- 0-36 mL CO2(g h)-l respectively. The FMR of Barrow Island mice increased very significantly to a mean of 2.73 +/- 0.50 mL CO2(g h)-l after rain, but rock rats were not caught at this time. The data document the impressive ability of these mammals to avail themselves of extremely limited resources and maintain physiological homoiostasis under conditions of extreme aridity.

AB The U-net is nowadays among the most popular deep learning algorithms for land use/land cover (LULC) mapping; nevertheless, it has rarely been used with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral (MS) imagery. On the other hand, the discrimination between plantations and forests in LULC maps has been emphasized, especially for tropical areas, due to their differences in biodiversity and ecosystem services provision. In this study, we trained a U-net using different imagery inputs from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, MS, SAR and a combination of both (MS + SAR); while a random forests algorithm (RF) with the MS + SAR input was also trained to evaluate the difference in algorithm selection. The classification system included ten classes, including old-growth and secondary forests, as well as old-growth and young plantations. The most accurate results were obtained with the MS + SAR U-net, where the highest overall accuracy (0.76) and average F1-score (0.58) were achieved. Although MS + SAR and MS U-nets gave similar results for almost all of the classes, for old-growth plantations and secondary forest, the addition of the SAR band caused an F1-score increment of 0.08-0.11 (0.62 vs. 0.54 and 0.45 vs. 0.34, respectively). Consecutively, in comparison with the MS + SAR RF, the MS + SAR U-net obtained higher F1-scores for almost all the classes. Our results show that using the U-net with a combined input of SAR and MS images enabled a higher F1-score and accuracy for a detailed LULC map, in comparison with other evaluated methods.

AB Soil microbial communities maintain multiple ecosystem functions in terrestrial ecosystems. The response of soil microbial communities to vegetation restoration in desertification environments is still poorly understood. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the dynamic changes of the soil microbial community during the growth of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolic (P. sylvestris) plantations. We collected soil samples from five P. sylvestris plantations with different stand age. High-throughput sequencing was performed to determine the microbial community structure. The dynamic relationship between soil microbial community and edaphic factors was analyzed using the co-occurrence network, mantel test and partial least squares path modeling. The results showed that the soil microbial alpha diversity and community structure were significantly various among the plantations (P < 0.001). The number of nodes and edges in microbial co-occurrence network gradually decreased and the interrelationships between species became weak with stand age. The Available phosphorus was the most significant factor affecting the structure of bacterial community (R2 = 0.952), while the total phosphorus was the most significant factor affecting the structure of fungal community (R2 = 0.745). However, soil moisture had no significant effect on the microbial community. pH (0.73) and available nitrogen (0.91) had the largest positive total effects on bacterial and fungal community, respectively. Stand age (-0.65) was an indirect factor with the largest negative total effects on the bacterial community. Therefore, we concluded that the soil microbial community was not limited by soil moisture during the natural restoration process of P. sylvestris plantations in the desertification environment and the phosphorus utilization efficiency played a leading role in shaping the soil microbial community.

AB Modeling functional connectivity in altered landscapes is one of the growing fields of expertise in landscape ecology, and many research teams have proposed different methods to evaluate it for a wide range of species. However, very few have empirically validated the efficiency of such models in discriminating real corridors from theoretical ones. Models that are not validated or those only based on structural connectivity could result in inefficient management decisions. Moreover, validation could potentially reveal that functional connectivity differs between focal species and spatial scales. Here we empirically compared different validation methods for two commonly used connectivity models applied to two cervid species (i.e. moose Alces americanus and white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus) during a road enlargement project. For both species, we built functional connectivity maps using CircuitScape (circuit-based model) and LinkageMapper (least-cost path model). We then validated them empirically using four different metrics: density of cervid-vehicle collisions, distance to the nearest wintering ground and detection rate calculated with automated cameras and with sand traps. Validation was carried out at various spatial scales (150, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 m). The circuit-based models performed better at identifying functional corridors of connectivity for moose. Validation strength differed greatly between the four metrics used, and the spatial scale at which the correlation between connectivity and data was assessed had little effect. Our study emphasizes the importance of validating functional connectivity models to provide the best decision-making tools.

AB The spatial pattern of forests impacts on biodiversity, stability and sustainability of forest ecosystems. Afforestation and reforestation projects have massively increased forested areas on the Chinese Loess Plateau, however, the spatial pattern of the new and old forests, as well as their interaction, remains unknown. Here we study the spatiotemporal dynamics of old and new forests for the period 2001-2016, and found that 84.21% of the old forests existed throughout the study period. Moreover, core forests (defined as a forest area which is surrounded by other forest areas) significantly increased (2585 km(2) yr(-1), in total 39, 597 km(2)). Two ecological restoration projects have left clear footprints on the forest landscape of the Loess Plateau: (1) The Natural Forest Conservation Project, aiming at expanding old forest, has resulted in the establishment of considerable areas of new forest surrounding old forest. Consequently, this has promoted new core forest areas to emerge. (2) The Grain for Green Project has mainly caused a fragmented landscape of forest islets which gradually connect to core forest areas. The general increase in core forest areas can be considered an ecological improvement, and the assessment method presented here may guide stakeholders in measuring the success of forest restoration activities that goes beyond a classical quantification of forest cover.

AB The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the richest biomes on the planet and also one of the most devastated; currently its distribution is summarized to isolated forest fragments and conservation units. The implementation and maintenance of ecological corridors is an alternative to mitigate negative effects caused by fragmentation. Analysis of the least cost path is a suitable technique for the correct implementation of corridors and can be improved with Fuzzy method. The objective of this work was to determine the potential forest fragments to interconnect in order to create a network of ecological corridors in Atlantic Forest, Espirito Santo State, using Fuzzy concept and least cost path analysis. First, by applying Fuzzy logic, we identified the potential forest fragments for ecological corridors implantation. Next, corridors were suggested based on the least cost path analysis, considering land use, declivity, permanent preservation areas (PPAs), and the 400 forest fragments with greatest ecological potential obtained by Fuzzy logic. A total of 33,105 forest fragments were recorded. Among these, considering combined classes "very good" and "good", only 31.5% were considered suitable for ecological corridors implantation, highlighting the largest fragments within state. Lowest cost path methodology presented 76 routes of runners, with a 335.71 km total length and 63,515.86 ha total area. Land use conflicts showed that forest fragments class predominated in the corridors area. PPAs inside corridors are in misuse, not complying with environmental legislation. Fuzzy Logic concept associated with least cost pathway methodology is an important tool for ecological network planning and implementation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The methodology proposed can be applied to other Brazilian Biomes as well other countries.

AB It has recently become apparent that the diversity of microbial life extends far below the species level to the finest scales of genetic differences. Remarkably, extensive fine -scale diversity can coexist spatially. How is this diversity stable on long timescales, despite selective or ecological differences and other evolutionary processes? Most work has focused on stable coexistence or assumed ecological neutrality. We present an alternative: extensive diversity maintained by ecologically driven spatiotemporal chaos, with no assumptions about niches or other specialist differences between strains. We study generalized Lotka Volterra models with antisymmetric correlations in the interactions inspired by multiple pathogen strains infecting multiple host strains. Generally, these exhibit chaos with increasingly wild population fluctuations driving extinctions. But the simplest spatial structure, many identical islands with migration between them, stabilizes a diverse chaotic state. Some strains (subspecies) go globally extinct, but many persist for times exponentially long in the number of islands. All persistent strains have episodic local blooms to high abundance, crucial for their persistence as, for many, their average population growth rate is negative. Snapshots of the abundance distribution show a power law at intermediate abundances that is essentially indistinguishable from the neutral theory of ecology. But the dynamics of the large populations are much faster than birth death fluctuations. We argue that this spatiotemporally chaotic "phase" should exist in a wide range of models, and that even in rapidly mixed systems, longer-lived spores could similarly stabilize a diverse chaotic phase.

AB Although metacommunity ecology has been a major field of research in the last decades, with both conceptual and empirical outputs, the analysis of the temporal dynamics of metacommunities has only emerged recently and consists mostly of repeated static analyses. Here we propose a novel analytical framework to assess metacommunity processes using path analyses of spatial and temporal diversity turnovers. We detail the principles and practical aspects of this framework and apply it to simulated datasets to illustrate its ability to decipher the respective contributions of entangled drivers of metacommunity dynamics. We then apply it to four empirical datasets. Empirical results support the view that metacommunity dynamics may be generally shaped by multiple ecological processes acting in concert, with environmental filtering being variable across both space and time. These results reinforce our call to go beyond static analyses of metacommunities that are blind to the temporal part of environmental variability.

AB The ongoing march toward freely available, highly pre-processed satellite imagery has given both researchers and the public unprecedented access to a vast and varied data stream teeming with potential. Among many sources, the multi-decade Landsat archive is certainly the best known, but legacy and current data from other sensors is available as well through the USGS data portals: these include CBERS, ASTER, and more. Though the particular band combinations or non-global missions have made their integration into analyses more challenging, these data, in conjunction with the entire Landsat record, are available to contribute to multi-decade surveys of land-cover change.
   With the goal of tracing forest change through time near the Roosevelt River in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, we used BULC and Google Earth Engine to fuse information from 13 space-borne imagers capturing 140 images spanning 45 years. With high accuracy, the resulting time series of classifications shows the timing and location of land-use/land-cover change-both deforestation and regrowth-at sub-annual time scales. Accuracy estimates showed that the synthesized BULC classification time series was better than nearly all of the single-day image classifications, covering the entire study area at sub-annual frequency while reducing the impact of clouds and most unwanted noise as it fused information derived from a wide array of imaging platforms. The time series improved and gradually sharpened as the density of observations increased in recent decades, when there were three or more clear, higher-resolution views of a pixel annually from any sensor combination. In addition to detailing the methodology and results of multi-source data fusion with the BULC approach, this study raises timely points about integrating information from early satellite data sources and from sensors with footprints smaller than Landsat's. There are decades of research deriving sensor-specific techniques for classifying land use and land cover from a single image in a variety of settings. The BULC approach leverages the many successes of single-sensor research and can be used as a straightforward, complementary tool for blending many good-quality mapped classifications from disparate sources into a coherent, high-quality time series.

AB The crucial role of tropical forests in the global carbon balance is underpinned by their extraordinarily high biomass and productivity, even though the majority of tropical forests grow on nutrient-poor soils. Nutrient cycling by litterfall has long been considered essential for maintaining high primary productivity in lowland tropical forests but few studies have tested this assumption experimentally. We review and synthesise findings from the Gigante Litter Manipulation Project (GLiMP), a long-term experiment in lowland tropical forest in Panama, Central America, in which litter has been removed from or added to large-scale plots for 15 years. We assessed changes in soil and litter nutrient concentrations in response to the experimental treatments and estimated nutrient return and nutrient use efficiency to indicate changes in nutrient cycling. The soil concentrations of most nutrients increased with litter addition and declined with litter removal. Litter removal altered nitrogen, potassium, manganese and zinc cycling, demonstrating the importance of litter inputs for maintaining the availability of these elements to plants. By contrast, litter addition only altered nitrogen cycling and, despite low concentrations of available soil phosphorus, the effects of litter manipulation on phosphorus cycling were inconsistent. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying the observed changes, and we emphasise the importance of decomposition processes in the forest floor for retaining nutrient elements, which partially decouples nutrient cycling from the mineral soil. Finally, by synthesising GLiMP studies conducted during 15 years of litter manipulation, we highlight key knowledge gaps and avenues for future research into tropical forest nutrient cycling.

AB The mineralization of soil organic phosphorus (P) is catalysed by extracellular phosphatases that hydrolyse different non-phytate phosphomonoesters (e.g., sugar phosphates and nucleotides), inositol phosphates (e.g., phytic acids), and phosphodiesters (e.g., nucleic acids, phospholipids). The availabilities of both the organic P compound and the respective phosphatase enzyme jointly determine whether the hydrolysis reaction is substrate limited (enzyme availability > substrate availability) or enzyme limited (enzyme availability < substrate availability), with potential consequences for overall organic P composition and accumulation in soil. Our objective was to evaluate whether the hydrolysis of various organic P compounds in soil is limited by availability of substrate or enzyme. To this end, we combined the principles of enzyme activity assays and enzyme addition assays. Ten soils with contrasting properties and origins received either model organic P substrate, specific phosphatases or a combination of both, added either to a soil:water suspension or a soil:water filtrate. Soil indigenous activity of phosphatases was low in all filtrates, confirming that enzymes were mostly associated with the solid fraction of the soil. In soil suspensions, the rapid hydrolysis of added non-phytate phosphomonoester substrate by soil indigenous enzymes indicated high availability of non-phytase phosphomonoesterase enzymes. In combination with the low availability of non-phytate phosphomonoester substrate in soil suspensions, determined by adding enzymes to the suspensions, this indicated a substrate limitation for the hydrolysis of non-phytate phosphomonoesters in soil. In contrast, enzyme-limitation was found for phytate and phosphodiesters. A review of the available literature on the production, stabilisation and hydrolytic activity of each of the three analysed organic P substrates and the respective enzymes supported our findings. We therefore suggest that not only the production and stabilisation but also differences in available phosphatase enzymes strongly determine the occurrence of specific organic P compounds in soil.

AB Worldwide, fires have substantial economic, social and health-related impacts. Brazil is one of the most affected areas in the globe, particularly the Cerrado, a savanna-like biome, whose composition, structure, species abundance and diversity are shaped by recurring fires. The aim is to assess present and future trends of fire danger and burned area (BA), using the Daily Severity Rating (DSR), an extension of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System, and climate outputs from a regional climate model, the RCA4 from the Rossby Centre. To that end, we validated the climate variables simulated by RCA4 and the resulting DSR, both showing consistency with observation-based datasets. We then developed a statistical model of BA using fire season averaged DSR as a predictor, found to explain 71% of the interannual variability of BA from 2003 to 2017. Using the statistical model, we projected future fire danger and BA over Cerrado for IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. Results show an increase in future BA for all scenarios, with pronounced changes for RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, where BA is expected to increase by 39% and 95% for 2100. In the case of RCP 2.6, the closest scenario to the 1.5 degrees C target established by the United Nations, results indicate an increase in mean BA up to 22% by 2050, compared to the historical period, followed by a decrease to 11% by 2100. This is especially relevant since RCP 2.6 is the only scenario where such a decrease is projected, highlighting the importance of keeping global mean surface temperature below the 1.5 degrees C warming target.

AB In temperate ecosystems, earthworms and ants are the most important organisms for bioturbation. Little is known about how these groups contribute to bioturbation in different environments and to what extent overall bioturbation depends on their diversity. We developed a formula that allows quantification of annual earthworm bioturbation, thereby taking differences between earthworm ecotypes into account. With this formula, we calculated earthworm bioturbation at three sites, each with vegetation types typically found in Northern Europe. Earthworm bioturbation was low (1 Mg dry soil ha(-1) y(-1)) in Scots pine and Norway spruce forests with acidic soil (pH 3.9-4.4) and high (between 15 and 34 Mg dry soil ha(-1) y(-1)) in broadleaf forests, grasslands, alder carr and spruce forests on calcareous soil. Burrowing (endogeic and anecic) earthworms accounted for most of the earthworm bioturbation, and these worms had the highest population densities at moderate-to-high soil pH (pH 5-7.2). Estimates of ant bioturbation at the same sites were based on nest abundance, size and residence time. Mean ant bioturbation varied between 0.2 and 1 Mg dry soil ha(-1) y(-1), but individual plots had up to 2.4 Mg dry soil ha(-1) y(-1). In soils with pH higher than 5, the relative contribution of ants to total bioturbation was only 1-5%. Ant bioturbation was higher than earthworm bioturbation only in some forest soils with pH 3.9-4.4. Thus, earthworms appear to be the dominant cause of bioturbation in most types of terrestrial ecosystems in the cold-temperate areas of Europe and when information on local earthworm communities and monthly soil temperatures is available, bioturbation can be quantified using the presented 'earthworm bioturbation formula'.

AB The highly interactive nature of predator-prey relationship is essential for ecosystem conservation; predators have been extirpated, however, from entire ecosystems all over the Earth. Reintroductions comprise a management technique to reverse this trend. Species Distribution Models (SDM) are preemptive tools for release-site selection, and can define levels of habitat quality over the species distribution. The Atlantic Forest of South America has lost most of its apex predators, and Harpy Eagles Harpia harpyja-Earth's largest eagle-are now limited to few forest pockets in this domain. Harpy Eagles are supposedly widespread in the Amazon Forest, however, where habitat loss and degradation is advancing at a rapid pace. We aim to describe the suitability of threatened Amazonian landscapes for this eagle. We also aim to assess the suitability of remaining Atlantic Forest sites for Harpy Eagle reintroductions. Here we show that that considerable eagle habitat has already been lost in Amazonia due to the expansion of the "Arc of Deforestation", and that Amazonian forests currently represent 93% of the current distribution of the species. We also show that the Serra do Mar protected areas in southeastern Brazil is the most promising region for Harpy Eagle reintroductions in the Atlantic Forest. Reintroduction and captive breeding programs have been undertaken for Harpy Eagles, building the technical and biological basis for a successful restoration framework. Our distribution range for this species represents a 41% reduction of what is currently proposed by IUCN. Furthermore, habitat loss in Amazonia, combined with industrial logging and hunting suggest that the conservation status of this species should be reassessed. We suggest researchers and conservation practitioners can use this work to help expand efforts to conserve Harpy Eagles and their natural habitats.

AB Although the impacts of climate change on biodiversity are increasing worldwide, few studies have attempted to forecast these impacts on Amazon Tropical Forest. In this study, we estimated the impact of climate change on Amazonian avian assemblages considering range shifts, species loss, vulnerability of ecosystem functioning, future effectiveness of current protected areas and potential climatically stable areas for conservation actions. Species distribution modelling based on two algorithms and three different scenarios of climate change was used to forecast 501 avian species, organized on main ecosystem functions (frugivores, insectivores and nectarivores) for years 2050 and 2070. Considering the entire study area, we estimated that between 4 and 19% of the species will find no suitable habitat. Inside the currently established protected areas, species loss could be over 70%. Our results suggest that frugivores are the most sensitive guild, which could bring consequences on seed dispersal functions and on natural regeneration. Moreover, we identified the western and northern parts of the study area as climatically stable. Climate change will potentially affect avian assemblages in southeastern Amazonia with detrimental consequences to their ecosystem functions. Information provided here is essential to conservation practitioners and decision makers to help on planning their actions.

AB The Australian desert ecosystem coevolved with humans over the course of fifty millennia, yet our understanding of the place of humans within the ecosystem is only now beginning to deepen; recent research suggests that the removal of Aboriginal people from homelands precipitated rapid ecosystem remodeling. We suggest that network-based approaches are instrumental in broadening our understanding of humans in ecosystems, so apply these approaches to examine nomadic-era ecosystems (when Aboriginal people lived exclusive foraging-based lifeways) and contemporary-era ecosystems (when Aboriginal people live a mixed-based economy lifestyle). Using the approach of food web modeling we explicitly place Martu Aboriginal foragers within the overall ecosystem of the Western Desert. By linking humans to the other biota in the desert, examining each species as nodes in a network and each consumption link as edges in the network, we can better understand the ways the network connectedness shifts between nomadic-era and contemporary-era food webs. Using network randomization simulations we show that the contemporary food webs deviate significantly from the nomadic era food webs, suggesting a key role of humans as knitters of the ecosystem. This work has implications for research on resilient ecosystems, both within Australia and beyond, and suggests that humans have significant roles to play in sustainability and resilience.

AB Mutualistic interactions are powerful drivers of biodiversity on Earth that can be represented as complex interaction networks that vary in connection pattern and intensity. One of the most fascinating mutualisms is the interaction between hummingbirds and the plants they visit. We conducted an exhaustive search for articles, theses, reports, and personal communications with researchers (unpublished data) documenting hummingbird visits to flowers of nectar-rewarding plants. Based on information gathered from 4532 interactions between 292 hummingbird species and 1287 plant species, we built an interaction network between nine hummingbird clades and 100 plant families used by hummingbirds as nectar resources at a continental scale. We explored the network architecture, including phylogenetic, morphological, biogeographical, and distributional information. As expected, the network between hummingbirds and their nectar plants was heterogeneous and nested, but not modular. When we incorporated ecological and historical information in the network nodes, we found a generalization gradient in hummingbird morphology and interaction patterns. The hummingbird clades that most recently diversified in North America acted as generalist nodes and visited flowers with ornithophilous, intermediate and non-ornithophilous morphologies, connecting a high diversity of plant families. This pattern was favored by intermediate morphologies (bill, wing, and body size) and by the low niche conservatism in these clades compared to the oldest clades that diversified in South America. Our work is the first effort exploring the hummingbird-plant mutualistic network at a continental scale using hummingbird clades and plant families as nodes, offering an alternative approach to exploring the ecological and evolutionary factors that explain plant-animal interactions at a large scale.

AB This article investigates whether protected areas are efficient instruments against deforestation in the Brazilian Amazonia. A Dynamic Spatial Durbin Model taking into account both the location bias and the spatial spillover effects between municipalities allows to assess the impact of the different types of protected areas (integral protected areas, sustainable protected areas and indigenous lands) on deforestation. We show that deforestation decisions are strategic complements. The econometric results differ according to the type of protected area. It is shown that: i) integral protected areas and indigenous lands allow for reducing deforestation; ii) sustainable use areas do not help to reduce deforestation; and iii) the spillover effects generated by integral protected areas and indigenous lands lead a reduction in deforestation in their vicinity. A 10% increase in the surface area of integral protected areas (indigenous lands) allows an estimated 9.32 sq. km (10.08 sq. km) of avoided deforestation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Amazonia is often cited as having the most diverse flora on the planet. However, the total number of species of higher plants in the region has been largely a matter of guesswork. Some recent publications have estimated the total number of species present, which indicate a lower overall diversity than was estimated in the past. However, analysis of the sampling density across the region, and data from various sources suggest that there may be reason why the recent figures may be considerable underestimates. I believe that much more investment in extensive collecting of quality plant specimens is needed to encounter the very large number of rare and local species that might never have been collected. Unfortunately the tendencies of investment in botany, in terms of geography and types of project, suggest that we will probably not be able to accurately assess the real diversity of the region.

AB The ecosystem services provided by tropical forests are affected by deforestation. Territorial management strategies aim to prevent and mitigate forest loss. Therefore, modeling potential land use changes is important for forest management, monitoring, and evaluation. This study determined whether there are relationships between forest vulnerability to deforestation (potential deforestation distribution) and the forest management policies applied in the Ecuadorian Amazon.
   Proxy and underlying variables were used to construct a statistical model, based on the principle of maximum entropy that could predict potential land use changes. Entropy can be seen as a measure of uncertainty for a density function. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and the Jackknife Test were used to validate the model. The importance of input variables in the model was determined through: Percent Contribution (PC) and Permutation Importance (PI). The results were compared with prevailing regional forest management strategies.
   The socioeconomic variables that provided the largest amount of information in the overall model (AUC=0.81) and that showed most of the information not present in other variables were: "Protected areas-Intangible zone" (PC=24%, PI=12.4%), "timber harvesting programs" (PC=21.7%, PI=4.7%), "road network" (PC=18.9%, PI=7.7%), and "poverty rate" (PC=3.7%, PI=6.1%). Also, the biophysical variable "temperature" (PC=7,9%, PI=22.3%) provided information in the overall model.
   The results suggested the need for changes in forest management strategies. Forest policies and management plans should consider integrating and strengthening protected areas and intangible zones, as well as restricting timber harvesting in native forest and establishing forest areas under permanent management. Furthermore, the results also suggested that financial incentive programs to reduce deforestation have to be evaluated because their present distribution is inefficient. In this context, conservation incentive plans need to be revised so that they focus on areas at deforestation risk. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forest-habitat loss and fragmentation reduce connectivity, presenting dispersal challenges for many forest-dependent species with deleterious effects on community structure and diversity. It is expected that avian forest specialists are vulnerable to fragmentation, yet seasonal migrants may be more resilient to isolation effects than sedentary specialists. We surveyed bird communities in 138 habitat patches of the critically endangered Indian Ocean Coastal Belt, South Africa, across a range of isolation distances from mainland forests during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. We quantified taxonomic and functional diversity per patch based on species' traits and performed 26 generalized linear mixed-effects models on the effects of isolation and the amount of habitat in the surrounding matrix on avian trait-diversity measurements. We compared diversity measures between seasons for evidence of resilience to isolation effects for migrants and compared linear regressions of isolation-distance effects to segmented regressions at various isolation distances to explore dispersal limits of sedentary forest specialists. All avian diversity measures were higher during the breeding season. The amount of surrounding habitat was a positive driver of all diversity measures. Isolation-distance effects had the most negative effect during the breeding season, and on sedentary forest specialists, which were unable to disperse across isolation distances >500m. Sedentary forest specialists are a conservation priority given (a) their value in perpetuating ecosystem services and (b) their vulnerability to isolation effects. Migratory forest specialists exhibited resilience to the isolation effect during non-breeding; thus, certain specialized niches may be occupied given the vagility of migratory forest specialists.

AB Climate change will increase the unpredictability, magnitude, and frequency of both slow and rapid onset disaster events. Although large-scale engineered interventions have been common for the purposes of risk reduction and adaptation in the past, emerging ecosystem-based approaches are gaining attention. In contrast to 'hard' infrastructure, ecosystem-based solutions that integrate risk management priorities with natural processes are touted as being more cost effective, socially equitable, and environmentally sustainable. Current developments in ecosystem-based approaches to climate adaptation (EbA) and ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) tend to focus on scientific projections, engineering techniques, and their respective roles in shaping economic benefits. However, recent studies show that effective implementation of such solutions is dependent on the governance practices and interactions between relevant actors, interests, and institutional structures. In response, this paper reviews the current status of governance studies in the context of EbA and Eco-DRR. The analysis is grounded in the interdisciplinary theories of governance, socio-ecological systems, infrastructure studies, and multilevel politics, with sources derived from scientific databases including Scopus and Science Direct advanced query. Based on the review, we evaluate existing governance theories, assessment methods, and implementation through illustrating emblematic examples from around the world. The paper concludes with a synthesis of governance gaps and opportunities, and notes that while emerging ecological engineering approaches provide distinct opportunities, there is a lack of comprehensive assessment beyond diagnosing potential financial, institutional, and political shortfalls. We therefore highlight the need for future research on the socio-ecological, spatial/scalar, and political dimensions of EbA and Eco-DRR.

AB Extreme events associated with global warming, such as ocean heat waves, can have contrasting fitness consequences for different species, thereby modifying the structure and composition of marine communities. Here, we examined the effects of a laboratory simulated heat wave on the physiology and performance of two Indo-Pacific crustacean species: the shrimp Rhynchocinetes durbanensis and the hermit crab Calcinus laevimanus. We exposed the crustaceans to a control temperature or to a +5 degrees C temperature (25 degrees C vs 30 degrees C) for two consecutive weeks, and weekly analyzed protective proteins, antioxidant activity, and lipid peroxides in muscle and visceral mass. Fulton's K, total protein, %C, and C:N molar ratio of muscle tissue were also analyzed at the end of the experiment. Results showed that 1) the most responsive tissues were the muscle in the shrimp species and the visceral mass in the hermit crab species; 2) biomarker responses in both species occurred mostly after 7 days of exposure; 3) temperature stress led to an increase in biomarker levels; 4) highest biomarker fold-changes were detected in protective chaperones and antioxidants superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase; 4) integrated biomarker indices suggested poorer health status in individuals subjected to the heat wave; 5) performance changes at the organism level were only detected in R. durbanensis; and 6) mortality rates of both species remained unchanged with the heat wave. Finally, we concluded that these species are capable of physiological adjustments in response to rapid environmental changes, which ultimately confers them with enough thermal tolerance to withstand this simulated heat wave without major consequences for fitness.

AB In forest ecosystems, disturbances that cause tree mortality create canopy gaps, increase growth of understory vegetation, and alter the abiotic environment. These impacts may have interacting effects on populations of ground-dwelling invertebrates that regulate ecological processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling. A manipulative experiment was designed to decouple effects of simultaneous disturbances to the forest canopy and ground-level vegetation to understand their individual and combined impacts on ground-dwelling invertebrate communities. We quantified invertebrate abundance, richness, diversity, and community composition via pitfall traps in response to a factorial combination of two disturbance treatments: canopy gap formation via girdling and understory vegetation removal. Formation of gaps was the primary driver of changes in invertebrate community structure, increasing activity-abundance and taxonomic richness, while understory removal had smaller effects. Families of Collembola and Diplopoda, as well as some families of Coleoptera, increased in combined canopy and understory disturbance treatments, whereas Curculionidae and Nitidulidae were more abundant in undisturbed forest. Gaps increased light availability, height and cover of understory vegetation, and soil moisture levels, and decreased depth and cover of leaf litter compared to undisturbed forest. Decoupling of canopy and understory vegetation disturbances revealed gap formation as an important short-term driver of ground-dwelling invertebrate community structure and composition. Our findings increase understanding of how ground-dwelling invertebrate communities respond to disturbance and inform sustainable management of forest ecosystems to foster biodiversity and resilience.

AB In the agricultural frontiers of Brazil, the distinction between forested and deforested lands traditionally used to map the state of the Amazon does not reflect the reality of the forest situation. A whole gradient exists for these forests, spanning from well conserved to severely degraded. For decision makers, there is an urgent need to better characterize the status of the forest resource at the regional scale. Until now, few studies have been carried out on the potential of multisource, freely accessible remote sensing for modelling and mapping degraded forest structural parameters such as aboveground biomass (AGB). The aim of this article is to address that gap and to evaluate the potential of optical (Landsat, MODIS) and radar (ALOS-1 PALSAR, Sentinel-1) remote sensing sources in modelling and mapping forest AGB in the old pioneer front of Paragominas municipality (Para state). We derived a wide range of vegetation and textural indices and combined them with in situ collected AGB data into a random forest regression model to predict AGB at a resolution of 20 m. The model explained 28% of the variance with a root mean square error of 97.1 Mgha(-1) and captured all spatial variability. We identified Landsat spectral unmixing and mid-infrared indicators to be the most robust indicators with the highest explanatory power. AGB mapping reveals that 87% of forest is degraded, with illegal logging activities, impacted forest edges and other spatial distribution of AGB that are not captured with pantropical datasets. We validated this map with a field-based forest degradation typology built on canopy height and structure observations. We conclude that the modelling framework developed here combined with high-resolution vegetation status indicators can help improve the management of degraded forests at the regional scale.

AB Understanding which environmental variables and traits underlie adaptation to harsh environments is difficult because many traits evolve simultaneously as populations or species diverge. Here, we investigate the ecological variables and traits that underlie Mimulus laciniatus' adaptation to granite outcrops compared to its sympatric, mesic-adapted progenitor, Mimulus guttatus. We use fine-scale measurements of soil moisture and herbivory to examine differences in selective forces between the species' habitats, and measure selection on flowering time, flower size, plant height, and leaf shape in a reciprocal transplant using M.laciniatusx M.guttatus F-4 hybrids. We find that differences in drought and herbivory drive survival differences between habitats, that M.laciniatus and M.guttatus are each better adapted to their native habitat, and differential habitat selection on flowering time, plant stature, and leaf shape. Although early flowering time, small stature, and lobed leaf shape underlie plant fitness in M.laciniatus' seasonally dry environment, increased plant size is advantageous in a competitive mesic environment replete with herbivores like M.guttatus'. Given that we observed divergent selection between habitats in the direction of species differences, we conclude that adaptation to different microhabitats is an important component of reproductive isolation in this sympatric species pair.

AB Background. A key strategy in biodiversity conservation is the establishment of protected areas. In the future, however, the redistribution of species in response to ongoing climate change is likely to affect species' representativeness in those areas. Here we quantify the effectiveness of planning protected areas network to represent 151 birds endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hotspot, under current and future climate change conditions for 2050.
   Methods. We combined environmental niche modeling and systematic conservation planning using both a county and a regional level planning strategy. We recognized the conflict between biodiversity conservation and economic development, including socio-economic targets (as opposed to biological only) and using planning units that are meaningful for policy-makers.
   Results. We estimated an average contraction of29,500 km(2) in environmentally suitable areas for birds, representing 52% of currently suitable areas. Still, the most cost-effective solution represented almost all target species, requiring only ca. 10% of the Atlantic Forest counties to achieve that representativeness, independent of strategy. More than 50% of these counties were selected both in the current and future planned networks, representing >83% of the species.
   Discussion. Our results indicate that: (i) planning protected areas network currently can be useful to represent species under climate change; (ii) the overlapped planning units in the best solution for both current and future conditions can be considered as "no regret" areas; (iii) priority counties are spread throughout the biome, providing specific guidance wherever the possibility of creating protected area arises; and (iv) decisions can occur at different administrative spheres (Federal, State or County) as we found quite similar numerical solutions using either county or regional level strategies.

AB The Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania and Kenya are one of 35 global biodiversity hotspots. The Eastern Arc forests are, as are many other tropical biodiversity hotspots, highly fragmented. Understanding the impact of habitat fragmentation (i.e., habitat loss and subdivision) on the spatial structure of the Eastern Arc forests is important because forest spatial structure highly influences species richness, persistence, and extinction debt. Here we examine the impact of habitat fragmentation on the spatial structure of the Eastern Arc forests at a patch scale using very high resolution aerial imagery having a spatial resolution of 0.5-1.5 m. Forest area across the 13 Eastern Arc Mountains is 405,852 ha and is distributed into 311 fragments 10 ha in size with a median fragment size of 84 ha. The 18 largest forest fragments in the Eastern Arc Mountains contain greater than three-quarters of total forest area. Average fragment isolation, as assessed by median distance to nearest fragment and median distance to the nearest larger fragment, is 867 and 1533 m, respectively. Of total forest area, 14% is < 100 m from the forest edge and 33% is < 300 m from the forest edge. Establishing forested linkages among the largest and closest forest fragments through forest regeneration and protection of secondary regenerating forest as well as providing protected area status to the remaining non-protected forest including unprotected smaller forest fragments are important to enhancing the long-term persistence of many plant and animal species here.

AB Payments for Ecosystem Services programmes represent an important conservation policy worldwide. Despite their popularity, there is still a shortage of evidence regarding whether or not these schemes improve quality of life and generate desired behavioural changes. In this paper, we use a dataset from participants that enrolled in a conservation program on 2007, and from non-participants in the same program. Mexican indigenous communities were interviewed to evaluate program impacts on a range of land use and socio-economic variables between 2007 and 2013. In response to the theory that perceptions of ecosystem services mediate changes in behaviour regarding conservation, we seek to test whether participation in the programme makes it more likely for respondents to identify a higher number of ecosystem services obtained from the forest. Our results are in line with recent socio-economic evaluations of these programmes that conclude that, at best, such conservation programmes do not harm their participants. However, we are also able to provide evidence that participation in the Mexican programme increases participants' perception of the provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services obtained from the forest. These results add more evidence to the thin literature on the behavioural dimensions of ecosystem services and the kind of responses of program participants to the conservation of those services.

AB In the following paper, we use robust optimization to calculate portfolios of Chilean forest stands which minimize the greatest underperformance among all considered ecosystem services (ES) and biodiversity. Forest experts were asked to score the six most important ES indicators and biodiversity for forest stands with either exotic or native tree species. Average scores and their variation were used to form an optimal forest portfolio (proportions of the five stand types). Quantitative indicators of ES were used to calculate the reference portfolio. Portfolios based on expert opinions (49% Eucalyptus plus Pinus, 51% native Nothofagus and mixed Pseudotsuga) did not differ significantly from portfolios based on quantitative indicators (51% Eucalyptus plus Pinus, 49% Nothofagus, mixed Pseudotsuga and Acacia). Both portfolios offer good protection against low achievement levels and prevent the degradation of important ES and biodiversity, while pure stands showed low achievement levels for specific ES. We conclude that integrating expert knowledge into forest planning may well support considering ES and biodiversity. Forest owners in the Mediterranean region, of Chile should be encouraged to integrate native Nothofagus species into their forest portfolios to better provide for multiple ES and the conservation of biodiversity.

AB Background. The Brazilian Amazon is the world's largest rainforest regions and plays a key role in biodiversity conservation as well as climate adaptation and mitigation. The government has created a network of protected areas (PAs) to ensure long-term conservation of the region. However, despite the importance of and positive advances in the establishment of PAs, natural resource depletion in the Brazilian Amazon is pervasive.
   Methods. We evaluated a total of 4,243 official law enforcement records generated between 2010 and 2015 to understand the geographical distribution of the illegal use of resources in federal PAs in the Brazilian Amazon. We classified illegal activities into ten categories and used generalized additive models (GAMs) to evaluate the relationship between illegal use of natural resources inside PAs with management type, age of PAs, population density, and accessibility.
   Results. We found 27 types of illegal use of natural resources that were grouped into 10 categories of illegal activities. Most infractions were related to suppression and degradation of vegetation (37.40%), followed by illegal fishing (27.30%) and hunting activities (18.20%). The explanatory power of the GAMs was low for all categories of illegal activity, with a maximum explained variation of 41.2% for illegal activities as a whole, and a minimum of 14.6% for hunting activities.
   Discussion. These findings demonstrate that even though PAs are fundamental for nature conservation in the Brazilian Amazon, the pressures and threats posed by human activities include a broad range of illegal uses of natural resources. Population density up to 50 km from a PA is a key variable, influencing illegal activities. These threats endanger long-term conservation and many efforts are still needed to maintain PAs that are large enough and sufficiently intact to maintain ecosystem functions and protect biodiversity.

AB Plants have numerous mechanisms to cope with the negative effects of herbivory, including plant resistance, structural and chemical traits that reduce damage, and plant tolerance, the ability to compensate for tissues lost. It has been argued that resistance and tolerance represent alternate strategies and thus there should be a trade-off between resistance and tolerance. However, resistance and tolerance are controlled via the same molecular pathway, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the process of endoreduplication. Endoreduplication is the replication of the genome without mitosis, which leads to an increase in cellular chromosome number. Increasing chromosome number and therefore gene copy number provides a means of increasing gene expression that has been shown to enhance compensation following herbivory. By measuring glucosinolate levels and seed production following the removal of apical dominance in genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana we show that there is a positive association between tolerance and induced chemical defense. Similarly, the direct association between tolerance and resistance is demonstrated by genetically manipulating the endoreduplication pathway. By overexpressing ILP1, a positive regulator of endoreduplication, and thus compensation, we experimentally increased glucosinolate production and tolerance in the Col-0 genotype. We suggest that many herbaceous plants that endoreduplicate (similar to 90%) would show a positive relationship between compensation and chemical defense, given that the molecular pathways are shared in common. We discuss these findings in light of contrasting results on measures of tolerance and resistance, given that the true relationship can be masked by ignoring genetic variation in endoreduplication and the timing of chemical measurement.

AB The emerging consensus posits that ultraviolet (UV) radiation accelerates litter decomposition in xeric environments mainly by preconditioning litter for subsequent microbial decomposition. However, how UV radiation affects the interactions among litter chemistry, microbes, and eventually litter mass during different decomposition stages is still poorly understood.
   Here, we conducted a 29-month in situ decomposition experiment with litter exposed to ambient and reduced UV in a semi-arid grassland.
   The decomposition rate for Cleistogenes squarrosa and Stipa krylovii under ambient UV was 82 and 111% greater than that under reduced UV, respectively. UV's positive effect showed three-stage temporal dynamics. During the early stage, UV had no impact on either litter chemistry or mass loss. During the intermediate stage, UV decreased litter carbon concentration and increased dissolved organic carbon concentration, but still had no effect on litter mass. During the late stage, UV exposure increased microbial population size in the surface soil and significantly increased litter mass loss.
   Overall, our study suggested that UV exposure accelerated litter decomposition first by improving litter biodegradability during the intermediate stage and then by enhancing microbial decomposition during the late stage. More long-term photodegradation experiments are needed to explore the biotic and abiotic interactions during different decomposition stages.

AB Context The biodiversity hotspot for conservation of New Caledonia has facing high levels of forest fragmentation. Remnant forests are critical for biodiversity conservation and can help in understanding how does forest fragmentation affect tree communities.
   Objective Determine the effect of habitat configuration and availability on tree communities.
   Methods We mapped forest in a 60 km 2 landscape and sampled 93 tree communities in 52 forest fragments following stratified random sampling. At each sampling point, we inventoried all trees with a diameter at breast height >= 10 cm within a radius of 10 m. We then analysed the response of the composition, the structure and the richness of tree communities to the fragment size and isolation, distance from the edge, as well as the topographical position.
   Results Our results showed that the distance from the forest edge was the variable that explained the greatest observed variance in tree assemblages. We observed a decrease in the abundance and richness of animaldispersed trees as well as a decrease in the abundance of large trees with increasing proximity to forest edges. Near forest edgeswe found a shift in species composition with a dominance of stress-tolerant pioneer species.
   Conclusions Edge-effects are likely to be the main processes that affect remnant forest tree communities after about a century of forest fragmentation. It results in retrogressive successions at the edges leading to a dominance of stress-tolerant species. The vegetation surrounding fragments should be protected to promote the long process of forest extension and subsequently reduce edge-effects.

AB According with niche theory the species are specialized in different ecological niches, being able to coexist as result of a differential use of resources. In this context, the biogeochemical niche hypothesis proposes that species have an optimal elemental composition which results from the link between the chemical and morphological traits for the optimum plant functioning. Thus, and attending to the limiting similarity concept, different elemental composition and plant structure among co-occurring species may reduce competition, promoting different functional niches. Different functional habits associated with leaf life-span or growth forms are associated with different strategies for resource uptake, which could promote niche partitioning. In the present study, based on the biogeochemical niche concept and the use of resources in different proportions, we have focused on leaf traits (morphological and chemical) associated with resource uptake, and explored the niche partitioning among functional habits: leaf life-span (deciduous, evergreen, and semideciduous) and growth (tree, shrub, and arborescent-shrub). To this end, we have quantified the hypervolume of the leaf functional trait space (both structure and chemical composition) in a sample of 45 Mediterranean woody species from Sierra Morena Mountains (Spain) growing along a local soil resource gradient. Our results show consistent variation in functional space for woody communities distributed along the environmental gradient. Thus, communities dominated by deciduous trees with faster growth and a predominant acquisitive strategy were characteristic of bottom forests and showed highest leaf biogeochemical space. While semideciduous shrubs and evergreen (arborescent, trees) species, characterized by a conservative strategy, dominated ridge forests and showed smaller functional space. In addition, within each topographical zone or environment type, the foliar biogeochemical niche partitioning would underlie the species ability to coexist by diverging on leaf nutrient composition and resource uptake. Lower niche overlap among functional habits were found, which support that different growth forms and leaf lifehabits may facilitate the coexistence of the woody species and niche partitioning along and within the gradient.

AB The Amazon basin has been subjected to unprecedented rates of land-use change over the past several decades, primarily as a result of the expansion of agriculture. Enhanced rain forest conservation efforts toward the end of the twentieth century slowed deforestation of the Amazon but, in turn, increased demand for land repurposing in the adjacent Cerrado (savanna) region, where conservation regulations are less strict. To maintain or increase yields while minimizing the need for additional land, agricultural producers adopted a form of intensification in which two rain-fed crops are planted within a single growing season (double cropping). Using 10 years (August 2002 to July 2012) of MODIS and TRMM data, it is demonstrated that there exists a threshold growing season rainfall amount (1759 mm) for double cropping. But more nuanced is the relationship between observable precipitation information available to farmers at the time of planting decision and the choice to "double crop'' in a given year. An evaluation of decision-available precipitation characteristics provides strong evidence for the importance of high rainfall frequency during a critical period prior to, and including, the rainy season onset.

AB Nitrogen (N) cycling in drylands under changing climate is not well understood. Our understanding of N cycling over larger scales to date relies heavily on the measurement of bulk soil N, and the information about internal soil N transformations remains limited. The N-15 natural abundance (delta N-15) of ammonium and nitrate can serve as a proxy record for the N processes in soils. To better understand the patterns and mechanisms of N cycling in drylands, we collected soils along a 3200 km transect at about 100 km intervals in northern China, with mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranging from 36 to 436 mm. We analyzed N pools and delta N-15 of ammonium, dual isotopes (N-15 and O-18) of nitrate, and the microbial gene abundance associated with soil N transformations. We found that N status and its driving factors were different above and below a MAP threshold of 100 mm. In the arid zone with MAP below 100 mm, soil inorganic N accumulated, with a large fraction being of atmospheric origin, and ammonia volatilization was strong in soils with high pH. In addition, the abundance of microbial genes associated with soil N transformations was low. In the semiarid zone with MAP above 100 mm, soil inorganic N concentrations were low and were controlled mainly by biological processes (e.g., plant uptake and denitrification). The preference for soil ammonium over nitrate by the dominant plant species may enhance the possibility of soil nitrate losses via denitrification. Overall, our study suggests that a shift from abiotic to biotic controls on soil N biogeochemistry under global climate changes would greatly affect N losses, soil N availability, and other N transformation processes in these drylands in China.

AB This study has assessed forest cover changes, rate of deforestation, levels of fragmentation and modeled the spatial dynamics of deforestation and forest fragmentation in Assam, India. The analysis of the forest change shows that between 1975 and 2015, the area coverage of forest has reduced from 23749 km(2) (30.3% of the state geographical area) to 21145 km(2) (27% of the state geographical area). The total predicted forest area of Assam is 20189 km(2) (25.7%) for 2030. Forest and non-forest classes were evaluated in order to assess changes and to study influence of five physical factors distance from road and settlement areas, elevation, slope and distance from the water bodies on the deforestation. The Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network modeling was used for predicting the spatial distribution of deforestation. According to the Cramer coefficients, the elevation was strongly associated with deforestation in Assam followed by the slope, distance to water bodies and the distance to roads. The forest areas undergoing high concentration of negative changes have been modelled in the form of deforestation hotspots by using optimised hotspot tool. The results of fragmentation analysis have indicated the reduction of core forests throughout the study period. The spatial database generated in the study is a useful input for understanding of the impact of deforestation and fragmentation on biodiversity and land use change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study explores the use of the relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the shortwave infrared ratio (SWIR32) vegetation indices (VI) to retrieve fractional cover over the structurally complex natural vegetation of the Cerrado of Brazil using a time series of imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Data from the EO-1 Hyperion sensor with 30 m pixel resolution is used to sample geographic and seasonal variation in NDVI, SWIR32, and the hyperspectral cellulose absorption index (CAI), and to derive end-member values for photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and bare soil (BS) from a suite of protected and/or natural vegetation sites across the Cerrado. The end-members derived from relatively pure 30 m pixels are then applied to a 500 m pixel resolution MODIS time series using linear spectral unmixing to retrieve PV, NPV, and BS fractional cover (F-PV, F-NPV, and F-BS). The two-way interaction response of MODIS-equivalent NDVI and SWIR32 was examined for regions of interest (ROI) collected within protected areas and nearby converted lands. The MODIS NDVI, SWIR32 and retrieved FPV, FNPV, and FBS are then compared to detailed cover and structural composition data from field sites, and the influence of the structural and compositional variation on the VIs and cover fractions is explored. The hyperion ROI analysis indicated that the twoway NDVI-SWIR32 response behaved as an effective surrogate for the two-way NDVI-CAI response for the campo limpo/grazed pasture to cerrado sensu stricto woody gradient. The SWIR32 sensitivity to the NPV and BS variation increased as the dry season progressed, but Cerrado savannah exhibited limited dynamic range in the NDVI-CAI and NDVI-SWIR32 two-way responses compared to the entire landscape, which also comprises fallow croplands and forests. Validation analysis of MODIS retrievals with Quickbird-2 images produced an RMSE value of 0.13 for FPV. However, the RMSE values of 0.16 and 0.18 for FBS and FNPV, respectively, were large relative to the seasonal and inter-annual variation. Analysis of site composition and structural data in relation to the MODIS-derived NDVI, SWIR32 and F-PV, F-NPV, and F-BS, indicated that the VI signal and derived cover fractions were influenced by a complex mix of structure and cover but included a strong year-to-year seasonal effect. Therefore, although the MODIS NDVI-SWIR32 response could be used to retrieve cover fractions across all Cerrado land covers including bare cropland, pastures and forests, sensitivity may be limited within the natural Cerrado due to sub-pixel heterogeneity and limited BS and NPV sensitivity.

AB Research about biodiversity-productivity relationships has focused on herbaceous ecosystems, with results from tree field studies only recently beginning to emerge. Also, the latter are concentrated largely in the temperate zone. Tree species diversity generally is much higher in subtropical and tropical than in temperate or boreal forests, with reasons not fully understood. Niche overlap and thus complementarity in the use of resources that support productivity may be lower in forests than in herbaceous ecosystems, suggesting weaker productivity responses to diversity change in forests. We studied stand basal area, vertical structure, leaf area, and their relationship with tree species richness in a subtropical forest in south-east China. Permanent forest plots of 30 x 30 m were selected to span largely independent gradients in tree species richness and secondary successional age. Plots with higher tree species richness had a higher stand basal area. Also, stand basal area increases over a 4-year census interval were larger at high than at low diversity. These effects translated into increased carbon stocks in aboveground phytomass (estimated using allometric equations). A higher variability in tree height in more diverse plots suggested that these effects were facilitated by denser canopy packing due to architectural complementarity between species. In contrast, leaf area was not or even negatively affected by tree diversity, indicating a decoupling of carbon accumulation from leaf area. Alternatively, the same community leaf area might have assimilated more C per time interval in more than in less diverse plots because of differences in leaf turnover and productivity or because of differences in the display of leaves in vertical and horizontal space. Overall, our study suggests that in species-rich forests niche-based processes support a positive diversity-productivity relationship and that this translates into increased carbon storage in long-lived woody structures. Given the high growth rates of these forests during secondary succession, our results further indicate that a forest management promoting tree diversity after disturbance may accelerate CO2 sequestration from the atmosphere and thus be relevant in a climate-change context.

AB Understanding the mechanisms generating species distributions remains a challenge, especially in hyperdiverse tropical forests. We evaluated the role of rainfall variation, soil gradients and herbivory on seedling mortality, and how variation in seedling performance along these gradients contributes to habitat specialisation. In a 4-year experiment, replicated at the two extremes of the Amazon basin, we reciprocally transplanted 4638 tree seedlings of 41 habitat-specialist species from seven phylogenetic lineages among the three most important forest habitats of lowland Amazonia. Rainfall variation, flooding and soil gradients strongly influenced seedling mortality, whereas herbivory had negligible impact. Seedling mortality varied strongly among habitats, consistent with predictions for habitat specialists in most lineages. This suggests that seedling performance is a primary determinant of the habitat associations of adult trees across Amazonia. It further suggests that tree diversity, currently mostly harboured in terra firme forests, may be strongly impacted by the predicted climate changes in Amazonia.

AB Understanding processes that promote species coexistence is integral to diversity maintenance. In hyperdiverse tropical forests, local conspecific density (LCD) and light are influential to woody seedling recruitment and soil nutrients are often limiting, yet the simultaneous effects of these factors on seedling survival across time remain unknown. We fit species-and age-specific models to census and resource data of seedlings of 68 woody species from a Costa Rican wet tropical forest. In decreasing order of prevalence, seedling survivorship was related to LCD, soil base cations, irradiance, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Species-specific responses to factors did not covary, providing evidence that species life history strategies have not converged to one continuum of high-surviving stress tolerant to low-surviving stress intolerant species. Survival responses to all factors varied over the average seedling's lifetime, indicating seedling requirements change with age and conclusions drawn about processes important to species coexistence depend on temporal resolution.

AB Ecological interactions affect the survival and reproduction of individuals. However, ecological interactions are notoriously difficult to measure in extinct populations, hindering our understanding of how the outcomes of interactions such as competition vary in time and influence long-term evolutionary changes. Here, the outcomes of spatial competition in a temporally continuous community over evolutionary timescales are presented for the first time. Our research domain is encrusting cheilostome bryozoans from the Wanganui Basin of New Zealand over a ca 2 Myr time period (Pleistocene to Recent). We find that a subset of species can be identified as consistent winners, and others as consistent losers, in the sense that they win or lose interspecific competitive encounters statistically more often than the null hypothesis of 50%. Most species do not improve or worsen in their competitive abilities through the 2 Myr period, but a minority of species are winners in some intervals and losers in others. We found that conspecifics tend to cluster spatially and interact more often than expected under a null hypothesis: most of these are stand-off interactions where the two colonies involved stopped growing at edges of encounter. Counterintuitively, competitive ability has no bearing on ecological dominance.

AB The effects of riparian forest removal on a neotropical stream fish assemblage were assessed in the Mata Atlantica. Fish assemblage structure and fish feeding patterns were quantified at three sites along a pristine-to-deforested gradient in a Serra do Mar stream: (1) a pristine site fully covered by canopy with no light penetration and transparent waters, (2) an intermediate site with partially removed forest and (3) a fully removed forest site with no canopy and full light penetration where siltation and turbid waters predominate. Fish assemblage structure, fish densities and their feeding patterns differed widely among sites. Whilst the same five fish species occurred at the three sites, forest removal favoured the occurrence of sediment-tolerant iliophagous benthic species at the deforested site. At the pristine site, invertebrate prey predominated in water column fish diet and feeding overlap among species was low. Severe shifts in the feeding patterns were noticed in both deforested sites. Invertebrates were replaced by detritus, organic matter and algae at both sites and feeding overlap increased markedly. The overwhelming feeding adaptability of these neotropical fishes appeared capable of buffering the deleterious effects of forest removal on stream quality in terms of increased light penetration, siltation and water turbidity. Forest cutting in this Mata Atlantica stream clearly caused strong functional changes associated with forest clearance through important modifications in the assemblage organization and trophic patterns of the main species, but did not eliminate species.

AB Research in ecological networks has developed impressively in recent years. A significant part of this growth has been achieved using networks to represent the complexity of mutualistic interactions between species of birds and plants, such as pollination and seed dispersal. Bird-plant networks are built from matrices whose cells account for the field-sampled magnitudes of interaction (e.g. the number of plant fruits consumed by birds) in bird-plant species pairs. The comparative study of mutualistic networks evidences three general patterns in network structure: they are highly heterogeneous (many species having just a few interactions, but a few species being highly connected), nested (with specialists interacting with subsets of species with which generalists interact) and composed of weak and asymmetric relationships between birds and plants. This type of structure emerges from a set of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms accounting for the probabilistic role of species abundances and the deterministic role of species traits, often constrained by species phylogenies. Although bearing structural generalities, bird-plant networks are variable in space and time at very different scales: from habitat to latitudinal and biogeographical gradients, and from seasonal to inter-annual contrasts. They are also highly sensitive to human impact, being especially affected by habitat loss and fragmentation, defaunation and biological invasions. Further research on bird-plant mutualistic networks should: 1) apply wide conceptual frameworks which integrate the mechanisms of interaction and the responses of species to environmental gradients, 2) enlarge the ecological scale of networks across interaction types and animal groups, and 3) account for the ultimate functional (i.e. demographic) effects of trophic interactions.

AB Understanding how diversity is maintained in species-rich communities, such as tropical forests, remains a challenge in ecology. Recent work suggests that the controversy between competing theories could be better resolved by considering the spatial scale at which different processes rule community assembly. Here we use individual species-area relationships (ISAR) to evaluate the spatial organization of tree diversity around individuals of different species in a completely-mapped tropical dry forest in south Ecuador. We test two hypotheses. First, stressful environmental conditions promote facilitative interactions that will generate spatial signals of accumulation of diversity around individual trees - contrary to what has been reported in humid tropical forests. Second, spatial signals will shift through ontogeny. As, as larger, older trees generate new microsite conditions that affect the recruitment of younger, smaller trees. We compute ISAR functions for adult trees, for young trees and a new crossed-ISAR function measuring the accumulation of diversity of young trees around the old trees. We compare observed ISARs to the expectations of inhomogeneous Poisson (i.e. null) models controlling for the effects of environmental variation and habitat association on tree distribution. Although the prevalent response among adult trees was not different from null expectations, which means that the organization of diversity in this size class could be explained by environmental heterogeneity alone, most species accumulated more diversity than expected over short spatial scales in the small stem size class. Only two species accumulated significant diversity in the crossed-ISARs. Our study indicates the role of facilitation in the organization of plant diversity in this dry forest, but that facilitation is limited to some key species acting on early life stages and accumulating diversity around them. Our results demonstrate the benefit of considering different life-stages and crossed analyses to disentangle the processes affecting community assembly in tropical dry forests.

AB In Amazonian non-flooded forests with a moderate dry season, many trees do not form anatomically definite annual rings. Alternative indicators of annual rings, such as the oxygen (delta O-18(wc)) and carbon stable isotope ratios of wood cellulose (delta C-13(wc)), have been proposed; however, their applicability in Amazonian forests remains unclear. We examined seasonal variations in the delta O-18(wc) and delta C-13(wc) of three common species (Eschweilera coriacea, Iryanthera coriacea, and Protium hebetatum) in Manaus, Brazil (Central Amazon). E. coriacea was also sampled in two other regions to determine the synchronicity of the isotopic signals among different regions. The annual cyclicity of delta O-18(wc) variation was cross-checked by C-14 dating. The delta O-18(wc) showed distinct seasonal variations that matched the amplitude observed in the delta O-18 of precipitation, whereas seasonal delta C-13(wc) variations were less distinct in most cases. The delta O-18(wc) variation patterns were similar within and between some individual trees in Manaus. However, the delta O-18(wc) patterns of E. coriacea differed by region. The ages of some samples estimated from the delta O-18(wc) cycles were offset from the ages estimated by C-14 dating. In the case of E. coriacea, this phenomenon suggested that missing or wedging rings may occur frequently even in well-grown individuals. Successful cross-dating may be facilitated by establishing delta O-18(wc) master chronologies at both seasonal and inter-annual scales for tree species with distinct annual rings in each region.

AB Although many studies have investigated the benthic environment of temperate marine waters, little is known about the acoustic behaviour of the organisms in these habitats, particularly crustaceans. This study focused on the acoustic behaviour of large crustaceans in NE Atlantic coastal regions. A total of 11 crustacean species were recorded in tank-based experiments to identify sound-producing species and the behaviours associated with their sounds as well as to quantitatively characterise and compare the sounds. A total of 34 sounds were associated with behaviours such as moving, feeding, mandible rubbing, swimming, species-specific behaviour and other unidentified behaviours. The sounds included single pulse and pulse train signals that were distributed across a peak frequency spectrum of 3 to 45 kHz with received levels between 93 and 142 dB re 1 mu Pa (peak to peak). The results demonstrated that Brachyura had the most diverse sound types. Using a combination of several acoustic features, 24% of the recorded sounds appeared to have a high potential to be differentiated in field recordings: the feeding sound of Cancer pagurus, Carcinus maenas, Necora puber and Pachygrapsus marmoratus; the species-specific sound of C. pagurus and Galathea squamifera; and the pulse train sound associated with unidentified behaviours of Lophozozymus incisus and N. puber. These findings extend the existing crustacean acoustic library in marine ecosystems and contribute to our understanding of in situ acoustic recordings in temperate regions.

AB Visual cues are important for insects to find flowers and host plants. It has been proposed that the diversity of leaf shape in Passiflora vines could be a result of negative frequency dependent selection driven by visual searching behavior among their butterfly herbivores. Here we tested the hypothesis that Heliconius butterflies use leaf shape as a cue to initiate approach toward a host plant. We first tested for the ability to recognize shapes using a food reward conditioning experiment. Butterflies showed an innate preference for flowers with three and five petals. However, they could be trained to increase the frequency of visits to a non-preferred flower with two petals, indicating an ability to learn to associate shape with a reward. Next we investigated shape learning specifically in the context of oviposition by conditioning females to lay eggs on two shoots associated with different artificial leaf shapes: their own host plant, Passiflora biflora, and a lanceolate non-biflora leaf shape. The conditioning treatment had a significant effect on the approach of butterflies to the two leaf shapes, consistent with a role for shape learning in oviposition behavior. This study is the first to show that Heliconius butterflies use shape as a cue for feeding and oviposition, and can learn shape preference for both flowers and leaves. This demonstrates the potential for Heliconius to drive negative frequency dependent selection on the leaf shape of their Passiflora host plants.

AB Community-based tropical forest restoration projects, often promoted as a win-win solution for local communities and the environment, have increased dramatically in number in the past decade. Many such projects are underway in Andean cloud forests, which, given their extremely high biodiversity and history of extensive clearing, are understudied. This study investigates the efficacy of community-based tree-planting projects to accelerate cloud forest recovery, as compared to unassisted natural regeneration. This study takes place in northwest Andean Ecuador, where the majority of the original, highly diverse cloud forests have been cleared, in five communities that initiated tree-planting projects to restore forests in 2003. In 2011, we identified tree species along transects in planted forests (n = 5), naturally regenerating forests (n = 5), and primary forests (n = 5). We also surveyed 120 households about their restoration methods, tree preferences, and forest uses. We found that tree diversity was higher in planted than in unplanted secondary forest, but both were less diverse than primary forests. Ordination analysis showed that all three forests had distinct species compositions, although planted forests shared more species with primary forests than did unplanted forests. Planted forests also contained more animal-dispersed species in both the planted canopy and in the unplanted, regenerating understory than unplanted forests, and contained the highest proportion of species with use value for local people. While restoring forest increased biodiversity and accelerated forest recovery, restored forests may also represent novel ecosystems that are distinct from the region's previous ecosystems and, given their usefulness to people, are likely to be more common in the future.

AB Forest conservation policies could potentially become a centerpiece for climate change mitigation. Incentive-based conservation policies, such as payments for environmental services (PES), are seen as promising approaches to reduce deforestation. Yet, arguably the adoption of upscaled PES programs has remained slow, and when implemented their design often diverges from the principles laid out in the theory-based PES literature. In this article, we concentrate on some political economy forces that could help explaining the gap between PES theory and practice, with respect to policy adoption, including opportunities and challenges in this process. Public policy theories grasp the adoption determinants of three large, government-led incentive programs for forest conservation in the Amazon, in Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. We use Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework to analyze decision-making regarding program initiation, including key stakeholder interviews, to understand policy choices. We find that environmental concerns are not always the prime motives for PES programs, as political and institutional contexts limit environmental policy-makers' actions. Yet, policy choice processes become less constrained when environmental issues are closer to a government's priorities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the factors determining the spatial and temporal variation of ecological networks is fundamental to the knowledge of their dynamics and functioning. In this study, we evaluate the effect of elevation and time on the structure of plant-flower-visitor networks in a Colombian mountain forest. We examine the level of generalization of plant and animal species and the identity of interactions in 44 bipartite matrices obtained from eight altitudinal levels, from 2200 to 2900 m during eight consecutive months. The contribution of altitude and time to the overall variation in the number of plant (P) and pollinator (A) species, network size (M), number of interactions (I), connectance (C), and nestedness was evaluated. In general, networks were small, showed high connectance values and non-nested patterns of organization. Variation in P, M, I and C was better accounted by time than elevation, seemingly related to temporal variation in precipitation. Most plant and insect species were specialists and the identity of links showed a high turnover over months and at every 100 m elevation. The partition of the whole system into smaller network units allowed us to detect small-scale patterns of interaction that contrasted with patterns commonly described in cumulative networks. The specialized but erratic pattern of network organization observed in this tropical mountain suggests that high connectance coupled with opportunistic attachment may confer robustness to plant-flower-visitor networks occurring at small spatial and temporal units.

AB Frugivory is a widespread mutualistic interaction in which frugivores obtain nutritional resources while favoring plant recruitment through their seed dispersal services. Nonetheless, how these complex interactions are organized in diverse communities, such as tropical forests, is not fully understood. In this study we evaluated the existence of plant-frugivore sub-assemblages and their phylogenetic organization in an undisturbed western Amazonian forest in Colombia. We also explored for potential keystone plants, based on network analyses and an estimate of the amount of fruit going from plants to frugivores. We carried out diurnal observations on 73 canopy plant species during a period of two years. During focal tree sampling, we recorded frugivore identity, the duration of each individual visit, and feeding rates. We did not find support for the existence of sub assemblages, such as specialized vs. generalized dispersal systems. Visitation rates on the vast majority of canopy species were associated with the relative abundance of frugivores, in which ateline monkeys ( i.e. Lagothrix and Ateles) played the most important roles. All fruiting plants were visited by a variety of frugivores and the phylogenetic assemblage was random in more than 67% of the cases. In cases of aggregation, the plant species were consumed by only primates or only birds, and filters were associated with fruit protection and likely chemical content. Plants suggested as keystone species based on the amount of pulp going from plants to frugivores differ from those suggested based on network approaches. Our results suggest that in tropical forests most tree-frugivore interactions are generalized, and abundance should be taken into account when assessing the most important plants for frugivores.

AB Impoverished communities often turn to illegal extraction of resources from protected areas to alleviate economic pressures or to make monetary gains. Such practices can cause ecological damage and threaten animal populations. These communities also often face a high disease burden and typically do not have access to affordable health care. Here we argue that these two seemingly separate challenges may have a common solution. In particular, providing health care to communities adjacent to protected areas may be an efficient and effective way to reduce the disease burden while also improving local perceptions about protected areas, potentially reducing illegal extraction. We present a case study of a health centre on the edge of Kibale National Park, Uganda. The centre has provided care to c. 7,200 people since 2008 and its outreach programme extends to c. 4,500 schoolchildren each year. Contrasting the provision of health care to other means of improving community perceptions of protected areas suggests that health clinics have potential as a conservation tool in some situations and should be considered in future efforts to manage protected areas.

AB Numerous authors have studied the diet of the Eastern Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus) and have described this species as a generalist predator of invertebrates. In most studies, prey taxa are identified to the family or order level. Additionally, few studies have directly assessed dietary preference by comparing diet to available prey. We chose an important component of the diet of red-backed salamanders (ants) to test whether salamanders altered their diets temporally and to determine if salamanders preyed on a subset of available ant prey. We identified ant species in salamander diets over a 13 mo period. In the fall season we also compared ants in stomach contents to those available in the surrounding leaf litter to determine if territorial residents of P. cinereus selectively forage on different ant species. We found significant temporal differences in ant species incorporated in the diet of P. cinereus that were consistent with our detailed examination of salamander ant preference in the fall. Our estimates of prey diversity and richness indicate that salamanders consumed a subset of available ant species. Aphaenogaster picea, an abundant species that prefers similar microhabitat characteristics to P. cinereus, made up a majority of the ants in the diet. However, our results indicate that P. cinereus avoids foraging on Myrmica punctiventris, Myrmecina americana, and Lasius alienus, ants that are among the most abundant species in the forested areas of northeastern Ohio where the study was conducted. These species are potentially aggressive and/or chemically defended, reducing their profitability as prey. The striped and unstriped morphs of red-backed salamanders foraged similarly on ant taxa, but the striped morph consumed significantly more ants and was found within territories that contained more ants. Our findings suggest selective foraging may be more common among generalist predators than previously considered, and we propose striped and unstriped morphs may represent a trophic polymorphism in P. cinereus.

AB The Chinese steppe is undergoing a drastic increase in nitrogen (N) deposition, and the precipitation in this region is predicted to increase. However, the response of soil N2O emissions to the coupling changes of precipitation and N deposition in grassland ecosystem has been seldom discussed. A manipulative field experiment was conducted to investigate the individual and interactive effects of precipitation increase and N deposition on soil N2O efflux in semi-arid temperate grassland in Inner Mongolia during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011.The treatments included four N addition levels [20 g N m(-2) y(-1) (N20) 10 gN m(-2) y(-1) (N10), 5 g N m(-2) y(-1) (N5), and a zero-N control (CK)] and two water application levels [natural precipitation for dry (D) and 15% increase of long-term mean annual precipitation for wet (W) treatments]. Results indicated that N and water addition both significantly increased soil N2O effluxes < 0.01). The maximum N2O emissions were observed within 2-3 days after N addition to all treatments, and the N2O effluxes in W treatments were generally higher than in D treatments for the same N input level. For the treatments without N inputs, the N2O emission peak of WCK was 9.8% higher than DCK in 2010. The effect of water addition on N2O emission was more evident when more N fertilizer was applied. For the high N input treatments, the maximum N2O emission of WN20 treatment was 222.6% higher than DN20 in 2010. The changes in N and water availabilities accounted for 91.3% (2010) and 75.6% (2011) of the N2O cumulative efflux variation among different treatments (P < 0.01). The N2O effluxes were significantly affected by the interactive effect between N and water in 2010 and 2011 (P < 0.05). Significant interannual variability in the cumulative N2O emissions was observed, the cumulative N2O emissions in 2011 were significantly lower than those in 2010 even though the summer of 2011 experienced higher rainfall (P < 0.01). Temperature also significantly influenced soil N2O emission apart from the effects of water and N. The temperature change accounted for 41.3% (W) to 47.2% (D) of the temporal variations in N2O emission during the relatively dry 2010. The combined changes in soil moisture, NH4+-N, and temperature accounted for 43.1% (D) to 54.5% (W) of the temporal variations in N2O emission in the relatively wet year of 2011.

AB Background: Although fire is an important factor in determining cerrado vegetation, information about its effect on seed banks is sparse. Cerrado fires are rapidly moving surface fires with low residence time, producing only short-term heating of the uppermost centimetres of the soil. However, the reduction in vegetation cover and deposition of ashes increases the daily amplitude of soil temperature by as much as 35 degrees C.
   Aims: To assess the effect of post-fire daily soil temperatures on the germination of one alien and nine native grasses.
   Methods: Seeds were stored at alternating temperatures of 45 oC/10 oC (10h/14h) for 7d or 30d, simulating two different storage times in the soil seed bank before the onset of the rainy season. Germination was monitored over 30d.
   Results: The variation in temperature had a significant effect on the rate of seed germination in some species, either enhancing it (Aristida setifolia) or reducing it (Schizachyrium sanguineum). Increased storage time reduced the viability of S. sanguineum and Echinolaena inflexa. The invasive Melinis minutiflora had the highest germination rate and it also showed the best toleration of post-fire conditions (45 oC/10 oC) after 7d, with significant reduction in the germination time after 30d.
   Conclusions: Fire seems to have a significant effect in the early life of cerrado grasses. Some native species responded positively to temperature oscillation, suggesting that they should be better prepared to compete with alien species after a fire, with more of their seeds germinating and/or at a more rapid rate.

AB As ecosystem engineers, ants can mediate soil processes and functions by producing biogenic structures. In their mounds, ants not only directly produce CO2 by respiration, but may also indirectly impact soil greenhouse gas emissions by affecting substrate availability and soil physicochemical characteristics. Recent studies focused on overall gas production from ant mounds. However, little is known about mound material respiration and N2O emissions in ant mounds in wetlands. We measured CO2 and N2O emissions from mound soils of three different ant species (Lasius niger Linnaeus, Lasius flavus Fabricius, and Formica candida Smith) and natural marsh soils in a laboratory incubation experiment. On the whole, average soil CO2 and N2O emission rates from ant mounds were significantly higher than from the natural marsh soils. Over the 64 days incubation, the cumulative soil CO2 and N2O production from ant mounds was, respectively, 1.5-3.0 and 1.9-50.2 times higher than from the natural soils. Soil gas emissions from ant mounds were significantly influenced by the specific ant species, with soil CO2 and N2O emissions from L. niger mounds being higher than those from F. candida or L. flavus mound soils. Cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions from ant mound soils were positively correlated with soil clay, total carbon, dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen and NH4+ content. Our laboratory results indicated that mound soil is an important source of CO2 and N2O emission from ant mounds in marshes, making mounds potential "hot spots" for CO2 and N2O emissions. Ants may increase the spatial heterogeneity of soil gas emissions by changing mound soil physicochemical properties, especially carbon and nutrition content, and soil texture. Contributions from ant mound materials should be considered when describing soil C and N cycles and their driving factors in wetland ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We were interested in how forest type and complexity of vegetation influence the diversity of canopy spiders in the rainforest of Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. We sampled spiders by fogging tree canopies in four replicate sites of five different forest types once in the middle of the rainy season, forest types were tropical seasonal rainforest; monsoon forest; mountain rainforest; Aporusa yunnanensis forest; and rubber plantation. From a total of 20 sites and 1000 m(2) projected area we collected 4999 adult spiders of 472 species. Vegetational structure (number of plant forms, such as herbs, shrubs, trees, epiphytes and lianas), tree coverage, shrub coverage, grass coverage, tree height and elevation characterize the environmental conditions in different types of forest. Species richness and mean abundance differed significantly between rubber plantations and natural habitats. Rubber plantations harbored only 42.6-50% of the spider species in the natural forests, and 63.8% of the species in the A. yunnanensis forests. Spider guild composition also differed among forest types. Sheet-line weavers dominated the spider assemblages in natural forests with complex vegetational structure, such as tropical seasonal rainforests and monsoon forests. In contrast, cursorial hunters dominated forests with a more simple structure, such as rubber plantations and A. yunnanensis forest. These results show that intensive management practices in rubber plantations decrease the complexity of the vegetation and, so, strongly influence the diversity and composition of canopy spider assemblages. A lower intensity of management and the restoration of native vegetation may help balance the opposing needs of economic development and biodiversity conservation in this region.

AB Land cover change (LCC) models are used in many studies of human impacts on the environment, but knowing how well these models predict observed changes in the landscape is a challenge. We used nearly three decades of LCC maps to run several LCC simulations to: (1) determine which parameters associated with drivers of LCC (e.g. roads) get selected for which transition (forest to deforested, regeneration to deforested or deforested to regeneration); (2) investigate how the parameter values vary through time with respect to the different activities (e.g. farming); and (3) quantify the influence of choosing a particular time period for model calibration and validation on the performance of LCC models. We found that deforestation of primary forests tends to occur along roads (included in 95 % of models) and outside protected areas (included in all models), reflecting farming establishment. Regeneration tends to occur far from roads (included in 78 % of the models) and inside protected areas (included in 38 % of the models), reflecting the processes of land abandonment. Our temporal analysis of model parameters revealed a degree of variation through time (e.g. effectiveness of protected areas rose by 73 %, p < 0.001), but for the majority of parameters there was no significant trend. The degree to which model predictions agreed with observed change was heavily dependent on the year used for calibration (p < 0.001). The next generation of LCC models may need to embed trends in parameter values to allow the processes determining LCC to change through time and exert their influence on model predictions.

AB We evaluated the roles of gibberellins (GAs) and cytokinins (CKs) in regulation of morphological traits such as biomass allocation and leaf mass per area (LMA). Seedlings of Polygonum cuspidatum Siebold & Zucc. were grown under various light and N availabilities. We exogenously sprayed solutions of gibberellin (GA(3)), benzyl adenine (BA), uniconazole (an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis) or their mixtures on the aboveground parts, and changes in morphological and physiological traits and relative growth rate (RGR) were analysed. Endogenous levels of GAs and CKs in the control plants were also quantified. The morphological traits were changed markedly by the spraying. Biomass allocation to leaves was increased by GA(3) and BA, whereas it decreased by uniconazole. GA(3) decreased LMA, whereas uniconazole increased it. We found close relationships among morphological and physiological traits such as photosynthetic rate and net assimilation rate, and RGR under all growth conditions. Seedlings with high levels of endogenous GAs or CKs and low levels of endogenous GAs or CKs showed morphologies similar to those sprayed with GA(3) or BA, and those sprayed with uniconazole, respectively. Thus we concluded these phytohormones are involved in the regulation of biomass allocation responding to either light or N availability.

AB Understanding community dynamics during early life stages of trees is critical for the prediction of future species composition. In Mediterranean forests drought is a major constraint for regeneration, but likely not the only factor determining the observed spatial patterns. We carried out a sowing experiment aimed at identifying main filters during seed-seedling transition. Specifically, we studied seed fate (predation, fungi infection, emergence) and subsequent seedling performance (mortality during the first summer and overall recruitment after 2 years) of four co-occurring Mediterranean tree species (Quercus ilex, Quercus faginea, Juniperus thurifera, Pinus nigra). We related these processes to the dominant species composition, microhabitat heterogeneity, herb cover and seed mass. The identity of the dominant species in the forest canopy was more important for recruitment than the forest canopy being dominated by conspecific vs. heterospecific species. The patterns we found suggest that biotic interactions such as facilitation (lower mortality under the canopies) and herb competition (during emergence of J. thurifera) are relevant during recruitment. Moreover, our results pointed to ontogenetic conflicts regarding the seed mass of Q. faginea and to density-dependent seed mortality for Q. ilex, rarely described in Mediterranean ecosystems. We propose that our study species experience population growth in forests dominated by heterospecifics where the recruitment success depends on habitat heterogeneity and on moderated biotic and abiotic stresses created by each species. Our results reveal patterns and mechanisms involved in recruitment constraints that add complexity to the well-known drought-related processes in Mediterranean ecosystems.

AB Understanding the behavioral decisions behind animal movement and space use patterns is a key challenge for behavioral ecology. Tools to quantify these patterns from movement and animal-habitat interactions are vital for transforming ecology into a predictive science. This is particularly important in environments undergoing rapid anthropogenic changes, such as the Amazon rainforest, where animals face novel landscapes. Insectivorous bird flocks are key elements of avian biodiversity in the Amazonian ecosystem. Therefore, disentangling and quantifying the drivers behind their movement and space use patterns is of great importance for Amazonian conservation. We use a step selection function (SSF) approach to uncover environmental drivers behind movement choices. This is used to construct a mechanistic model, from which we derive predicted utilization distributions (home ranges) of flocks. We show that movement decisions are significantly influenced by canopy height and topography, but depletion and renewal of resources do not appear to affect movement significantly. We quantify the magnitude of these effects and demonstrate that they are helpful for understanding various heterogeneous aspects of space use. We compare our results to recent analytic derivations of space use, demonstrating that the analytic approximation is only accurate when assuming that there is no persistence in the animals' movement. Our model can be translated into other environments or hypothetical scenarios, such as those given by proposed future anthropogenic actions, to make predictions of spatial patterns in bird flocks. Furthermore, our approach is quite general, so could potentially be used to understand the drivers of movement and spatial patterns for a wide variety of animal communities.

AB Despite the overall trend of worldwide deforestation over recent decades, reforestation has also been found and is expected in developing countries undergoing fast urbanization and agriculture abandonment. The consequences of reforestation on landscape patterns are seldom addressed in the literature, despite their importance in evaluating biodiversity and ecosystem functions. By analyzing long-term land cover changes in Puerto Rico, a rapidly reforested (6 to 42% during 1940-2000) and urbanized tropical island, we detected significantly different patterns of fragmentation and underlying mechanisms among forests, urban areas, and wetlands. Forest fragmentation is often associated with deforestation. However, we also found significant fragmentation during reforestation. Urban sprawl and suburb development have a dominant impact on forest fragmentation. Reforestation mostly occurs along forest edges, while significant deforestation occurs in forest interiors. The deforestation process has a much stronger impact on forest fragmentation than the reforestation process due to their different spatial configurations. In contrast, despite the strong interference of coastal urbanization, wetland aggregation has occurred due to the effective implementation of laws/ regulations for wetland protection. The peak forest fragmentation shifted toward rural areas, indicating progressively more fragmentation in forest interiors. This shift is synchronous with the accelerated urban sprawl as indicated by the accelerated shift of the peak fragmentation index of urban cover toward rural areas, i.e., 1.37% yr(-1) in 1977-1991 versus 2.17% yr(-1) in 1991-2000. Based on the expected global urbanization and the regional forest transition from deforested to reforested, the fragmented forests and aggregated wetlands in this study highlight possible forest fragmentation processes during reforestation in an assessment of biodiversity and functions and suggest effective laws/regulations in land planning to reduce future fragmentation.

AB QuestionsWhat are the temporal and spatial variations of groundwater depth along topographic gradients in Neotropical savannas? Are patterns of tree density and species diversity along topographic gradients in Neotropical savannas controlled by water table depth? Do soil and groundwater nutrient concentrations differ along topographic gradients in Neotropical savannas?
   LocationFire-protected savannas of central Brazil.
   MethodsOver 16mo, we monitored temporal and spatial variations in groundwater levels using automated submersible pressure transducers installed in ten wells located along two topographic gradients (five wells per gradient) of 950m and 1703m in length, representing elevations of 47 and 37m a.s.l., respectively. We located the wells according to changes in vegetation physiognomies from woody savannas at high elevations, to open shrubby grasslands at low elevations. Along each topographic gradient we determined soil and groundwater nutrient concentrations as well as richness, density, basal diameter and height of trees within two plots of 14x14m (392m(2)) adjacent to each well.
   ResultsAlong the two gradients, groundwater levels exhibited larger fluctuations at lower than at higher elevations where the water table was deeper. Richness, density and diversity of trees decreased significantly at lower elevations where soils were waterlogged during the wet season. Soil pH and soil concentrations of carbon, nitrogen and manganese decreased significantly as elevation increased along the topographic gradients, but soil nutrient concentrations of phosphorus, aluminium and iron did not change with elevation. Groundwater samples contained only trace amounts of nutrients and were poorly correlated with elevation along the topographic gradients.
   ConclusionsIn Neotropical savannas, the minimum distance between the soil surface and water table depth (reached during the wet season) and the relatively large fluctuations in groundwater limit tree density and diversity at low elevations as savanna trees cannot cope with extended waterlogging during the wet season and with low soil water availability during the dry season. Thus, variations of tree density and diversity along topographic gradients are more related to spatial and temporal variations in water table depth than to soil and groundwater nutrient variations in Neotropical savannas.

AB While metacommunities of bacterioplankton are generally considered to be structured primarily by local environmental conditions (through species sorting), additional ecological processes such as dispersal limitation, neutral dynamics or mass effects can influence community structure. Under the mass effects paradigm, continuous or large influxes of organisms, not self-maintaining in the target environment, affect community structure. We used communities of freshwater bacterioplankton to quantify the outcome of mass effects and species sorting in a laboratory experiment in which we exchanged cells between two communities from contrasting ponds (eutrophic and mesotrophic) at a rate of 0.025, 0.25, 2.5 and 12.5% of the cells present per day. When cells were exchanged only once on day 1 of the experiment, the reciprocally exchanged communities in all dispersal treatments remained as divergent, after 20days, as the unexchanged control communities, reflecting strong species sorting and no strong influences of dispersal limitation and neutral dynamics on the observed bacterioplankton. Under daily cell exchange, however, community similarity between the reciprocally exchanged communities increased significantly with increasing dispersal rate, indicating an increasing influence of mass effects relative to species sorting. The responses differed at the level of community composition and ecosystem processes, and depended on pond identity. At the community level, a daily exchange of 2.5% was necessary to increase community similarity compared with the unexchanged controls, while at the ecosystem process level (Biolog GN2 metabolic profiles), a daily exchange rate of 0.25% was sufficient. Mass effects can evidently overcome species sorting in freshwater bacterioplankton, but only under relatively high dispersal rates that are unlikely to occur in nature among habitats without a direct hydrological connection. Mass effects in the freshwater bacterioplankton acted differently at the community composition and ecosystem process level.

AB Premise of the study: Adansonia digitata L. is one of the most important indigenous fruit trees of mainland Africa. Despite its significance for subsistence and income generation of local communities, little is known about the genetic and morphological variability of East African populations of A. digitata, including those of Sudan. The aim of the current study, therefore, was to analyze genetic and morphological variability of different baobab populations in Kordofan, Sudan and to estimate the effect of human intervention on genetic differentiation and diversity.
   Methods: A total of 306 trees were randomly sampled from seven spatially separated locations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan, to cover a wide range of differing environmental gradients and management regimes ('homesteads' and 'wild'). Genetic analyses were conducted using nine microsatellite markers. Because of the tetraploid nature of A. digitata, different approaches were applied to estimate patterns of genetic diversity. Investigations were completed by measurements of dendrometric and fruit morphological characters.
   Key results: Genetic diversity was balanced and did not differ between locations or management regimes, although tendencies of higher diversity in 'homesteads' were observed. A Bayesian cluster approach detected two distinct gene pools in the sample set, mainly caused by one highly diverse population close to a main road. The variability of tree characters and fruit morphometries was high, and signifi cantly different between locations.
   Conclusions: Results indicated a rather positive effect with human intervention. The observed populations provide a promising gene pool and likely comprise ecotypes well-adapted to environmental conditions at the northern distribution range of the species, which should be considered in conservation and management programs.

AB Along the coast of Chile, fisheries targeting the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas, commonly named "loco", were highly valuable until the end of the 80s when catches declined significantly. Since the late 90s, a management plan based on territorial-user-rights areas has been implemented, with limited effect on stock recovery. More effective loco conservation and management is impeded by lack of information regarding connectivity via larval dispersal between these individually-managed areas. To develop a regional view of loco connectivity, we integrate loco life history information into a biophysical, individual-based larval dispersal model. This model is used to evaluate scales of loco connectivity and seasonality in connectivity patterns, as well as to partition the coast into largely disconnected subpopulations using a recently developed connectivity-matrix clustering algorithm. We find mean dispersal distances ranging from 170 to 220 km depending on release depth of larvae and planktonic larval duration. Settlement success levels depend quantitatively on the physical and biological processes included in the model, but connectivity patterns remain qualitatively similar. Model estimates of settlement success peak for larval release dates in late austral autumn, consistent with field results and with favorable conditions for larval coastal retention due to weak upwelling during austral autumn. Despite the relatively homogeneous Chilean coastline, distinct subpopulations with minimal connectivity between them are readily identifiable. Barriers to connectivity that are robust to changes in model configuration exist at 23 degrees S and 29 degrees S latitudes. These zones are all associated with important headlands and embayments of the Chilean coast. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Understanding climate effects on plant-soil interactions in terrestrial ecosystems remains challenging due to the fact that floristic composition covaries with climate, particularly along rainfall gradients. It is difficult to separate effects of precipitation per se from those mediated indirectly through changes in species composition. As such, afforestation (the intentional planting of woody species) in terrestrial ecosystems provides an ecological opportunity to assess the relative importance of climate and vegetation controls on ecosystem processes.
   We investigated the impacts of 35years of afforestation on ecosystem N dynamics, in ecosystems ranging from arid shrub-steppe to closed-canopy forest in Patagonia, Argentina. Sites of natural vegetation and adjacent sites planted with a single exotic species, Pinus ponderosa, were identified in five precipitation regimes along a continuous gradient of 250-2200mm mean annual precipitation (MAP). We evaluated C and N parameters of vegetation and soil, as well as natural abundance of C-13 and N-15 in leaves, roots, ectomycorrhizae (EcM) and soils.
   In natural vegetation, most leaf traits (%N, C:N ratios, leaf mass per area, delta N-15 values) demonstrated strong significant relationships with MAP, while these relationships were nearly absent in afforested sites. In addition, the EcM of native southern beech and pine trees were significantly enriched in N-15 relative to leaves at all sites where they were present. While soil C and N pools in both vegetation types increased with MAP, overall pool sizes were significantly reduced in afforested sites.
   Synthesis. Observed relationships between leaf traits and precipitation in natural vegetation may be driven largely by shifts in species composition and plant-soil interactions, rather than direct effects of precipitation. Our results suggest that a change in the species composition of the dominant vegetation is sufficient to alter C and N cycling independently of climate constraints: pine afforestation homogenized N dynamics across sites spanning an order of magnitude of MAP. These results highlight the important control of ectomycorrhizal associations in affecting C and N dynamics. Additionally, they serve to demonstrate that altering natural species composition alone is sufficient to cause large, detectable impacts on N turnover independently of direct climate effects.

AB This study focuses on the potential impacts of large-scale land use and land cover changes (LUCC) on surface temperature from a global perspective. As important types of LUCC, urbanization, deforestation, cultivated land reclamation, and grassland degradation have effects on the climate, the potential changes of the surface temperature caused by these four types of large-scale LUCC from 2010 to 2050 are downscaled, and this issue analyzed worldwide along with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The first case study presents some evidence of the effects of future urbanization on surface temperature in the Northeast megalopolis of the United States of America (USA). In order to understand the potential climatological variability caused by future forest deforestation and vulnerability, we chose Brazilian Amazon region as the second case study. The third selected region in India as a typical region of cultivated land reclamation where the possible climatic impacts are explored. In the fourth case study, we simulate the surface temperature changes caused by future grassland degradation in Mongolia. Results show that the temperature in built-up area would increase obviously throughout the four land types. In addition, the effects of all four large-scale LUCC on monthly average temperature change would vary from month to month with obviously spatial heterogeneity.

AB Invasive plants generally escape from specialist herbivores of their native ranges but may experience serious damage from generalists. As a result, invasive plants may evolve increased resistance to generalists and tolerance to damage. To test these hypotheses, we carried out a common garden experiment comparing 15 invasive populations with 13 native populations of Chromolaena odorata, including putative source populations identified with molecular methods and binary choice feeding experiments using three generalist herbivores. Plants from invasive populations of C. odorata had both higher resistance to three generalists and higher tolerance to simulated herbivory (shoot removal) than plants from native populations. The higher resistance of plants from invasive populations was associated with higher leaf C content and densities of leaf trichomes and glandular scales, and lower leaf N and water contents. Growth costs were detected for tolerance but not for resistance, and plants from invasive populations of C. odorata showed lower growth costs of tolerance. Our results suggest that invasive plants may evolve to increase both resistance to generalists and tolerance to damage in introduced ranges, especially when the defense traits have low or no fitness costs. Greater defenses in invasive populations may facilitate invasion by C. odorata by reducing generalist impacts and increasing compensatory growth after damage has occurred.

AB Liverworts are non-vascular cryptogamic plants with wide geographic distributions due to their capacity to disperse their spores over long distances, although they have no epidermal cuticle, sensitive to external environmental conditions, found only in very specific microenvironments - and are therefore widely used as bioindicators. We evaluated the floristic composition of liverworts in localities located in different Atlantic Forest vegetation types in southeastern Brazil to address the following questions: Is the liverwort flora distributed uniformly or randomly, or does it demonstrate environmental niche restrictions at regional scales? If the distribution of liverworts is deterministic, do geoclimatic variables act as environmental filters for this flora? Can liverwort species be considered bioindicators of the different Atlantic Forest vegetation types? We undertook floristic surveys in 26 localities to evaluate the beta diversity of the liverwort flora and its correlation with environmental gradients (geoclimatic variables) using multivariate analyses and the Mantel Test. Ordination and classification methods indicated elevated beta diversity in a deterministic distribution of the liverwort flora along the Atlantic coast of southeastern Brazil. Altitude was significantly associated with the first axis of the CCA, demonstrating a floristic gradient between Lowland Forests and High Montane Forests and "Campos de Altitude". Five floristic groups were identified and 34 species could be considered bioindicators. The principal geoclimatic variables that explained the floristic groupings of liverwort species were altitude, temperature, and precipitation. The prediction that liverwort plants demonstrated environmentally determined distributions was confirmed by the Mantel Test (rM 0.557; p < 0.0001). Our results support the idea that the liverwort flora of the coastal Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil comprises part of a regional pool of species whose establishment and survival are determined by abiotic filters acting in those habitats. The low similarities between localities and the high numbers of indicator species suggest that the liverwort vegetation has a deterministic distribution at the regional level which corroborates their use as bioindicators of vegetation types and of environmental conditions. Although species distributions are principally determined by environmental niches, geographical distances (dispersal limitation) are important in regions such as oceanic islands and coastal mountains.

AB Uncertainties surrounding vegetation response to increased disturbance rates associated with climate change remains a major global change issue for Amazonian forests. Additionally, turnover rates computed as the average of mortality and recruitment rates in the western Amazon basin are doubled when compared to the central Amazon, and notable gradients currently exist in specific wood density and aboveground biomass (AGB) between these two regions. This study investigates the extent to which the variation in disturbance regimes contributes to these regional gradients. To address this issue, we evaluated disturbance-recovery processes in a central Amazonian forest under two scenarios of increased disturbance rates using first ZELIG-TROP, a dynamic vegetation gap model which we calibrated using long-term inventory data, and second using the Community Land Model (CLM), a global land surface model that is part of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Upon doubling the mortality rate in the central Amazon to mirror the natural disturbance regime in the western Amazon of similar to 2% mortality, the two regions continued to differ in multiple forest processes. With the inclusion of elevated natural disturbances, at steady state, AGB significantly decreased by 41.9% with no significant difference between modeled AGB and empirical AGB from the western Amazon data sets (104 vs. 107 Mg C ha(-1), respectively). However, different processes were responsible for the reductions in AGB between the models and empirical data set. The empirical data set suggests that a decrease in wood density is a driver leading to the reduction in AGB. While decreased stand basal area was the driver of AGB loss in ZELIG-TROP, a forest attribute that does not significantly vary across the Amazon Basin. Further comparisons found that stem density, specific wood density, and basal area growth rates differed between the two Amazonian regions. Last, to help quantify the impacts of increased disturbances on the climate and earth system, we evaluated the fidelity of tree mortality and disturbance in CLM. Similar to ZELIG-TROP, CLM predicted a net carbon loss of 49.9 %, with an insignificant effect on aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP). Decreased leaf area index (LAI) was the driver of AGB loss in CLM, another forest attribute that does not significantly vary across the Amazon Basin, and the temporal variability in carbon stock and fluxes was not replicated in CLM. Our results suggest that (1) the variability between regions cannot be entirely explained by the variability in disturbance regime, but rather potentially sensitive to intrinsic environmental factors; or (2) the models are not accurately simulating all tropical forest characteristics in response to increased disturbances.

AB Plant biodiversity in the tropics is threatened by intense anthropogenic pressures. Deforestation, habitat degradation, habitat fragmentation, overexploitation, invasive species, pollution, global climate change, and the synergies among them have had a major impact on biodiversity. This review paper provides a brief, yet comprehensive and broad, overview of the main threats to tropical plant biodiversity and how they differ from threats in temperate regions. The Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, an international program with 16 global targets set for 2020 aimed at understanding, conserving, and using sustainably the world's plant biodiversity, is then used as a framework to explore efforts in assessing and managing tropical plant conservation in a changing world. Progress on 13 of the 16 outcome-oriented targets of the Strategy is explored at the pantropical scale. Within each target, I address current challenges in assessing and managing tropical plant biodiversity, identify key questions that should be addressed, and suggest ways for how these challenges might be overcome.

AB Pervasive increases in biomass and stem density of tropical forests have been recorded in recent decades, potentially having significant implications for carbon storage, biodiversity and ecosystem function. This trend is widely considered to be the result of multidecadal and global scale growth stimulation arising from increases in atmospheric CO2 and temperatures. However, contrasting patterns have been recorded across the tropics, and the role of disturbance in driving biomass and stem dynamics has been highlighted as an alternative explanation. Australian tropical forests have rarely been assessed in pan-tropical analyses of long-term dynamics. We have measured recruitment, mortality and growth in 20 permanent plots in tropical forest across north-eastern Australia since 1971. We assess changes in plot level above-ground live biomass (AGB) and stem density, and compare our results with those documented over a similar time frame in the neo-tropics. No significant increase in AGB was found over the 40-year time period. Above-ground biomass tended to increase over the first two decades of the monitoring period and decrease in the final two with gain terms (growth and recruitment) lower than loss terms (mortality) by the final decade (2000s). Stem density significantly decreased over the monitoring period with recruitment consistently lower than mortality. There was large variation in individual plots in their pattern of AGB and stem density changes over time which was consistent with the response of each plot to known disturbance events, including cyclones, pathogen outbreaks and drought. Our results are in contrast to those described for neo-tropical plots which appear to show a widespread pattern of increasing growth and stem density.Synthesis. The trend towards increasing biomass and stem density of tropical forests described for the neo-tropics does not necessarily reflect patterns in areas of the tropics where large-scale natural disturbances are relatively frequent. Australian tropical rain forests are either not increasing in productivity in response to global change, or cyclones and other regional and local mechanisms of change mask any evidence of larger-scale patterns.

AB Sustainable management strategies for tropical forest ecosystems require a detailed understanding of the distribution of tropical forest species, limitations on distribution, as well as occurrence patterns in the absence of limitations. In the Americas, many tropical palms (Arecaceae) are locally abundant keystone species that provide a number of non-timber forest products. Here we focus on 10 such species (Aphandra natalia, Attalea phalerata, Euterpe oleracea, Iriartea deltoidea, Mauritia flexousa, Oenocarpus bataua, Phytelephas aequatorialis, Phytelephas macrocarpa, and Phytelephas seemannii) found in western South America. This study aimed to determine: (i) what variables control potential species distribution, (ii) whether their distribution is spatially constrained and if so, (iii) how their potential ranges compare to their actual ranges. We built species distribution models using Maxent software with three groups of predictor variables: C (climatic), N (non-climatic environmental), S (spatial), and combinations thereof: C, CN and CNS. The CNS predictor variable combination gave superior predictive ability based on median Area Under the Curve (AUC) values and was consistent with available range maps. In contrast, individual C and CN predictor variables gave inferior AUC values and showed less similarity to range maps. We concluded that the CNS model that combined climatic, non-climatic, and spatial variables best represented the actual distribution of the 10 palm species, whereas C and CN models approached their potential distribution. Precipitation during the driest quarter and annual precipitation were the most important predictors of the potential distribution, whereas temperature of the coldest month, soil, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were less important. We found that the actual distributions of palm species were spatially constrained, and that the spatial variables largely coincided with the dispersal barriers of the Andean Cordillera and past climatic fluctuations. The estimated potential range varied from nearly equal to the actual range, to up to 0.55 x 10(6) km(2) (55.1 x 10(6) ha) larger than the actual range, depending on model, threshold settings, and species. We thus concluded that current palm resources in the forests of western South America have major potential for ecological expansion. These results are relevant to current palm management and resource conservation planning, as well as future strategies that will have to address climate change and increasing human disturbance.

AB Premise of research. African grass communities are dominated by two distinct functional types: tall, caespitose bunch grasses and short, spreading lawn grasses. Functional type coexistence has been explained by differences in defoliation tolerance, because lawn grasses occur in intensively grazed areas while bunch grasses are less associated with heavy grazing. If different responses to tissue loss explain their distribution, expectations are that biomass production and leaf-level physiology will be negatively impacted in bunch relative to lawn grasses.
   Methodology. We tested the influence of defoliation on three lawn and three bunch grasses from Tanzania and South Africa by quantifying growth and measuring physiological response of these grasses to simulated herbivory in a glasshouse experiment. Specifically, we measured photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen, and leaf pigment concentrations in leaves of bunch and lawn grasses that were clipped or unclipped.
   Pivotal results. In contrast to our expectations, clipped lawn and bunch grasses did not differ in photosynthesis, leaf nitrogen, or biomass production, and both lawn and bunch grasses upregulated photosynthesis in response to clipping. However, defoliated bunch grasses had higher rates of stomatal conductance and transpiration compared with defoliated lawn grasses. Also, leaf carotenoid concentrations increased in response to clipping for both functional types but much more in bunch than in lawn grasses. An analysis of leaf-level physiological relationships with structural equation modeling showed that lawn and bunch grasses exert control over carbon gain in different ways. In bunch grasses, net carbon gain was associated with leaf-level structural properties (LDMC and SLA) that varied in response to defoliation, while in lawn grasses, increased carbon gain was the result of increased leaf [N] subsequent to defoliation.
   Conclusions. The varied responses of lawn and bunch grasses to defoliation appear to arise from their different investments in defense and carbon assimilation subsequent to defoliation. Bunch grasses invest relatively more in carotenoid production, likely as a mechanism to enhance regrowth and protect costly leaves from photodamage. Moreover, bunch grasses maintain efficient carbon assimilation by structural adjustments in leaves (decreasing LDMC subsequent to defoliation), while lawn grasses maintain efficient water use by increasing leaf [N] subsequent to defoliation. Thus, we conclude that a key difference between lawn and bunch grasses is not defoliation tolerance per se but physiological adaptations that constrain them to environments with different moisture availability subsequent to defoliation.

AB Aim Current conservation biology suggests that across ecological time-scales specialist species existing in the recent past have left on average fewer descendant populations today than generalist species. Conversely, the speciation literature suggests that on an evolutionary time-scale specialists leave as many or more descendant lineages as generalists, i.e. they have high rates of global diversification. This begs the question: which of these two processes has more influence on the regional scale, i.e. do specialists leave more or fewer descendants than generalists within a region? Location The flora of the Netherlands. Methods We quantified niche volume of 707 plant species from coexistence data and ecological indicator values and used sister taxon comparisons to compare specialist and generalist sister taxa for the relative numbers of descendants across three temporal scales: ecological, microevolutionary and macroevolutionary. Results We show, first, that specialist species are more likely to be currently declining, i.e. to leave only few descendant populations. Second, specialists are less likely to be currently diversifying into intra-specific taxa. Finally, most specialist clades left fewer descendant species within a region than their generalist sister clades. These results were consistent across sublineages, unbiased by geographic sampling of lineages and environments, and held after accounting for species life histories. Differences between specialist and generalist sister clades increased with clade age, suggesting that they reflect differences in rates at which specialists left descendants (rather than differences in ecological limits to the numbers of specialists and generalists). Main conclusions Specialists left only few descendants within a region (i.e. the Netherlands), both at ecological, microevolutionary and macroevolutionary scales. While specialists may leave numerous evolutionary descendants at a global scale, these might be absent from most regions. Humans, by threatening specialist species, may hence further accelerate biotic homogenization with descendants of generalist lineages proliferating within regions while specialist lineages disappear.

AB We now live in a world dominated by humans (the Anthropocene), whose activities on Earth are resulting in new habitats and new environmental conditions, including climate change. To many, the Anthropocene is an era of environmental doom that unless reversed, will result in catastrophic reductions in biodiversity. An alternate view is that the biota will adjust to the new environmental conditions and through processes of species mixing and self-organization will form sustainable novel communities of organisms. Using examples from Puerto Rico, I discuss the conditions that lead to novel forest formation and the characteristics of these forests, including their species composition. Novel forests include native tree and animal species as well as significant numbers of introduced and naturalized species. These introduced species dominate forest stands, and their dominance is not incompatible with the regeneration of native species. I propose that these types of ecosystems might represent the natural response of the biota to the Anthropocene.

AB We analyzed the changes in composition, diversity and structure of trees and shrubs along a successional gradient in southwest Mexico. Early stages were dominated by typical pioneer species but species of mature forests were present throughout the chronosequence, and therefore the species plant distribution between stages may be explained by the initial floristic composition model. Because sites from all stages had similar number of species, our study does not support the intermediate levels of disturbance hypothesis. Contrary to the patterns observed in other dry forests, the mature stages presented a relatively simple structure complexity compared to that of intermediate forests. This resulted from a few dominant species which are usually present in mature forests with some degree of perturbation. According to the polyclimax hypothesis, diversity of the mature forests appears to be influenced by local soil conditions, microclimates and biotic factors. Our study supports this idea because local conditions vary between sites and the dominant species of the late stages were different between stands. The conservation and management plans should be directed to different successional stages and not only to single patches in order to ensure the conservation of regional biodiversity.

AB Early vigour is an important objective in rice breeding. A previous study reported strong positive effects of development rate (DR, 1/phyllochron) on early growth vigour in two rice panels. This study provided a model-based analysis of DR effects on rice early vigour and underlying sourcesink processes during exponential growth, using Ecomeristem model. Relevant model parameters were fitted to panel observations, and their effect on early vigour was quantified. A sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the impact of model parameters on simulation outputs. The simulated behaviour of a population of virtual genotypes defined by the combination of model parameter values was compared with that of diversity panel. Finally, a simulation experiment was conducted to analyse sourcesink adjustments constituting early vigour across a range of DR. Parameters governing structural development, particularly DR, had greater impact on vigour than parameters for resource acquisition. High DR was associated with rapid dry weight accumulation and low transitory carbohydrate reserves in both real and virtual populations. Genotypic DR is thus a major driver of early vigour in rice under stress-free conditions. To evaluate traits contributing to vigour, the capacity of crop models to simulate interactions between structural development and resource acquisition must be improved.

AB The area of primary forest is decreasing throughout the tropical world and being replaced by secondary forests. Many policy makers regard these secondary forests as being unworthy of protection since they are too degraded to have any commercial or conservation value. Because of this many are now being cleared for alternative land uses. But there are a variety of types of secondary forest differing in the extent to which they have been disturbed, the frequency at which this has taken place and, because of their position in the landscape, in their capacity to be recolonized from species from intact primary forests. This means that some secondary forests may not be as degraded as is supposed and many may have the capacity to recover if protected from further disturbances. This study reports on a comparison between remnant forest, and frequently and infrequently disturbed secondary forests in Lao PDR. The frequently disturbed forest had been cleared for shifting cultivation 3-5 times in the past 30 years while the infrequently disturbed sites had been cleared only once. The study found comparatively small differences in the occurrence of primary forest species in these two types of secondary forest and that they still contained a large proportion of primary forest tree species despite the disturbance history. This apparent resilience may be due to the capacity of many species to resprout after disturbances and their ability to recolonize across the present agricultural matrix. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB 1. Perennial plants often endure chronic loss of leaf area due to recurrent physical damage, herbivory and, for species used as non-timber forest products, due to leaf harvesting. However, little is known about functional and demographic resilience (extent and speed of recovery) of plants subjected to varying levels of chronic defoliation. 2. We used a dioecious, understorey palm (Chamaedorea elegans) to evaluate temporal trajectories and rates of recovery of leaf functional traits and vital rates (survival, growth and reproduction) after being subjected to experimental chronic defoliation regimes. 3. Pristine populations of mature C. elegans, categorized by gender (male and female), were subjected to five defoliation levels (0%, 33%, 50%, 66% or 100% of newly produced leaves) every 6 months over a period of 3 years (19972000). To evaluate recovery from defoliation, surviving palms were monitored for 3 years after the cessation of the defoliation treatment (20002003). We recorded leaf functional traits (leaf persistence, leaf production rate, leaf size and leaf area) and annual rates of mortality, growth and reproduction. 4. Cumulative effects of chronic defoliation concomitantly reduced leaf traits, survival, growth and reproduction, and this effect was stronger in female than in male palms, independent of plant size. Recovery from defoliation was faster in males than in females, but proceeded gradually overall. Survival increased first, followed by growth, while reproductive traits showed the slowest recovery rate. Recovery was independent of plant size. Notably, 3 years after defoliation treatment, the standing leaf area and probability of reproduction had not recovered to pre-defoliation levels. Additionally, we found that the occurrence of a severe drought in the first year (2000) after defoliation ceased led to decreased survival, growth and reproduction and the ability of plants to recover from defoliation. 5. Synthesis. Chronic defoliation reduces fitness components of C. elegans palms differentially between genders. Recovery is gradual and is slower and less complete in females compared with males. The lower level of resilience to chronic defoliation shown by female plants may have profound consequences for the dynamics and genetic variability of populations of tropical understorey plants undergoing prolonged defoliation. Such effects may be aggravated by severe drought episodes that are expected to increase in frequency according to global climate change predictions.

AB The inclusion of carbon stock enhancements under the REDD+ framework is likely to drive a rapid increase in biosequestration projects that seek to remove carbon from the atmosphere through rehabilitation of degraded rainforests. Concern has recently been expressed, however, that management interventions to increase carbon stocks may conflict with biodiversity conservation. Focusing on a large-scale rainforest rehabilitation project in northern Borneo, we examine the broad impacts of selective logging and subsequent carbon enhancement across a wide range of invertebrate fauna by comparing the abundance of 28 higher-level taxa within two separate rainforest strata (leaf-litter and understorey) across unlogged, naturally-regenerating and rehabilitated forest. We additionally assess changes in functional composition by examining responses of different feeding guilds. Responses of individual taxa to forest management were idiosyncratic but logging resulted in more than a 20% increase in total invertebrate abundance, with fewer than 20% of taxa in either stratum having significantly lower abundance in logged forest. Rehabilitation resulted in a marked reduction in abundance, particularly among leaf-litter detritivores, but overall, there were much smaller differences between unlogged and rehabilitated forest than between unlogged and naturally regenerating forest in both total invertebrate abundance and the abundances of different feeding guilds. This applied to both strata with the exception of understorey herbivores, which were more abundant in rehabilitated forest than elsewhere. These results support previous data for birds suggesting that carbon stock enhancement in these forests has only limited adverse effects on biodiversity, but with some impacts on abundance within particular guilds.

AB The western Amazon, a relatively remote and unstudied region, is experiencing unprecedented levels of oil and gas exploration. Despite the widespread use of seismic reflection technology for oil and gas exploration, no studies have investigated the response of primate populations to this disturbance in the Amazon. We conducted distance sampling along transects in pristine, unhunted lowland rain forest inside a large oil concession (Block 39) in the northern Peruvian Amazon with ongoing 2D seismic exploration. We aimed to investigate seismic exploration effects on local primate abundance, with a particular focus on the region's most endangered primates, lowland woolly monkeys (Lagothrix poeppigii) and white-bellied spider monkeys (Ateles belzebuth). We sampled transects before the arrival of exploration crews (control) and during the seismic operation (disturbance) and compared primate counts using mixed-effect models. We confirmed the presence of nine species of primates along sampled transects. Abundance of primate groups (species pooled) was not different between the control and disturbance period, yet abundance of primate individuals was significantly lower in the disturbance period. Although we encountered groups of Ateles belzebuth equally often during the control and disturbance periods, overall counts of individuals of this species were lower during the disturbance period owing to lower subgroup sizes. This suggests this species may have responded, at least temporarily, with localized spatial avoidance, and that it may be particularly sensitive to human disturbance regardless of hunting pressure. Our overall density estimate for Lagothrix poeppigii (30.6/km(2)) approaches the highest reported for the species. Although the relatively temporary nature of 2D seismic exploration may limit its effect on primate species, our data indicate some species may respond more negatively than others.

AB (Influence of edaphic variables on the floristic composition and structure of the tree-shrub vegetation in typical and rocky outcrop cerrado areas in Serra Negra, Goias State, Brazil). The present study analyzed the influence of edaphic variables on the floristic compositions and structures of the arboreal and shrub vegetation of typical cerrado (TC) and rocky outcrop cerrado (RC) communities in the Serra Negra mountain range in Piranhas Municipality, Goias State, Brazil. Ten 20 x 50 m plots were established in each community, and all individuals with minimum diameters >= 5 cm measured at 30 cm above soil level were sampled. Composite soil samples were collected at 0-20 cm depths in each plot for physical and chemical analyses. The proportions of above-ground rock cover work also estimated in each RC plot. A total of 2,009 individuals (83 species, 69 genera, and 34 families) were recorded. Qualea parviflora was the only species consistently among the 10 most structurally important taxa in both communities, and was considered a generalist species. The observed and estimated species richnesses were greater in RC than in TC, although plant basal areas and heights did not differ between them. There were positive correlations between rock cover x plant density and rock cover x basal areas. TWINSPAN and PCA analysis separated the TC and RC plots, and three RC habitat specialist species (Wunderlichia mirabilis, Norantea guianensis, and Tibouchina papyrus) were identified. Soil variables were found to have greater effects on the species compositions of the TC and RC sites than the geographic distances between sampling plots. According to CCA analysis, the exclusive (or more abundant species) of each community were correlated with soil variables, and these variables therefore determined the selection of some species and influenced the differentiation of the vegetation structures of the communities studied.

AB The enhancement in photosynthesis at elevated concentration of carbon dioxide level than the ambient level existing in the atmosphere is widely known. However, many of the earlier studies were based on instantaneous responses of plants grown in pots. The availability of field chambers for growing trees, and long-term exposure studies of tree species to elevated carbon dioxide, has changed much of our views on carbon dioxide acting as a fertiliser. Several tree species showed acclimation or even down-regulation of photosynthetic responses while a few of them showed higher photosynthesis and better growth responses. Whether elevated levels of carbon dioxide can serve as a fertilizer in a changed climate scenario still remains an unresolved question. Forest-Air-Carbon dioxide-Enrichment (FACE) sites monitored at several locations have shown lately, that the acclimation or down regulation as reported in chamber studies is not as wide-spread as originally thought. FACE studies predict that there could be an increase of 23-28% productivity of trees at least till 2050. However, the increase in global temperature could also lead to increased respiration, and limitation of minerals in the soil could lead to reduced responses in growth. Elevated carbon dioxide induces partial closure of leaf stomata, which could lead to reduced transpiration and more economical use of water by the trees. Even if the carbon dioxide acts as a fertilizer, the responses are more pronounced only in young trees. And if there are variations in species responses to growth due to elevated carbon dioxide, only some species are going to dominate the natural vegetation. This will have serious implications on the biodiversity and the structure of the ecosystems. This paper reviews the research done on trees using elevated CO2 and tries to draw conclusions based on different methods used for the study. It also discusses the possible functional variations in some tree species due to climate change.

AB The neutral theory of biodiversity provides a powerful framework for modeling macroecological patterns and interpreting species assemblages. However, there remain several unsolved problems, including the effect of relaxing the assumption of strict neutrality to allow for empirically observed variation in vital rates and the 'problem of time'-empirically measured coexistence times are much shorter than the prediction of the strictly neutral drift model. Here, we develop a nearly neutral model that allows for differential birth and death rates of species. This model provides an approach to study species coexistence away from strict neutrality.
   Based on Moran's neutral model, which assumes all species in a community have the same competitive ability and have identical birth and death rates, we developed a model that includes birth-death trade-off but excludes speciation. This model describes a wide range of asymmetry from strictly neutral to nearly neutral to far from neutral and is useful for analyzing the effect of drift on species coexistence. Specifically, we analyzed the effects of the birth-death trade-off on the time and probability of species coexistence and quantified the loss of biodiversity (as measured by Simpson's diversity) due to drift by varying species birth and death rates.
   We found (i) a birth-death trade-off operating as an equalizing force driven by demographic stochasticity promotes the coexistence of nearly neutral species. Species near demographic trade-offs (i.e. fitness equivalence) can coexist even longer than that predicted by the strictly neutral model; (ii) the effect of birth rates on species coexistence is very similar to that of death rates, but their compensatory effects are not completely symmetric; (iii) ecological drift over time produces a march to fixation. Trade-off-based neutral communities lose diversity more slowly than the strictly neutral community, while non-neutral communities lose diversity much more rapidly; and (iv) nearly neutral systems have substantially shorter time of coexistence than that of neutral systems. This reduced time provides a promising solution to the problem of time.

AB Fragmentation of natural habitats is one of the main causes of the loss of biodiversity. However, all plants do not respond to habitat fragmentation in the same way due to differences in species traits. We studied the effect of patch size and isolation on the biodiversity of vegetation in the mixed-oak forests in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. The aim was to evaluate whether all the growth-forms of vegetation are equally affected by forest fragmentation in order to improve the management strategies to restore this type of vegetation.
   This study has shown that the effect of the area and spatial isolation of the patches was not the same for the different growth-forms. Fragmentation had a mainly negative effect on the richness and diversity of forest specialist species, especially ferns and herbaceous growth-forms. Moreover, the presence and/or cover of woodland herbaceous species (such as Lamiastrum galeobdolon and Helleborus viridis) and of woodland ferns (namely Asplenium adiantum-nigrum, Asplenium trichomanes, Polystichum setiferum, Dryopteris affinis) were negatively affected by patch size, possibly due to the reduction of habitat quality. These species have been replaced by more generalist species (such as Cardamine pratensis, Cirsium sp., Pulmonaria longifolia or Rumex acetosella) in small patches. Patch isolation had a negative effect on the presence of forest specialist species (namely, L galeobdolon, Frangula alnus, Hypericurn androsaemum, A. adiantum-nigrum and Athyrium filix-femina) and favored colonization by more generalist species such as Cirsium sp., Calluna vulgaris, Erica arborea or Ulex sp. Thus, in this region special attention should be paid to the conservation of forest specialist species, especially ferns and herbs. In conservation policy focused on forest specialist species, the most valuable species in forest ecosystems, conservation of large forest areas should be promoted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The parties to the Montreal Protocol are informed by three panels of experts. One of these is the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP), which deals with two focal issues. The first focus is the effects of increased UV radiation on human health, animals, plants, biogeochemistry, air quality, and materials. The second focus is on interactions between UV radiation and global climate change and how these may affect humans and the environment. When considering the effects of climate change, it has become clear that processes resulting in changes in stratospheric ozone are more complex than believed previously. As a result of this, human health and environmental problems will be longer-lasting and more regionally variable. Like the other panels, the EEAP produces a detailed report every four years; the most recent was published in 2010 (Photochem. Photobiol Sci., 2011, 10, 173-300). In the years in between, the EEAP produces less detailed and shorter progress reports, which highlight and assess the significance of developments in key areas of importance to the parties. The next full quadrennial report will be published in 2014-2015.

AB Amazonia became a target area for Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) initiatives in deforestation. We analysed the implementation of a PES scheme in Acre (Brazil) by taking into account land use heterogeneity in an agricultural frontier. Justified by the modernisation of deforestation control policies, the programme promotes agricultural intensification through fire-free practices. In this way, the PES tends to focus on long-established settlements, where farmers are wealthier and the landscape is dominated by pasture. Agricultural intensification may be adapted to foster reforestation. In order to curb deforestation a specific policy is needed for targeting remote areas where initial stages of deforestation usually take place. By promoting only land sparing, PES programmes in Amazonia may lose sight of their socio-economic and environmental objectives due to limited spatial targeting.

AB Zhang, C., Zhao, Y., Zhao, X. & Gadow, K. v. 2012. Species-habitat associations in a northern temperate forest in China. Silva Fennica 46(4): 501-519. This contribution identifies species-habitat associations in a temperate forest in north-eastern China, based on the assumption that habitats are spatially autocorrelated and species are spatially aggregated due to limited seed dispersal. The empirical observations were obtained in a large permanent experimental area covering 660 x 320 m. The experimental area was subdivided into four habitat types using multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis. According to an indicator species analysis, 38 of the 47 studied species were found to be significant indicators of the MRT habitat types. The relationships between species richness and topographic variables were found to be scale-dependent, while the great majority of the species shows distinct habitat-dependence. There are 188 potential species-habitat associations, and 114 of these were significantly positive or negative based on habitat randomization. We identified 139 significant associations using a species randomization. A habitat is not a closed system it may be both, either a sink or a source. Therefore, additional to the randomization, the Poisson Cluster Model (PCM) was applied. PCM considers the spatial autocorrelation of species and habitats, and thus appears to be more realistic than the traditional randomization processes. It identified only 37 associations that were significant. In conclusion, the deviation from the random process, i.e. the high degree of species spatial mingling may be explained by persistent immigration across habitats.

AB We tested the feasibility of infra-red (IR) thermography as a tool to survey in situ temperatures in intertidal habitats. We employed this method to describe aspects of thermal ecology for an exposed algal reef in the tropics (O'ahu, Hawai'i). In addition, we compared temperatures of the surrounding habitat as determined by IR thermography and traditional waterproof loggers. Images of reef organisms (6 macroalgae, 9 molluscs, 1 anthozoan, and 2 echinoderms), loggers, and landscapes were taken during two diurnal low tides. Analysis of IR thermographs revealed remarkable thermal complexity on a narrow tropical shore, as habitats ranged from 18.1 to 38.3A degrees C and surfaces of organisms that ranged from 21.1 to 33.2A degrees C. The near 20A degrees C difference between abiotic habitats and the mosaic of temperatures experienced by reef organisms across the shore are similar to findings from temperate studies using specialized longterm loggers. Further, IR thermography captured rapid temperature fluctuations that were related to tidal height and cross-correlated to wave action. Finally, we gathered evidence that tidal species were associated with particular temperature ranges and that two species possess morphological characteristics that limit thermal stress. Loggers provided similar results as thermography but lack the ability to resolve variation in fine-scale spatial and temporal patterns. Our results support the utility of IR thermography in exploring thermal ecology, and demonstrate the steps needed to calibrate data leading to establishment of baseline conditions in a changing and heterogeneous environment.

AB Light intensity and heterogeneity are some of the main environmental factors that differ between forest and savanna habitats, and plant species from these habitats form distinct functional types. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that not only differences in morphological and physiological traits but also phenotypic plasticity in response to light are involved in adaptation to forest and savanna habitats by investigating ecotypic differentiation between populations of Plathymenia reticulata (Leguminosae: Mimosoideae), a tree from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna). Seeds from four natural populations (one from each biome core area and two from ecotonal regions) were grown in a common garden with four light treatments. Fifteen morphological and physiological characteristics were evaluated until individuals reached 6 mo old. Comparisons among populations showed differences for seven traits in at least one light treatment. These differences pointed to local adaptation to different biomes. Populations showed different levels of phenotypic plasticity in response to light in seven traits. Higher plasticity was found either in the forest core population or ecotonal populations; lower values were found in the cerrado core population. Lower plasticity in the cerrado population emphasizes the stress resistant syndrome, as lower plasticity is probably advantageous in a habitat where a conservative resource use is crucial. Higher plasticity in forest individuals suggests higher ability in exploiting the light heterogeneity in this habitat. Also, higher plasticity in ecotonal populations can be important to ensure the maintenance of P. reticulata in these temporally and spatially dynamic areas.

AB Tree recruitment is rare and oak populations are declining in many Mediterranean-climate oak savannas. Factors affecting acorn production, seedling establishment and initial seedling growth have been much studied in short-term experiments. However, fecundity and early survival rates have not been placed in a demographic framework that also considers sapling survival and growth and adult tree mortality. We use matrix models and life table response experiments to analyze long-term experimental and observation data on California valley oak (Quercus lobata Nee) near its southern range limit in Santa Barbara County to answer three questions: (1) How sensitive is oak population growth rate to variation in acorn production and initial seedling establishment vs. sapling survivorship and growth? (2) How do mammalian consumers-specifically, cattle, deer and rodents-impact valley oak seedling establishment and sapling survival and growth? (3) Can vertebrate consumers account for the observed population decline of valley oak in savannas in its southern range? We find that population growth is far more sensitive to consumer-mediated variation in sapling survivorship and growth than to variation in fecundity or seedling establishment and that consumers exert strong influence on the demography of the species. Deterministic, finite population growth rate (lambda) is <1 for unprotected plants and for plants that are protected from cattle but still exposed to mule deer and rodents. Population growth rate increases to 1.03 with protection from both cattle and deer, mainly because plants are able to quickly reach the tree layer when they are protected from ungulate browsing. Population growth rate jumps to 1.15 for plants protected from both ungulates and rodents as a result of increased survivorship and height growth of established individuals and because of increased seedling establishment during the first year. Our experimental findings are consistent with observed patterns in natural populations in Santa Barbara County, where tree recruitment is rare in both grazed and non-grazed savannas but more common in areas such as roadsides that are refuges from cattle and deer.

AB The regeneration of many tropical trees is threatened by forest fragmentation because it produces major physical, biological and ecological changes that limit seed germination and seedling establishment. We analyzed the regenerative potential of an old growth forest tree species-Ampelocera hottlei (Ulmaceae)-in three contrasting habitats located in the Lacandona rain forest, southeastern Mexico: continuous forest, fragments occupied by black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) and fragments unoccupied by howlers. We tested if germination of A. hottlei seeds among habitats was affected by understory temperature, light incidence and ingestion by A. pigra. We compared seedling survival and relative growth rate in height (RGR(H)) for 20 d among habitats and between ingested and control seeds (from mature fruits). Germination was higher in continuous forest than in fragments (occupied or not), with higher germination rates for ingested seeds in fragments. Temperature and light incidence were lower in continuous forest than in fragments. Germination decreased with increasing temperature and light incidence with this relationship being significantly higher for ingested seeds. Seedling survival was higher in continuous forest than in fragments, whereas RGRH did not differ among habitats. In addition, survival and RGRH were higher in seedlings originating from ingested seeds. Overall, our results suggest that the populations of A. hottlei can be limited in fragments where changes in the understory physical environment and the extirpation of A. pigra will likely have deleterious consequences for the regeneration of A. hottlei and possibly for other tree species, ultimately affecting forest composition and structure.

AB Most conservation biology is about the management of space and therefore requires spatial analyses. However, recent debates in the literature have focused on a limited range of issues related to spatial analyses that are not always of primary interest to conservation biologists, especially autocorrelation and spatial confounding. Explanations of how these analyses work, and what they do, are permeated with mathematical formulas and statistical concepts that are outside the experience of most working conservationists. Here, we describe the concepts behind these analyses using simple simulations to exemplify their main goals, functions and assumptions, and graphically illustrate how processes combine to generate common spatial patterns. Understanding these concepts will allow conservation biologists to make better decisions about the analyses most appropriate for their problems.

AB The gastropod shell use of the hermit crab Calcinus californiensis was studied at Troncones, Guerrero, Mexico. Hermit crabs were captured at two different levels of the intertidal zone, in wave-protected and wave-exposed sites. C. californiensis occupied shells of 18 gastropod species. At both wave-action sites. Cantharus sanguinolentus was the most occupied shell. Columbella sp. was used more by females than by males, and Nerita scabricosto was more used by males. The frequency of use of the shells was different between the different wave sites. N. scabricosta and Columbella sp. were occupied more at the wave-protected than at the exposed sites; C. sanguinolentus and Stramonita biserialis were occupied more at the exposed sites. The hermit crabs at the wave-exposed sites occupied heavier and thicker shells compared with the crabs from the protected sites. The Olmstead-Tukey diagram showed eight shell species as dominant in the wave-protected sites, and seven in the wave-exposed sites. Ten shell species were rare in the wave-protected sites, and six in the wave-exposed sites. The rare shells occupied by the hermit crabs were relatively heavier than the dominant shells in both site types. Our results suggest that the shell weight is important in sites that are greatly affected by the hydrodynamics.

AB This paper describes an approach to account for asymmetric preference formation in discrete choice models used for environmental valuation. The paper draws on data from a case study on preferences for environmental change resulting from a hypothetical rural development and conservation programme in Indonesia. Local knowledge on the current state of the environment was used to define an individual-specific status quo that consistently frames changes in a range of environmental services as gains or losses matching the perceptions of the local population living in the vicinity of a National Park. I estimated choice models that included separate parameters for increases and decreases in attribute levels for the environmental services and derived the indicators of local willingness to pay (WTP) corresponding to the bidirectional changes relative to the individual-specific status quo option.
   I found clear evidence of an asymmetric response to increase and decrease in attribute levels relative to the status quo. Ignoring asymmetric preference formation can therefore result in biased estimates of WTP indicators and welfare measures of change in cases where the outcomes of environmental programmes can plausibly result in both an increase and a decrease relative to a reference option. Compared to a symmetrical modelling approach, the combination of simultaneously accounting for asymmetric preference formation and preference heterogeneity in the choice model yielded additional insights that may be used to inform the development of local strategies towards biodiversity conservation.

AB The Janzen-Connell hypothesis proposes that density dependent seed and seedling mortality, combined with increasing seed and seedling survival away from the parent tree, together promote regular spacing of species and thus alpha diversity. This hypothesis has rarely been tested in tropical Africa, and rarely in montane forests anywhere. We tested this hypothesis using a combination of field experiments and observations in the most floristically diverse dry submontane forest in Nigeria. We investigated distance effects on seedling herbivory, seedling survival and seedling height growth. We found a significant decrease in herbivory with distance from conspecific adult trees for all three species of experimentally planted seedlings (Entandrophragma angolense, Deinbollia pinnata and Sterculia setigera), and also for naturally occurring seedlings of Pouteria altissima but not of Newtonia buchananii or Isolona pleurocarpa. The relative density of large seedlings/saplings of P. altissima, N. buchananii and I. pleurocarpa increased significantly at greater distance from conspecific adult trees; however, we found no significant distance effect on survival or height growth over 3 mo for all three experimentally planted species. Taken together, our results are some of the first to show that Janzen-Connell effects occur on the African continent and in particular montane tropical forest and suggest that such effects may be pantropical.

AB From 1945 to 2000, the extent of Paraguay's Atlantic Forest was reduced from 73,000 to 12,000 square kilometers. Deforestation rates were exceptionally high from the late 1960s through to the end of the century. During this period, dual agricultural frontiers pushed into the region from both east and west, resulting in a production landscape defined by two principal commodities: soybeans and cotton. This article considers the expansion and contraction of these industries and addresses their impacts on the region's forest cover. Findings suggest that the role of cotton and smallholder agriculture has been greatly diminished as a driver of land cover change in the region since 1990. High rates of forest loss were sustained, however, partly as a result of continued pressure for agricultural expansion for soy production.

AB We evaluated the feeding ecology of largehead hairtail (Trichiurus lepturus) and hairtail (T. margarites). We collected specimens from fishing ports in the Beibu Gulf (Gulf of Tonkin) from October 2008 to September 2009 and analyzed their gut contents. We collected 857 T. lepturus and 666 T. margarites samples. The number of stomachs examined in this study was sufficient to describe the monthly and ontogenetic diet shifts for the two species, as indicated by the trophic diversity curves. T. lepturus was a general omnivore, feeding primarily on Bregmaceros rarisquamosu, Decapterus maruadsi, and Acetes chinensis. Conversely, T. margarites preyed primarily on D. maruadsi, B. rarisquamosus, B. nectabanus, and A. chinensis. Both species exhibited distinct ontogenetic diet shifts. Although the two hairtail specie fed on similar sources in the same habitat, the diet overlap was relatively low. Our results suggest that hairtail play an important role in controlling small pelagic and benthic fish populations in the gulf. This trophic correlation shall be used for developing a marine ecosystem model for the Beibu Gulf.

TI What's the Harm? An Evolutionary Theoretical Critique of the
   Precautionary Principle
SO KENNEDY INSTITUTE OF ETHICS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID BIODIVERSITY; EQUILIBRIUM; DIVERSITY; STABILITY; BALANCE
AB The precautionary principle has been hailed as the new paradigm for contending with health and environmental risk in the context of emerging technologies. In the philosophical literature, however, it has been met with skepticism. Weaker conceptions of the precautionary principle are accused of being trivial or vacuous, while stronger versions are criticized for issuing irrationally restrictive or even contradictory prescriptions. Although the precautionary approach suffers from a number of conceptual defects, it nonetheless could be justified in certain biological domains if it were the case that evolution tended to produce optimal, delicately balanced equilibria that generally coincided with what we value. This justification fails, however, since it is premised on assumptions about the causal structure of the world that do not accord with contemporary evolutionary theory. This does not exclude the possibility that the precautionary principle may be warranted for other reasons or in certain settings, but it does remove a potentially powerful rationalization, one that has motivated much of the scholarship, law, and policy that is inclined toward the precautionary approach.

AB The expression of sexually-selected traits such as bright plumage, exaggerated antlers, and elongated eyestalks can be highly influenced by environmental factors, including the behaviors of mothers. Many recent studies have described the ways that maternal behavior can influence the expression of sexually-selected traits in offspring, however, few studies have investigated if and how such maternal effects might change, over time, in natural populations. Here, we examine the influence of maternal oviposition site on the expression of offspring sexually-selected traits in four successive cohorts of the heliconia bug, Leptoscelis tricolor (Hemiptera: Coreidae). Female heliconia bugs lay eggs on multiple host plant species, and offspring remain on these plants for the entirety of growth and development. We found that natal plant species had significant effects on the expression of male sexually-selected traits and the degree of sexual dimorphism. Moreover, these effects changed over time for later cohorts, concurrent with changes in host plant resources. Our results suggest that maternal effects can be a significant and dynamic influence on the sexually-selected traits of offspring. Such environmental effects on sexually-selected traits could have broad implications for the processes and outcomes of sexual selection.

AB Forest fires pose a threat more serious than illegal felling in developing countries and are a cause of major concern for environmental security. Fires in tropical forests, though not devastating on a large scale as compared to large and infrequent fires in boreal or Mediterranean systems, still cause loss to biodiversity and economic and monetary value. In India, human-induced forest fires increasingly affect legally protected nature conservation areas. An array of satellite sensors that are now available can be deployed to monitor such events on a global and local scale. The present study uses night-time Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (A)ATSR satellite data from the last nine years to identify high fire-prone zones, fire affected areas in protected zones and the distribution of these incidents in relation to bio-geographic zones. Central India, with its vegetation type that is just right for fire ignition and spread, was observed to be the most severely affected area with maximum fire incidences. The bio-geographic zone comprising this area-such as the Deccan peninsula, which includes provinces like Central Highlands, Eastern Highlands, Central Plateau and Chhota Nagpur-was observed to be the most affected, accounting for approximately 36% of the total fire occurrences during the period 1997-2005. In protected areas, 778 fire incidents were observed within the last eight years. Comparison of (A)ATSR fire locations with MODIS active fire data for the Western Ghats (mainly of tropical evergreen forests and savannahs) and the Eastern Ghats (tropical deciduous) showed a spatial agreement of 72% with a minimum distance between the two products of 100 m. This study focuses on regions in India that are vulnerable to forest fires during specific time-frames and appraises the situation with an aim to minimize such incidents, if not completely stop the fire spread and its consequent destruction and loss. Our main objective is to understand seasonal and spatial variation in fire pattern and to identify zones of frequent burning.

AB Greater understanding of patterns of distributions of organisms and their causal mechanisms are required if the consequences of climatic change are to be fully realized. Associations between topographic features of the environment and distributions of organisms are frequently assumed to be a consequence of provision or modification of local conditions by those features. Such assumptions are rarely supported empirically and there is increasing evidence that topographic features do not always influence variables in the way we might anticipate. Thus, data about how features of habitat influence environmental conditions, including availability of food, are likely to be useful Or understanding how and why organisms are found where they are. Such data are few and rigorous descriptions about what defines particular features of habitat are seldom provided or are simplistic. For hard substrata in aquatic environments, crevices are often prominent features with which many species associate. Crevices have frequently been assumed, but not demonstrated, to ameliorate conditions by increasing humidity, moderating (usually reducing) temperatures and by decreasing forces from wave-impacts and water-flow. This study provided clear definitions and tests of various hypotheses about how crevices altered the local environment. The main predictions were that crevices would be cooler, more humid, more sheltered from water-movement and support more micro-algae than areas away from crevices. Manipulative experiments using artificial habitats and measurements on natural rocky shores were carried out on multiple shores over two years to understand how crevices affected local conditions. Crevices were indeed cooler, more humid, supported more micro-algae and more sheltered from water-flow than open areas nearby, but conditions did not always vary in ways that were expected. Effects were often complex, with factors such as season, height on the shore and tidal conditions interacting to influence how crevices affect environmental conditions. Without this detailed information, assumptions about the reasons animals associate with features of habitat cannot be tested.

AB Ecuadorian mountain rainforests are declining dramatically due to deforestation. Exploitation of remaining forests has led to low abundances of native, valuable timber species. Enrichment planting of selected native tree species into forest gaps is a strategy that may increase their abundance and maintain biodiversity. However, the development of successful planting strategies requires knowledge of environmental demands on, and ecological requirements of, native species during their establishment. This knowledge is currently lacking for mid- and late-successional species in Central American forests. Two deciduous, mid-successional (Cedrela montana, Tabebuia chrysantha) and two evergreen, late-successional native tree species (Nectandra membranacea, Podocarpus sprucei) were planted into felling gaps. Photosynthetic performance and growth in height of these species were assessed along light gradients during seedling establishment to test whether species-specific light responses were related to plant successional traits. Both mid-successional species benefited from higher light levels in gaps up to 30% canopy openness(60A degrees). In larger gaps, C. montana exhibited a significant decline in growth. As expected, growth of the late-successional species was only marginally increased at higher light levels. Nevertheless, the photosynthetic apparatus of N. membranacea displayed rapid acclimation to higher light conditions in gaps. Plant response to felling gaps may not always be predicted based on successional status. Our results suggest that the four investigated species may coexist in the same gap by occupying different niches along light gradients. This arrangement may offer an ecological basis to increase the abundance of valuable timber species through enrichment planting in Ecuador mountain rainforests.

AB Fragmentation is a major cause of biodiversity loss. The relationship between fragmentation and biodiversity might be non-linear, due to the presence of ecological thresholds; however, the application of the threshold concept on the conservation of herb biodiversity has received limited attention. We assessed the relationship between a pool of woodland indicators and features of forest fragments (area, isolation, shape), and we evaluated whether ecological thresholds might provide guidelines for conservation. We performed our study in a human dominated area of northern Italy. In order to obtain a group of floristic indicators, we chose perennial herbs characteristic of the phytosociological syntaxa Fagetalia sylvaticae, Carpinion betuli and Erythronio-Carpinion, with suitable Landolt L and H index, obtained from previous releves in reference and high-quality forests. Subsequently, we analyzed the relationship between richness of indicators and patch features recorded in a highly fragmented landscape. Generalized linear models showed that the number of forest indicators was positively related to fragment size and connectivity. Generalized Additive Models showed that the relationship between indicator richness and fragment size was non-linear, with the presence of two thresholds. The number of forest indicators increased until 35-40 ha; above this size the richness remained constant. Fragments above this threshold should be the target of conservation. Furthermore, the relationship between area and number of indicators was less steep in patches smaller than 1-1.5 ha. Patches between these two thresholds can be optimal targets of management actions, as small size increases can greatly improve their value for biodiversity.

AB Effects of conservation status and human population pressure on species composition, density and spatial distribution of seedling populations in Sudanian dry forests of Burkina Faso were studied. Data were collected from protected and unprotected forests at two sites differing in human population densities. A total of 62 species were recorded, representing. 23 families and 48 genera, and the dominant families were Combretaceae and Caesalpiniaceae. Population pressure influenced significantly the species richness, but not conservation status. There were moderately significant differences in seedling densities between protected and unprotected forests at each site. The mature-juvenile relationships were generally weak in all cases (r(2) < 50%). The spatial distribution of the seedlings was mainly clumped, reflecting the dominance of clonal propagation. The protection provided by the present conservation status was inefficient in promoting regeneration. As most species have few seedlings, expediting the natural regeneration process inside and outside the forest reserve is recommended.

AB This paper analyses the effectiveness and distributional effects of payments to avoid tropical deforestation. As a first: aspect, we investigated whether or not expected payments for avoided deforestation would be acceptable for tropical farmers in Southern Ecuador with the study area located directly adjacent to the Podocarpus National Park. Second, we explored possible distributional effects resulting from voluntary or mandatory remuneration schemes to avoid deforestation. Finally, a productive sustainable land use,vas conceptualised to be combined with payments For avoided deforestation to avoid leakage (i.e. deforestation processes elsewhere when avoided at a given farm). Farm level land use scenarios with ("business as usual") and without deforestation ("conservation strategy") were compared. Compensation per Mg Carbon (C) that is not emitted into the atmosphere under the "conservation strategy" was derived to achieve a monetary land net present value (NPV, sum of discounted future net revenues) equal to the NPV obtained under "business as usual'. Avoided carbon emissions were computed from above ground C in tropical forests of the project area and supplemented by In(130 formation on soil carbon from another study Economic data for cattle pasturing were obtained from a farm survey (130 households) to investigate distributional effects. To derive sustainable land use concepts, a risk sensitive bioeconomic farm model was used that considered effects of risk compensation when combining pasture with reforestation of abandoned farm lands and selective logging of natural forests. The results showed that only a few farmers (20 out of 130) would possibly accept a compensation price of US$ 10 per Mg avoided C emission, a C-compensation that is believed by other authors to reduce deforestation by 65%. Rather a compensation of around US$ 25 per Mg C was necessary to address compensation requirements of farmers who hold 50% of the tropical forest area in our study. The implementation of a voluntary remuneration scheme for avoided deforestation would not introduce systematic distributional effects (such as that only the biggest farmers would benefit from compensation), while a mandatory and enforced ban on deforestation coupled with a "fair" compensation payment equal to mean compensation requirements may lead to undesirable effects for many farmers. Finally, we demonstrate a mixed sustainable land use concept that depended on cheap credits for reforestation of abandoned pasture lands. This concept was able to stop farm level deforestation and to enlarge the economic value of farms through various combined land use options (agricultural and forestry options). The combination of land uses led to risk compensatory), effects and a more efficient land use by reintegrating unproductive abandoned areas back into the economical process. I In our conclusion a combination of payments for avoided deforestation along with productive land use concepts provided a viable solution for tropical forest conservation.

AB Many aquatic invertebrates alter their behaviour in response to chemical stimuli from predators. Less is known about how finely prey can discriminate between stimuli from predatory and related non-predatory species, even in well-studied hermit crabs. We tested the time to emerge from the shell after disturbance ( hiding time) of a common intertidal hermit crab. Pagurus granosimanus was exposed to effluent from two large-bodied brachyuran crabs: the durophagous, predatory red rock crab, Cancer productus, and the herbivorous kelp crab, Pugettia producta, in a controlled laboratory setting. Hiding times were a dramatic 41% shorter in the presence of Cancer effluent than when exposed to Pugettia effluent, which did not differ from a sea water control. Therefore hermit crabs can distinguish between chemical effluent from predatory and nonpredatory brachyuran crabs, which could include crab-specific compounds or metabolites from recently consumed prey, and adjust their behaviour accordingly. Shorter hiding times probably decrease the risk of being eaten by a shell-breaking predator because hermit crabs may be better able to elude them, either by running rapidly away or by abandoning their shell before it is crushed. Individual tests with three video stimuli ( control, predatory crab, herbivorous crab), and combined tests with video and chemical stimuli, revealed a consistent generalized response to the presence of video but no differences among video treatments.

AB Many invertebrates avoid predation risk by seeking and defending refuges that can be in limited supply, producing strong intra- and inter-specific interference competition. Previous experimental studies in central Chile demonstrated that interference competition for refuges is the primary factor driving habitat segregation between the predatory crabs Acanthocyclus gayi and A. hassled, with the latter species monopolizing galleries inside mussel beds in the mid intertidal zone and limiting A. gayi to rock crevices. Yet, habitat partitioning between rival species can result from differences in habitat preferences and not solely from interference interactions. Moreover, since A. gayi is also known to shelter in turf-forming algae (predominantly Gelidium), which dominates extensive areas in the low intertidal zone, among-sites variation in the turf morphology and abundance could modify habitat preferences and the pattern of inter-specific interactions. We experimentally evaluated refuge habitat preferences of individual, similarly-sized adult A. gayi and A. hassleri in the laboratory, comparing choice patterns across multiple trials with paired combinations of the main refuge types commonly used by crabs in the field: a) mussel galleries, b) rock crevices, c) short algal turf, and d) tall algal turf Our results showed that both species display a strong ranking of preferences for some refuge habitats over others. In general, mussel galleries were the preferred refuge type for both crab species, but their preference rankings changed depending on turf morphology. When turf was short, A. hassleri and A. gayi made identical refuge choices, strongly preferring mussel galleries over crevices and these over the short turf. In contrast, when the turf was tall A. gayi selected equally the tall turf or mussel galleries, and these were strongly preferred over crevices. A. hassleri, on the other hand, largely ignored tall turf and kept the highest preference for mussel galleries. A field experiment in which crabs were offered to foraging birds demonstrated that A. hassleri is more susceptible than A. gayi to predation by kelp gulls when outside refuges. Differences in patterns of coloration between crabs may underlie between-species differences in predation susceptibility and their habitat choices. These results suggest that the among-site differences in turf morphology (height and shape of fronds), which is largely driven by varying intensity of upwelling, could affect crab preferences for refuge habitats and the relative importance of inter-specific interference competition.

AB Spatial patterns of deforested areas and secondary forest are analyzed in terms of the spatial variation in location factors at different spatial extents. The spatial extents considered are old and new agrarian colonization projects and the administrative units of two different municipalities in Rondonia: Vale do Anari and Machadinho d'Oeste. A grid database was constructed including land cover and potential location factors based on biophysical, accessibility, socioeconomic and policy data. Results of the spatial analyses confirmed the hypothesis that different extents yield different relationships between land use/cover patterns and their location factors, particularly between old and new agrarian colonization projects. It emphasizes that current patterns of forest, secondary forest and pasture/agricuiture can only be understood with a combination of policy, accessibility, biophysical and socioeconomic factors while accounting for the historical pathways of change. Because we are dealing with different trajectories of land use/cover change, static analysis of the spatial pattern without acknowledging these trajectories will lead to erroneous interpretations of the current and future land use/cover dynamics.

AB In all systems, phosphorus (P), particularly phosphate, is inexorably drawn to sorption surfaces or precipitated, and is removed from the readily plant-available P pools. Mobilising this less-available P is a significant challenge in organic and low-input agro-ecosystems where readily available P sources may not be applied regularly. Although good-quality inputs, with low C : P ratio, and rotations may be effective in managing organic P cycles in pasture and forestry systems, extensive cropping systems will remain problematic. Two conceptual models are proposed to use organic matter additions to transfer this recalcitrant P into the biocycle, one involving highly labile organic matter and the other involving less-labile organic additions. Current literature provides some evidence for the efficacy of both models, but further work is necessary to clarify which is optimal for agro-ecosystems relying on either low inputs of P or forms of P that are allowed in organic agricultural systems, such as manures or rock phosphate. The microbial biomass is integral to P biocycling in organic systems, but further work is necessary to clarify the role of fungal and bacterial decomposers in decomposition processes. Identifying P-efficient cultivars with low translocation from roots to shoots to provide an 'organic' P source for following crops, essentially optimal rotation sequences for mobilising P using plants, is an avenue of promising research potential. Enzyme activation of recalcitrant organic P sources is unlikely to be effective if applied to bulk soils; however, further research on enzyme activities in the rhizosphere holds promise. We strongly recommend that further research be directed toward understanding and limiting reactions of inorganic P with soil colloids and minerals, either through chemical means (pH change, competitive sorption) or introduction and manipulation of organic materials. The research issues identified above overlap considerably with conventional agricultural concerns and benefits will accrue to both conventional and organic producers where further research is promoted.

AB The neutral theory of biodiversity has been criticized for its neglect of species differences. Yet it is much less heeded that S. P. Hubbell's definition of neutrality allows species to differ in their birth and death rates as long as they have an equal per capita fitness. Using the lottery model of competition we find that fitness equalization through birth-death trade-offs can make species coexist longer than expected for demographically identical species, whereas the probability of monodominance for a species under zero-sum neutral dynamics is equal to its initial relative abundance. Furthermore, if newly arising species in a community survive preferentially they are more likely to slip through the quagmire of rareness, thus creating a strong selective bias favoring their community membership. On the other hand, high-mortality species, once having gained a footing in the community, are more likely to become abundant due to their compensatory high birth rates. This unexpected result explains why a positive association between species abundance and per capita death rate can be seen in tropical-forest communities. An explicit incorporation of interspecific trade-offs between birth and death into the neutral theory increases the theory's realism as well as its predictive power.

AB We explored the effects of recent forest fragmentation on fine-scale patterns of population structuring and genetic diversity in populations of White-ruffed Manakins (Corapipo altera) inhabiting premontane forest fragments of varying size in southwestern Costa Rica. Habitat fragmentation is a major conservation concern for avian populations worldwide, but studies of the genetic effects of fragmentation on Neotropical birds are limited. We sampled 159 manakins from nine forest fragments of varying size within an 18 km radius, and genotyped these birds at 13 microsatellite loci. Bayesian clustering methods revealed that birds from all fragments comprised a single genetic population, and an MCMC approach showed that the fragments were likely to be at migration-drift equilibrium. F-statistics showed only modest levels of differentiation between forest fragments. We calculated allelic diversity indices for each fragment but found no correlation between genetic diversity and fragment size. These results suggest that manakins may retain substantial connectivity via inter-fragment dispersal despite habitat fragmentation.

AB Plant recruitment in nature exhibits several distinctive patterns ranging from hump shaped to monotonically decreasing with distance from the seed source. We investigate the role of post-dispersal seed predation in shaping these patterns, introducing a new mechanistic model that explicitly accounts for the movement strategy used by seed eaters. The model consists of two partial differential equations describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of both seed and predator densities. The movement strategy is defined by how predators move in response to the different cues they can use to search for seeds. These cues may be seed density, seed intake, distance from the plant, density of conspecific foragers, or a mixture of these four. The model is able to reproduce all the basic plant recruitment patterns found in the field. We compare the results to those of the ideal free distribution (IFD) theory and show that hump-shaped plant recruitment patterns cannot be generated by IFD predators and, in general, by foragers that respond exclusively to seed density. These foragers can produce only nonincreasing patterns, the shapes of which are determined by the foragers' navigation capacities. In contrast, hump-shaped patterns can be produced by distance-responsive predators or by foragers that use conspecifics as a cue for seed abundance.

AB Spatial and temporal variation in the below-canopy light environment of tropical forests is not well known and its measurement is technically challenging. Distributions of gap and understory areas in forests are likewise little known because of the resource requirements of forest structural censuses and a lack of consensus over how gaps should be defined. A basic model of forest structure, based on tree allometries from the 50 ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, and a solar positioning algorithm were used to predict spatial and temporal variation in the distribution of direct light at the forest floor. Predicted duration of direct sunlight was then compared with the distribution of gap and understory areas, delimited according to four standard gap definitions, giving predictions for the correspondence between direct light regimes and forest structure. At least 36 percent of the areas of gaps of all sizes was predicted to receive < 1 h of direct sunlight per day, and the understory to receive direct sunlight for >= 1 h per day in up to 15 percent of its area, even when not in proximity to gaps. The predicted distribution of light changed over the course of the year with the greatest spread of light throughout the forest floor coinciding with the months when maximum daily solar elevation peaked. These predictions suggest a partial decoupling of light regimes from canopy structure, with implications for gap definitions, patch models of forest development and current understanding of tree seedling recruitment patterns.

AB Community ecologists implicitly assume redundancy when they aggregate species into functional groups. But there have been remarkably few empirical efforts to investigate the accuracy of this concept in situ. The concept of redundancy could be roughly split into two components: the ecological redundancy (similar response to environmental variations involving similar ecological processes) and the functional redundancy (similar biological trait combinations shaping similar functional processes). Both types of redundancy are tested among the 3 invasive European Elodeas. In 11 sites and during two successive years 2004-2005, the cover growth rate of each Elodea species was monthly recorded. To test ecological redundancy, cover growth rates were related to a large suite of environmental variables. To test functional redundancy, 13 biological traits involved in competitive relationships were measured each month. Firstly, the redundancy hypothesis looks problematic for Elodea ernstiae. Indeed, the later possess numerous biological traits involved in light competition and niche overlap with the other Elodeas is very low. Secondly, ecological and functional redundancy can be successfully applied to Elodea canadensis and Elodea nuttallii. They share a large suite of biological traits leading to wide niche overlaps through the growing season. And the measured environmental variables do not differentially influence their growth rates, which are, in turn, controlled by a similar group of biological traits. In this way, the different invasiveness patterns of E. canadensis and E. nuttallii could be solely due to the ecological drift and their ecological dynamic could follow neutral rules.

AB (Initial development and biomass allocation in seedlings of Brosimum rubescens Taub. (Moraceae) at different shading levels). Monodominant forests of Brosimum rubescens Taub. (Moraceae) occur at the Cerrado/Amazonia boundary and are threatened by logging. Light is considered an important determinant for monodominance in forests, so the aim of this study was to analyze initial growth at shading levels of 0, 30, 50, 70 and 90% in the nursery, in a forest gap, and also at a closed canopy site. Photosynthesis was measured in seedlings at three shading levels. Seedlings under a closed canopy showed lower relative growth rates in comparison to seedlings growing in a nearby gap. At 21 months of age, the highest total dry mass of 9.46 g was measured at 50% shading. This represents a biomass accumulation of 144% over that found at 90% shading. For all treatments in every assessment the partitioning was dry matter of roots > leaves > stems. The lowest maximum photosynthesis rate (A(max) = 3.46 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was recorded at 90% shading and the highest (A(max) = 7.89 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was recorded at 30% shading. Gaps seem to play an important role in maintaining monodominance since B. rubescens showed some plasticity regarding light conditions and grew better at intermediate shading levels.

AB In Malaysia, the development of two major agricultural crops, i.e. oil palm and rubber, is one of the primary causes of forest loss. However, understanding of this relationship has not been quantified, which is vital to improve the planning and management of the agricultural land uses. TO understand the relationship. this study addresses their dynamic change, patchiness and spatial relationship with forestland in the State of Selangor, Malaysia as a case study. Data development and analysis were based on three land-Use maps of 1966, 1981 and 1995 where forest and, wetland forest and marshland land use categories were referred to as forestland. Two defined natural landscapes; forest and wetland landscapes were used as a basic unit of analysis to determine the patchiness of the agricultural lands at the expense of large tract of forestland. During the periods Studied, oil palm area increased whereas rubber area reduced. The development of oil palm had caused loss much of forestland, particularly wetland forest and marshland. Its expansion at the expense of large tract of wetland forest and marshland earnestly occurred between 1966 and 1981 but slowed clown between 1981 and 1995. By using the landscape type approach this study recommended a way to determine the patchiness of the agricultural lands at the expense of large tract of forestland. With these findings, we Conclude that it is important to understanding the relationship quantitatively in order to describe the implications for land development of the agricultural crops.

AB We studied drivers of habitat conversion in the Panama Canal region, where rich biodiversity in tropical rainforests currently coexists with two major growing cities and a plethora of economic opportunities. We examined existing administrative units (counties) with known biophysical (e.g., rainfall, topography) and socio-economic (e.g., Population density, road density) characteristics. To identify associations between those characteristics and likelihood of habitat conversion to agriculture or urbanization, we used canonical correlation analysis. Two axes accounted for most of the variation among administrative units: one for urbanization and the other for agriculture. Rainfall and topography were negatively associated with urbanization, whereas population wealth was positively associated with land conversion to urban. Agriculture was most strongly associated with elevation variability and topographic complexity. To a lesser extent, agriculture was associated with rural population density, mean annual human population growth and poverty level. We hypothesize that most future habitat loss in the Panama Canal region will be from urbanization as Panama City expands and populations grow along the highway system. Decision-makers will need to emphasize preservation of forests on the edge of developments, where risk of loss is highest. These forested lands tend to become more expensive as urbanization approaches, putting them at greater risk of being converted. Nevertheless, they are still important for protection of the Canal watershed and the high levels of biodiversity in watershed forests. Land planners and decision-makers should consider the influence of socio-economic and biophysical factors when selecting forests to protect for conservation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB The knowledge of broad-scale floristic variation in wet grasslands, which are endangered throughout Europe, is still limited and some regions have remained unexplored so far. In addition, hitherto published phytosociological studies were concentrated at the national level and therefore national vegetation classifications are not consistent with each other. In order to overcome these shortcomings of traditional phytosociology, we gathered original data from Bulgaria and analysed them together with the data from Central Europe. We further analysed major compositional gradients within Bulgarian wet grasslands and changes in species richness along them. We sampled 164 wet grassland vegetation plots throughout Bulgaria. We further prepared a restricted data set of wet grasslands from Central-European phytosociological databases. Both data sets were merged and classified by modified TWINSPAN. Four distinct vegetation types were differentiated. Even if they correspond with traditional alliances, which are primarily drawn as geographically defined units in Western and Central Europe (sub-Mediterranean Trifolion resupinati, sub-continental Deschampsion cespitosae and Molinion caeruleae and sub-oceanic Calthion palustris), they all occur in Bulgaria. When more precise classification was applied, two types of sub-Mediterranean wet grasslands and one high-altitude type of Calthion grasslands were detected solely in Bulgaria. DCA analysis showed that altitude is a dominant gradient controlling variation in Balkan wet grasslands. The second DCA axis was interpreted as the gradient of nutrient availability. Species richness shows skewed-unimodal trends along both major gradients, with the highest species richness in intermittently wet nutrient-limited grasslands. Tukey post-hoc test of altitudinal differences amongst vegetation types is significant for all pairs of clusters, suggesting that altitudinal differentiation is responsible for co-occurrence of nearly all European types of wet grasslands in Bulgaria. Our results suggest that (1) climate is an important factor for the diversity of wet grasslands; (2) Balkan vegetation of middle altitudes matches with that of Central Europe, whereas that of the lowest altitudes corresponds rather to the sub-Mediterranean region and high mountains are specific; (3) upward shift of Central-European vegetation types in southern Europe, so often described in forest vegetation is also evident for grassland vegetation and (4) the high diversity of Balkan vegetation is determined by a diverse relief enabling confluence of habitats possessing different climatic conditions.

AB We investigated the population density of the two common rodent species Akodon montensis, Oligoryzomys nigripes, and the more specialized endemic Delomys sublineatus in secondary forest fragments of the highly endangered coastal Atlantic Rainforest. Linear regression was used to examine relationships between population density and four landscape variables. We tested the hypothesis that rare species, which are more affected by fragmentation than the common species, should decrease in population density with decreasing fragment size while the density of common generalist species should be unaffected or increase in smaller fragments. The results revealed that A. montensis and O. nigripes showed no significant association to any landscape variable. The density of D. sublineatus showed a strong tendency to a positive correlation to fragment size as well as a negative correlation to edge density. The results underline the importance of large and connected forest remnants in the Atlantic Rainforest to guarantee an effective protection of endemic small mammal species.

AB Psittacids are important pre-dispersal seed predators. However, little is known about the parameters that may determine seed predation rates by these birds, such as plants' characteristics and microhabitat. Eriotheca gracilipes (Bombacaceae) is a semi-deciduous tree widely distributed in the Brazilian cerrado. The fruits are dehiscent pods and the seeds are wind-dispersed. Some individuals lose their leaves during the fruiting season, getting very conspicuous. Here we tested the hypothesis that the absence of leaves in E. gracilipes during the fruiting season may increase pre-dispersal seed predation by psittacids. We also tested the hypotheses that (1) seed predation intensity increases with increasing plant size and (2) number of fruits, (3) seed predation decreases with the increasing number of conspecific plants in a range of 15 m, and (4) seed predation intensity is lower in plants with higher vegetation cover over their crowns. The small parakeet Brotogeris versicolurus was the only species observed preying upon the seeds of E. gracilipes. The percentage of fruits damaged by the parakeets ranged from 0 to 100% (66.98 +/- 43.11%, n = 72) among the different plants. Our data give weak support to the hypothesis that the absence of leaves may facilitate plants and/or fruits detection by the parakeets. However, seed predation intensity was significantly affected by crop size. The hypothesis that conspecific fruiting plants surrounding the studied individuals may reduce predation rate was not supported. Nevertheless, trees without higher vegetation cover over their crowns were significantly affected by increased seed predation. This suggests that seed predation by parakeets can be a potential selective factor influencing fruit crop sizes in E. gracilipes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB [1] A new three-dimensional version of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) ecosystem model (CASA-3D) was developed to simulate regional carbon cycling in tropical forest ecosystems after disturbances such as logging. CASA-3D has the following new features: (1) an alternative approach for calculating absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) using new high-resolution satellite images of forest canopy gap fraction; (2) a pulse disturbance module to modify aboveground carbon pools following forest disturbance; (3) a regrowth module that simulates changes in community composition by considering gap phase regeneration; and (4) a radiative transfer module to simulate the dynamic three-dimensional light environment above the canopy and within gaps after forest disturbance. The model was calibrated with and tested against field observations from experimental logging plots in the Large-scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) project. The sensitivity of key model parameters was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations, and the uncertainties in simulated NPP and respiration associated with model parameters and meteorological variables were assessed. We found that selective logging causes changes in forest architecture and composition that result in a cascading set of impacts on the carbon cycling of rainforest ecosystems. Our model sensitivity and uncertainty analyses also highlight the paramount importance of measuring changes in canopy gap fraction from satellite data, as well as canopy light-use efficiency from ecophysiological measurements, to understand the role of forest disturbance on landscape and regional carbon cycling in tropical forests. In sum, our study suggests that CASA-3D may be suitable for regional-scale applications to assess the large-scale effects of selective logging, to provide guidance for forest management, and to understand the role of forest disturbance in regional and global climate studies.

AB If current trends of declining fertility rates and increasing abandonment of rural land as a result of urbanization continue, this will signal a globally significant transformation with important consequences for policy makers interested in conservation planning. This transformation is presently evident in a number of countries and projections suggest it may occur in the future in many developing countries. We use rates of population growth and urbanization to project population trends in rural areas for 25 example countries. Our projections indicate a general decline in population density that has either occurred already (e.g., Mexico) or may occur in the future if current trends continue (e.g., Uganda). Using both temperate and tropical examples we present evidence that this process will lead to ecological homogenization as a dominant habitat (e.g., forest replaces a mosaic of human-maintained landscapes), resulting in declines in biodiversity at the local scale. Building on this information, we consider research programs that need to be conducted so that policy makers are prepared to effectively manage depopulated rural areas.

ID DEFORESTATION
AB We report on the ornithological results of the first rapid biodiversity survey in the BX-044 polygon, one of the largest open vegetation enclaves in southern Amazonia, in the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Rondonia. Three-hundred and thirty species were recorded in all habitats surveyed, including closed (terra-firme, riparian, gallery, and campinarana forests) and open (cerrado and grassland) vegetation types. Over 90% (298) of all species were not shared between closed and open habitat types emphasizing the importance of interhabitat diversity to the overall species richness recorded. Significant range extensions were documented for 34 species (30 of which were associated with the cerrado biome). Open vegetation enclaves contribute significantly to local avian species richness in Amazonia in addition to supporting species with special relevance to conservation with ranges centered in the cerrado, currently one of the most threatened biomes of South America. Conservation of Amazonian cerrado enclaves offers the unique opportunity to combine preservation of areas with high inter-habitat diversity with establishment of a complementary network of conservation units directed at preserving the cerrado biome throughout South America. Urgent steps must be taken to protect Amazonian open vegetation enclaves, which are still conspicuously under represented in the network of Brazilian conservation units, despite the fairly recent expansion of agriculture into these areas.

AB Trail following behaviour and pedal mucus production were investigated in the mid-shore topshell, Monodonta labio (Linnaeus) in Hong Kong. On the shore, individuals exhibited both conspecific and self trail following while awash on ebb and flood tides, although fidelity to resting sites during emersion on successive days was low. In the laboratory, animals that encountered traits that had been aged on the shore for different periods showed similar patterns of movement (distance moved, speed and tortuosity) suggesting that degradation of cues in the mucus that animals responded to did not occur until >3 days post-deposition. Animals moved faster, with a lower rate of radular rasping, on freshly laid mucus trails than on a biofilm-covered substratum and did not change their speed when moving over aged (biofilm-covered) mucus compared to fresh mucus. Mucus production rates were similar when animals were crawling on vertical or horizontal surfaces, but significantly more mucus was produced when animals were emersed than when submerged. Mucus trail profiles were of variable thickness, but 'double' mucus trails (marker+tracker traits) did not contain significantly more mucus than 'single' trails (marker mucus only) and were considerably thinner than single trails suggesting tracker snails utilized mucus laid by marker snails, reducing their own deposition of mucus. Thus, while M labio do not appear to utilize trails for orientation or refuge location, snails that follow trails have the potential to save energy through reducing mucus production or to gain energy through mucus ingestion. Given the role of pedal mucus production in the overall energy balance of gastropods, such energetic benefits are considerable and may have implications for the life history of the snail.

AB To improve the restoration of tropical rain forests, we tested the germination of seeds of Omphalea oleifera collected from soil (S) and from trees (T) in the 2001 dry season (Spring), at the beginning of a dry season (2005a, winter) and in the rainy season (2005b, winter). All seeds had high water content (WC, 31-33%), and the lipid content varied from 14 to 46%. Seedlings from seeds collected in 2001 were subjected to moderate water stress as a preconditioning treatment for severe stress. T-seeds collected in the dry season had high WC, rapid and high germination percentage; S and T-seeds collected in winter (2005) had also high WC but were dormant. GA(3) (250 ppm) broke this dormancy. S-seeds collected in the dry season or at the beginning of it had relatively low WC and low and delayed germination. Some 2001 S-seeds produced albino seedlings. The critical water content for maintaining ecological longevity in these seeds was similar to 15%. Seeds collected in 2005b that were dehydrated for 20 days in a moist and fresh atmosphere lost their viability, showing recalcitrant behavior. T-seeds with the lowest lipid content (2005a) after dehydration maintained low germination (15 +/- 18%). In all samples the seed size varied widely and was not predictive of seed WC. Embryos taken from dehydrated seeds had two to four times higher WC than the seeds, but germination did not take place. Laboratory and field germination of dormant seeds showed that viability may be maintained for at least 2-3 months on a moist substrate (soil or agar). Moderate water stress at the seedling stage reduced the efficiency of biomass production. Response to this water stress was expressed more in physiological traits than in morphological characters, consequently biomass allocation was maintained and plants retained most of their morphological characteristics (root:shoot ratio, leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, leaf weight ratio). Moderate water stress did not increase the tolerance of seedlings to severe stress, causing leaf shedding and plant death. For restoration purposes we recommend that T-seeds be germinated immediately avoiding dehydration. The use of S-seeds could result in unhealthy seedlings. Seed recalcitrance and the response to moderate water stress restrict germination and establishment to small gaps, where this species naturally grows. We suggest that before introducing O. oleifera in restoration programs, a plant cover should be built to reduce soil water deficit. It is necessary to improve methods to increase potential seed longevity in storage. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Measuring the fate of seeds between seed production and seedling establishment is critical in understanding mechanisms of recruitment limitation of plants. We examined seed fates to better understand the recruitment dynamics of four resprouting shrubs from two families (Fabaceae and Epacridaceae) in temperate grassy woodlands. We tested whether: (i) pre-dispersal seed predation affected seed rain; (ii) post-dispersal seed predation limited seed bank accumulation; (iii) the size of the seed bank was related to seed size; and (iv) viable seeds accumulated in the soil after seed rain. There was a distinct difference in seed production per plant between plant families with the legumes producing significantly more seeds per individual than the epacrids. Seed viability ranged from 43% to 81% and all viable had seed or fruit coat dormancy broken by heat or scarification. Pre-dispersal predation by Lepidopteran larvae removed a large proportion of seed from the legume seed rain but not the epacrids. Four species of ants (Notoncus ectatomoides, Pheidole sp., Rhytidoponera tasmaniensis and Iridomyrmex purpureus) were major post-dispersal seed removers. Overall, a greater percentage of Hardenbergia (38%) and Pultenaea (59%) seeds were removed than the fleshy fruits of Lissanthe (14%) or Melichrus (0%). Seed bank sizes were small (< 15 seeds m(-2)) relative to the seed rain and no significant accumulation of seed in the soil was detected. Lack of accumulation was attributed to seed predation as seed decay was considered unlikely and no seed germination was observed in our study sites. Our study suggests that seed predation is a key factor contributing to seed-limited recruitment in grassy woodland shrubs by reducing the number of seeds stored in the soil.

AB We used low-density seed additions to measure seed predation in eight 8-m x 8-m experimental plots at three prairie sites in 2002 and 20 experimental plots ai each site in 2003. We added plant litter to one-half of the experimental plots (treatments), but not the other half (controls). Within each treatment and control plot, we established two seed plots, one available to all consumers and one available only to invertebrates. Seed removal by invertebrates did not differ between treatments and controls for any site or in either year. All consumers, collectively, removed significantly more seed from control plots in tallgrass prairie in both years but more seed from control plots in mixed-grass and shortgrass prairies only in 2003. These patterns suggested that rodents were the primary cause of differences in seed use between control and litter-augmented plots in the three prairie types; and plant litter in central North American grasslands negatively affects seed removal by rodents, but not ants.

AB The yearly renewal of leaves and their holding organs ( the leafy shoot) represent an energetic cost for saplings. The contribution of both biochemical (tissue construction cost, CC) and morphological traits (biomass partitioning and leaf mass per unit area, LMA) to the cost associated with leaf area renewal (construction cost of the leafy shoot per unit leaf area, shoot CCA) was studied in saplings of Acer platanoides L. and Fraxinus excelsior L. growing in a natural light gradient below forest canopy. Decrease in LMA with shade and change in biomass partitioning from stems towards leaves and petioles accounted for the strong decrease in mass per unit area of the leafy shoot (SMA) with shade and for most of the plasticity of shoot CCA in both species. In addition, a decrease in leaf CC in A. platanoides also contributed to the overall decrease of shoot CCA with shade in this species. Leaf CC was positively correlated with LMA in F. excelsior, positively correlated with both LMA and epidermal absorbance of UV (A(UV)) in A. platanoides. Leaf CC was negatively correlated with ash content in both species. The strong negative correlation between A(UV) and nitrogen content might have damped variations in leaf CC in F. excelsior.

AB Spatially explicit community models often generate a wide range of complex dynamics and behaviours, but the predictions of community structure and dynamics from many of these models are rarely compared with the natural communities they are intended to represent. Here, we develop a spatially explicit individual-based model of a complex marine epibenthic community and test its ability to predict the dynamics and structure of the natural community on which the model is based. We studied a natural epibenthic community on small-scale patches of jetty wall to estimate the outcomes of pair-wise interactions among individuals of different species, neighbour-specific growth rates, and species-specific recruitment and mortality rates. The model is defined with rules acting at two spatial scales: (1) between individual cells on the spatial landscape that define the nature of interactions, growth and recruitment at a scale of 1 cm(2), and (2) at the scale of whole colonies (blocks of contiguous cells) that define size-specific mortality and limitations to the maximum size of colonies for some species for scales up to 1000 cm(2). The model is compared to the existing patches on the jetty wall and proves to be a good descriptor of the large range of possible communities on the jetty, and of the multivariate variances of the patches. The high variability in community structure predicted by the model, which is similar to that observed in the natural community, arises from observed variability in parameters of interaction outcomes, growth, recruitment, and mortality of each species. Thus if the processes we modelled operate similarly in nature, our results suggest that it is difficult to attempt to predict the precise trajectory of the community in a particular patch. Our results show that it is possible to develop a testable, predictive spatial model where the patch-scale community patterns of structure and dynamics are emergent, arising from local processes between colonies and species-specific demography.

AB Lieutenant Francis Winslow's 1878 oyster survey data of the lower Chesapeake Bay provided the spatial context for considering connectivities of Crassostrea virginica to estuarine function and food web dynamics. Winslow measured the area, water depths, and in some cases bed thickness for 70 distinct oyster beds in the 368 km(2) Tangier-Pocomoke complex, and 12 beds in 35 km(2) of the James River oyster reef habitat. Individual beds showed great size variations, yet most were < 2 km(2). Beds occupied variable water depths, but most occurred in 1-4 in depths near shore and 2-12 m depths along channels. Varied bed-top topography and elevation changes created complex structures and hydrologic corridors between shores and tributaries. This historical spatial data provide a framework for considering oyster beds in the context of modern research to suggest they formed resource patches in the seascape at the estuarine scale. It is suggested that beds at different locations are connected by hydrologic corridors, and they facilitate dispersion, migration, and recruitment. Also, oyster-reef habitat added topographic roughness and spatial heterogeneity that increase resource-use options important to an active and diverse estuarine community moving between shore and tributary systems, and between Bay waters and watershed systems.

   vasquezii maintain itself so successfully in a tropical rain forest

AB 1 Although monocarpy is rare among long-lived plant species that grow in stable habitats, one monocarpic species, Tachigali vasquezii, is extremely abundant in the rain forests of the Bolivian Amazon. We analyse how T. vasquezii is able to maintain itself successfully by comparing its life-history traits with those of polycarpic tree species of the same community. We then evaluate the relative importance of such traits using population matrix models.
   2 Monocarpic species are expected to have a high fecundity. Seed production per basal area for T. vasquezii is indeed nearly twice that of an average polycarpic species, but this is not sufficient to maintain stable populations.
   3 Life-history theory predicts that a monocarpic strategy is advantageous if juvenile survival rates are high compared with adult survival. Although seedlings of T. vasquezii have a lower mortality rate than polycarpic species, its sapling have higher mortality.
   4 We found that the success of T. vasquezii is due to its very high diameter growth rates in the larger size classes, which are four times higher than that of an average, co-occurring polycarpic species. Fast diameter growth is enabled by investment in large, leafy crowns and by a low wood density. Applying this high diameter growth in a population model yielded a population growth rate close to that of polycarpic species. Life table response experiment analysis of Tachigali and polycarp models showed that higher growth compensated for the negative demographic effect of 100% adult mortality following reproduction.
   5 Rapid growth enables T. vasquezii to reach reproductive maturity in only 49 years, compared with 79 years for an average polycarpic species. It also reduces the risk of dying before reproducing, and 50% more seedlings survive to maturity for T. vasquezii compared with polycarpic species.
   6 The dramatic negative demographic consequences of one-time flowering can therefore be completely balanced by taking a shorter time to reach maturity. Taking a time perspective, it appears that Tachigali vasquezii has an advanced, rather than a delayed, reproduction.

AB We hypothesized that pioneer and late successional species show different morphological and physiological responses in water use after gap formation. The magnitude of the responses was compared between two pioneer species (Macaranga gigantea and Trema orientalis) and four late successional species (Shorea sp.), in an experiment in which saplings were transferred from shade to sun. Although transpiration demand increased following the transfer, root hydraulic conductivity (Lp(r)) decreased. Lp(r) was sensitive to brief treatments with HgCl2 (a specific inhibitor of aquaporins). This allows Lp(r) to be divided into two components: cell-to-cell and apoplastic pathways. The Lp(r) of cell-to-cell pathway decreased in all species following the transfer, relating to aquaporin depression in roots. Following the transfer, leaf osmotic potentials at full hydration decreased and both leaf mass per area [leaf mass/leaf area (LMA)] and fine-root surface area/leaf surface area (root SA/leaf SA) increased in almost all species, allowing saplings to compensate for the decrease in Lp(r). Physiologically, pioneer species showed larger decreases in Lp(r) and more effective osmotic adjustment than late successional species, and morphologically, pioneer species showed larger increases in root SA/leaf SA and LMA. Water balance at the whole-plant level should be regulated by coupled responses between the aboveground and the belowground parts. Interspecific differences in responses after gap formation suggest niche differentiation in water use between pioneer and late successional species in accordance with canopy-gap size.

AB Dispersal quality an important component of seed disperser effectiveness, may strongly affect the rate of plant recruitment. Here we evaluated the quality of Cebus monkey dispersal by comparing the secondary removal fate and germination of fresh and Cebus-ingested seeds of nine tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Overall, rates of secondary seed removal by vertebrates were low, with most Cebus defecations remaining undisturbed for extended periods on the forest floor. Only four of 30 feces were completely buried by dung beetles, and we found significantly higher vertebrate removal of defecated seeds than control seeds for only one species, Cordia bicolor. Seed germination varied greatly between plant taxa. Seeds of 3 out of 9 species showed significantly higher percent germination after monkey gut passage than control fresh seeds. Germination times tended to be shorter for defecated than for control seeds but were significantly different only for one of nine species, Cecropia insignis. Low rates of seed removal from Cebus feces, coupled with high germination probabilities, suggest high dispersal effectiveness for Cebus and contrasts strongly with patterns of post-dispersal seed fate recorded for other primate species.

AB The diet of long-nosed bandicoots (Perameles nasuta) on the central coast of New South Wales, Australia, was examined over two summers and two winters using a combination of faecal scat analysis for food fragments and stable isotope analysis ( ratios of C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14) of blood. Isotope ratios in blood overlapped most strongly with those in invertebrate prey, and varied much less between seasons than did those in most dietary items, suggesting that the assimilated diet of long-nosed bandicoots is dominated by invertebrates throughout the year. Invertebrate remains dominated collected faeces in both seasons, even though the availability of invertebrate prey was higher in summer. Thus both techniques indicated that long-nosed bandicoots were primarily insectivorous year-round. Faecal scat analysis indicated that invertebrate eggs were more abundant in summer than winter. At a finer scale, spiders, orthopterans, lepidopteran larvae, ants, leaf material (non-grass monocot) and seeds were more abundant in summer, while cicada larvae, roots, fungi, grass leaves and Acacia bract ( small modified leaves appearing as scales) were more abundant in winter. Subterranean foods ( cicada larvae, plant roots and hypogeous fungi) were more abundant in winter and more abundant in the diet of males than of either lactating or non-lactating females.

AB Foraging distance and nesting sites of ants were surveyed in several lowland vegetation types in N. Vietnam, by employing a bait-attraction method. A total of 74 colonies of 22 ant species were found. The number of soil-nesting colonies was much higher than that of twig-nesting colonies. Long-distance foraging species were Liometopum sp. 1 of SKY (maximum foraging distance > 10 m), Diacamma sculpturatum complex (5.14 m), Philidris sp. 3 of SKY (> 3.75 m), Aphaenogaster sp. eg-22 (1.42 m) and Odontoponera denticulata (1.16 m). In 16 of the 22 species maximum foraging distance did not exceed 1 In. Differences in the foraging distance were not significant between soil-nesting and rotting-wood-nesting colonies. Limited data on Liometopum sp. I of SKY and Philidris sp. 3 of SKY suggests the possibility that arboreal-nesting species which forage on the ground tend to have larger foraging, areas than the majority of ground-nesting species. The present results concerning foraging distance may have implications in designing a protocol including baiting.

AB We studied patterns of removal and predation on seeds of ten plant species over two years in four abandoned pastures adjacent to forest fragments in Costa Rica. We hypothesized that: (1) removal within pastures would be greater nearest forest fragments and decline at farther distances; (2) removal rates would be greater on smaller-seeded species; and (3) removal rates would differ among pastures. We placed seeds of two species in three pastures in 1997 and eight species in two pastures during 1998. In each pasture, removal was monitored at three distances from the forest edge. Rates of seed removal in 1997 and 1998 were significantly greater 1-5 in from the forest than at 20 in distances, but removal rates at the 40 in distance did not differ from the 1-5 in distance. Rates of removal for both species were low in 1997, although removal was significantly greater for the smaller-seeded species Sorocea trophoides than for the large seeds of Nectandra sp. Removal rates differed significantly among pastures for both species in 1997 and among pastures for five small-seeded species in 1998. No removal of three large-seeded species was detected in 1998. Interspecific differences in seed removal rates were consistent with the hypothesis that larger seeds are removed less in pastures than smaller seeds. While some seed removal patterns appear predictable, species-specific variation in removal within and among sites was substantial. Predator population densities and other among-pasture differences may also influence patterns of spatial variation in seed predation.

AB Several methods of assessment have been used to document variation in grazing pressure on temperate rocky shores, although often these methods are applied without consideration of local conditions or species. In this study, a comparison was made between abundance counts of inactive molluscan grazers at low tide, direct observations of grazer activity and distribution throughout day and night tidal cycles, and records of grazing marks on wax discs, for the mid-shore of Hong Kong. The abundance of grazers found during low-tide counts varied among dates, sites and species. This method, however, did not record all grazer species that day/night observations showed to migrate from the low shore with the rising tide. Low-tide counts, therefore, underestimate grazing pressure (number of active grazers per unit area) and grazer guild (number of species). Grazing marks on wax discs also recorded a greater number of species than the low-tide counts of inactive grazers, and included grazers that were seen to migrate up shore during day/night observations. Certain limpet species, however, avoided the wax and did not leave grazing marks, showing this method to also underestimate grazing pressure. All methods showed grazing pressure to be variable at spatial scales of tens of metres or less and also temporally variable between sampling dates. The sole use of either low-tide counts or wax discs is likely to underestimate grazing pressure, due to variation in shore topography and grazer foraging behaviour, especially on shores with a narrow tidal range such as in Hong Kong. To gain a more accurate assessment of total grazing pressure, it is suggested that recording of grazing marks on wax discs should be used in conjunction with direct day/night observations.

AB Two controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential for vascular plants to germinate and establish in milled peatlands and to assess whether easily measured plant traits can be used to predict their probable success. Study species included twenty species of perennial herbs, shrubs and trees occurring frequently in undisturbed bogs or abandoned milled bogs in Quebec, Canada. First, a glasshouse experiment was performed to test the effect of burial under peat on germination and seedling emergence. Second, a growth chamber experiment was conducted to measure relative growth rate and other growth parameters of seedlings between 1 and 3 weeks of age. In the burial experiment, seedling emergence decreased exponentially with peat depth for most species examined. The slope of the exponential decline varied between species and was strongly correlated to seed mass. Seeds less than 0.1 mg in mass were most sensitive to burial. In the seedling growth experiments, Betula species had the highest absolute and relative growth rates, which may help to explain their prevalence in milled bogs. Relative growth rate (RGR) was not correlated with seed mass, however it was strongly correlated with leaf area ratio (LAR) and especially specific leaf area (SLA) of seedlings, except for species with seed mass less than 0.01 mg. Screening of species for seed mass and SLA should help predict their germination and establishment success or failure in milled peatlands and allow more directed interventions to favour the establishment of desirable species in milled bogs.

AB The effect of catastrophic disturbance on forest structure was studied for 10 years subsequent to the landfall of Hurricane joan in 1988. Four sites within the damage area and one control site outside of the area were established in the early 1990s and positions and sizes (DBH and crown height) were measured annually. Results of the study are reported in the context of the debate between equilibrium versus non-equilibrium models of tropical forest dynamics. Equilibrium models imply some sort of niche segregation on a species to species basis. whereas non-equilibrium models emphasise chance and history in the development of canopies. In either case, the details of the dynamics of building and thinning after a disturbance are key to resolve the debate. Physical aspects of the developing canopy began with a severely damaged forest with effectively no canopy at all. Two distinct canopies had developed 4 or 5 years after the disturbance; (1) a larger but diffuse canopy made up of the tress that had survived the hurricane standing and had begun resprouting high in their damaged crowns and (2) a 'thinning canopy' of very densely packed crowns of small individual trees, resulting from the growth of surviving saplings and seedlings and trees that had sprouted near to the ground. Competitive thinning has begun to occur in this dense lower canopy. Since the disturbance, the increase in number of species has been great, ranging from 134 to 208% over what would be expected in a mature forest. Mortality patterns in the thinning canopy suggest that trees are not dying at random and thus supports a niche-based model of forest regeneration. Qualitative analysis of the thinning canopy also suggests that some species have come to occupy the upper position in the canopy (and are thus likely to be competitive dominants) while other species have come to occupy the lower position (and are thus likely to be competitively suppressed). A qualitative model is proposed illustrating where, during the process of regeneration, various authors have emphasized either a niche (equilibrium) or non-niche (nonequilibrium) model. It is suggested that in the building phase of the post-disturbance forest a non-niche interpretation is most appropriate while in the thinning phase a niche interpretation may be warranted.

AB Information about the life history of the stone crab Homalaspis plana was necessary to investigate the possible reasons for the failure of Marine Protected Area (MPA) and Management and Exploitation Area (MEA) in increasing stone crab abundance, in contrast with other exploited benthic species. In this study, we analyzed some aspects of the early Life history of the stone crab, focusing especially on (1) recruitment patterns among habitats and between years in intertidal zones, (2) habitat preferences, including some intra- and interspecific interactions that may affect habitat use, and (3) intraspecific interactions that may affect survival. We also evaluated the percent cover of suitable habitats for juvenile stone crabs in a MPA and a MEA. Sheltered habitats showed higher densities of juvenile H, plana than exposed areas, and sand with boulders showed the highest crab densities, followed by shell hash with boulders. Differences in mean densities were detected for all benthic stages among sheltered substrates, except for megalopae. Bare substrates (without boulders) showed the lowest density. Throughout the settlement period, abundance of smaller instars (<J2) was 3 times higher in 1995 than in 1996, while densities of >J4 were twice as high in 1996 than in 1995. Neither intra- nor interspecific space competition seems to explain the distribution of juvenile stone crabs in the field. However, cannibalism among juveniles may have an important effect on survival. Cannibalism among juveniles is density-dependent, and may have greater effects as the abundance of larger conspecifics increases since mutual interference does not affect proportional prey mortality per predator. We suggest that losses are high in low quality habitats (probably through emigration, predation or habitat disturbance due to wave impact), and cannibalism is an important source of mortality in high quality habitats (where crab density is high). Although substrate type and post-settlement processes can help explain the distribution of juvenile stone crabs, wave action seems to be the major determinant of juvenile distribution. Neither sheltered habitats nor the most suitable substrate are common in the MPA and MEA studied. These factors are not currently being considered in the assignation of MEAs or planning of MPAs, although they could explain the lack of effect of both protection strategies in increasing the abundance of the stone crabs in Chile in comparison to other exploited benthic species.

AB The limpets Patella granularis Linn. and Siphonaria capensis commonly co-exist on the coast of South Africa where S. capensis often reaches very high densities. Patella occurs in the diets of various predators, but Siphonaria is rarely eaten. The possibility of chemical defence in Siphonaria was tested using co-occurring predators. Live limpets were used to establish that predators differentiate between the two species; limpet tissue to establish that this was not due to behavioural defence; and chemical extracts from Siphonaria to eliminate the possibility of physical effects such as tissue toughness.
   The predators capable of taking live limpets (clingfish, starfish and two species of whelks) took Patella in preference to Siphonaria (chi(2) tests, P < 0.05 in all cases). Of 331 limpets eaten during trials, only 12% were Siphonaria. Whelks refused the tissue of Siphonaria while accepting Patella. Gobies ate Siphonaria tissue, but were then reluctant to feed again. Anemones showed no difference in their response to tissues of the two species.
   Coating Patella tissue with the ether-soluble organic fraction of a chemical extracted from Siphonaria using acetone did not affect feeding by gobies. However, starfish which were touched by a glass rod smeared with Siphonaria mucus or extract suffered temporary paralysis of the tube-feet. Patella which had their shells coated with Siphonaria extract were eaten significantly less often by starfish. This effect was strongly dose dependent. We conclude that avoidance of Siphonaria by those predators capable of attacking live individuals was due to chemical defence, the active components being present in both the mucus and the foot tissues.

AB A primate community was studied in a fluvial tropical rain forest island, in the northernmost part of Brazilian Amazonia, in the State of Roraima. Density and biomass were determined, and the differences between the forest types were assessed. The line-transect method was used from the east towards the centre of the island. No previous studies had been carried out in this remote undisturbed area. Density and biomass varied between the forest types, as well as between frugivorous primates; the smaller-bodied species were more abundant in the forest that was richer in fruiting trees, while they were absent from a monodominant forest. The folivorous, or partly folivorous, primates were abundant in those forests with less fruiting trees. The abundance of the primates in the different forest types was shown to be a function of food availability.

AB Between October 1987 and September 1989, the British Ornithologists' Union Colombia Expedition recorded 16 species of hummingbird at Matamata in the Amacayacu National Park, Amazonas, Colombia, Most of these species were resident breeders at the study site although two appeared to be local migrants. Six species of hermit hummingbirds (subfamily Phaethornithinae) occurred at Matamata; although very similar in general morphology and behaviour, they showed different preferences for habitat, food plants and foraging technique, Hermits were predominant in the forest, but in areas of secondary vegetation and along riverine borders,"typical" hummingbirds (subfamily Trochilinae) wore more common. The study site consisted of terra firme and varzea forest and an area of riverine secondary vegetation and contained around 60 species of flowering plants visited by hummingbirds. In contrast with most groups of organisms, hummingbirds and hummingbird-pollinated plants had similar species diversity in primary forest and secondary habitats, The overall abundance of hummingbirds and flowers was significantly higher in areas of riverine secondary growth. The hummingbird community at Matamata is remarkably species rich when compared with study sites elsewhere in North and South America, However, random null model comparisons among Amazonian hummingbird communities reveal that they share many characteristics in their structure and show a high degree of species overlap.

AB For sustainable logging to be achieved in tropical forests, there must be successful gap-phase regeneration to restock: the logged-over area. This study examined three aspects of gap-phase regeneration in selectively logged lowland swamp forest of northeast Costa Rica. First, logging gaps were censused immediately after extraction to determine the density of advanced regeneration. Stem density and basal area of residual trees greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh in logging gaps was >85% lower than undisturbed forest, and all trees in gaps had sustained structural damage. The common canopy species Pentaclethra macroloba (Fabaceae) was the most abundant species in gaps whereas the timber tree Carapa nicaraguensis (Meliaceae) was absent from all censused gaps. This suggests that canopy replacement, particularly by Carapa, will depend on trees <10 cm dbh or by seed input into logging gaps. Second, the diversity of the understorey was compared with. 6-y old single-tree and multiple-tree logging gaps. Multiple-tree logging gaps were the most diverse, but dominated by two ruderal species; however many shade-tolerant species were present in those gaps. This indicates that controlled selective logging can result in a localized shift in species composition, but that logging gaps should return to pre-logging composition with time under a carefully implemented, controlled harvesting regime. Finally, this study found a significant effect of a fringing Carapa tree on logging gap seedling density. Thus, seed arrival into gaps is a barrier to logging gap regeneration, particularly for a large-seeded tree species. Gap-phase regeneration by a large-seeded tree species in managed forest would benefit from seed broadcasting into gaps.

AB The reproductive biology of Manettia luteo-rubra was studied in the coastal montane Atlantic rain forest of southeastern Brazil. This Rubiaceae is a perennial vine that flowers all the year round, but has a flowering peak during the dry season. It presents reciprocal herkogamy, thus the plants are morphologically distylous. The morphs occur in a 1:1 ratio, and pollen diameter and corolla length vary between short and long-styled flowers. Manettia luteo-rubra displays typical heterostylous self-incompatibility and sets almost no fruits from self- or intramorph pollinations. The flowers are tubular, red with yellow lobes, and odourless. Anthesis is asynchronous, and the Bowers last about four days. Concentration of sugars in nectar is similar in both morphs, ca. 24%, this concentration being typical for hummingbird flowers. Three species of hummingbirds are the major pollinators of the flowers of M. luteo-rubra at the study site: the hermits Phaethornis eurynome and P. squalidus, and the trochiline Thalurania glaucopis. Three species of Heliconius butterflies act as minor pollinators. Both morphs of M. luteo-rubra exhibit natu ral fruit-set of about 80%, this reproductive output being maintained throughout the year by the pollinators' constancy to the flowers.

AB Differences in zooid skeletal ontogeny are strongly linked to the distribution of bryozoan species, even along such large-scale environmental gradients as depth and latitude. Three growth patterns broadly characterize zooid formation for encrusting cheilostome bryozoans: zooidal and intrazooidal budding, which facilitate growth in two dimensions at colony margins; and frontal budding, which also permits upward growth in the third dimension. Analyses of skeletal growth patterns of encrusting species present in 230 Recent assemblages from the North Atlantic, Mediterranean, North Sea, and Gulf of Mexico show that species with zooidal budding dominate over-whelmingly at lower latitudes and in shallower water, as assessed by percentages of species within assemblages. In contrast, patterns within moderately diverse fossil assemblages from North America indicate that within the geographic and environmental limits sampled, species with intrazooidal budding once dominated and probably originated in shallow, warm water environments. Intrazooidal budding now occurs with greater relative frequency among species from deeper and higher latitude assemblages. Patterns for frontal budding suggest a slight decrease with increasing depth, but no consistent relationship with latitude. These paleoenvironmental trends occur within a putatively monophyletic clade and are markedly simular to onshore/offshore trends recognized in other groups of marine benthos, based on patterns of occurrence of supra-specific taxa and novel morphotypes. Results presented here are based on relative dominance of species within assemblages and thus provide a novel comparative test of these previously reported trends.

AB Quantifying the abundance of species is essential to ecology, evolution, and conservation. The distribution of species abundances is fundamental to numerous longstanding questions in ecology, yet the empirical pattern at the global scale remains unresolved, with a few species' abundance well known but most poorly characterized. In large part because of heterogeneous data, few methods exist that can scale up to all species across the globe. Here, we integrate data from a suite of well-studied species with a global dataset of bird occurrences throughout the world-for 9,700 species (-92% of all extant species)-and use missing data theory to estimate speciesspecific abundances with associated uncertainty. We find strong evidence that the distribution of species abundances is log left skewed: there are many rare species and comparatively few common species. By aggregating the species-level estimates, we find that there are -50 billion individual birds in the world at present. The global-scale abundance estimates that we provide will allow for a line of inquiry into the structure of abundance across biogeographic realms and feeding guilds as well as the consequences of life history (e.g., body size, range size) on population dynamics. Importantly, our method is repeatable and scalable: as data quantity and quality increase, our accuracy in tracking temporal changes in global biodiversity will increase. Moreover, we provide the methodological blueprint for quantifying species-specific abundance, along with uncertainty, for any organism in the world.

AB Deforestation in Indonesia in recent decades has made increasingly large parts of the region vulnerable to fires. Burning is particularly widespread in deforested peatlands, and it leads to globally significant carbon emissions. Here we use satellite-based observations to assess loss and fragmentation of primary forests and associated changes in fire regimes in Sumatra and Kalimantan between 2001 and 2019. We find that fires did not penetrate undisturbed primary forest areas deeper than two kilometres from the forest edge irrespective of drought conditions. However, fire-resistant forest now covers only 3% of peatlands and 4.5% of non-peatlands; the majority of the remaining primary forests are severely fragmented or degraded due to proximity to the forest edge. We conclude that protection and regeneration of the remaining blocks of contiguous primary forest, as well as peatland restoration, are urgently needed to mitigate the impacts of potentially more frequent fire events under future global warming.

AB The optimal partitioning theory predicts that plants of a given species acclimate to different environments by allocating a larger proportion of biomass to the organs acquiring the most limiting resource. Are similar patterns found across species adapted to environments with contrasting levels of abiotic stress? We tested the optimal partitioning theory by analysing how fractional biomass allocation to leaves, stems and roots differed between woody species with different tolerances of shade and drought in plants of different age and size (seedlings to mature trees) using a global dataset including 604 species. No overarching biomass allocation patterns at different tolerance values across species were found. Biomass allocation varied among functional types as a result of phenological (deciduous vs evergreen broad-leaved species) and broad phylogenetical (angiosperms vs gymnosperms) differences. Furthermore, the direction of biomass allocation responses between tolerant and intolerant species was often opposite to that predicted by the optimal partitioning theory. We conclude that plant functional type is the major determinant of biomass allocation in woody species. We propose that interactions between plant functional type, ontogeny and species-specific stress tolerance adaptations allow woody species with different shade and drought tolerances to display multiple biomass partitioning strategies.

AB Although studies of biogeography in soil bacterial communities have attracted considerable attention, the generality of these patterns along with assembly processes and underlying drivers is poorly understood in the inner tissues of plants. Plant tissues provide unique ecological habitats for microorganisms, which play an essential role in plant performance. Here, we compared core bacterial communities among five soil-plant associated compartments of common bean across five sampling sites in China. Neutral and null modelling consistently suggested that stochastic processes dominated the core community assembly processes and escalated from the belowground compartments to the inner tissues of aerial plant parts. The multiple distance-decay relationships also varied and had flattened patterns in the stem endosphere, which were shaped by distinct environmental factors in each compartment. Coexistence patterns also varied in topological features, in addition with the sparsest networks in the stem endosphere resulted from the interaction with the stochastic processes. This study considerably expanded our understanding of various biogeographic patterns, assembly processes, and the underlying mechanisms of core bacterial communities between aerial and belowground compartments of common bean. That will provide a scientific basis for the reasonable regulation of core bacterial consortia to get better plant performance.

AB The long-lived tree speciesEschweilera tenuifolia(O. Berg) Miers is characteristic of oligotrophic Amazonian black-water floodplain forests (igapo), seasonally inundated up to 10 months per year, often forming monodominant stands. We investigatedE. tenuifolia' growth and mortality patterns in undisturbed (Jau National Park - JNP) and disturbedigapos(Uatuma Sustainable Development Reserve - USDR, downstream of the Balbina hydroelectric dam). We analysed age-diameter relationships, basal area increment (BAI) through 5-cm diameter classes, growth changes and growth ratios preceding death, BAI clustering, BAI ratio, and dated the individual year of death (C-14). Growth and mortality patterns were then related to climatic or anthropogenic disturbances. Results were similar for both populations for estimated maximum ages (JNP, 466 yr; USDR, 498 yr, except for one USDR tree with an estimated age of 820 yr) and slightly different for mean diameter increment (JNP: 2.04 mm; USDR: 2.28 mm). Living trees from JNP showed altered growth post-1975 and sparse tree mortality occurred at various times, possibly induced by extreme hydroclimatic events. In contrast with the JNP, abrupt growth changes and massive mortality occurred in the USDR after the dam construction began (1983). Even more than 30 yr after dam construction, flood-pulse alteration continues to affect both growth and mortality ofE. tenuifolia. Besides its vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbances, this species is also susceptible to long-lasting dry and wet periods induced by climatic events, the combination of both processes may cause its local and regional extinction.

AB From its inception as a scientific discipline, tree-ring research has been used as a trans-disciplinary tool for dating and environmental reconstruction. Tree-ring chronologies in some regions extend back many thousands of years, opening up new potential for the study of climate, people, and ecology at annual and sub-annual resolution. As such, they are a frequently used resource for a diverse range of studies spanning the Holocene. They are also the focus of a constantly evolving array of analytical techniques and multidisciplinary approaches to research questions. This literature review discusses case studies at the cutting-edge of interdisciplinary tree-ring research, notes recent breakthroughs and limitations, and identifies key frontiers for the future of tree-ring research.

AB Loss of habitat area and structural heterogeneity through anthropogenic fragmentation poses a threat to the survival of wildlife, which may be exacerbated by urban pressures. Understanding the underlying ecological processes that influence species' persistence in fragmented landscapes is vital for conservation. We described the effects of forest fragmentation via measures of patch size and isolation on the taxonomic richness and functional richness of forest bird communities in five Protected Areas within the urban-forest mosaic of the Durban Metropolitan Area, South Africa. We conducted 137 fixed-radius point-count surveys across 41 distinct forest patches during the austral breeding season. We quantified the avian taxonomic, guild and functional richness and measured at each survey patch. We measured the influence of patch size, Euclidean isolation distance, patch shape and habitat configuration (i.e. habitat amount) on each diversity measure. We then conducted a series of General Linear Models to determine how fragmentation and patch configuration influenced the diversity of forest birds. The explanatory variables in the top models had a significant effect on all avian diversity measures but habitat amount did not. The amount of habitat surrounding a patch was not significant for measures of bird diversity but based on the Akaike's weight it was important for specialist species. Isolation distance did not have a significant effect on the measures of bird diversity. An increase in patch shape index increased species richness. These results show the importance of large forest fragments/patches for the conservation of forest birds and for maintaining ecosystem functioning and services of forests in increasingly urbanising landscapes, to the benefit of the environment and its human population.

AB Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle. High-resolution remote sensing techniques, e.g., spaceborne lidar, can measure complex tropical forest structures, but it remains a challenge how to interpret such information for the assessment of forest biomass and productivity. Here, we develop an approach to estimate basal area, aboveground biomass and productivity within Amazonia by matching 770,000 GLAS lidar (ICESat) profiles with forest simulations considering spatial heterogeneous environmental and ecological conditions. This allows for deriving frequency distributions of key forest attributes for the entire Amazon. This detailed interpretation of remote sensing data improves estimates of forest attributes by 20-43% as compared to (conventional) estimates using mean canopy height. The inclusion of forest modeling has a high potential to close a missing link between remote sensing measurements and the 3D structure of forests, and may thereby improve continent-wide estimates of biomass and productivity.

AB A new threat now confronts the Amazon in the form of a massive infrastructure program, the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America, or IIRSA. This article presents results of a projection analysis showing that IIRSA could push the Amazonian forest past a "tipping point,'' replacing it with tropical savanna. Such an event would degrade biodiversity, reduce carbon storage, and harm continental agriculture, dependent on moisture transport from forest-based rainfall recycling. The article considers environmental policy in Brazil and discusses its weakening over time. One short-term approach to conservation is provided by indigenous resistance to development forces. The article presents a case study of the Munduruku people, who recently stopped construction of a large dam on the Tapajos River in defending their territories. It argues that more research is needed to understand the impacts of IIRSA, which is proceeding in the dark.

AB Defining the reference system for restoration projects in regions characterized by complex vegetation mosaics is challenging. Here we use the Cerrado region of Brazil as an example of the importance of clearly defining multiple natural and anthropogenically altered states in grassland-savanna-forest mosaics. We define three main, natural vegetation types-grassland, savanna, and scleromorphic (cerradao) forest-to (1) distinguish between original and degraded states and (2) set appropriate targets for and guide restoration. We contend that the differences in Cerrado vegetation composition originally were driven by soil conditions and secondarily by fire frequency and precipitation patterns that differ from the core to the edge of the Cerrado region. Grasslands are found on the shallowest, least fertile soils and/or in waterlogged soils; scleromorphic forests are generally located on deeper, more fertile soils; and savannas occupy an intermediate position. In recent decades, this biophysical template has been overlain by a range of human land-use intensities that strongly affect resilience, resulting in alternative anthropogenic states. For example, areas that were originally scleromorphic forest are likely to regenerate naturally following low- or medium-intensity land use due to extensive resprouting of woody plants, whereas grassland restoration requires reintroduction of grass and forb species that do not tolerate soil disturbance and exotic grass competition. Planting trees into historic grasslands results in inappropriate restoration targets and often restoration failure. Correctly identifying original vegetation types is critical to most effectively allocate scarce restoration funding.

AB 1. Nutrient resorption from senescing leaves prior to litterfall is a strategy for nutrient conservation in vascular plants. However, the mechanisms through which soil fertility and/or foliar nutrient status affect nutrient resorption are not yet fully known.
   2. We used two 1,000-m-wide altitudinal gradients on two different bedrock types (carbonate and silicate) for analysing the interactive effects of temperature and soil chemistry on the resorption efficiency of two major nutrients, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Our objective was to assess how nutrient resorption varied across the gradients through the adaptation of individual species to changing environmental conditions rather than through changes in species composition.
   3. Both N and P resorption efficiency increased across the altitudinal gradients independent of bedrock type. The main process regulating nutrient resorption was a negative feedback to nutrient availability in the soil. The negative feedback of nutrient resorption efficiency to soil nutrient status was unrelated to total soil nutrient contents but depended on concentrations of organic N forms for nitrogen resorption efficiency (NRE) and on inorganic P forms for phosphorus resorption efficiency (PRE), respectively.
   4. While we hypothesized that the resorption of P, as a principally rock-derived nutrient, depended on physical-chemical processes affected by soil chemistry, our results showed that microbial P mineralization was the main source of inorganic P supply to the plants. Both NRE and PRE were effective to improve the growth potential of plants, but there was no evidence of stoichiometric adaptations of N:P RE-to-nutrient ratio in the soil.

AB 1. The enemy-induced Janzen-Connell ( JC) effect, a classic model invoking conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and distance dependence, is a primary biodiversity maintenance hypothesis. Yet, conflicting evidence for the JC effect leads to disagreement about its role in maintaining forest diversity.
   2. We focus this review on soil-borne pathogens, which are the primary agent inducing the JC effect in many forest ecosystems. Although the test of the pathogeninduced JC effect in ecology critically rests on the seedling mortality caused by soil pathogens, what has not been explicitly explored in the early literature but has increasingly received attention is the long-recognized fact that the environment can alter virulence of pathogens and host susceptibility (thus pathogen-host interactions), as predicted by the classic disease triangle framework enlightened by pathology research in agricultural systems.
   3. Here, following the disease triangle framework we review evidence on how the pathogen-induced JC effect may be contingent on context (e.g. environmental conditions, pathogen inoculum load and genetic divergence in host and pathogen populations). The reviewed evidence reveals and clarifies the conditions where pathogens may or may not cause disease to hosts, thus contributing to reconciling the inconsistent results about the pathogen-induced JC effect in the literature. The context dependence of the disease triangle predicts that the pathogen-induced JC effect would change under global change.
   4. Gaining insights from evidence that the pathogen-induced JC effect is context-dependent, we suggest that future tests on the JC hypothesis be conducted under the framework of disease triangle, and we stress the necessity by controlling the effect of context factors on plant-pathogen interactions when testing for the JC effect. We conclude the review by proposing three lines of future research for testing the importance of the JC effect in maintaining global forest tree species diversity, with a particular emphasis on testing the effect of global warming on the strength of pathogen-host interactions for better predicting changes of forest biodiversity under climate change.

AB Tropical forest ecosystems harbor high biodiversity, but they have suffered from ongoing human-induced degradation. We investigated the conservation value of moist evergreen Afromontane forest sites across gradients of site-level disturbance, landscape context and forest history in southwestern Ethiopia. We surveyed woody plants at 108 randomly selected sites and grouped them into forest specialist, pioneer, and generalist species. First, we investigated if coffee dominance, current distance from the forest edge, forest history, heat load and altitude structured the variation in species composition using constrained correspondence analysis. Second, we modelled species richness in response to the same explanatory variables. Our findings show that woody plant community composition was significantly structured by altitude, forest history, coffee dominance and current distance from forest edge. Specifically, (1) total species richness and forest specialist species richness were affected by coffee management intensity; (2) forest specialist species richness increased, while pioneer species decreased with increasing distance from the forest edge; and (3) forest specialist species richness was lower in secondary forest compared to in primary forest. These findings show that coffee management intensity, landscape context and forest history in combination influence local and landscape level biodiversity. We suggest conservation strategies that foster the maintenance of large undisturbed forest sites and that prioritize local species in managed and regenerating forests. Creation of a biosphere reserve and shade coffee certification could be useful to benefit both effective conservation and people's livelihoods.

AB Unconditional conservation payments are increasingly used by non-governmental conservation organizations to further their environmental objectives. One key objective in many conservation projects that use such unconditional payments schemes is the protection of tropical forest ecosystems in buffer zone areas around protected parks where the scope of instating mandatory restrictions is more limited. We use a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of unconditional livelihood payments to local communities on land use outside a protected area-the Gola Rainforest National Park-which is a biodiversity hotspot on the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia. High resolution RapidEye satellite imagery from before and after the intervention was used to determine land use changes in treated and control villages. We find support for the hypothesis that unconditional payments, in this setting, increase land clearance in the short run. The study constitutes one of the first attempts to use evidence from a randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy of conservation payments and provides insights for further research.

AB The objective of this study is to characterize and quantify the "trans-spatial nexus synergy" benefit of subsidized water ponding in the water-energy-food nexus in Kumamoto, Japan. After years of decreased rice production in upstream areas and associated declines in groundwater levels, the Kumamoto city government implemented a subsidy program whereby farmers in the Shira River basin receive payments to water their fields, which provides valuable groundwater recharge to downstream Kumamoto city. We quantify the economic benefits of this subsidy program, which include avoided additional energy costs to obtain scarcer levels of groundwater, as well as net revenue from the crops in the Shira River basin that would otherwise not be grown in the absence of the subsidy. These annual benefits can be combined and compared to the annual cost of the government subsidy. We also calculate potential historical losses that may have occurred in the region as a result of land use transitions from rice farming to urban use, which disrupted the nexus synergy between the watered fields and the groundwater table.

AB Rewilding has been an increasingly popular tool to restore plant-animal interactions and ecological processes impaired by defaunation. However, the reestablishment of such processes has seldom been assessed. We investigated the restoration of ecological interactions following the reintroduction of the brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba) to a defaunated Atlantic forest site. We expected the reintroduction to restore plant-animal interactions and interactions between howlers and dung beetles, which promote secondary seed dispersal. We estimated the number of interactions expected to be restored by the reintroduction to provide the baseline interaction richness that could be restored. We followed the reintroduced howler monkeys twice a week for 24 months (337 hours total) to assess their diet. We used howler monkey dung in secondary seed dispersal experiments with 2484 seed mimics to estimate the removal rates by dung beetles and collected the beetles to assess community attributes. We compared the potential future contribution of howler monkeys and other frugivores to seed dispersal based on the seed sizes they disperse in other areas where they occur. In 2 years, howler monkeys consumed 60 animal-dispersed plant species out of the 330 estimated. Twenty-one dung beetle species were attracted to experimentally provided dung; most of them were tunnelers, nocturnal, and large-sized (>10 mm). On average 30% (range 0-100%) of the large seed mimics (14 mm) were moved by dung beetles. About 91% of the species consumed by howlers (size range 0.3-34.3 mm) overlapped in seed size with those removed by dung beetles. In our study area, howler monkeys may consume more large-seeded fruit species than most other frugivores, highlighting their potential to affect forest regeneration. Our results show reintroductions may effectively restore ecological links and enhance ecological processes.

AB The Sao Francisco River basin is one of the most drought-prone regions of Brazil. Seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) are widely distributed in the basin and we developed a short chronology of Cedrela fissilis annual ring widths from SDTF fragments based on 89 cores from 44 trees dating from 1961 to 2015. The average correlation among all radii (RBAR) is 0.52. The tree-ring chronology is correlated with wet season precipitation totals, must strongly and consistently near the beginning of the wet season. The spatial pattern of correlation covers most of the southern portion of the Brazilian Drought Polygon and the sub-basins of the two largest tributaries of the Sao Francisco River, in some areas exceeding r = 0.60. The chronology is also correlated with total annual discharge of the Rio Sao Francisco River measured at Barra (r = 0.489; 1961-2015), which is very promising in a country that generates two thirds of its electricity from hydroelectric power plants, particularly if this short chronology can be extended with trees exceeding 150-years old known to still exist in the region.

AB The Atlantic Forest is a Neotropical biome encompassing mainly Brazil's coastline and parts of Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina, but today surviving largely in small degraded patches and protected areas. Being a region under threat of extinction of its biological components, little is known about how climate change could influence the biodiversity, dynamics, and stability of this ecosystem. Here, we analyze the response of tree-growth dynamics to regional climate variability and drought, both in temporal and spatial scale. For this purpose, five Cedrela spp forest sites located in the biogeographic region 'Serra do Mar' (AFSM) in southeastern Brazil was considered. This region contains the best-preserved secondary forests of the Atlantic Forest biome, a fact that represents a natural laboratory to ascertain the environmental influence on the tree development through large spatial scales. Correlation and regression analysis were used to explore the relationship between growth and rainfall, air temperature, and a drought index. Results indicate that tree growth performance is highly dependent to the dry season rainfall amounts in the most humid sector of the gradient, while sites settled in areas of lower summer temperatures, rainfall during the warm-rainy season is the main determining factor influencing tree-growth dynamics. This implies that the same environmental factor (rainfall) affect differentially the growth of Cedrela sites depending on the sector in the gradient in which they are. We found that the population located at the highest-altitude site experienced a growth decline in recent decades linked to increases of winter regional warming, being more sensitivity to long periods of drought (6-10 years). In summary, the seasonal response of cambium activity in AFSM trees to rainfall varies across a climatic gradient. These results are crucial to understand how the present and future global change may differentially impact on tree population dynamics of montane Neotropical forests. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Recently, it has been shown that nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) additions lead to different effects on grassland diversity. While N additions decrease species richness, the effects of P additions are mainly neutral. This contribution focuses on the mechanisms behind this observed pattern. First, I elaborate on three classical hypotheses explaining the diversity response to nutrient enrichment. These hypotheses highlight the roles of above ground competition ('the light asymmetry hypothesis'), above and below ground interactions ('the total competition hypothesis') and litter production ('the litter hypothesis'). I test whether these hypotheses are able to explain the differences between N and P additions using data from the nutrient network, a globally distributed experiment (including 45 sites from five continents). I show that N addition leads to species loss (c.13%) but P addition has no net effect on species richness. Furthermore, the effects of N and P additions on richness are mediated by biomass, litter and light availability as proposed by the general hypotheses. Nonetheless, there are additional (biomass independent) effects of N addition on species richness. These effects elucidate the main limitation of the general hypotheses that do not explicitly consider the differences between N and P additions. Hence, I review the current knowledge on the differences between N and P additions by integrating the specific characteristics of N and P with the potential mechanisms proposed by ecological theory. The review focuses on mechanisms mediated by soil chemistry and stoichiometry, variation in light acquisition among species as well as species pool size of different functional groups. These mechanisms are incorporated into a detailed graphical model that allows testing the old and new hypotheses presented in this contribution.

AB Soil fungi are key mediators of negative density-dependent mortality in seeds and seedlings, and the ability to withstand pathogens in the shaded understory of closed-canopy forests could reinforce light gradient partitioning by tree species. For four species of tropical rainforest trees-two shade-tolerant and two shade-intolerant-we conducted a field experiment to examine the interactive effects of fungal pathogens, light, and seed density on germination and early seedling establishment. In a fully factorial design, seeds were sown into 1 m(2) plots containing soil collected from underneath conspecific adult trees, with plots assigned to forest edge (high light) or shaded understory, high or low density, and fungicide or no fungicide application. We monitored total seed germination and final seedling survival over 15 weeks. Shade-intolerant species were strongly constrained by light; their seedlings survived only at the edge. Fungicide application significantly improved seedling emergence and/or survival for three of the four focal species. There were no significant interactions between fungicide and seed density, suggesting that pathogen spread with increased aggregation of seeds and seedlings did not contribute to pathogen-mediated mortality. Two species experienced significant edge-fungicide interactions, but fungicide effects in edge vs. interior forest varied with species and recruitment stage. Our results suggest that changes to plant-pathogen interactions could affect plant recruitment in human-impacted forests subject to fragmentation and edge-effects.

AB Moist evergreen forests of southwestern Ethiopia host high levels of biodiversity and have a high economic value due to coffee production. Coffee is a native shrub that is harvested under different management systems; its production can have both beneficial and detrimental effects for biodiversity. We investigated how bird community composition and richness, and abundance of different bird groups responded to different intensities of coffee management and the landscape context. We surveyed birds at 66 points in forest habitat with different intensities of coffee management and at different distances from the forest edge. We explored community composition using detrended correspondence analysis in combination with canonical correspondence analysis and indicator species analysis, and used generalized linear mixed models to investigate the responses of different bird groups to coffee management and landscape context. Our results show that (1) despite considerable bird diversity including some endemics, species turnover in the forest was relatively low; (2) total richness and abundance of birds were not affected by management or landscape context; but (3) the richness of forest and dietary specialists increased with higher forest naturalness, and with increasing distance from the edge and amount of forest cover. These findings show that traditional shade coffee management practices can maintain a diverse suite of forest birds. To conserve forest specialists, retaining undisturbed, remote forest is particularly important, but structurally diverse locations near the forest edge can also harbour a high diversity of specialists.

AB Root structures secreting carboxylates and phosphatases are thought to enhance a plant's phosphorus (P) acquisition. But do closely related species with and without such structures really differ in root exudation, P mobilization, or ecological niche? We investigated this by comparing 23 European Carex species with and without 'dauciform roots' (DRs).
   Plants grown in pots with sand were screened for DR formation, phosphatase activities, carboxylate exudation, and utilization of various organic and inorganic P compounds. Ecological niches were compared using ecological indicator values and nutrient concentrations of plant shoots in natural habitats.
   Species of subgenus Carex formed DRs, while species of subgenus Vignea did not. Species with DRs had higher root diesterase activity than species without DRs, exuded more citrate but less oxalate and less total carboxylates, and allocated less biomass to roots. Species with and without DRs showed similar growth responses to different forms of P and different amounts of P supplied; their natural habitats do not differ in soil fertility or degree of P limitation.
   Despite some differences in physiological function, DRs did not influence the P acquisition and nutritional niche of European Carex species, suggesting that species with and without DRs do not exhibit distinct P-acquisition strategies.

AB Temperate ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi show segregation whereby some species dominate in organic layers and others favor mineral soils. Weak layering in tropical soils is hypothesized to decrease niche space and therefore reduce the diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi.
   The Neotropical ECM tree Dicymbe corymbosa forms monodominant stands and has a distinct physiognomy with vertical crown development, adventitious roots and massive root mounds, leading to multi-stemmed trees with spatially segregated rooting environments: aerial litter caches, aerial decayed wood, organic root mounds and mineral soil. We hypothesized that these microhabitats host distinct fungal assemblages and therefore promote diversity.
   To test our hypothesis, we sampled D.corymbosa ectomycorrhizal root tips from the four microhabitats and analyzed community composition based on pyrosequencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) barcode markers.
   Several dominant fungi were ubiquitous but analyses nonetheless suggested that communities in mineral soil samples were statistically distinct from communities in organic microhabitats. These data indicate that distinctive rooting zones of D.corymbosa contribute to spatial segregation of the fungal community and likely enhance fungal diversity.

AB Ecuador, a country with nearly unparalleled levels of biodiversity and endemism, has one of the highest deforestation rates of South America. I examined whether governmentally protected areas in Ecuador have been effective at reducing deforestation. After estimating deforestation rates from existing land cover change data for 2000 to 2008, I used a matching approach to compare the rates of forest loss inside and outside protected areas, which corrected for geographic biases in the locations of protected areas. I tested for the effects of protected area age, size and level of protection on the rate of deforestation using generalized linear models. Governmentally protected areas still experienced deforestation - with no apparent effect of age, size and level of protection - of nearly 10,000 ha per year, but deforestation rates were lower inside compared to outside protected areas. Governmental protection led to the avoidance of additional deforestation of 2600-7800 ha of natural forest per year. Actions to mitigate deforestation in Ecuador are of global importance and as such it is promising that protected areas can help diminish deforestation, although the effectiveness of Ecuador's protected areas can still be improved upon.

AB Models that accurately predict forest interception are essential both for water balance studies and for assessing watershed responses to changes in land use and the long-term climate variability. This paper compares the performance of four rainfall interception models-the sparse Gash (1995), Rutter et al. (1975), Liu (1997) and two new models (NvMxa and NvMxb)-using data from four spatially extensive, structurally diverse forest ecosystems in Mexico. Ninety-eight case studies measuring interception in tropical dry (25), arid/semi-arid (29), temperate (26), and tropical montane cloud forests (18) were compiled and analyzed. Coefficients derived from raw data or published statistical relationships were used as model input to evaluate multi-storm forest interception at the case study scale. On average empirical data showed that, tropical montane cloud, temperate, arid/semi-arid and tropical dry forests intercepted 14%, 18%, 22% and 26% of total precipitation, respectively. The models performed well in predicting interception, with mean deviations between measured and modeled interception as a function of total precipitation (ME) generally <5.8% and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency E estimators >0.66. Model fitting precision was dependent on the forest ecosystem. Arid/semi-arid forests exhibited the smallest, while tropical montane cloud forest displayed the largest ME deviations. Improved agreement between measured and modeled data requires modification of in-storm evaporation rate in the Liu; the canopy storage in the sparse Gash model; and the throughfall coefficient in the Rutter and the NvMx models. This research concludes on recommending the wide application of rainfall interception models with some caution as they provide mixed results. The extensive forest interception data source, the fitting and testing of four models, the introduction of a new model, and the availability of coefficient values for all four forest ecosystems are an important source of information and a benchmark for future investigations in this area of hydrology.

AB Standard procedures to assess P availability in soils are based on batch experiments with various extractants. However, in most soils P nutrition is less limited by bulk stocks but by strong adsorption and transport limitation. The basic principle of root-phosphate uptake is to strip phosphate locally from the solid phase by forming a radial depletion zone in the soil solution, optionally enhanced by release of mobilizing substances. Microdialysis (MD), a well-established method in pharmacokinetics, is capable to mimic important characteristics of P root uptake. The sampling is by diffusional exchange through a semipermeable membrane covering the probes with their sub-mm tubular structure. Additionally, the direct environment of the probe can be chemically modified by adding, e.g., carboxylates to the perfusate. This study is the first approach to test the applicability of MD in assessing plant available phosphate in soils and to develop a framework for its appropriate use.We used MD in stirred solutions to quantify the effect of pumping rate, concomitant ions, and pH value on phosphate recovery. Furthermore, we measured phosphate yield of top-soil material from a beech forest, a non-fertilized grassland, and from a fertilized corn field. Three perfusates have been used based on a 1 mM KNO3 solution: pure (1), with 0.1 mM citric acid (2), and with 1 mM citric acid(3). Additionally, a radial diffusion model has been parametrized for the stirred solutions and the beech forest soil.Results from the tests in stirred solutions were in good agreement with reported observations obtained for other ionic species. This shows the principal suitability of the experimental setup for phosphate tests. We observed a significant dependency of phosphate uptake into the MD probes on dialysate pumping rate and on ionic strength of the outside solution. In the soils, we observed uptake rates of the probes between 1.5x 10(-15) and 6.7 x 10(-14) mol s(-1) cm(-1) in case of no citrate addition. Surprisingly, median uptake rates were mostly independent of the bulk soil stocks, but the P-fertilized soil revealed a strong tailing towards higher values. This indicates the occurrence of hot P spots in soils. Citrate addition increased P yields only in the higher concentration but not in the forest soil. The order of magnitude of MD uptake rates from the soil samples matched root-length related uptake rates from other studies. The micro-radial citrate release in MD reflects the processes controlling phosphate mobilization in the rhizosphere better than measurements based on flooding of soil samples with citric acid in batch experiments. Important challenges in MD with phosphate are small volumes of dialysate with extremely low concentrations and a high variability of results due to soil heterogeneity and between-probe variability. We conclude that MD is a promising tool to complement existing P-analytical procedures, especially when spatial aspects or the release of mobilizing substances are in focus.

AB Drylands account globally for 30% of terrestrial net primary production and 20% of soil organic carbon. Present ecosystem models under predict litter decay in drylands, limiting assessments of biogeochemical cycling at multiple scales. Overlooked decomposition drivers, such as soil-litter mixing (SLM), may account for part of this model-measurement disconnect. We documented SLM and decomposition in relation to the formation of soil-microbial films and microbial extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) in the North American Chihuahuan Desert by placing mesh bags containing shrub (Prosopis glandulosa) foliar litter on the soil surface within contrasting vegetation microsites. Mass loss (in terms of k, the decay constant) was best described by the degree of SLM and soil-microbial film cover. EEA was greatest during periods of rapid litter decomposition and associated SLM. Soil-microbial film cover on litter surfaces increased over time and was greater in bare ground microsites (50% litter surface area covered) compared to shrub and grass microsites (37 and 33% covered, respectively). Soil aggregates that formed in association with decomposing leaf material had organic C and N concentrations 1.5-2x that of local surface soils. Micrographs of soil aggregates revealed a strong biotic component in their structure, suggesting that microbial decomposition facilitates aggregate formation and their C and N content. Decomposition drivers in arid lands fall into two major categories, abiotic and biotic, and it is challenging to ascertain their relative importance. The temporal synchrony between surface litter mass loss, EEA, biotic film development, and aggregate formation observed in this study supports the hypothesis that SLM enhances decomposition on detached litter by promoting conditions favorable for microbial processes. Inclusion of interactions between SLM and biological drivers will improve the ability of ecosystem models to predict decomposition rates and dynamics in drylands.

We compared a high-intensity land-use area, where the forest that had been cleared, and used for subsistence agriculture before being abandoned in 1934 then regrew to a low-intensity land-use area, in which there had been only some selective experimental logging by the USDA Forest Service in the 1940s. Prior to our study, both areas were strongly affected by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and again damaged to a lesser degree by Hurricane Georges in 1998, increasing canopy openness and subsequently increasing tree stem densities. Between 2001 and 2015, changes in the light environment and the recovery of forest structure resulted in roughly a 50% reduction in tree stem densities in the high-intensity land-use area, as recruited saplings naturally thinned. In this area, liana abundance increased by 103%, liana biomass tripled, and occupancy of trees by lianas grew by nearly 50%. In the low-intensity land-use area, juvenile stem densities were stable, and resultantly liana abundance only increased by 33%, liana biomass rose 39%, and the occupancy of trees was constant. Liana flower and fruit production increased over the 14-year interval, and these increases were much greater in the high-intensity land-use quadrats. Results of this study do show how rapid forest tree successional dynamics coincide with liana increases, but the confounding of hurricane effects of disturbance at our site, prevent us from asserting that the increases in liana density and biomass can be attributed to the same causes as those in forests elsewhere in the Neotropics.

AB Disentangling the mechanisms that shape community assembly across diversity gradients is a central matter in ecology. While many studies have explored community assembly through species average trait values, there is a growing understanding that intraspecific trait variation (ITV) can also play a critical role in species coexistence. Classic biodiversity theory hypothesizes that higher diversity at species-rich sites can arise from narrower niches relative to species-poor sites, which would be reflected in reduced ITV as species richness increases. To explore how ITV in woody plant communities changes with species richness, we compiled leaf trait data (leaf size and specific leaf area) in a total of 521 woody plant species from 21 forest communities that differed dramatically in species richness, ranging from boreal to tropical rainforests. At each forest, we assessed ITV as an estimate of species niche breadth and we quantified the degree of trait overlap among co-occurring species as a measure of species functional similarity. We found ITV was relatively invariant across the species richness gradient. In addition, we found that species functional similarity increased with diversity. Contrary to the expectation from classic biodiversity theory, our results rather suggest that neutral processes or equalizing mechanisms can be acting as potential drivers shaping community assembly in hyperdiverse forests.

AB Recent work has shown that the behaviour of marine organisms can be affected by elevated P-CO2, although little is known about the effect of multiple stressors. We therefore investigated the effect of elevated P-CO2 and temperature on locomotion and behaviour during prey searching in the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas, a predator characteristic of the southeastern Pacific coast. Movement duration, decision time, route finding and lateralization were measured using a T-maze tank with a prey positioned behind a barrier. Four treatments, representing present day and near-future scenarios of ocean acidification and warming were used in rearing the individuals for 6 months. Regardless of the treatment, no significant differences were found in relative and absolute lateralization before and after exposure for 6 months. However, relative lateralization was not repeatable for animals tested after 6 months at elevated P-CO2 at both experimental temperatures, whereas it was repeatable in individuals kept at the present day level of P-CO2. We suggest that these effects may be related to a behavioural malfunction caused by elevated P-CO2. Movement duration, decision time and route finding were not repeatable. However, movement duration and decision time increased and route finding decreased in elevated P-CO2 (at 15 degrees C), suggesting that elevated P-CO2 has negative effects on the locomotor and sensory performance of C. concholepas in the presence of a prey odour, thereby decreasing their ability to forage efficiently.

AB Over the past few decades there has been a growing realization that a large share of apparently virgin or old-growth tropical forests carries a legacy of past natural or anthropogenic disturbances that have a substantial effect on present-day forest composition, structure and dynamics. Yet, direct evidence of such disturbances is scarce and comparisons of disturbance dynamics across regions even more so. Here we present a tree-ring based reconstruction of disturbance histories from three tropical forest sites in Bolivia, Cameroon, and Thailand. We studied temporal patterns in tree regeneration of shade-intolerant tree species, because establishment of these trees is indicative for canopy disturbance. In three large areas (140-300 ha), stem disks and increment cores were collected for a total of 1154 trees (>5 cm diameter) from 12 tree species to estimate the age of every tree. Using these age estimates we produced population age distributions, which were analyzed for evidence of past disturbance. Our approach allowed us to reconstruct patterns of tree establishment over a period of around 250 years. In Bolivia, we found continuous regeneration rates of three species and a peaked age distribution of a long-lived pioneer species. In both Cameroon and Thailand we found irregular age distributions, indicating strongly reduced regeneration rates over a period of 10-60 years. Past fires, windthrow events or anthropogenic disturbances all provide plausible explanations for the reported variation in tree age across the three sites. Our results support the recent idea that the long-term dynamics of tropical forests are impacted by large-scale disturbance-recovery cycles, similar to those driving temperate forest dynamics.

AB A major gap in our understanding of biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships concerns the role of intra-and interspecific diversity of mycorrhizal fungi, which are critical for plant fitness, biogeochemical cycling and other processes. Here, we test the hypothesis that the identity and richness of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi at the intra-and interspecific levels affect ecosystem multifunctionality by regulating plant and fungal productivity, soil CO2 efflux and nutrient retention.
   Microcosms containing Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings colonized by different ECM fungal isolates, in monocultures and mixtures, enabled us to test for both intra-and interspecific identity and richness effects, and transgressive overyielding.
   Intra-and interspecific identity had modest but significant effects on plant and fungal productivity and nutrient retention, but no effect on CO2 efflux. Intraspecific richness increased plant root productivity and ECM root tips but decreased hyphal length, whereas interspecific richness had no effects. Interspecific mixtures outperformed the most productive monocultures in only 10% of the cases, compared with 42% for the intraspecific mixtures.
   Both intra-and interspecific identity and richness of ECM fungi regulate ecosystem multifunctionality, but their effects on the direction and magnitude of individual variables differ. Transgressive overyielding suggests that positive niche complementarity effects are driving some of the responses to intraspecific richness.

AB The Guayana Shield is one of the oldest geological formations in South America, ranging from southern Colombia, Venezuela, and the Guianas to the extreme north of the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Roraima. Because of its ancient origin and isolation from other mountain ranges in South America, it harbors a rich flora with high levels of endemism. Recent expeditions to remote areas in the Brazilian portion of the Guayana Shield generated many new herbarium collections. Through these efforts, we report the first records for Brazil of 57 species and infraspecific taxa of vascular plants. In most cases, the taxa are narrowly distributed and were previously known from nearby populations in other countries.

AB We address the issue of adapting landscapes for improved insect biodiversity conservation in a changing climate by assessing the importance of additive (main) and synergistic (interaction) effects of land cover and land use with climate.
   We test the hypotheses that ant richness (species and genus), abundance and diversity would vary according to land cover and land use intensity but that these effects would vary according to climate.
   We used a 1000 m elevation gradient in eastern Australia (as a proxy for a climate gradient) and sampled ant biodiversity along this gradient from sites with variable land cover and land use.
   Main effects revealed: higher ant richness (species and genus) and diversity with greater native woody plant canopy cover; and lower species richness with higher cultivation and grazing intensity, bare ground and exotic plant groundcover. Interaction effects revealed: both the positive effects of native plant canopy cover on ant species richness and abundance, and the negative effects of exotic plant groundcover on species richness were greatest at sites with warmer and drier climates.
   Impacts of climate change on insect biodiversity may be mitigated to some degree through landscape adaptation by increasing woody native vegetation cover and by reducing land use intensity, the cover of exotic vegetation and of bare ground. Evidence of synergistic effects suggests that landscape adaptation may be most effective in areas which are currently warmer and drier, or are projected to become so as a result of climate change.

AB The phyllosphere (comprising the leaf surface and interior) is one of the world's largest microbial habitats and is host to an abundant and diverse array of bacteria. Nonetheless, the degree to which bacterial communities are benign, harmful, or beneficial to plants in situ is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the net effect of reducing bacterial abundance and diversity would vary substantially among host species (from harmful to beneficial) and this would be strongly mediated by soil resource availability. To test this, we monitored tree seedling growth responses to commercial antibiotics among replicated resource supply treatments (N,P,K) in a tropical forest in Panama for 29months. We applied either antibiotics or control water to replicated seedlings of five common tree species (Alseis blackiana, Desmopsis panamensis, Heisteria concinna, Sorocea affinis, and Tetragastris panamensis). These antibiotic treatments significantly reduced both the abundance and diversity of bacteria epiphytically as well as endophytically. Overall, the effect of antibiotics on performance was highly host specific. Applying antibiotics increased growth for three species by as much as 49% (Alseis, Heisteria, and Tetragastris), decreased growth for a fourth species by nearly 20% (Sorocea), and had no impact on a fifth species (Desmopsis). Perhaps more importantly, the degree to which foliar bacteria were harmful or not varied with soil resource supply. Specifically, applying antibiotics had no effect when potassium was added but increased growth rate by almost 40% in the absence of potassium. Alternatively, phosphorus enrichment caused the effect of bacteria to switch from being primarily beneficial to harmful or vice versa, but this depended entirely on the presence or absence of nitrogen enrichment (i.e., important and significant interactions). Our results are the first to demonstrate that the net effect of reducing the abundance and diversity of bacteria can have very strong positive and negative effects on seedling performance. Moreover, these effects were clearly mediated by soil resource availability. Though speculative, we suggest that foliar bacteria may interact with soil fertility to comprise an important, yet cryptic dimension of niche differentiation, which can have important implications for species coexistence.

TI Litter Decomposition in a Semiarid Dune Grassland: Neutral Effect of
   Water Supply and Inhibitory Effect of Nitrogen Addition
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

AB Background
   The decomposition of plant material in arid ecosystems is considered to be substantially controlled by water and N availability. The responses of litter decomposition to external N and water, however, remain controversial, and the interactive effects of supplementary N and water also have been largely unexamined.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   A 3.5-year field experiment with supplementary nitrogen and water was conducted to assess the effects of N and water addition on mass loss and nitrogen release in leaves and fine roots of three dominant plant species (i.e., Artemisia halondendron, Setaria viridis, and Phragmites australis) with contrasting substrate chemistry (e.g. N concentration, lignin content in this study) in a desertified dune grassland of Inner Mongolia, China. The treatments included N addition, water addition, combination of N and water, and an untreated control. The decomposition rate in both leaves and roots was related to the initial litter N and lignin concentrations of the three species. However, litter quality did not explain the slower mass loss in roots than in leaves in the present study, and thus warrant further research. Nitrogen addition, either alone or in combination with water, significantly inhibited dry mass loss and N release in the leaves and roots of the three species, whereas water input had little effect on the decomposition of leaf litter and fine roots, suggesting that there was no interactive effect of supplementary N and water on litter decomposition in this system. Furthermore, our results clearly indicate that the inhibitory effects of external N on dry mass loss and nitrogen release are relatively strong in high-lignin litter compared with low-lignin litter.
   Conclusion/Significance
   These findings suggest that increasing precipitation hardly facilitates ecosystem carbon turnover but atmospheric N deposition can enhance carbon sequestration and nitrogen retention in desertified dune grasslands of northern China. Additionally, litter quality of plant species should be considered when modelling the carbon cycle and nutrient dynamics of this system.

AB Aims Spatial aggregation of soil chemical properties, or nutrient patches, may be generated by topography and plants and can seasonally fluctuate because of climate. Whether nutrient patches maintain consistency (no change in ranking through sequential sampling), through temporal scales, and whether topography and litterfall contribute to the persistence of such ranking is rarely tested.
   Methods In a 1-ha tropical rainforest plot in Southwest China, we measured soil pH, total N, NH4-N, NO3-N, and available P and K for four times and assessed the patch structure (patterns of patch distribution) and their temporal consistency. We then tested how structure and consistency of chemical soil properties were affected by topography and chemical inputs from litterfall.
   Results All soil chemical properties showed significant seasonal fluctuations, but patch consistency was higher for soil pH, total N, and available P and K compared to NH4-N or NO3-N. Topography influenced pH patch consistency while annual litterfall input was important for maintaining patch consistency in total N and available P and K.
   Conclusions Fine-scale consistency of patches in soil pH, total N, and available P and K suggest they may exert stable selection pressures on species for niche differentiation, while consistency of soil NH4-N and NO3-N require further study.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY : Secondary succession is a worldwide phenomenon affecting plant communities. Studying functional variation during succession aids in understanding the mechanisms through which environmental shifts drive succession. We investigated changes in the functional space occupied by herbaceous communities during succession. Furthermore, since different traits are differently affected by environmental conditions, we asked how considering different sets of plant traits impacts those changes.
   METHODS : Using a chronosequence of Mediterranean old fields (2-42 yr after abandonment), we analyzed shifts of the occupied functional space during succession, how the volume of occupied functional space varies compared with null expectations, and the functional overlap between communities of different successional status. We repeated these analyses considering (1) the leaf-height-seed functional dimensions separately and together and (2) different sets of traits representing those dimensions.
   KEY RESULTS : From early to late succession, a shift toward nutrient conservative-light competitive species occurred. Functional strategies of mid-successional communities appeared more diverse than expected by chance and less diverse than expected for early and late communities. Early and middle stages overlapped the most. These patterns were generally robust to the choice of functional axes, though important trait-specific exceptions occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS : We showed evidence for a well-defined history of successive dominance of different assembly mechanisms along succession, resulting in a generally stronger functional diversification in mid-succession. We also demonstrated that different traits typically grouped under one functional dimension can substantially affect the results, discouraging the use of surrogate traits from the same dimension.

AB The pervasive pattern of aggregated tree distributions in natural communities is commonly explained by the joint effect of two clustering processes: environmental filtering and dispersal limitation, yet little consensus remains on the relative importance of the two clustering processes on tree aggregations. Different life stages of examined species were thought to be one possible explanation of this disagreement, because the effect of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation are expected to increase and decrease with tree life stages, respectively. However, few studies have explicitly tested these expectations. In this study, we evaluated these expectations by three different methods (species-habitat association test based on Poisson Clustering model and spatial point pattern analyses based on Heterogeneous Poisson model and the jointly modeling approach) using 36 species in a 20-ha subtropical forest plot. Our results showed that the percentage of species with significant habitat association increased with life stages, and there were fewer species affected by dispersal limitation in later life stages compared with those in earlier stages. Percentage of variance explained by the environmental filtering and dispersal limitation also increases and decreases with life stages. These results provided a promising alternative explanation on the existing mixed results about the relative importance of the two clustering processes. These findings also highlighted the importance of plant life stages for fully understanding species distributions and species coexistence.

AB All four chimpanzee sub-species populations are declining due to multiple factors including human-caused habitat loss. Effective conservation efforts are therefore needed to ensure their long-term survival. Habitat suitability models serve as useful tools for conservation planning by depicting relative environmental suitability in geographic space over time. Previous studies mapping chimpanzee habitat suitability have been limited to small regions or coarse spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we used Random Forests regression to downscale a coarse resolution habitat suitability calibration dataset to estimate habitat suitability over the entire chimpanzee range at 30-m resolution. Our model predicted habitat suitability well with an r(2) of 0.82 (+/-0.002) based on 50-fold cross validation where 75% of the data was used for model calibration and 25% for model testing; however, there was considerable variation in the predictive capability among the four sub-species modeled individually. We tested the influence of several variables derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) that included metrics of forest canopy and structure for four three-year time periods between 2000 and 2012. Elevation, Landsat ETM+ band 5 and Landsat derived canopy cover were the strongest predictors; highly suitable areas were associated with dense tree canopy cover for all but the Nigeria-Cameroon and Central Chimpanzee sub-species. Because the models were sensitive to such temporally based predictors, our results are the first to highlight the value of integrating continuously updated variables derived from satellite remote sensing into temporally dynamic habitat suitability models to support near real-time monitoring of habitat status and decision support systems.

AB The ant species Myrmica scabrinodis plays a markedly important ecological role through much of the humid grasslands of Eurasia. It hosts a species-rich community of pathogens and parasites, including Rickia wasmannii, an enigmatic member of entomoparasitic laboulbenialean fungi. This study provides a descriptive ecology of R. wasmannii by characterizing its prevalence and distribution across several hierarchical levels: colonies, individuals, and anatomic body parts. Infections were restricted to a single ant species, M. scabrinodis, and infected colonies occurred predominantly in wet habitats. Infections tended to be highly prevalent within infected colonies, often reaching 100% sample prevalence among workers. Individual infections exhibited an aggregated distribution typical to host-parasite systems. Workers from the aboveground part of nests (presumably older ones acting as foragers) were more infected than those from the belowground part. Fungal thalli could be found all over the body of the hosts, the head and the abdomen being the most infected parts of the body. The fungi's distribution among host body parts statistically differed between low versus high-intensity infections: the initial dominance of the head decreased with advancing infection. These findings may provide baseline data for future comparative or monitoring studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ants have been used to assess land use conversion, because they reflect environmental change, and their response to these changes have been useful in the identification of bioindicators. We evaluated ant diversity and composition associated to different land use change in a temperate forest (above 2000 m asl) in Mexico. The study was carried out in "Flor del Bosque" Park a vegetation mosaic of native Oak Forests and introduced Eucalyptus and grasslands. Species richness, dominance and diversity rarefaction curves, based on ant morphospecies and functional groups, were constructed and compared among the three vegetation types, for the rainy and the dry seasons of 2008-2009. Jaccard and Sorensen incidence-based indices were calculated to obtain similarity values among all the habitats. The Oak Forest was a rich dominant community, both in species and functional groups; the Eucalyptus plantation was diverse with low dominance. The most seasonality habitat was the grassland, with low species and high functional group diversity during the dry seasons, but the reverse pattern during the wet season. The Oak Forest was more similar to the Eucalyptus plantation than to the grassland, particularly during the dry season. Oak Forests are dominated by Cold Climate Specialists, specifically Prenolepis imparis (Say). The Eucalyptus and the grassland are characterized by generalized Myrmicinae, as Pheidole spp. and Monomorium ebenium (Forel). The conservation of the native Oak Forest is primordial for the maintenance of Cold Climate Specialist ant communities. The microclimatic conditions in this forest, probably, prevented the invasion by opportunistic species.

AB 1. Grazing by livestock is a major ecological disturbance, with potential effects on vegetation, soil, and insect fauna. Ants are a diverse and functionally important insect group with many associations with the ground layer, yet recent global syntheses question the importance of grazing effects on ant communities relative to vegetation or soil.
   2. We examined the effects of vegetation, soil and grazing on the whole ant community, ant functional groups, and abundant species in temperate eucalypt woodlands, southeastern Australia.
   3. We found limited influence of grazing on our vegetation and soil measures, except for a positive association between grazing and exotic perennial grass cover. We also found that exotic grass cover had a negative effect on overall ant abundance and richness, but not functional groups or individual species. Soil C:N ratio had a positive effect on the subdominant Camponotini, and leaf litter cover had a positive effect on the abundance of cryptic species. Partial Mantel tests revealed an effect of both environmental and grazing measures on ant assemblage composition, but constrained ordination showed that leaf litter cover, grass biomass, and native and exotic perennial grass cover had stronger correlations with ant community structure than grazing.
   4. Our study shows that both environmental variation and grazing play a role in driving ant community structure, but that key environmental variables such as grass biomass and leaf litter cover are particularly important in temperate eucalypt woodlands. Monitoring of ant communities to measure the benefits of changed grazing regimes for biodiversity should consider contemporary grazing pressure as well as the underlying effects of variation in plants and soils.

AB Increasing numbers of cities are currently developing sustainable policies aimed at promoting urban biodiversity and ecological dynamics through the planning of green networks and the implementation of more sustainable management practices. These human activities can strongly influence environmental factors on which the organization of ecological communities at different scales depends. Thus, it is of fundamental importance to understand the relative impact of local management, green space design and landscape features on the distribution and the abundance of species in urban areas. On the basis of 2 years of butterfly surveys in urban public parks within an extensive Mediterranean metropolitan area, Marseille (South-East France), the aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the effect of these three environmental scales (plot, park, landscape) on the composition and organization of species assemblages. Using variation partitioning and nestedness analysis on ecological data aggregated at plot-level and park-level respectively, we demonstrate the preponderant effect of landscape scale features on urban butterfly assemblages. Our results also highlight an important co-variation of plot management, park layout and urban landscape features, in their interaction with the community structure of urban butterflies. Although there is no significant species-area relationship, significantly nested patterns arise in species composition. Selective colonization appears as a driving force constraining the constitution of species assemblages within the city. However, a prospective study on adjacent more natural areas suggests that biotic limitations, interspecific competition and habitat filtering may play an important role if a larger portion of the urbanization gradient is explored, which remains to be investigated.

AB Some plant functional groups such as nonnative invasive and nitrogen (N)-fixing plants are widely thought to have consistent, coordinated differences in their functional traits relative to other groups such as native and non -N-fixing plants. Recent evidence suggests that these trait differences between groups can be context dependent, varying with environmental factors such as resource availability and disturbance. However, many previous comparisons among plant groups differing in invasion status have not standardized growth form between groups or have compared species that do not co-occur, which could result in invasion status per se being confounded with other factors. We determined growth and leaf functional trait responses of 20 co-occurring woody species, that is, five species within each of four functional groups (native N-fixers, native non -N-fixers, nonnative [invasive] N-fixers and nonnative [invasive] non-N-fixers), to factorial combinations of soil fertility and defoliation treatments in a mesocosm experiment to test each of two hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that nonnative invasive and N-fixing species will have functional traits associated with rapid resource acquisition whereas natives and non -N-fixing species will have traits linked to resource conservation. Second, we hypothesized that plant growth and leaf traits of nonnative and N-fixing species will be more strongly influenced by environmental factors (i.e., soil fertility and disturbance) than will natives and non-N-fixers. Plant growth, foliar nutrients, and leaf structural traits varied among plant functional groups in a manner consistent with our first hypothesis. Support for our second hypothesis was mixed; origin (native vs. nonnative) and soil fertility rarely interacted to determine plant growth or variation in leaf traits whereas interactions involving N-fixing ability and soil fertility were common. Further, there were no consistent interactive effects between plant groupings and disturbance. Our results demonstrate that variation in growth and functional traits among plant species were driven primarily by the relatively large responses of nonnative N-fixers to soil fertility, rather than by consistent differences between other plant functional groups. These findings highlight the importance of resource availability in determining trait or performance differences among plant functional groups, and provide insights into the assembly of plant functional traits in novel communities of co-occurring native and nonnative species.

AB Monitoring the rhythm of tree growth associated with the growth rings can contribute substantially to understanding forest dynamics and the management of tropical forests. In this study, we monitored the girth increment rhythm and described the wood characteristics (anatomy of growth rings, wood specific gravity) in 10 tropical tree species (103 individuals) naturally occurring in a wet and weakly seasonal region of Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil. We aimed to verify whether tree growth dynamics are associated with climate and woody anatomy in tropical trees with contrasting ecological characteristics. We installed permanent dendrometer bands and monthly assessed the girth increment for 22 months. We collected wood samples (non-destructive method), measured wood specific gravity and prepared permanent slides to characterize the growth ring markers. We found growth rings in all species (distinct in six species); deciduous species produced more distinguishable tree rings compared with semi-deciduous and evergreen tree species. Species varied in their accumulated girth growth (in average, from 1.83 to 62.64 mm), growth rates (1-15 %), and annual radial increment (0.16-5.44 mm). Girth increment was positively related to temperature and day length in five out of ten tree species, indicating the possible effects of these climatic variables in triggering cambial activity in these species. The growth pattern varied among species and was marginally associated to the tree deciduousness. We concluded that even in wet and less seasonal climates, there can be an association in the cambium activity and stem growth with the hotter and longer days of summer months.

AB We describe an integrated modeling framework for understanding strain coexistence in polymorphic pathogen systems. Previous studies have debated the utility of neutral formulations and focused on cross-immunity between strains as a major stabilizing mechanism. Here we convey that direct competition for colonization mediates stable coexistence only when competitive abilities amongst pathogen clones satisfy certain pairwise asymmetries. We illustrate our ideas with nested SIS models of single and dual colonization, applied to polymorphic pneumococcal bacteria. By fitting the models to cross-sectional prevalence data from Portugal (before and after the introduction of a seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), we are able to not only statistically compare neutral and non-neutral epidemiological formulations, but also estimate vaccine efficacy, transmission and competition parameters simultaneously. Our study highlights that the response of polymorphic pathogen populations to interventions holds crucial information about strain interactions, which can be extracted by suitable nested modeling.

AB 1. Tropical forest tree diversity has been hypothesized to be maintained via the attraction of density responsive and species-specific enemies. Tests of this hypothesis usually assume a linear relationship between enemy pressure (amount of damage and enemy richness) and seedling or tree density. However, enemy pressure is likely to change nonlinearly with local seedling abundance and community scale tree abundance if enemies are characterized by nonlinear functional responses.
   2. We examined the abiotic and biotic factors associated with richness of above-ground enemies and foliar damage found in tree seedlings in a tropical forest in Puerto Rico. Rather than identify specific enemies targeting these seedlings, we used damage morphotypes, a paleo-ecological method, to derive a proxy for enemy species richness.
   3. We found that the relationships between local and (conspecific seedling density) community scale (conspecific basal area of adult trees) abundance and both richness of above-ground enemies and foliar damage were hump-shaped. Seedlings of tree species existing at intermediate levels of abundance, at both local and community scales, suffered more damage and experienced pressure from a greater diversity of enemies than those existing at high or low densities.
   4. We hypothesized that greater damage at intermediate abundance level could arise from a rich mixture of generalist and specialist enemies targeting seedlings of intermediate abundance tree species. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that generalist enemies were more diverse on species at rare or intermediate abundance relative to common tree species. However, specialist enemies showed no significant trend across tree species abundance at either the local or community scales.
   5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that interspecific variation in tree species abundance leads to differences in the magnitude and type of damage tropical tree seedlings suffer. This variation leads to a nonlinear, hump-shaped relationship between species abundance and enemy damage, highlighting fruitful directions for further development of species coexistence theory.

AB Ants can act as plant biotic defenses, however, in agricultural ecosystems they are often associated with outbreaks of honeydew-producing pests mainly due to the protection they offer to the plant feeders in exchange for honeydew. In this interaction ants may alter the abundance, diversity and community structure of predators and parasitoids. In the present study, we conducted ant-exclusion experiments in three commercial citrus orchards, each one dominated by one ant species (Pheidole pallidula, Lasius grandis or Linepithema humile) during two consecutive years. We then compared the abundance, species richness, diversity and community structure of predators and parasitoids between the ant-allowed and ant-excluded treatments. A total of 176,074 natural enemies belonging to 81 taxa were captured and identified. The abundance of the natural enemies showed a species specific response between treatments. When examining functional groups of natural enemies the abundance of generalist predators decreased while that of parasitoids increased in the ant-allowed treatment. The species richness was significantly lower for predators and higher for parasitoids in the ant-allowed treatment. The Shannon diversity index was not different between treatments for predators, whereas parasitoid diversity was significantly higher in the ant-allowed treatment. Finally, the community structure of predators and parasitoids was not significantly different between treatments. These results suggest that ants in citrus are not associated with a dramatic decrease in natural enemy abundance or biodiversity; on the contrary ants were associated with increased parasitoid species richness and diversity. On the other hand, ants negatively affected the abundance of specific natural enemy species, mainly generalist predators. The impact on these predators might explain the higher pest densities associated with ants in citrus. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Leaf-cutting ants are major agricultural and forestry pests in the New World. Attempts to control them have most frequently involved the use of chemical insecticides, with mixed results. Among alternative methods, botanical pesticides may provide a sustainable and efficient control of leaf-cutting ants. In the present study, we screened the activity of plant extracts derived from 89 species native to Argentina, against the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex lundi (Guerin) and its mutualistic fungus, Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, through a pick-up assay and bioautography, respectively. The pick-up assay revealed moderate to strong anti-foraging activity for just over 13.5% of the assayed species, including complete ant foraging inhibition for Aristolochia argentina, Flourensia oolepis, Gaillardia megapotamica, Lantana grisebachii and Lithrea molleoides. Most plant extracts were well tolerated by fungi, with only 12.3% of the species tested showing some degree of fungus growth inhibition. Among these, A. argentina, F. oolepis and Pterocaulon alopecuroides were the strongest inhibitors, whereas Baccharis flabellata, Dalea elegans and Zanthoxylum coco revealed a more moderate activity. Only A. argentina and F. oolepis extracts showed strong antiforaging effects and affected fungus growth at the same time. Values of IC50 and MIC indicated that extracts inhibiting ant foraging at lower concentrations did not necessarily also inhibit fungus growth at lower doses. The active principle of A. argentina, on both ant foraging and fungal growth, was identified as argentilactone. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To reveal whether hypocotyl sink activities are regulated by the aboveground parts, and whether physiology and morphology of source leaves are affected by the hypocotyl sink activities, we conducted grafting experiments using two Raphanus sativus varieties with different hypocotyl sink activities. Comet (C) and Leafy (L) varieties with high and low hypocotyl sink activities were reciprocally grafted and resultant plants were called by their scion and stock such as CC, LC, CL and LL. Growth, leaf mass per area (LMA), total non-structural carbohydrates (TNCs) and photosynthetic characteristics were compared among them. Comet hypocotyls in CC and LC grew well regardless of the scions, whereas Leafy hypocotyls in CL and LL did not. Relative growth rate was highest in LL and lowest in CC. Photosynthetic capacity was correlated with Rubisco (ribulose 15-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) content but unaffected by TNC. High C/N ratio and accumulation of TNC led to high LMA and structural LMA. These results showed that the hypocotyl sink activity was autonomously regulated by hypocotyl and that the down-regulation of photosynthesis was not induced by TNC. We conclude that the change in the sink activity alters whole-plant growth through the changes in both biomass allocation and leaf morphological characteristics in R. sativus.

AB In the marine environment, many cryptic - morphologically similar but genetically distinct species show sympatric distributions, which challenges traditional ecological competition theory. In the morphospecies complex of the bacterivorous nematode Litoditis marina, four cryptic species (Pm I, Pm II, Pm III and Pm IV) frequently occur with mostly two or more of these species together. This co-occurrence displays fluctuating abundances that have been linked to seasonal dynamics in the environment. In intertidal marine environments, salinity and temperature play an important role in species distributions. In the here presented experiments, the impact of these two abiotic variables on juvenile development time, fecundity and population development was investigated. Monospecific cultures were reared at three different temperatures: 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C (salinity 25) and at two different salinities: 15 and 25 (temperature: 20 degrees C) in 2 separate experiments. Our results showed that differences in life history are present between the four species: Pm III had a higher instantaneous fecundity than the other three species. Furthermore, differences in reproduction strategy were observed between the cryptic species: Pm II and Pm III were always oviparous in this experiment, whilst Pm land Pm IV were mostly viviparous species. Abiotic factors affected the life history characters and the reproductive strategy of some of these cryptic species, with temperature clearly having a stronger effect than salinity. Temperature had an effect on juvenile development time for all species and a species-specific influence on population development. Pm III performed better at higher temperature, Pm II and Pm IV at lower temperature, whereas Pm I proved to be a more eurytherm species, which nicely correlates with their respective seasonal field distribution pattern in the south-eastern coast of the North Sea and adjacent estuaries. Juvenile development time was also influenced by salinity, with a shorter development time at the lower salinity for all cryptic species. Moreover, Pm III and Pm IV performed better at lower than at the higher salinity. Pm IV also changed its reproductive strategy, depending on the salinity. The effect of salinity was less clearly reflected in the geographical distribution of the four species. Different temperature preferences of the cryptic species on the other hand may result in niche differentiation and can provide an important mechanism for coexistence of these closely related species.

AB Species range-limits are influenced by a combination of several factors. In our study we aimed to unveil the drivers underlying the expansion of the Egyptian mongoose in Portugal, a carnivore that was confined to southern Portugal and largely increased its range during the last three decades. We evaluated the expansion of the species in three periods (1980-1990, 1990-2000 and 2000-2010), by projecting the presence/absence data of the species in each temporal range and proposed four hypotheses to explain this sudden expansion associated to changes in the barrier effects of human infrastructure and topographic features, and in the availability of suitable areas due to climate change or land use. An exploratory analysis was made using Spearman rank correlation, followed by a hierarchical partitioning analysis to select uncorrelated potential explanatory variables associated with the different hypotheses. We then ran Generalized Linear Models (GLM) for every period for each hypothesis and for every combination of hypotheses. Our main findings suggest that dynamic transitions of land-use coupled with temperature and rainfall variations over the decades are the main drivers promoting the mongoose expansion. The geographic barriers and the human infrastructures functioned as barriers for mongoose expansion and have shaped its distribution. The expansion of the Egyptian mongoose across the Portuguese territory was due to a variety of factors. Our results suggest a rapid shift in species range in response to land-use and climate changes, underlining the close link between species ranges and a changing environment.

AB Analyses of morphological and molecular data indicate the existence of an unrecognized and unnamed species of soft-haired mouse, genus Abrothrix. Here, we name and describe this new species, which inhabits the Valdivian ecoregion, from the north of Chiloe Island onto the mainland in the Chilean regions of Los Lagos and Los Rios; it also occurs at a single locality in the Argentinean province of Neuquen. Long confused with A. sanborni, the new species presents a unique combination of characters that differentiate it in external, cranial, phallic, and dental terms from its congeners. Phylogenetic analysis, based on cytochrome-b gene sequences, indicates that the new species is sister to a clade formed by the austral species A. lanosa and A. sanborni and differs on average from them by 5.7% and 5.2%, respectively. Results based on the nuclear Fgb-I7 locus are less conclusive regarding the phylogenetic position of the new species but also show its distinction. We comment on the conservation significance of our findings, considering that forests of the Valdivian ecoregion are suffering substantial human disturbance through intensive logging.

AB The ecological and physiological significance of body size is well recognized. However, key macroevolutionary questions regarding the dependency of body size trends on the taxonomic scale of analysis and the role of environment in controlling long-term evolution of body size are largely unknown. Here, we evaluate these issues for decapod crustaceans, a group that diversified in the Mesozoic. A compilation of body size data for 792 brachyuran crab and lobster species reveals that their maximum, mean and median body size increased, but no increase in minimum size was observed. This increase is not expressed within lineages, but is rather a product of the appearance and/or diversification of new clades of larger, primarily burrowing to shelter-seeking decapods. This argues against directional selective pressures within lineages. Rather, the trend is a macroevolutionary consequence of species sorting: preferential origination of new decapod clades with intrinsically larger body sizes. Furthermore, body size evolution appears to have been habitat-controlled. In the Cretaceous, reef-associated crabs became markedly smaller than those in other habitats, a pattern that persists today. The long-term increase in body size of crabs and lobsters, coupled with their increased diversity and abundance, suggests that their ecological impact may have increased over evolutionary time.

AB Individuals vary within a species in many ecologically important ways, but the causes and consequences of such variation are often poorly understood. Foraging behavior is among the most profitable and risky activities in which organisms engage and is expected to be under strong selection. Among social insects there is evidence that within-colony variation in traits such as foraging behavior can increase colony fitness, but variation between colonies and the potential consequences of such variation are poorly documented. In this study, we tested natural populations of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, for the existence of colony and regional variation in foraging behavior and tested the persistence of this variation over time and across foraging habitats. We also reared single-lineage colonies in standardized environments to explore the contribution of colony lineage. Fire ants from natural populations exhibited significant and persistent colony and regional-level variation in foraging behaviors such as extra-nest activity, exploration, and discovery of and recruitment to resources. Moreover, colony-level variation in extra-nest activity was significantly correlated with colony growth, suggesting that this variation has fitness consequences. Lineage of the colony had a significant effect on extra-nest activity and exploratory activity and explained approximately half of the variation observed in foraging behaviors, suggesting a heritable component to colony-level variation in behavior.

AB Understanding the habitat requirements of great apes is essential for effective conservation strategies. We examined annual habitat use of a bonobo group in the Wamba field site within the Luo Scientific Reserve, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Using satellite imagery, we categorized the group's ranging area into three forest types: (1) primary and old secondary forest (P/OS), (2) young secondary forest and agriculture (YS/Ag), and (3) swamp forest (Sw). We tracked the group for 1 year (2007-2008) and compared usage of the three forest types for ranging, feeding, and night-sleeping. We also recorded what the bonobos ate and monitored monthly fruit availability in each forest type. The group ranged and fed more often in P/OS and less often in YS/Ag and Sw than expected based on habitat availability. Also, the group slept mostly in P/OS (94% of nights monitored), but also in YS/Ag (1%), and Sw (5%). Fruit availability in P/OS had no significant effect on habitat selection, but the group fed in YS/Ag most often during the two months when fruits in P/OS were least abundant. In June, when fruit of Uapaca spp. (selectively eaten by bonobos) was generally abundant in Sw, the group mostly ranged and slept there. The bonobos fed most often on herbaceous plants in all three forest types. In Sw, the bonobos frequently ate mushrooms. Our results show that semi-open forest with abundant herbaceous plants such as YS/Ag could be an important feeding habitat and may provide fallback food for bonobos when fruits are scarce. Furthermore, Sw can serve seasonally as a main habitat to complement P/OS if adequate food resources and tree nesting opportunities are available. We conclude that bonobos use diverse habitats depending on their needs and we highlight the importance of minor-use habitats for sustaining populations of target species in conservation planning. Am.

AB Predatory traces, in which the tracemaker has damaged the prey animal's skeleton to kill and consume it, have a deep fossil history and have received much scientific attention. Several types of predatory traces have been assigned to ichnotaxa, but one of the most studied predatory traces, the wedge-shaped excision produced as a result of attacks mainly by crustaceans on the apertures of gastropod shells, has yet to be described as an ichnotaxon. We propose the ichnogenus Caedichnus to describe the shell damage produced by aperture peeling behavior. Caedichnus is produced by predators that are unable to crush their prey's shells outright. Depending on the predator's peeling ability and the prey's withdrawal depth within the shell, the trace can extend through several whorls of the shell. Aperture peel attacks may fail, allowing such damage to be repaired by surviving gastropods. Thus, the types of attacks that produce Caedichnus may exert selective pressure on prey to evolve better-defended shells (in the case of gastropods) or to inhabit better-defended shells (in the case of hermit crabs). The identification of these trace fossils will enhance our understanding of how predation influences the morphological, and even behavioral, evolution of prey organisms.

AB Lianas are an important component of tropical forests, contributing up to 25 % of the woody stems and 35 % of woody species diversity. Lianas invest less in structural support but more in leaves compared to trees of similar biomass. These physiological and morphological differences suggest that lianas may interact with neighboring plants in ways that are different from similarly sized trees. However, the vast majority of past liana competition studies have failed to identify the unique competitive effects of lianas by controlling for the amount of biomass removed. We assessed liana competition in the forest understory over the course of 3 years by removing liana biomass and an equal amount of tree biomass in 40 plots at 10 sites in a secondary tropical moist forest in central Panama. We found that growth of understory trees and lianas, as well as planted seedlings, was limited due to competitive effects from both lianas and trees, though the competitive impacts varied by species, season, and size of neighbors. The removal of trees resulted in greater survival of planted seedlings compared to the removal of lianas, apparently related to a greater release from competition for light. In contrast, lianas had a species-specific negative effect on drought-tolerant Dipteryx oleifera seedlings during the dry season, potentially due to competition for water. We conclude that, at local scales, lianas and trees have unique and differential effects on understory dynamics, with lianas potentially competing more strongly during the dry season, and trees competing more strongly for light.

AB Recovery from disturbance is an important attribute of community dynamics. Temperate rocky shores will experience increases in both the type and intensity of impacts under future expected global change. To gauge the community response to these potential changes in the disturbance regime it is important to assess space occupancy and the temporal dynamics of key species over the recovery process. We experimentally disturbed replicated 1 m(2) plots in the lower intertidal at 5 sites along the Ligurian rocky coast (North-western Mediterranean) and assessed early succession processes over 18 months. To identify colonisation processes and role of key species in affecting species richness on recovery trajectories, we monitored species composition at the cm-scale along fixed transects within the plots. Our results highlighted the role of a limited number of taxa in driving the recovery of species richness across sites, despite site variation in community composition. Settlement of new propagules and overgrowth were the principal pathway of space occupancy. We detected an important role for coralline algae, particularly the articulated Corallina elongata, in promoting the colonisation of a diverse range of colonists. The present study highlights the important role played by calcifying coralline macroalgae as substrate providers for later colonists, favouring recovery of biodiversity after disturbance. This pivotal role may be compromised in a future scenario of elevated cumulative disturbance, where ocean acidification will likely depress the role of coralline algae in recovery, leading to a general loss in biodiversity and community complexity.

AB The long-lived pioneer species Pericopsis elata is one of the rare tropical timbers on the list of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species, supporting the need for accurate and reliable growth data. In one planted and one natural forest in the Democratic Republic of Congo, respectively four and 37 Pericopsis stem disks were collected. The tree-ring series of planted trees were used to confirm annual tree-ring formation. For the natural forest, a tree-ring chronology with 24 stem disks ranged from 1852 up to 2008. This chronology was compared with time-series of local precipitation, resulting in a significant correlation with the second half of the rainy season (September-November). This seasonal precipitation was related with sea surface temperatures of the West Indian Ocean. Higher precipitation during El Nino years corresponded with higher tree-ring indices but differences were not significant. In addition, pointer years were rare and did not have a consistent link with extreme climatic conditions. The existence of annual tree rings encourages further tree-ring analyses of P. elata and other flagship timber species in order to further document climate-growth responses and to provide the long-term framework that is needed for sustainable management planning.

AB We have estimated forest changes and deforestation trends on the island of Unguja (Zanzibar) over the last three decades based on satellite images, forest cover change trajectory and post-forest land cover analysis. The results show that deforestation has intensified and forest cover change rate has changed from 0.03% to -0.46% between 1975-1996 and 1996-2009. On average 0.88 km(2) of forests were lost annually, which makes altogether 29.9 km(2) during the 34 year study period. Using three distinctive land use regimes prevailing on the island, we are able to show that in reality the changes and their causes were unique in each region. The community forest land use regime was dominated by shifting cultivation related cyclical changes combined with growing deforestation rates. The deforestation rates were also high in agroforest land use regime, but here forest clearings were associated with urban sprawl. Opposite to these two regimes, the cover increased in government forest areas, due to large tree planting schemes. However, forest clearings increased significantly since 1996 in government areas and currently all regimes are facing decreasing forest cover. Population growth, in-migration, urbanization, tourism and increasing demand of agricultural and forestry products were the main underlying causes behind the deforestation. Although, the long-term developments of the forest cover are dictated by these relatively uncontrollable underlying causes, we suggest few actions to restrain deforestation and its effects. These actions include establishment of protected area network with forest corridors, heeding trees in urban and agricultural land use planning, replanting cleared governmental plantations and extending plantations outside the Island.

AB AimsPlants, fungal endophytes (FEs) and the changing environment interact with each other forming an interlaced network. This study evaluates nonadditive and interactive effects of the FE Acremonium strictum and drought treatment on Atractylodes lancea plantlets.
   Methods and ResultsBy applying FEs (meristem cultures of At.lancea, fungal inoculation of Ac.strictum and plantlet acclimatization) and drought treatment (regular watering, mild drought, severe drought), a research system of At.lancea ramets under different treatments was established. During 12days of drought treatment, the plantlets' physiological responses and basic growth traits were measured and analysed. Although drought and FE presence affected plantlet traits to differing degrees, the interactive effects of the two were more pronounced. In particular under mild drought treatment, the FE conferred drought tolerance to plantlets by enhancing leaf soluble sugars, proteins, proline and antioxidant enzyme activity; decreasing the degree of plasmalemma oxidation; and increasing the host's abscisic acid level and root:shoot ratio. When exposed to regular watering or severe drought, these effects were not significant.
   ConclusionsPlant traits plasticity was conferred by dual effects of drought stress and FEs, and these factors are interactive. Although FEs can help plants cope with drought stress, the beneficial effects are strictly constrained by drought degree.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyDuring finite environmental stress, FEs can benefit plants, and for this reason, they may alleviate the effects of climate change on plants. However, because the benefits of FEs are highly context dependent, the role of FEs in a changing background should be re-assessed.

AB In the absence of direct observations, demographic traits such as age and reproductive status may be modeled through proxies. We examined 35 yr of over 10,000 captures of Hawaiian green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and compared results from skeletochronology studies with mark-recapture records. For 109 turtles that were captured as juveniles and later observed nesting, we estimated maturity age first from skeletochronology-based models of age to length and second by estimating age at first capture using skeletochronology and then adding the time elapsed to first nesting. The second method involving mark-recapture gave younger and less variable age estimates. From these data we developed a scaling, rule that calculates that females first bred at 23 yr (95% interval: 16.8-28.1). This result was corroborated by tag returns in the Caribbean and Hawai'i showing that green turtles first nest at 16-20 yr. We validated this approach using life table models, successfully reconstructing four decades (1973-2012) of nesting surveys at East Island, French Frigate Shoals. We then compared our results with observed somatic growth rates, which suggest that nearshore studies may sample an atypical subset of the population that is chronically sedentary and slow growing. When exact life history traits are unknown, we recommend consulting multiple lines of evidence and independently validating proxy studies.

AB The impact of logging on plant communities was studied in forest that has been logged selectively 1, 5 and 10 years previously (following a certified procedure): diversity was compared with that of primary rain forest in the Berau region of East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Four sets of 20 transects located within an area of 6 ha were sampled for all trees, saplings and seedlings, and records were made of topographic position, structure, composition and species diversity. There was a high level of floristic similarity between primary forests at the study sites compared to primary forest elsewhere in Kalimantan. The impact of logging is therefore likely to be the most important factor determining any differences between the plant communities of the selectively logged and primary forest sites. We found differences in species composition and abundance of most plants between selectively logged and primary forest. Overall, stem densities of trees in the primary forest were higher than in the three selectively logged forest sites. Stem densities of saplings were equivalent in all four forests. Seedling stem densities were higher in the forest site logged 10 years previously than in primary forest. Our results showed that the forests logged selectively under certified regimes still have a high plant diversity, possibly indicating that biodiversity values may be conserved by following certification procedures.

AB Short-term nitrous oxide (N2O) pulse emissions caused by precipitation account for a considerable portion of the annual N2O emissions and are greatly influenced by soil nitrogen (N) dynamics. However, in Chinese semiarid temperate steppes, the response of N2O emissions to the coupling changes of precipitation and soil N availability is not yet fully understood. In this study, we conducted two 7-day field experiments in a semiarid temperate typical steppe of Inner Mongolia, China, to investigate the N2O emission pulses resulting from artificial precipitation events (approximately equivalent to 10.0 mm rainfall) under four N addition levels (0, 5, 10, and 20 g N/(m(2)center dot a)) using the static opaque chamber technique. The results show that the simulated rainfall during the dry period in 2010 caused greater short-term emission bursts than that during the relatively rainy observation period in 2011 (P < 0.05). No significant increase was observed for either the N2O peak effluxes or the weekly cumulative emissions (P > 0.05) with single water addition. The peak values of N2O efflux increased with the increasing N input. Only the treatments with water and medium (WN10) or high N addition (WN(2)0) significantly increased the cumulative N2O emissions (P < 0.01) in both experimental periods. Under drought condition, the variations in soil N2O effluxes were positively correlated with the soil NH4-N concentrations in the three N input treatments (WN5, WN10, and WN(2)0). Besides, the soil moisture and temperature also greatly influenced the N2O pulse emissions, particularly the N2O pulse under the relatively rainy soil condition or in the treatments without N addition (ZN and ZWN). The responses of the plant metabolism to the varying precipitation distribution and the length of drought period prior to rainfall could greatly affect the soil N dynamics and N2O emission pulses in semiarid grasslands.

AB Understanding how biodiversity and ecosystem functioning respond to changes in the environment is fundamental to the maintenance of ecosystem function. In realistic scenarios, the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning path may account for only a small share of all factors determining ecosystem function. Here, we investigated the strength to which variations in environmental characteristics in a Neotropical savanna affected functional diversity and decomposition. We sought an integrative approach, testing a number of pairwise hypotheses about how the environment, biodiversity, and functioning were linked. We used structural equation modelling to connect fire frequency, soil fertility, exchangeable Al, water availability, functional diversity of woody plants, tree density, tree height, and litter decomposition rates in a causal chain. We found significant effects of soil nutrients, water availability, and Al on functional diversity and litter decomposition. Fire did not have a significant direct effect on functional diversity or litter decomposition. However, fire was connected to both variables through soil fertility. Functional diversity did not influence rates of litter decomposition. The mediated effects that emerged from pairwise interactions are encouraging not only for predicting the functional consequences of changes in environmental variables and biodiversity, but also to caution against predictions based on only environmental or only biodiversity change.

AB The African lion has lost more than 75% of its historic range and numbers of wild lions continue to decline. Protected areas are critical to the species' future, yet its conservation status in many of these presumed sanctuaries remains unknown. Zambia is one of nine countries estimated to hold over 1000 wild lions, and Kafue, its largest National Park, is a key stronghold for the species. Understanding lion distribution and threats facing the species in the park are of particular relevance given the recent ban on lion hunting in Zambia and the uncertainty over this industry's future in the country. We used a single-season occupancy model based on detection of lion tracks to estimate proportion of area used and derive spatially explicit probability of lion use for northern Kafue, an area for which no previous empirical lion data exist. Our top-ranking model predicted that lions use 72.1% of the study area, 23.3% greater than the naive estimate. Contrary to our expectations, and possibly due to apparent ubiquity of illegal bushmeat hunting in the park, neither prey biomass nor anthropogenic edge effects emerged as important drivers of lion distribution, with habitat class instead the best predictor. Our findings provide the management authority with survey methodology as well as focal areas for further lion research in the Kafue system. More broadly, we demonstrate the utility of track-based occupancy models in establishing the distribution of large carnivores within previously unsurveyed African protected areas.

ID HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; ABUNDANCE; ECOLOGY; AREA
AB Habitat fragmentation affects species distribution and abundance, and drives extinctions. Escalated tropical deforestation and fragmentation have confined many species populations to habitat remnants. How worthwhile is it to invest scarce resources in conserving habitat remnants within densely settled production landscapes? Are these fragments fated to lose species anyway? If not, do other ecological, anthropogenic, and species-related factors mitigate the effect of fragmentation and offer conservation opportunities? We evaluated, using generalized linear models in an information-theoretic framework, the effect of local- and landscape-scale factors on the richness, abundance, distribution, and local extinction of 6 primate species in 42 lowland tropical rainforest fragments of the Upper Brahmaputra Valley, northeastern India. On average, the forest fragments lost at least one species in the last 30 years but retained half their original species complement. Species richness declined as proportion of habitat lost increased but was not significantly affected by fragment size and isolation. The occurrence of western hoolock gibbon (Hoolock hoolock) and capped langur (Trachypithecus pileatus) in fragments was inversely related to their isolation and loss of habitat, respectively. Fragment area determined stump-tailed (Macaca arctoides) and northern pig-tailed macaque occurrence (Macaca leonina). Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) distribution was affected negatively by illegal tree felling, and rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) abundance increased as habitat heterogeneity increased. Primate extinction in a fragment was primarily governed by the extent of divergence in its food tree species richness from that in contiguous forests. We suggest the conservation value of these fragments is high because collectively they retained the entire original species pool and individually retained half of it, even a century after fragmentation. Given the extensive habitat and species loss, however, these fragments urgently require protection and active ecological restoration to sustain this rich primate assemblage.

AB Niche differentiation is a prominent mechanism for explaining tree species coexistence in tropical rain forests. Theory predicts that species that are specialized on a set of environmental conditions should competitively exclude generalists in those conditions, and that environmental heterogeneity allows the coexistence of many different species based on niche specialization. Yet, many tropical tree species of the family Dipterocarpaceae have broadly similar habitat preferences, with some occurring widely across several soil types. These soil generalists clearly persist despite the presence of other dipterocarp species that show clear soil specialization. We evaluate comparative seedling performance (growth and survival) of six Shorea species (Dipterocarpaceae) which differ in their adult tree habitat associations within the Sepilok Forest Reserve (Borneo, Malaysia). We tested the hypothesis that seedlings of species associated with a particular soil type perform better on that soil type than seedlings of soil generalist species, with generalists in turn performing better than specialists on a different soil type. We conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment including two soil types (alluvial and mudstone) and two light treatments (gap and understory). The soils differed in soil acidity, Al and P concentration. Observed species-specific differences in seedling responses to soil, light, and occasional flooding events could partially explain observed adult distribution, although not all species could be fully differentiated along these axes. Other trade-offs, such as investment in defense against herbivores and tolerance to soil waterlogging, may play additional roles in explaining coexistence of these species.

AB Although tree ferns are an important component of temperate and tropical forests, very little is known about their ecology. Their peculiar biology (e.g., dispersal by spores and two-phase life cycle) makes it difficult to extrapolate current knowledge on the ecology of other tree species to tree ferns. In this paper, we studied the effects of negative density dependence (NDD) and environmental heterogeneity on populations of two abundant tree fern species, Cyathea caracasana and Alsophila engelii, and how these effects change across a successional gradient. Species patterns harbor information on processes such as competition that can be easily revealed using point pattern analysis techniques. However, its detection may be difficult due to the confounded effects of habitat heterogeneity. Here, we mapped three forest plots along a successional gradient in the montane forests of Southern Ecuador. We employed homogeneous and inhomogeneous K and pair correlation functions to quantify the change in the spatial pattern of different size classes and a case-control design to study associations between juvenile and adult tree ferns. Using spatial estimates of the biomass of four functional tree types (short- and long-lived pioneer, shade-and partial shade-tolerant) as covariates, we fitted heterogeneous Poisson models to the point pattern of juvenile and adult tree ferns and explored the existence of habitat dependencies on these patterns. Our study revealed NDD effects for C caracasana and strong environmental filtering underlying the pattern of A. engelii. We found that adult and juvenile populations of both species responded differently to habitat heterogeneity and in most cases this heterogeneity was associated with the spatial distribution of biomass of the four functional tree types. These findings show the effectiveness of factoring out environmental heterogeneity to avoid confounding factors when studying NDD and demonstrate the usefulness of covariate maps derived from mapped communities.

AB Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and Forest Enhancement (REDD+) has become a central focus of global climate change mitigation efforts. Even though the international demand for forest-based carbon sequestration is the key driver of REDD+, forest protection strategies must be implemented on the ground. This cross-scale nature of REDD+ explains why scholars and policy makers increasingly favor nested governance arrangements over either fully centralized or fully decentralized REDD+ governance. The focus of the literature on nested REDD+ governance has mostly been on monitoring, reporting, and verification of carbon emission reductions across sub-national, national, and international levels. We build on Ostrom's principle of 'nested enterprises' to argue that REDD+ must be designed to systematically and formally link national policy reforms with the organization and execution of sub-national (regional and local) forest conservation efforts led by forest users. We also contribute new insights on the political dimensions of nestedness in REDD+, with important roles for inter-community forestry associations and forest rights movements.

AB It has been hypothesized that the wide range of forms and complexities of phosphorus (P) in soil may result in resource partitioning that contributes to the maintenance of plant species diversity. Here, we test whether the graminoid, Deschampsia cespitosa, and the ericaceous shrub, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, which often coexist, display preferences in utilization of P forms, and differ in their production of extracellular P-degrading enzymes. We provided plants with no additional P, or P forms with decreasing lability, namely sodium phosphate (SP), D-glucose 6 phosphate (DG6P), sodium phytate (PASS), and a combination of SP, DG6P, and PASS. We also tested if preferences for P forms affected the competitive outcomes between the two species compared between conspecifics, as indicated by shoot biomass and acquisition of nitrogen (N) and P. Both D.cespitosa and V.vitis-idaea produced the greatest biomass when supplied with a mix of all three forms of P. Of the three forms of P tested alone, shoot biomass produced by both species was least when supplied with SP. D.cespitosa performed better when grown with PASS or a mix of all P forms compared with the performance of V.vitis-idaea on these substrates. This was reflected by substantially greater phytase activity on the surface of its roots compared with V.vitis-idaea. In contrast, V.vitis-idaea produced more phosphomonoesterase to hydrolyze the simple organic P form, DG6P. Although N was kept constant in the treatments, the ability of plants to acquire it was dependent on species identity, competition, and P supply. These findings provide direct evidence for preferences toward specific forms of P and indicate a key role played by organic forms of P. The results support the idea that partitioning for soil P is one factor regulating plant competition, and ultimately, community composition. Our data also highlight the importance of the interplay between P supply and N acquisition.

AB Speciation involves the evolution of traits and genetic differences that contribute to reproductive isolation and the cessation of gene flow, and studying closely related species and divergent populations gives insight into how these phenomena proceed. Here, we document patterns of gene flow within and between two members of a rapid Neotropical species radiation, Costus pulverulentus and Costus scaber (Costaceae). These species co-occur in the tropical rainforest and share pollinators, but are reproductively isolated by a series of prezygotic barriers, some of which show evidence of reinforcement at sympatric sites. Here, we genotype microsatellite markers in plants from eight sites that span the geographical range of both species, including four sympatric sites. We also genotype putative hybrids found at two sympatric sites. We find high levels of genetic isolation among populations within each species and low but detectable levels of introgression between species at sympatric sites. Putative hybrids identified by morphology are consistent with F1 or more advanced hybrids. Our results highlight the effectiveness of prezygotic isolating mechanisms at maintaining species boundaries in young radiations and provide empirical data on levels of gene flow consistent with reinforcement.

AB The Janzen-Connell hypothesis is among the most important theories put forward to explain species coexistence in species-rich communities. However, the relative importance of Janzen-Connell effects with respect to other prominent mechanisms of community assembly, such as dispersal limitation, self-thinning due to competition, or habitat association, is largely unresolved. Here we use data from a 24-ha Gutianshan subtropical forest to address it. First we tested for significant associations of adults, juveniles, and saplings with environmental variables. Second we evaluated if aggregation decreased with life stage. In a third analysis we approximately factored out the effect of habitat association and comprehensively analyzed the spatial associations of intraspecific adults and offspring (saplings, juveniles) of 46 common species at continuous neighborhood distances. We found i) that, except for one, all species were associated with at least one environmental variable during at least one of their life stages, but the frequency of significant habitat associations declined with increasing life stage; ii) a decline in aggregation with increasing life stage that was strongest from juveniles to adults; and iii) intraspecific adult-offspring associations were dominated by positive relationships at neighborhood distances up to 10 m. Our results suggest that Janzen-Connell effects were not the dominant mechanisms in structuring the spatial patterns of established trees in the subtropical Gutianshan forest. The spatial patterns may rather reflect the joint effects of size-dependent self-thinning, dispersal limitation and habitat associations. Our findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the relative importance of Janzen-Connell effects in influencing plant community structure under strong topographic heterogeneity.

AB Impact of Pheidole sp., reportedly important in insect pest suppression in agroecosystems was studied on supporting agroecosystem services. This tropical ant species was found to be common and abundant in agroecosystems, with a high nest density and preference for the central, crop-growing zone of annual cropping systems. Physico-chemical characteristics of the debris soil were examined from nests located by the roadside and within two managed ecosystems. The debris soil had significantly higher concentrations of total C, N, P and NO3-N along with higher water-holding capacity and moderate-sized soil particles in comparison to the control soil. The pH of the Pheidole sp. debris soil was shifted towards reduced alkaline conditions. Results reveal that annually, 2.44 kg/ha C, 0.071 kg/ha P, 0.628 kg/ha N and 0.009 kg/ha NO3-N are added to the soil through the accumulation of organic refuse at the nest rim. This contributes to soil nutrient enhancement and is suggested to enhance ecosystem productivity. The high nutrient content of nest debris soil is linked to the predominance of arthropod carcasses (93.7% of the total organic refuse) in the refuse piles derived from the animal-based food (70.3%) brought to the nests by the foragers. Plant-based food was 29.6% (seeds, leaves, roots, etc.) of the total indicating a minor role of Pheidole sp. as a seed harvester. The results suggest an important role of Pheidole sp. in regulating the soil nutrients as an ecosystem engineer. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Payments for ecosystem services often are viewed as an innovative approach toward improving natural resource management, while also providing opportunities for enhancing incomes and livelihoods. Yet not all PES programs are designed and implemented in ways that reflect voluntary transactions between buyers and providers of well-defined, measurable ecosystem services. When third-party interests, such as donors or governments, design PES programs to achieve goals that lie outside the conceptual scope of payments for ecosystem services, the improvements in resource management and enhancements in livelihoods can fall short of expectations. We examine this potential dissonance in PES program implementation, taking the case of PES in the forestry sector in Vietnam. We question whether PES in Vietnam has the potential to enhance forest protection and watershed management. We highlight the importance of institutions and governance (i.e., the policies, rules, and regulations) in determining program significance and we illustrate how PES programs are implemented as part of the government's subsidy scheme. We conclude that in the absence of a competitive market structure and appropriate regulations, governments can reshape PES programs to function primarily as tools for strengthening state control over natural resources.

AB Intertidal organisms are vulnerable to global warming as they already live at, or near to, the upper limit of their thermal tolerance window. The behaviour of ectotherms could, however, dampen their limited physiological abilities to respond to climate change (e.g. drier and warmer environmental conditions) which could substantially increase their survival rates. The behaviour of ectotherms is still mostly overlooked in climate change studies. Here, we investigate the potential of aggregation behaviour to compensate for climate change in an intertidal gastropod species (Nerita atramentosa) in South Australia. We used thermal imaging to investigate (1) the heterogeneity in individual snail water content and body temperature and surrounding substratum temperature on two topographically different habitats (i.e. rock platform and boulders) separated by 250 m at both day- and night-times, (2) the potential relationship between environment temperature (air and substratum) and snail water content and body temperature, and (3) the potential buffering effect of aggregation behaviour on snail water content and body temperature. Both substratum and snail temperature were more heterogeneous at small spatial scales (a few centimetres to a few metres) than between habitats. This reinforces the evidence that mobile intertidal ectotherms could survive locally under warmer conditions if they can locate and move behaviourally in local thermal refuges. N. atramentosa behaviour, water content and body temperature during emersion seem to be related to the thermal stability and local conditions of the habitat occupied. Aggregation behaviour reduces both desiccation and heat stresses but only on the boulder field. Further investigations are required to identify the different behavioural strategies used by ectothermic species to adapt to heat and dehydrating conditions at the habitat level. Ultimately, this information constitutes a fundamental prerequisite to implement conservation management plans for ectothermic species identified as vulnerable in the warming climate.

AB The dynamic equilibrium model of species diversity predicts that ecosystem productivity interacts with disturbance to determine how many species coexist. However, a robust test of this model requires manipulations of productivity and disturbance over a sufficient timescale to allow competitive exclusion, and such long-term experimental tests of this hypothesis are rare. Here we use long-term (27 years), large-scale (8 x 50-m plots), factorial manipulations of soil resource availability and sheep grazing intensity (disturbance) in grasslands to test the dynamic equilibrium model. As predicted by the model, increased productivity not only reduced plant species richness, but also moderated the effects of grazing intensity, shifting them from negative to neutral with increasing productivity. Reductions in species richness with productivity were associated with dominance by faster growing (i.e. high specific leaf area) and taller plants. Conversely, grazing favoured shorter plants and this effect became stronger with greater productivity, consistent with the view that grazing can lead to weaker asymmetric competition for light. Our study shows that the dynamic equilibrium model can help to explain changes in plant species richness following long-term increases in soil resource availability and grazing pressure, two fundamental drivers of change in grasslands worldwide.

AB Biodiversity conservation in urban areas has become increasingly important as cities have expanded to cover larger proportions of landscapes across the world. The careful planning of habitat reserves within urbanized areas has the potential to make significant contributions to regional biodiversity. We surveyed the passerine community in 15 habitat reserves within the Phoenix metropolitan region and explored the relationships between community composition and urban land uses surrounding the reserves. Diversity of different guilds was affected in substantially different ways by reserve characteristics and surrounding urban land use. Guilds responded to land use at all three scales included in the study - 200 m, 1000 m and 2500 m. The responses of four guilds, synanthropic, non-synanthropic, insectivore and feeding generalist, were well predicted by the factors considered here. Reserve characteristics (area, shape, isolation), particularly area, had effects on all four of these guilds with non-synanthropic and insectivore species responding positively to area, while synanthropic and feeding generalist species responded negatively. Land use type surrounding the reserves had significant effects on all of these guilds, except for feeding generalists. High density, high diurnal activity land uses decreased diversity, while medium density, low diurnal activity uses increased the diversity of some guilds, particularly insectivores, probably by providing supplemental habitat. This study provides new evidence from an arid urban landscape that not only reserve characteristics, but also surrounding urban land use should be considered during conservation planning, especially if non-synanthropic or insectivore species are among the targeted species.

AB Using data from a three-year study of socioeconomic factors influencing hunting in 23 indigenous communities, we assess the influence of indigenous and Christian beliefs and practices on dietary taboos among Makushi and Wapishana peoples in the Guyanese Amazon. We found that members of Evangelical and established (Anglican and Catholic) churches do not differ significantly in terms of their adherence to dietary restrictions and members of Sabbatarian churches show a stronger tendency to adhere to dietary taboos than Evangelicals or members of established churches. Counter to expectations, we found no significant difference in avoidance of meat between households belonging to established and Evangelical churches. Furthermore, members of all church groups deviated in terms of dietary restrictions from indigenous norms as exemplified in dietary advice given by shamans. We conclude that, despite doctrinal opposition to shamanistic practices associated with indigenous taboos, there is continuity in terms of dietary practice among Makushi and Wapishana households that have converted to Evangelical and, to some degree, Sabbatarian forms of Christianity.

AB The distribution of beta diversity is shaped by factors linked to environmental and spatial control. The relative importance of both processes in structuring spider metacommunities has not yet been investigated in the Atlantic Forest. The variance explained by purely environmental, spatially structured environmental, and purely spatial components was compared for a metacommunity of web spiders. The study was carried out in 16 patches of Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil. Field work was done in one landscape mosaic representing a slight gradient of urbanization. Environmental variables encompassed plot-and patch-level measurements and a climatic matrix, while principal coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNMs) acted as spatial variables. A forward selection procedure was carried out to select environmental and spatial variables influencing web-spider beta diversity. Variation partitioning was used to estimate the contribution of pure environmental and pure spatial effects and their shared influence on beta-diversity patterns, and to estimate the relative importance of selected environmental variables. Three environmental variables (bush density, land use in the surroundings of patches, and shape of patches) and two spatial variables were selected by forward selection procedures. Variation partitioning revealed that 15% of the variation of beta diversity was explained by a combination of environmental and PCNM variables. Most of this variation (12%) corresponded to pure environmental and spatially environmental structure. The data indicated that (1) spatial legacy was not important in explaining the web-spider beta diversity; (2) environmental predictors explained a significant portion of the variation in web-spider composition; (3) one-third of environmental variation was due to a spatial structure that jointly explains variation in species distributions. We were able to detect important factors related to matrix management influencing the web-spider beta-diversity patterns, which are probably linked to historical deforestation events.

AB Few studies have focused explicitly on the later stages of the fragmentation process, or "late-stage fragmentation", during which habitat area and patch number decrease simultaneously. This lack of attention is despite the fact that many of the anthropogenically fragmented habitats around the world are, or soon will be, in late-stage fragmentation. Understanding the ecological processes and patterns that occur in late-stage fragmentation is critical to protect the species richness in these fragments. We investigated plant species composition on 152 islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China. A random sampling method was used to create simulated fragmented landscapes with different total habitat areas and numbers of patches mimicking the process of late-stage fragmentation. The response of the landscape-scale species-area relationship (LSAR) to fragmentation per se was investigated, and the contribution of inter-specific differences in the responses to late-stage fragmentation was tested. We found that the loss of species at small areas was compensated for by the effects of fragmentation per se, i.e., there were weak area effects on species richness in landscapes due to many patches with irregular shapes and high variation in size. The study also illustrated the importance of inter-specific differences for responses to fragmentation in that the LSARs of rare and common species were differently influenced by the effects of fragmentation per se. In conclusion, our analyses at the landscape scale demonstrate the significant influences of fragmentation per se on area effects and the importance of inter-specific differences for responses to fragmentation in late-stage fragmentation. These findings add to our understanding of the effects of habitat fragmentation on species diversity.

TI The Genus Cecropia: A Biological Clock to Estimate the Age of Recently

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID FORESTS; TREES; PATTERNS; RATES
AB Forest successional processes following disturbance take decades to play out, even in tropical forests. Nonetheless, records of vegetation change in this ecosystem are scarce, increasing the importance of the chronosequence approach to study forest recovery. However, this approach requires accurate dating of secondary forests, which until now was a difficult and/or expensive task. Cecropia is a widespread and abundant pioneer tree genus of the Neotropics. Here we propose and validate a rapid and straightforward method to estimate the age of secondary forest patches based on morphological observations of Cecropia trees. We found that Cecropia-inferred ages were highly correlated with known ages of the forest. We also demonstrate that Cecropia can be used to accurately date disturbances and propose twenty-one species distributed all over the geographical range of the genus as potential secondary forest chronometer species. Our method is limited in applicability by the maximal longevity of Cecropia individuals. Although the oldest chronosequence used in this study was 20 years old, we argue that at least for the first four decades after disturbance, the method described in this study provides very accurate estimations of secondary forest ages. The age of pioneer trees provides not only information needed to calculate the recovery of carbon stocks that would help to improve forest management, but also provides information needed to characterize the initial floristic composition and the rates of species remigration into secondary forest. Our contribution shows how successional studies can be reliably and inexpensively extended without the need to obtain forest ages based on expensive or potentially inaccurate data across the Neotropics.

AB The spatial segregation hypothesis and the low-frequency hypothesis are two important proposed mechanisms that delay or prevent competitive exclusion in ecosystems. Because tree species interact with their neighbors, the importance of these potential processes can be investigated by analyzing the spatial structures of tree species.
   The distribution of the adults of 27 common tree species in a fully mapped 5-ha subtropical forest plot in Baishanzu, eastern China, was analyzed to investigate the community-level intra- and interspecific spatial association patterns. We first tested for the overall spatial pattern in the 5- to 40-m neighborhoods and classified first-order bivariate associations with a diametric scheme based on Ripley's K and nearest-neighbor statistic (G-function). Then heterogeneous Poisson null models were used to distinguish second-order interactions from overall spatial associations (including first-order effects). Finally, we analyzed correlations between the existence of species interactions and some attributes of the species involved.
   Partial overlap and segregation increased with scale, whereas mixing decreased. Nearly 70% of the species pairs occurred less than expected at random, and only 3.4% of the species pairs were well mixed; 11.0% of all species pairs showed significant small-scale interactions, which was a greater frequency than expected by chance if species are abundant or prefer the same habitat, but less frequent than expected if species are highly aggregated. This suggests that both spatial segregation and low frequency of species facilitate species coexistence by reducing the opportunity that trees of two species encounter each other. The study also revealed that positive interactions were more prevalent than negative interactions in the forest, which indicates that positive interactions may have important effects on forest species assemblies.

AB Continental tropical ecosystems are generally viewed as less vulnerable to biological invasions than island ones. Their apparent resistance to invasive alien species is often attributed to their higher native biota diversity and complexity. However, with the increase of human activities and disturbances and the accelerate rate of introductions of plant species, these apparently resilient continental ecosystems are now experiencing alien plant naturalization and invasion events. In order to illustrate this emergent phenomenon, we compiled a list of all known introduced and naturalized plant species in French Guiana (Guiana Shield, South America). A total of 490 alien plants were recorded, about 34% of which are currently naturalized, mainly species belonging to the Acanthaceae and Fabaceae (Faboideae) in the Eudicotyledons, and Poaceae (grasses) and Arecaceae (palms) in the Monocotyledons. The coastal dry and wet savannas appears to be vulnerable to plant invasion (with 165 naturalized species, about 34% of the alien flora), especially by Acacia mangium (Mimosaceae) and Melaleuca quinquenervia (Myrtaceae) which are forming localized but dense monotypic stands. Both tree species, intentionnally introduced for reforestation, rehabilitation, and as garden ornamentals and have the potential to spread with increasing human disturbances The number and abundance of naturalized alien plants in the relatively undisturbed tropical lowland rainforests and savannas remains still very low. Therefore, surveillance, early detection, and eradication of potential plant invaders are crucial; moreover collaboration with neighbouring countries of the Guiana Shield is essential to prevent the introduction of potentially invasive species which are still not present in French Guiana.

AB Cote d'Ivoire holds 18 catarrhine taxa, with 3 endemic to Cote d'Ivoire and neighbouring Ghana. Nine of the taxa occurring in Cote d'Ivoire are listed as threatened at the global level. However, information on their conservation status within the country is available for only a limited number of taxa. In order to assess the current distribution of primates and their conservation status, we conducted foot surveys and interviews in protected forests in the southern part of Cote d'Ivoire. Our data suggest that 22 out of 23 surveyed forests have lost 25-100% of the primate taxa expected to occur in these areas. The only exception is the Tai National Park where all of the expected primate taxa were encountered. Based on our surveys, we propose an updated national list according to the IUCN Red List criteria for all diurnal primate species of Cote d'Ivoire. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB The interaction of plants with insect herbivores and fungal pathogens can affect community dynamics, but there is little information on how this antagonistic interaction may be altered in human-disturbed tropical systems. We examined whether the amount and quality of foliar damage on the pioneer herbs Heliconia latispatha and Heliconia collinsiana are distinct on road edges and secondary riparian vegetation compared with natural gaps in continuous forest (controls) in Mexico. We also investigated some physical and biological mechanisms that may jointly explain such differences. The overall insect damage in H. latispatha was similar between road edges and natural forest gaps (8.0% vs. 7.2% of leaf area). Damage by caterpillars, however, decreased from 4.2 percent in forest gaps to 0.5 percent on road edges, whereas damage by leaf-cutting ants increased from 0 to 5.8 percent. In secondary riparian vegetation, where none of the leaves sampled were attacked by ants, overall herbivore damage in H. collinsiana was less than half that observed in forest gaps (3.0% vs. 6.7%), and driven mainly by differences in caterpillar damage (2.5% vs. 6.2%). By contrast, attack by leaf fungal pathogens was two to three times greater in both human-disturbed habitats than in gaps (8.29.6% vs. 3.74.2%). Potential mechanisms underlying these differences involved human-induced shifts in air and soil temperature driven by greater light availability, as well as changes in relative humidity, leaf toughness, foliar condensed tannins, and local abundance of herbivores. Our results indicate that human disturbance alters insect herbivory and may increase proliferation of leaf disease.

AB The spatial and temporal distribution and diversity of sediment-dwelling foraminifera are reasonably well known, but encrusting (hard-substrate dwelling) foraminifera are little studied. Encrusting foraminifera are common in the world's oceans, attached to floating debris or marine animals in the water column to living on rocks, sand grains and organisms in benthic environments from shallow to deep marine regions. With projected ocean acidification and warming conditions, these important calcifying protists that comprise beaches, buffer sediments, and contribute to complex food webs are potentially in peril.
   Results indicate that calcifying foraminifera were the first to colonize experimental molluscan substrates within the first year in shallow habitats, with colonization offshore in subsequent years. Agglutinated foraminifera become more common after one year. Species richness (alpha diversity) remained relatively similar throughout the study, but species turnover (beta diversity) was greatest within the first year and between the shelf/slope break and deeper water, following the thermocline and photic zone regions. The equivalent of the Shannon Entropy Index provided important information on beta diversity and community structure.
   Paleobathymetric distributions can be resolved after six years into four distinct foraminiferal distributional zones: shallow shelf (15 m), outer shelf (33 m), shelf/slope break (73-88 m), and slope depths (>213 m to 267 m). Some encrusting foraminifera are invasive, settling in high numbers within the first year, and increasing their abundance through the duration of the experiment. A foraminiferan, Discorbis bentheloti, was discovered to bioerode carbonate, and is a potentially excellent paleobathymetric indicator for 15-33 m depths. Results differ from previously reported pioneer and climax foraminiferal communities documented for Caribbean coral reefs, because long-term experiments reveal the spatial and temporal development and distribution of carbonate-producing encrusting foraminifera in these climatically-sensitive regions.

AB Urbanization results in widespread habitat loss and fragmentation and generally has a negative impact upon native wildlife, in particular ground-dwelling mammals. The northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus; Marsupialia: Peramelidae) is one of relatively few native Australian ground-dwelling mammals that is able to survive within urbanized landscapes. As a consequence of extensive clearing and urban development within the city of Brisbane, bandicoots are now restricted to the mostly small (<10 ha) bushland fragments scattered across the city landscape. Our study examined the behavioural ecology of northern brown bandicoots within habitat fragments located on a major creek-line, using mark-recapture population monitoring and radio telemetry. Bandicoots at monitored sites were found to occur at high densities (typically one individual ha(-1)), although one-third of the populations were transient. Radio tracking revealed that bandicoots had relatively small home ranges (mean 1.5 +/- 0.2 ha) comprised largely of bushland/grassland with dense, often weed-infested ground cover. Bandicoots sheltered by day in these densely covered areas and also spent most time foraging there at night, although they occasionally ventured small distances to forage in adjacent maintained parklands and residential lawns. We suggest that introduced tall grasses and other weeds contribute to high habitat quality within riparian habitat fragments and facilitate the persistence of high density populations, comprised of individuals with small home ranges. The generalized dietary and habitat requirements of northern brown bandicoots, as well as a high reproductive output, undoubtedly facilitate the survival of the species in urban habitat fragments. Further research is required on other native mammal species in urbanized landscapes to gain a greater understanding of how best to conserve wildlife in these heavily modified environments.

AB The Brazilian government has already acknowledged the importance of investing in the development and application of technologies to reduce or prevent CO2 emissions resulting from human activities in the Legal Brazilian Amazon (BA). The BA corresponds to a total area of 5 x 10(6) km(2) from which 4 x 10(6) km(2) was originally covered by the rain forest. One way to interfere with the net balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions is to increase the forest area to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. The single most important cause of depletion of the rain forest is cattle ranching. In this work, we present an effective policy to reduce the net balance of CO2 emissions using optimal control theory to obtain a compromising partition of investments in reforestation and promotion of clear technology to achieve a CO2 emission target for 2020. The simulation indicates that a CO2 emission target for 2020 of 376 million tonnes requires an estimated forest area by 2020 of 3,708,000 km(2), demanding a reforestation of 454,037 km(2). Even though the regional economic growth can foster the necessary political environment for the commitment with optimal emission targets, the reduction of 38.9% of carbon emissions until 2020 proposed by Brazilian government seems too ambitious.

AB Aim How important are frequent, low-intensity disturbances to tree community dynamics of a cyclone-prone forest? We tested the following hypotheses concerning the 'inter-cataclysm' period on a remote Polynesian island: (1) tree turnover would be high and recruitment rates would be significantly higher than mortality; (2) low-intensity disturbance would result in a marginal increase in tree mortality in the short term; (3) turnover would vary among species and would be associated with plant traits linked to differences in life history; and (4) mortality and recruitment events would be spatially non-random.
   Location Tutuila, a volcanic island in the Samoan Archipelago, Polynesia.
   Methods We censused the tree (stem diameter >= 10 cm) community in 3.9 ha of tropical forest three times over a 10-year period, 1998-2008. We calculated annual mortality, recruitment and turnover rates for 36 tree species. We tested for non-random spatial patterns and predictors of mortality, and non-random spatial patterns of tree recruitment. A 2004 cyclone passing within 400 km allowed us to measure the effects of a non-cataclysmic disturbance on vital rates.
   Results Annual turnover was 2.8% and annual recruitment was 3.6%; these are some of the highest rates in the tropics, and likely to be a response to a cyclone that passed < 50 km from Tutuila in 1991. Species turnover rates over 10 years were negatively correlated with wood specific gravity, and positively correlated with annual stem diameter increment. Mortality was spatially aggregated, and a function of site, species and an individual's growth rate. Recruitment was highest on ground with low slope. The low-magnitude cyclone disturbance in 2004 defoliated 29% of all trees, but killed only 1.8% of trees immediately and increased annual mortality over 5 years by 0.7%.
   Main conclusions The inter-cataclysm period on Tutuila is characterized by frequent, low-amplitude disturbances that promote high rates of tree recruitment and create a dynamic, non-equilibrium or disturbed island disequilibrium tree community. Species with low wood density and fast growth rates have enhanced opportunities for recruitment between cataclysms, but also higher probabilities of dying. Our results suggest that increases in the frequency of cyclone activity could shift relative abundances towards disturbance-specialist species and new forest turnover rates.

AB The debate on the role of species differences in shaping biodiversity patterns, with its two extremes of pure niche theory and neutral theory, is still ongoing. It has been demonstrated that a slight difference in competitive ability of species severely affects the predictions of the neutral model. At the same time, neutral patterns seem to be ubiquitous. Here, we model both negative density dependence (NDD) and competitive asymmetry (CA) simultaneously. Our simulation results show that an appropriate intensity of NDD can offset the negative effect of CA (modeled as fecundity difference) on species coexistence and produce a neutral-like species abundance distribution. Therefore, our model provides a plausible mechanistic explanation of neutral-like patterns, but contrary to the neutral model, a species' relative abundance is positively related to its competitive ability in our model.

AB Among-site variation in metacommunities (beta diversity) is typically correlated with the distance separating the sites (spatial lag). This distance decay in similarity pattern has been linked to both niche-based and dispersal-based community assembly hypotheses. Here we show that beta diversity patterns in community composition, when supplemented with functional-trait information, can be used to diagnose assembly processes. First, using simulated data, we show how the relationship between distance decay patterns in taxonomic and functional measures of community composition can be used to predict the influence of a given trait on community assembly. We then use the patterns generated by the simulation as a template to show that the sorting of benthic macroinvertebrate metacommunities in headwater streams is likely influenced by different sets of functional traits at regional and local scales. We suggest that functional-trait databases and spatially referenced taxonomic surveys can be used to predict the spatial scales at which different aspects of interspecific functional variation are involved in niche-based community assembly while accounting for the influence of dispersal-based community assembly processes.

AB The objective of the study was to investigate changes in the woody plant community in a four-year period. It was established 50 permanent plots of 10 x 10 m and all individuals with diameter above ground 30 cm (DAG (30cm)) >= 5 cm were sampled in 2002 and 2006. In the inventory of January 2002, were found 945 individuals belonging to 77 species, 65 genera and 35 families and in January 2006, were 1,106 individuals, 80 species, 66 genera and 36 families. Community species diversity and diameter structure did not change within the period. Mortality rates (4.01% year(-1)) and basal area losses (0.68% year(-1)) were offset by recruitment (6.67% year(-1)) and gain (2.26% year(-1)), indicating community maintenance as stable apparently. The periodic annual increment (PAI) of the community was 0.31 cm year(-1), being overcome by the PAI of Euplassa inaequalis, Kielmeyera rubriflora and Byrsonima coccolobifolia (0.72, 0.49 and 0.47 cm year(-1), respectively), indicating the growth potential of such species as important for recovery strategies on degraded areas. The absence of fire during the study period may have been the main factor behind the dynamics of the vegetation of the studied cerrado, favoring the establishment of some woody species and providing increase in density and biomass.

AB In the United States multispecies habitat conservation plans were meant to be the solution to conflicts between economic development and protection of biological diversity. Although now widely applied, questions exist concerning the scientific credibility of the conservation planning process and effectiveness of the plans. We used ants to assess performance of one of the first regional conservation plans developed in the United States, the Orange County Central-Coastal Natural Community Conservation Plan (NCCP), in meeting its broader conservation objectives of biodiversity and ecosystem-level protection. We collected pitfall data on ants for over 3 years on 172 sites established across a network of conservation lands in coastal southern California. Although recovered native ant diversity for the study area was high, site-occupancy models indicated the invasive and ecologically disruptive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) was present at 29% of sites, and sites located within 200 m of urban and agricultural areas were more likely to have been invaded. Within invaded sites, native ants were largely displaced, and their median species richness declined by more than 60% compared with uninvaded sites. At the time of planning, 24% of the 15,133-ha reserve system established by Orange County NCCP fell within 200 m of an urban or agricultural edge. With complete build out of lands surrounding the reserve, the proportion of the reserve system vulnerable to invasion will grow to 44%. Our data indicate that simply protecting designated areas from development is not enough. If habitat conservation plans are to fulfill their conservation promise of ecosystem-level protection, a more-integrated and systematic approach to the process of habitat conservation planning is needed.

AB Rodents have a high impact on human activities, producing economical losses and diseases. One of these diseases is Hantavirus syndrome, whose reservoir is Oligoryzomys longicaudatus. Raptors are the natural biological controllers of rodents, being, therefore, our efficient and effective allies. Despite the existing legal dispositions for protection, 11 of the 33 species of raptors in Chile have conservation problems. We evaluated the effectiveness of nest boxes for Tyto alba, as a way to increase its population and propose a procedure for the biological control of O. longicaudatus. The study area was the National Reserve Lago Peuelas, Valparaiso, Chile. The variation of population density before and after the installation of the nest boxes was established both for T. alba and rodents. The results show that the nest boxes installed dramatically increased the population and the total density of T. alba, and a significant reduction of the abundance of small mammals was stated. We propose a methodological diagram for the biological control of the reservoir of the Hantavirus, which we have been implementing since 2001.

AB This paper describes the conceptualization and implementation of an agent-based model to investigate how varying levels of human presence could affect elements of wolf behavior, including highway crossings; use of areas in proximity to roads and trails; size of home ranges; activities, such as hunting, patrolling, resting, and feeding pups; and survival of individuals in Banff and Kootenay National Parks, Canada. The model consists of a wolf module as the primary component with five packs represented as cognitive agents, and grizzly bear, elk, and human modules that represent dynamic components of the environment. A set of environmental data layers was used to develop a friction model that serves as a base map representing the landscape over which wolves moved. A decision model was built to simulate the sequence of wolf activities. The model was implemented in a Java Programming Language using RePast, an agent-based modeling library. Six months of wolf activities were simulated from April 16 to October 15 (i.e., a season coherent with regard to known wolf behaviors), and calibrated with GPS data from wolf radiocollars (n = 15) deployed from 2002 to 2004. Results showed that the simulated trajectories of wolf movements were correlated with the observed trajectories (Spearman's rho 0.566. P < 0.001); other critical behaviors, such as time spent at the den and not traveling were also correlated. The simulations revealed that wolf movements and behaviors were noticeably affected by the intensity of human presence. The packs' home ranges shrank and wolves crossed highways less frequently with increased human presence. In an extreme example, a wolf pack whose home range is traversed by a high-traffic-volume highway was extirpated due to inability to hunt successfully under a scenario wherein human presence levels were increased 10-fold. The modeling prototype developed in this study may serve as a tool to test hypotheses about human effects on wolves and on other mammals, and guide decision-makers in designing management strategies that minimize impacts on wolves and on other species functionally related to wolves in the ecosystem.

AB We report on the population response of a species of rodent, Necromys lasiurus, to southern oscillation index (SOI) and extent of regional fire in an Amazonian savanna. Information on temporal variation in local abundance of N. lasiurus in a 4.0 ha savanna plot was obtained from 1985 to 1989, from 1997 to 1998 and 2000-2006, giving data on 14 of the 22 years. Throughout this period, rodent density declined by 90%. Densities were positively associated with SOI and the extent of fire in the region. Rainfall was related to SOI and negatively influenced the extent of fire. However, the amount of rain had no measurable direct effect on rat densities. Thus, small changes in temperature, and consequently fire probability and intensity, may have drastic consequences on the biota of Amazonian savannas, especially in El Nino periods.

AB Little is known about how arboreal arthropods respond to forest disturbance. We assessed how rain forest fragmentation affected the vertical stratification of arboreal dung beetles in Peninsular Malaysia. An arboreal dung beetle species (Onthophagus sp.) moved closer to the forest floor in smaller fragments, suggesting a downward shift in its foraging possibly in response to fragmentation.

AB We analyzed the influence of human access and landscape structure on forest bird species richness in a fragmented landscape of the Colombian Andes In Latin America, habitat loss and fragmentation are considered as the greatest threats to biodiversity because a large number of countryside villagers complement their food and incomes with the extraction of forest resources. Anthropogenic actions may also affect forest species by bird hunting or indirectly through modifying the structure of forest habitats. We surveyed 14 secondary cloud forest remnants to generate bird species richness data for each of them We also quantified six landscape structure descriptors of forest patch size (patch area and core area), shape (perimeter of each fragment and the Patton's shape index) and isolation (nearest neighbor distance and edge contrast), and generated (using principal components analysis) a synthetic human influence variable based on the distance of each fragment to roads and villages, as well as the total slope of the fragments Species richness was related to these variables using generalized linear models (GLMs) complemented with model selection techniques based on information theory and partial regression analysis We found that forest patch size and accessibility were key drivers of bird richness, which increased toward largest patches, but decreased in those more accessible to humans and their potential disturbances. Both patch area and human access effects on forest bird species richness were complementary and similar in magnitude Our results provide a basis for biodiversity conservation plans and initiatives of Andean forest diversity (c) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS All rights reserved.

AB To evaluate the effects of distinct management of the matrix in which forest fragments are found upon plant populations thriving in forest remnants in south Brazil, we assessed the conservation status of populations of four woody species (Campomanesia rhombea, Diospyros incontans, Myrciaria cuspidata and Sebastiania commersoniana) through analyses of size structure. Analyzes were carried out at two scales. At a local scale, we consider populations in fragments surrounded by pastures or eucalypts forest plantations, and at a regional scale we also consider larger forest tracts taken as reference areas (Rio Grande do Sul Forest Inventory databank). Population size structures were summarized using the symmetry of height distributions. Small individual size classes prevailed at the local scale in fragments surrounded by eucalypts plantations, whereas in areas exposed to cattle ranching, populations of the same species consistently lack small individuals. At the regional scale, populations in fragments surrounded by pastures presented greater skewness (prevalence of small plants) than populations in reference areas, while populations surrounded by eucalypts plantations presented intermediate skewness. These results reinforce the notion that plantations have a higher conservation value for forest ecosystems than other commercial land uses, like cattle ranching.

AB 1. Insects are known to be influenced by global climate change, especially by drought and increased temperatures.
   2. Although ants are widely regarded to be indicator or keystone species and ecosystem engineers, we do not know how ants may respond to global climate change.
   3. This study reports the range contraction of an extremely abundant fungus-gardening ant (Trachymyrmex septentrionalis) over a 3-year period that coincided with the end of a record drought in southeastern North America.
   4. Reduction in nest number appears to be the result of an increase in water-table levels and decrease in soil aridity.
   5. Therefore T. septentrionalis should be expected to increase its abundance and presumably its ecological impact during multiyear droughts.

AB Several wood samples collected from Dorslandboom, a large iconic African baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) from Namibia, were investigated by AMS radiocarbon dating subsequent to pretreatment and, alternatively, without pretreatment. The comparative statistical evaluation of results showed that there were no significant differences between fraction modern values and radiocarbon dates of the samples analyzed after pretreatment and without pretreatment, respectively. The radiocarbon date of the oldest sample was 993 +/- 20 BP. Dating results also revealed that Dorslandboom is a multi-generation tree, with several stems showing different ages.

AB Herbivory rates are generally thought to be higher in tropical than in temperate forests. Nevertheless, tests of this biogeographic prediction by comparing a single plant species across a tropical-temperate range are scarce. Here, we compare herbivore damage between subtropical and temperate populations of the evergreen tree Aextoxicon punctatum (Olivillo), distributed between 30 degrees and 43 degrees S along the Pacific margin of Chile. To assess the impact of herbivory on Olivillo seedlings, we set up 29 experimental plots, 1.5 x 3 m: 16 in forests of Fray Jorge National Park (subtropical latitude), and 13 in Guabun, Chiloe Island (temperate latitude). Half of each plot was fenced around with chicken wire, to exclude small mammals, and the other half was left unfenced. In each half of the plots we planted 16 seedlings of Olivillo in December 2003, with a total of 928 plants. Seedling survival, leaf production and herbivory by invertebrates were monitored over the next 16 mo. Small mammal herbivores killed ca 30 percent of seedlings in both sites. Nevertheless, invertebrate herbivory was greater in the temperate forest, thus contradicting the expected trend of increasing herbivore impact toward the tropics. Seedling growth was greater in subtropical forest suggesting better conditions for tree growth or that higher invertebrate herbivory depressed seedling growth in the temperate forest. Invertebrate herbivory increased toward temperate latitudes while small mammal herbivory was similar in both sites. We suggest that comparison of single species can be useful to test generalizations about latitudinal patterns and allow disentangling factors controlling herbivory patterns across communities.

AB Traditionally, heterogeneity levels have been associated with refuge availability and, consequently, with security areas for prey. Hence, there is assumed to be a positive correlation between the spatial distribution of potential victims and habitat heterogeneity levels. Among fish, the magnitude of predator-prey interaction has been associated with their size ratio, which includes body size as a central variable for individual predation risk. To date, the importance of body size and its interaction with spatial heterogeneity in relation to fish spatial distribution has been scarcely considered, being this the main objective of the present study. Based on a semi-experimental design, defined by the level of spatial heterogeneity, censuses in 24 artificial pools were conducted for 2 years at the rocky intertidal zone. This study focused on carnivorous fish assemblages residing off the rocky shore of central Chile. The results indicated a counterintuitive response of fish to spatial heterogeneity, with a higher abundance of small fish in open areas. Apparently, this differential distribution could be related to the size ratio between prey and predator (size-dependent susceptibility to predation), which is a hypothesis supported by decreases in the co-occurrence of fish with increasing size similarity.

AB Considering the pressures on tropical forests from deforestation and the recent expansion of harvesting through forest concessions in the Brazilian Amazon, it is imperative that forest management systems are scrutinized to ensure sustainability. One of the basic problems in forest management is the correct identification of species within the forest stand. While this is a well known issue, little consideration is given to how to mitigate this problem or its affects on management practices and conservation. This paper examines the current practice of forest inventories in the Brazilian Amazon, as part of the mandatory system of reduced impact logging (RIL), using extensive forest inventory verification. The results show that the RIL management plan implemented in the project area was based on a highly inaccurate forest inventory. At least 132 species or 43.5% of all species identified after botanical checking did not appear in the forest inventory and the common practice of matching vernacular names to scientific ones proved to be severely deficient. In contrast, a high percentage of field identifications based on local people's expertise were correct. We suggest changes to current practices, including the training and use of parataxonomists, the collection of samples for verification, and stricter government control over current practices, which will achieve greater accuracy in data collection and forest management planning. Ultimately, we argue that in the current climate of extensive deforestation and forest use, it is essential that all aspects of RIL systems are reevaluated in order to achieve economic and ecological sustainability.

AB Tall-grass prairies are a critically endangered ecosystem in North America. Our objectives were to evaluate potential roles of prairie patch structure (defined in terms of prairie patch area, matrix type, and edge effects) in explaining changes in number, size, and quality of northern tall-grass prairies over time. In 2006, we evaluated changes in remnant tall-grass prairies at the most northern extent of the tall-grass prairie range, by resurveying plant communities in 65 remnant patches in Manitoba, Canada, that were previously surveyed in 1987 or 1988. In 2007 and 2008 we conducted more detailed surveys of vegetation structure and composition at 580, 0.2 x 0.5 m quadrats distributed within 24 remnant patches of northern tall-grass prairie. Our findings suggest remnant northern tall-grass prairies continue to suffer from serious threats: 37% of the patches surveyed in 1987 or 1988 had changed to other habitat types by 2006; patches smaller than 21 ha tended to decrease in size, while larger patches increased in size; and most patches, particularly smaller ones, declined in quality. Both native and alien species responded more strongly to distance to edge than to patch size or matrix type. Edge effects may explain why prairie quality is lower and more likely to decline in smaller remnants. Richness of native plants was negatively correlated with cover and richness of alien species, suggesting that alien species may displace native species. Few existing northern tall-grass prairies are likely to be self-sustaining, and immediate active management is required to prevent further loss of remnant northern tall-grass prairies.

AB Rhus typhina L. (staghorn sumac) is a clonal woody species that is considered potentially invasive in its non-native habitats. It is slow growing as seedlings, but grows fast once established. Its growth in the early stages is limited by many abiotic factors, including light intensity. To evaluate its potential of becoming invasive in areas it has been introduced into, we conducted a field experiment to investigate the effects of light intensity on the physiology and growth of R. typhina. Two-month-old R. typhina seedlings were examined under five light levels, that is, 100% full sunlight (unlimited light), moderate stress (50% or 25% of full sunlight) and severe stress (10% or 5% of full sunlight), for 60 days in Hunshandak Sandland, China. Net photosynthetic rate (P-N) was reduced significantly under severe light stress, but P-N of the moderately stressed seedlings was unaffected. Light stress also led to a reduction in saturated light intensity of the moderately stressed seedlings by 20% and of the severely stressed seedlings by 40%, although the light saturation points were as high as 800 and 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for the moderately and severely stressed seedlings, respectively. Under severe light stress, the maximum quantum yield of Photosystem II (F-v/F-m) decreased significantly, but the minimal fluorescence yield (F-0) increased compared to that of the control plants. The number of newly produced leaves and the stem height, however, decreased as the light intensity became lower. Root length and leaf area decreased, whereas specific leaf area significantly increased as light became increasingly lower. Biomass production was significantly reduced by light stress, but the allocation pattern was unaffected. Our results demonstrated that R. typhina seedlings can survive low light and grow well in other light conditions. The physiology and growth of R. typhina will likely enable it to acclimate to varying light conditions in Hunshandak Sandland, where R. typhina has been widely cultivated for sand stabilization and other purposes. Because of its ability to tolerate low light and to compete aggressively for light resource once established, that is, becoming invasive, we urge caution when it comes to introducing R. typhina into its non-native habitats, despite its many ecological benefits.

AB Humid tropical forests are dynamic ecosystems that experience multiple and overlapping disturbance events that vary in frequency, intensity, and spatial extent. Here we report the results of a 10-year study investigating the effects of forest clearing and multiple hurricanes on ecosystem carbon reservoirs, nutrient pools and vegetation. The aboveground plant community was most heavily affected by multiple disturbances, with the 9-year-old stands showing high rates of hurricane-induced mortality relative to surrounding forest. Belowground pools were less affected. Live fine root biomass fluctuated in response to multiple disturbances, but returned to pre-disturbance levels after 10 years. Soil C was resilient to clearing and hurricanes, probably due to the large pool size and high clay content. Soil P fluctuated over time, declining during periods of rapid plant recovery and growth. With the exception of K, base cations recovered within 2 years following clearing and showed little response to hurricane disturbance.

AB Schinus molle (Peruvian pepper tree) was introduced to South Africa more than 150 years ago and was widely planted, mainly along roads. Only in the last two decades has the species become naturalized and invasive in some parts of its new range, notably in semi-arid savannas. Research is being undertaken to predict its potential for further invasion in South Africa. We studied production, dispersal and predation of seeds, seed banks, and seedling establishment in relation to land uses at three sites, namely ungrazed savanna once used as a military training ground; a savanna grazed by native game; and an ungrazed mine dump. We found that seed production and seed rain density of S. molle varied greatly between study sites, but was high at all sites (384 864-1 233 690 seeds per tree per year; 3877-9477 seeds per square metre per year). We found seeds dispersed to distances of up to 320 m from female trees, and most seeds were deposited within 50 m of putative source trees. Annual seed rain density below canopies of Acacia tortillis, the dominant native tree at all sites, was significantly lower in grazed savanna. The quality of seed rain was much reduced by endophagous predators. Seed survival in the soil was low, with no survival recorded beyond 1 year. Propagule pressure to drive the rate of recruitment: densities of seedlings and sapling densities were higher in ungrazed savanna and the ungrazed mine dump than in grazed savanna, as reflected by large numbers of young individuals, but adult : seedling ratios did not differ between savanna sites. Frequent and abundant seed production, together with effective dispersal of viable S. molle seed by birds to suitable establishment sites below trees of other species to overcome predation effects, facilitates invasion. Disturbance enhances invasion, probably by reducing competition from native plants.

AB Predators are thought to play a key role in controlling herbivory, thus having positive indirect effects on plants. However, evidence for terrestrial trophic cascades is still fragmentary, perhaps due to variation in top-down forces created by environmental heterogeneity. We examined the magnitude of predation effects on foliar damage by chewing insects and mean leaf size, by excluding birds from saplings in 'dry' and 'wet' Nothofagus pumilio forests in the northern Patagonian Andes, Argentina. The experiment lasted 2 years, encompassing a severe drought during the La Nina phase of a strong El Nino/Southern Oscillation event, which was followed by unusually high background folivory levels. Insect damage was consistently higher in wet than in dry forest saplings. In the drought year (1999), bird exclusion increased folivory rates in both forests but did not affect tree leaf size. In the ensuing season (2000), leaf damage was generally twice as high as in the drought year. As a result, bird exclusion not only increased the extent of folivory but also significantly decreased sapling leaf size. The latter effect was stronger in the wet forest, suggesting compensation of leaf area loss by dry forest saplings. Overall, the magnitude of predator indirect effects depended on the response variable measured. Insectivorous birds were more effective at reducing folivory than at facilitating leaf area growth. Our results indicate that bird-initiated trophic cascades protect N. pumilio saplings from insect damage even during years with above-normal herbivory, and also support the view that large-scale climatic events influence the strength of trophic cascades.

ID ATLANTIC FOREST FRAGMENTS; HABITAT; REPRODUCTION; LANDSCAPES
AB Between May 2002 and May 2003, we studied a small mammal community from an Atlantic forest fragment surrounded by a coffee plantation in the municipality of Santa Teresa, Espirito Santo state, Brazil. We obtained a total of 300 captures of 114 individuals belonging to 11 mammal species. Seventy three percent of the species captured in the forest also used the coffee plantation, mainly males (90%) and young (80%) individuals of Marmosops incanus. The exceptionally low recapture rate in the coffee plantation suggests that it functions as a corridor between fragments, rather than as a habitat for these species. Understanding the role of matrix habitat use in fragmented landscapes is an important factor in small mammal conservation, as it asymmetrically affects the rate and mode of individual movements of different species.

AB Operational standard products of biophysical variables, such as leaf area index (LAI) derived from satellite observations (e.g. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) or VEGETATION), serve the need for adequate input data for quantitative modelling of ecosystem dynamics on regional to global scales. For the validation of those products and for local applications, higher resolution LAI maps based on field and high spatial resolution satellite data are crucial. As validation sites in tropical rainforests are rare, a study was undertaken in a moist semi-deciduous tropical rainforest in East Africa. In situ LAI measurements were carried out with digital hemispherical photography on 30 test sites. Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) and texture measures calculated from top-of-canopy Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT)-4 High Resolution Visible and Infrared (HRVIR) reflectance data were compared with respect to their ability to predict effective LAI. Regression analyses showed that ASTER data were generally better suited, with simple ratio (SR) performing best for early and intermediate forest stages and texture measures (grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) variance) derived from SWIR information rendering superior results in later forest stages. Finally, a high resolution LAI map could be constructed with an accuracy of 0.39.

AB Variations in the composition and structure of mid-altitude, semi-deciduous topical forest in a 0.64-ha plot in Mpanga Forest Reserve, Uganda, are described for a 38-year period to 2006. Repeat surveys of trees in the plot with a girth >= 30 cm at reference height in 1982, 1993 and 2006, following a baseline survey in 1968, indicate only relatively minor fluctuations in density, Shannon diversity, evenness, basal area (BA) and estimated above ground biomass. The largest trees [diameter at breast height (dbh) > 40 cm] and main canopy taxa (e.g. Celtis mildbraedii) accounted for the largest fraction of BA. Mortality was the highest amongst taxa classed as early seral, understorey and/or in the smallest size category (dbh = 9.5-20 cm), while new recruits were predominantly understorey taxa. Only one tree was recorded as felled for human use between the surveys of 1968 and 1993. In contrast, a considerable increase in anthropogenic disturbance was evident at the time of the 2006 survey, and illegal logging now poses a substantial threat to future resource availability and carbon storage in what was for a time one of the most protected areas of forest in Uganda.

AB The diet of the bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus) was investigated by quantifying the stomach contents of sharks taken in the California-based drift gillnet fishery. Fishery observers collected stomachs of sharks ranging in size from 147 to 230 cm fork length during the 1998-99 and 2002-06 seasons in pelagic waters between the U.S.-Mexico border and Cape Mendocino, California. The frequency of prey items in stomachs by weight, number, and Occurrence was determined and used to calculate two indices of dietary preference: the geometric index of importance (GII) and index of relative importance (IRI). Of 26 stomachs examined, 23 contained food items representing 20 taxa, indicating a broad trophic spectrum. Overall, the two indices consistently ranked the relative importance of prey items. Of the 10 taxa of teleosts found in the diet, fish of the firmly barracudinas (Paralepididae) represented the most important prey item (GII = 52.8; %IRI = 45.98), followed by Pacific hake (Merluccius productus; GII = 38.4; %IRI = 24.23), Pacific saury (Cololabis saira; GII = 22.2; %IRI = 8.08), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus; GII = 17.3; %IRI = 3.92), and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax; GII = 16.0; %IRI = 3.93). Of the eight taxa of cephalopods, jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas; GII = 15.5; %IRI = 3.61) and Gonatus spp. squid (GII = 11.0; %IRI 0.63) were proportionately highest in ranking. The remaining two taxa were both crustaceans. Despite a sample size inadequate for characterizing the full breadth of the bigeye thresher diet, these data demonstrate that bigeye thresher sharks have a diverse diet and may feed opportunistically on locally and temporally available prey, including epipelagic, mesopelagic, epi-benthic, and deep-scattering-layer species. These data are consistent with fishery and electronic tracking data which demonstrate that the bigeye thresher shark is predominately a deep-water species, but spends time both within the deep-scattering and the mixed-surface layers.

AB Aphyllophoraceous fungi are expected to reflect changes in the environmental conditions caused by forest use. To reveal the effects of forest uses on the fungal community structure, we performed a 3-month survey of aphyllophoraceous species in five forest types (undisturbed primary forest, isolated patches of primary forest, old and young fallow forest, and rubber plantations) in Sarawak, Malaysia in 2005. We used a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to reveal the relationships between fungal community composition and the environmental variables (canopy openness, soil water potential, amount and composition of coarse woody debris, litter mass, basal area, plant species composition). A total of 155 samples from 67 species were collected during the study period. The fungal species density represented by the number of species in a transect differed significantly among forest types. The fungal species density increased significantly with increasing number of pieces of coarse woody debris (CWD), but decreased significantly with increasing the scores of second axis of principal component analysis (PCA) for plant species composition. In the CCA ordination, automatic forward selection revealed that only the number of pieces of CWD significantly affected the fungal species composition. The occurrences of Flabellophora licmophora, Coriolopsis retropicta, Microporus vernicipes, and Amauroderma subrugosum were positively correlated with the number of pieces of CWD. Our study clearly demonstrated that forest use negatively affected aphyllophoraceous fungal diversity and suggest that the quantity of CWD would be an important determinant of fungal diversity and composition.

AB With an increase in growth irradiance (from 15 to 100 % of full sunlight, I-15 to I-100), the maximum net photosynthetic rate (P (max)), compensation (CI) and saturation irradiances of A. annua increased. At full sunlight, A. annua had a high capacity of photosynthesis, while at low irradiance it maintained a relatively high P (max) with a low CI. The height and diameter growth, total and leaf biomass, and artemisinin content of A. annua decreased with the decrease in irradiance, which might be connected with lower photosynthesis at lower than at higher irradiance. Irradiances changed biomass allocations of A. annua. The leaf/total mass ratio of A. annua increased with decreasing irradiance, but the root/total mass ratio and root/above-ground mass generally increased with increasing irradiance. Thus A. annua can grow in both weak and full sunlight. However, high yield of biomass and artemisinin require cultivation in an open habitat with adequate sunshine.

AB Predation of herbivorous Lepidoptera larvae by insectivorous avifauna was estimated on Lindera benzoin in edge and interior habitats at two sites in eastern Pennsylvania (USA). Clay baits modeled after Epimecis hortaria (Geometridae) larvae, the primary herbivore of L. benzoin at our study sites, were used to estimate predation by birds. In both habitat types, models were placed on uninjured L. benzoin leaves as well as on leaves that had prior insect herbivore damage. Rates of model attack were greater, and model longevity reduced, in forest edge plots compared to interiors. Naturally occurring herbivore damage on L. benzoin was greater in forest interiors. However, model attack was not significantly greater on leaves with prior herbivory damage, suggesting that birds do not effectively use this type of leaf damage as a cue in their foraging. Our findings are consistent with a contribution of bird predation towards top-down control of herbivory in this system. We further discuss these results in a broader context considering the possible effects of habitat type on leaf quality, leaf defense, and herbivore performance. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Fire and herbivory are known to modify plant community structure. Many studies have suggested that fire ashes may increase soil nutrients in dystrophic soils. Herbivores may also change plant community structure through direct effects of herbivory and affecting nutrient cycling. Leaf-cutting ants were traditionally viewed as herbivores, although their role may be more complex, because their nests affect both chemical and physical soil properties, thus affecting plants indirectly. We investigated the effects of frequent burning and of leaf-cutting ants on the nutrient status of an herbaceous and a shrub species occurring in the Brazilian Cerrado, a habitat that is characterized by natural burnings. The proximity of ant nests resulted in an increase of nutrients in the leaves of both vegetation strata, whereas burning sometimes resulted in a decrease of nutrients. Our results do not lead to a possible positive effect of fire on plant nutrient content. On the other hand, ant nests may represent an important source of nutrients for plants on the nutrient-depleted Cerrado soils and may accelerate vegetation recovery after burning.

AB We present a plant trait database covering autecology for rain forest trees of French Guiana. The database comprises more than thirty traits including autecology (e. g., habitat associations and reproductive phenology), wood structure (e. g., density and tension characteristics) and physiology at the whole plant (e. g., carbon and nitrogen isotopes) and leaf level (e. g., specific leaf area, photosynthetic capacity). The current database describes traits for about nine hundred species from three hundred genera in one hundred families. For more than sixty species, data on twelve morphological and ecophysiological traits are provided for individual plants under different environmental conditions and at different ontogenetic stages. The database is thus unique in permitting intraspecific analyses, such as the effects of ontogenetic stages or environmental conditions on trait values and their relationships.

AB The crustacean decapod fauna of Cubagua Island in the Caribbean Sea, Venezuela, an island much affected by coastal upweling, was surveyed. A total of 178 species from 41 families were recorded, of which 56 species were new records for the island; eigth genera and six species were new records for Venezuela. Most species had previously been recorded from the the Caribbean province, 19.7% were endemic for the province, 64.1% had affinities to the Brazilian province, 57.3% to the Texan and Carolinian provinces and 45.5% showed continuous distributions across the provinces but showing less endemism and more affinities with Brazilian province than the general trends of distributions of decapods in the Caribbean. It appears that upwelling processes around the island hinders the development of the typical Caribbean marine ecosystems. The proximity with the northern limit of the Brazilian province also affects the biodiversity of the island.

AB We used predictive modeling of species distributions to identify conservation priority areas in the equatorial Pacific region of western Ecuador and northwestern Peru. Museum and herbarium data and predictive models of species distributions are increasingly being used to assess the conservation status of individual species. In this study, we assembled occurrence data for 28 species of vascular plants, birds, and mammals to assess the conservation priorities of the set of natural communities that they represent. Environmental variables were used to predict the species' distributions using correlative modeling as an alternative to point data, which has been the traditional approach to identify critical areas. Specific priority sites for conservation were identified using an area-selection algorithm based on simulated annealing. Four scenarios of prioritization were created using different criteria for the spatial compactness of the selected sites and fragmentation of remnant habitat. The results provide a preliminary assessment of conservation priorities for the dry ecosystems of the Equatorial Pacific region, and will serve as guidelines to focus future fieldwork.

AB We surveyed birds in patches of native eucalypt forest and in surrounding exotic matrix (Radiata pine forests) in south-eastern Australia. Our objectives were: (1) to examine the influence of the width of native forest patches and the age of surrounding pine forests on bird occurrence in patches of native forest; and (2) to verify the relationship between the use of the surrounding pine matrix and bird species response to variation in width of patches of native forests. A total of 32 study sites (boundaries between eucalypt and pine forests) were surveyed. Birds were counted by the area search method within 0.5-ha quadrats. Data were analysed using generalised linear models. Wide patches of eucalypt forest supported higher species richness and greater numbers of birds, such as foliage searchers and nectarivores, than narrow patches. Matrix age also influenced the occurrence of some species in native patches. The abundance of species in wide and narrow patches of native forest was related to their use of the matrix. This was true for native forests surrounded by old but not by young pine forests. We suggest that management in wood production landscapes take into account both characteristics of native patches and the surrounding matrix. Negative impacts of fragmentation in managed landscapes might be reduced by promoting matrix types that are suitable for bird species.

ID GOVERNANCE
AB The territory organization of the Brazilian Amazon, understood as a socioeconomic network of municipalities, reflects the diversity of human settlements and their potentials for environmental changes, especially deforestation. This paper characterizes the urban network in the Brazilian Amazon through a model that integrates the levels of socioeconomic organization of municipalities and their interrelationships, as determined through migratory movements. The model of territorial organization combines five components: (i) the hierarchy of central places (poles) established by the concentration of urban specialized services, (ii) the geographical distance between central poles and other centers, (iii) the poles' populations, (iv) the migratory movements among them, and (v) a socioeconomic dimension index. These components are combined into a gravitational model to produce measures and maps of the socioeconomic municipality network of the Brazilian Amazon. As a result, out of 792 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon, 9 were classified as macro-poles, 29 were classified as meso-poles and 48 as micropoles. The areas of influence of these poles were determined according to the three hierarchy levels. The Amazon region network comprises a nested spatial pattern of municipalities not constrained by the state boundaries. Socioeconomic space and population movements influence the mobility of the deforestation frontier. This analysis provides insights to predict deforestation as well as to guide formulation of sustainable development policies suitable for each region's specificity. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Containerized seedlings of three commercially important tropical species were grown under four different light treatments [i.e., 100 ( open site), 45, 22 and 10% sunlight] for 130 days. Light-saturated photosynthesis (A(max)) and light saturation estimates (LSE) reflected the species successional status with Terminalia superba Engl. and Diels, the pioneer species showing largest mean Amax and LSE at 100% sunlight, whereas at 10% sunlight, it showed the lowest A(max) and LSE. At 22% sunlight, Cedrela odorata L., an intermediate successional species had greater Amax and LSE than Mansonia altissima A. Chev., a non-pioneer light demander and T. superba. T. superba had the lowest relative growth rate (RGR) at 10% sunlight and greatest net assimilation rate (NAR) at 100% sunlight; although a higher RGR at this light level was not seen for this species. Strong and positive linear mean A(max)-mean NAR relationship of C. odorata and T. superba indicated that differences in leaf photosynthetic rates of the two species were reflected in their NAR, which increased with increasing light. At final harvest, superior biomass production was found at 45% sunlight for all the species. Seedling responses in specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, leaf mass ratio and root mass ratio were typically those found along a light gradient. At the 100% sunlight, intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUE), F-v/F-m and final root system of the plants was generally superior in T. superba but at 10% sunlight, WUE was inferior in T. superba when compared to C. odorata and M. altissima, reflecting the respective species' short-term acclimation to high or low light. Results of this study may have practical use in screening tropical tree species for use in plantation forestry.

AB Berberis darwinii(Berberidaceae) is a serious environmental weed in New Zealand, capable of invading a range of different light environments from grazed pasture to intact forest. According to optimal partitioning models, some plants optimise growth under different environmental conditions by shifting biomass allocation among tissue types (e.g. roots, shoots) to maximise the capture of limiting resources (e.g. water, light). We examined patterns of growth, biornass allocation, and seedling survival in Berberis darwinii to determine whether any of these factors might be contributing to invasion success. Growth and biomass allocation parameters were measured oil seedlings grown for 7 months in five natural light environments in the field. Survival was high in the sunniest sites, and low in the shadiest sites. Seedlings grown in full suit were an order of magnitude taller and heavier, had five times as many leaves, and proportionally more biomass allocated to leaves than seedlings grown in other light environments. In the shade, leaves were bigger and thinner, and leaf area as a proportion of total plant biomass increased, but the proportion of above- to below-ground biomass was similar across all light and soil moisture environments. In summary, although leaf traits were plastic, patterns of biomass allocation did not vary according to optimal partitioning models, and were not Correlated with patterns of seedling survival. Implications for the management of this invasive species are discussed.

AB The information currently available on sexual selection in hermit crabs is reviewed to identify the role of males and females before, during and after mating. According to this information, possible mechanisms of male-male competition, female choice and/or sexual conflict are suggested. Important male components that may affect mating success include dragging the female shell, rotations of the female's shell and male cheliped palpations, and male size and/or shell characteristics (species and size). Possible female determinants of male mating/fertilization success include size (as an indicator of egg production capacity), signalling of sexual receptivity to males, delay from mate guarding to copulation and mating duration. Avenues for deeper exploration in males include the role of the number and morphometry of male sexual tubes during sperm transfer, and whether ejaculate size and sperm number can be adjusted with variable situations of sperm competition intensity and risk. In females it would be interesting to investigate the chemical and behavioural mechanisms affecting spermatophore breakage for sperm release and the variable duration from sperm transfer to spawning. Given these possibilities, and that sperm is externally deposited on the female's body but inside her shell (except for those species that do not use shells, e.g. Birgus, or species where shells are rather small and do not cover the body totally, e.g. Parapagurus), we conclude that hermit crabs are unique subjects for separating male and female effects, particularly with respect to the applicability of current ideas in sexual selection such as female choice and sexual conflict. Some practical ideas are provided to disentangle both hypotheses using these animals.

AB This study examined the impact of wetland habitat loss and isolation on an insect-plant interaction, and the subsequent rate of recovery of the interaction following experimental habitat restoration. We compared herbivore colonisation rates and herbivory damage by "Batrachedra' sp. (Lepidoptera: Coleophoridae) on experimentally placed potted Sporadanthus ferrugineus (Restionaceae) plants at increasing distances (up to 800 m) from an intact habitat (the source population). These tests showed that even a moderate degree of isolation (i.e. greater than 400 m) from the intact wetland habitat caused an almost complete collapse of the insect-plant interaction, at least in the short term. The number of eggs and larvae of colonising "Batrachedra' sp., as well as average larval size and the proportion of S. ferrugineus stems damaged, all decreased logarithmically with increasing distance from the intact habitat, presumably due to dispersal limitation of the herbivore. Subsequently, to test whether the interaction can recover following habitat restoration, we surveyed herbivore colonisation rates and herbivory damage on naturally regenerated S. ferrugineus plants on experimentally restored 'islands' at increasing distances (up to 800 m) from an intact habitat. The rate of recovery of the interaction was surprisingly rapid (i.e. between 196 and 308 weeks). The degree of difference in the density of eggs and larvae, and in the proportion of stems damaged with increasing isolation from the intact wetland, gradually diminished over 196 weeks. After 308 weeks there was no significant difference in the insect-plant interaction between the intact wetland sites and any of the experimentally restored sites up to 800 m away. These results suggest that some insect-plant interactions can recover rapidly from habitat loss with restoration management.

AB Recognizing the importance of catchment processes related to the long-term sustainability of rapidly developing forested and formerly forested landscapes in tropical Asia, two scientific meetings were recently hosted to highlight current research advances in this region. Here we have compiled 18 papers that address various catchment processes in tropical Asia, including atmospheric fluxes, hydrologic and geomorphic processes, and carbon and nutrient cycling, as well as related land management effects. Sustainable management options related to catchment processes in Southeast Asia are discussed herein, along with research and technology transfer needs. A conceptual model is presented for assessing the interactions of anthropogenic factors on catchment processes across various temporal and spatial scales. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, two benthic habitats have been investigated in a fully protected site and two control sites at the Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo marine protected area (MPA) (NE Sardinia). Overall, a protection effect on the benthic assemblages was highlighted in the shallow subtidal (5 m deep) rather than at intertidal algal turf habitat. Structure of assemblages at the shallow subtidal habitat is different in the fully protected site vs. controls, while this was not true for the intertidal habitat. At the subtidal, this finding is probably linked to indirect effects due to an increase of consumers in the protected site (e.g., sea urchins), while the lack of direct impacts in the intertidal at control sites is indicative of very similar assemblages. Cover of encrusting algae was significantly higher at the subtidal protected site suggesting a possible higher grazing pressure. Possible causes underlying the inconsistency of results obtained between habitats include the possibility that trophic cascade effects have a different influence at different heights on the shore. The need to estimate the interconnection among benthic habitats through trophic links is also highlighted to provide an estimate of the vulnerability to protection of various habitats.

AB Zidona dufresnei (fine snail) is a common gastropod species in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean, which has been exported to Asian countries for human consumption since 1988. Landings of Z. dufresnei increased from 1974 to a maximum record of 1,300 mt (whole shelled animal) in 1997, followed by a steady decline through 2002. No resource management effort have been applied to this species since the beginning of its catch history, about 30y ago. Information provided in this work, together with previous studies on the reproductive biology and population dynamics of Z. dufresnei. will contribute to establish effective precautionary polices to manage this resource. We suggest that Z. dufresnei is in a phase of over-exploitation since 1988 until present, we propose a rational management as size selectivity, with a minimum capture size of 16 cm, closure of the fishery during the reproductive season, from September to December and to rotate the fishing areas. This study provides historical and updated information as an attempt to implement corrective measures towards a better management of the fishery on the Argentine Continental Shelf.

AB The diversity and distribution of stream insect communities in three habitats and 33 microhabitats were explored using data collected from 39 localities in the Western Ghats. The diversity and abundance of taxa vary across habitats. The microhabitat richness was positively correlated and altitude negatively correlated with taxa richness in the cascades and riffles. In pools and cascades, per cent canopy cover and average annual rainfall were both positively correlated with taxa richness. Structurally complex microhabitats harboured more taxa than the unstable and detritus poor microhabitats. The importance of habitat and microhabitat distribution in understanding the spatial distribution of stream insects and developing biomonitoring tools is discussed.

AB Fragmentation of tropical forest alters community composition as a result of changes in forest shape. This paper uses 22 hypotheses to test the effect of fragment shape on tree species composition in Ghana, West Africa. within biological categories of regeneration guild, rarity, phenology and dispersal. For both regenerating and mature trees, relationships between species composition and the shape of forest fragments were complex: almost half were significant but many failed to support the established hypotheses. Irregular shaped fragments had high proportions of regenerating, light-demanding pioneers and mature, animal-dispersed species. Species common to Ghana formed the foundation of communities in fragments of all shapes. Investigation at the landscape level indicated broad patterns of species change. Rigorous hypothesis testing is needed, following extensive demographic work on the ground, before population dynamics within tropical forest fragments can be comprehended fully and applied to conservation management.

ID UNITED-STATES; EFFICIENCY; SCALE; FRAGMENTATION; STRESS
AB This article reports the methodology and results of a data envelopment analysis (DEA) that attempts to identify areas in the country where there is maximum potential for improving the forest and rangeland condition, based on 12 indicator variables. This analysis differs from previous DEA studies in that the primary variables are measures of human activity and indicators of forest and rangeland condition in place of the traditional economic inputs (costs) and outputs. It also involves a different (ecological) production process than traditional DEA analyses, and a statistical preanalysis is developed and applied to homogenize the large and highly diverse landscape where this ecological production process takes place for the purposes of the DEA. It is concluded that, based on this analysis, there are opportunities to improve the forest and rangeland condition without reducing the amount of human activity, but not over large areas, only for some indicators, and typically not for a large number of indicators in the same place. This means that large-scale improvements in environmental condition across many indicators may often not come about without a reduction in human activity.

AB 1. Animal aggregation has been well studied, with many proximate and ultimate models proposed. Many of the proximate models have relied on cost-benefit arguments, but frequently aspects of cost have been inferred in relation to position in group. An expected cost to an animal that rests in aggregations, but departs to forage, is that being in the centre of a group may impede foraging opportunities, in that 'inner' animals cannot leave to forage until outer animals have done so.
   2. Experiments with a limpet Cellana tramoserica, on a rocky shore in New South Wales, Australia, showed that central limpets remain central more often than would be expected by chance. In respect of costs due to access to foraging, we show that there is no effect of position (central vs. outer) in timing of foraging excursions or of feeding-rate. We also show that an aggregated distribution of C. tramoserica at rest does not translate into an aggregated distribution of foraging animals.
   3. We propose that aggregations of C. tramoserica are probably a function of how the group reassembles after foraging and is much dependent on processes happening at a small spatial scale. It is highly probable that assumptions about the effects of limpet aggregation on rocky shore ecology (i.e. in influencing patchiness of algae) may be premature.

AB Helcion pectunculus has an organized distribution within rock crevices with smaller, younger limpets towards the back of the crevice and larger, older limpets towards the crevice mouth. The crevice refuge provides H. pectunculus with a stable and buffered environment with higher relative humidities and lower rock surface temperatures than adjacent exposed rock surfaces. Limpet body temperatures were significantly lower in crevice refuges compared with limpets on adjacent exposed rock surfaces. Body temperatures never exceeded the rock surface temperatures. It is suggested that this is a result of morphological adaptations such as short spines on the shell and allometric growth (shell increasing in height faster than length). Compared with other South African patellids, less force is required to detach H. pectunculus from the substratum and individuals deprived of a crevice refuge experienced extremely high mortalities, 45% of limpets being lost during the first high tide period.

AB Southeast Asia is rapidly losing native habitats and the consequences of this are poorly understood. Because habitat loss and disturbance can affect avian and seed survivorship, we conducted artificial nest and seed predation experiments on tropical southeast Asian islands. Data among islands and fragments or different forest types (e.g. primary versus exotic forest) within the islands are compared. On Singapore Island, predation among different forest types (primary, secondary and woodland) did not differ. Only at one of the sites, nest predation was higher at 75 m from the forest edge than at 25 m. In other sites, predation did not differ in relation to the distance from the forest edge. Predation among 10 small (0.8-1026 ha) Singaporean islands differed. However, none of the environmental variables (e.g. island area) could explain the predation differences. The lowest predation of both nests and seeds was recorded in the primary forest areas of a contiguous forest (25 500 ha) in central Java (Linggoasri). Small mammals were the main predators on Singapore and other surrounding islands. However, the index of potential predator abundance, overall, did not correlate with predation. While larger and more pristine forests may be better for avian and seed survivorship, pinpointing variables affecting both artificial nest and seed predation may be difficult.

AB A greenhouse experiment was conducted on seedlings of three native trees from the Ecuadorian Amazon: Pollalesta discolor, Inga densiflora, and Platymiscium pinnatum. We studied their growth and photosynthetic performances in contrasting light environments, in order to assess the potential of these seedlings for future silvicultural use as well as to characterize their optimal light requirements. Seedlings were grown for 3.5 months in a greenhouse under three light intensities, full light (100%), partial shade (15%), and full shade (2.5%). Survival, growth, biomass allocation, leaf turnover and plant morphology were determined for all seedlings and gas exchange measurements were measured on a sub-sample of each species. Results showed that Pollalesta discolor had a high growth rate, a rapid leaf turnover, a large total leaf area and a high specific leaf area (SLA), coupled with high photosynthetic rates, when grown in a full-light environment. These traits confirm that it is shade intolerant, requiring a high-light environment for establishment as a seedling, characteristic of an early-successional species. Inga densiflora appeared to require some shade during its seedling stage, as shown by highest photosynthetic rates in partial shade. The full light treatment caused photoinhibition, impairing photosynthetic rates, and the full shade treatment was linked to high mortality, indicating that this species could not persist in a forest understory. Platymiscium pinnatum thrived equally well under both shade treatments, and had lower photosynthetic rates under the full light treatment. It was definitely a shade-tolerant species, displaying characteristics of a late-successional species. Increased growth performances with increased light intensity would indicate that this species could eventually benefit from higher light conditions. This experimental characterization of light requirements for seedlings of lesser known native species, through growth and photosynthetic performances under contrasting light environments, provided valuable information on their early establishment requirements, which could be used in selecting the proper light regime in nurseries and plantation models.

AB Studies of primate community structure increase our understanding of behavior, adaptation, and evolution. However; there are few biogeographic data on specific composition and association partterns in primate communities. I conducted a biogeographic analysis of the community structure of primate species at 16 sites in Guyana. I used data from 1725 km of line-transect censuses to determine specific composition and association patterns of 220 primate groups. Of the 18 polyspecific groups, 94.1% (N = 16) included squirrel monkeys. There was an overall trend rewards positive specific associations among Guyanese primates. The only species that exhibited a negative pattern of interspecific associations were brown and wedge-capped capuchins. The sighting rate for wedge-capped capuchins at sympatric sires was particularly depressed compared to that for brown capuchins. Low plant productivity in Guyanese forests may reduce the diversity of feeding niches and result in a low incidence of polyspecific associations and scramble competition between wedge-capped and brown capuchins.

AB Several congeneric species of intertidal green algae inhabit shady, low-desiccation microhabitats. The N.E. Pacific green alga Codium setchellii occurs on sand-influenced rocky shores, particularly on shady, vertical surfaces on low intertidal rocky benches. The S. Pacific congener C. convolutum shows a similar, though less restrictive, distribution. The algal distributional patterns were inversely related to potential desiccation stress. Thallus abundance and/or size increased lower on the shore and on shady aspects. Because some thalli persist in desiccation-prone habitats, C. setchellii and C. convolutum can persist in alternative areas. Spatial patterns of specialist herbivore abundance indicated that stenophagous sea slugs that fed selectively on Codium were disproportionately more frequent on desiccation-prone algal hosts. On Oregon shores, USA, the sea slug Placida dendritica was more frequent on the alga C. setchellii (i) at the upper end of the alga's tidal distribution than at the lower end and (ii) on desiccation-prone, eastern aspects than on those with more benign, western aspects. Populations of slugs on Oregon shores peaked in spring and early summer during the period of peak desiccation to low intertidal species. The seasonal, habitat-associated pattern of slug distribution on algal hosts was geographically and taxonomically robust. On N.E. New Zealand shores, two species of ascoglossan slugs were significantly more frequent on thalli of C. convolutum at the upper end of the alga's tidal distribution than at the lower end. Increased larval settlement of slugs on desiccation-prone algal hosts contributed to this pattern whereas spatial variation in predator abundance did not. Larval metamorphosis experiments with the ascoglossan Elysia viridis from Scottish shores demonstrated that the frequency of larval metamorphosis was significantly greater in the presence of desiccation-prone algal hosts than unstressed ones. Thus, variable algal susceptibility and differential slug settlement and metamorphosis both contribute to this striking pattern of targeted slug attack. In contrast to the wealth of terrestrial examples, this is one of the few marine examples of prey-stress models. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.

TI BRYOZOAN ASSEMBLAGES IN MESSINIAN DEPOSITS OF WESTERN ALGERIA
SO LETHAIA
LA English
DT Article
ID MIOCENE
AB Messinian (Uppermost Miocene) outcrops near the town of Oran in western Algeria yielded rich bryozoan faunas: 188 species and forms. Bryozoans were studied in ten different deposits and 27 horizons representing various marly and calcareous facies. The number of species is lowest in the coral reefs (51), intermediate in the coralline-algae limestones (95), and highest in the marls (167). Also, zoarial growth forms are more diverse in marly deposits than in calcareous ones. These differences are interpreted in terms of bottom substrate, depth, deposition rate, and hydrodynamic conditions. An analysis based on zoarial growth forms and known bathymetric ranges of species still living gives more precise depth indications for each studied assemblage. A detailed survey of these assemblages in several sections shows that a gradual lowering of regional sea level occurred during the Messinian. From the presence of a number of warm-water bryozoan taxa, a higher temperature than in the Present Mediterranean sea is also favored.

AB Long-tongued Anthophora spp. bees collecting nectar from flowers of Anchusa strigosa (Boraginaceae) exhibit systematic foraging. Successive forager arrivals at individual flowers are not independent, and the time elapsed between successive arrivals at a particular flower is distributed more uniformly than be expected on the basis of a random arrival process. Distributions of interarrival time for individual flowers show standard deviation/mean mean ratios of 0.44-0.79, a range which is consistent with results obtained for two other plant-pollinator systems. The rate at which nectar is renewed between successive forager arrivals is independent of the amount of nectar in the flower, and the renewal process is strongly linear. Practical and theoretical implications of these results are discussed.

AB Cheilostome distribution and abundance were surveyed on eight reefs along the Caribbean coast of Panama to determine the extent of local variation in community structure. Communities were sampled from two depths, from several different substrata, and from two reef types defined by degree of exposure to terrigenous influence. Communities differed widely in total cheilostome cover, species richness, and species abundance pattern, but none of these measures were consistently related to reef type, depth or substratum. In all samples, a small number of the species present contributed disproportionately to the spatial cover or population of colonies. Multivariate analyses based on species cover or colony abundance distinguished between communities with a high level of accuracy, but with no consistent grouping by depth or reef type. Among the main space-occupying cheilostome species, local abundance patterns reflecting differences in reef type were rare, but several species showed clear depth-related trends in abundance.
   Cheilostomes dominating similar reef habitats in Jamaica and Venezuela are often identical or congeneric with those common in Panama, but some widespread species show inconsistencies in habitat preference. Results from Caribbean reefs suggest a general correlation between cheilostome life history and ecological success on different substrata. We suggest that geographic differences in the relative abundance of reef species probably do not result from a high sensitivity to local conditions, but are more likely to have a stochastic and historical basis.

AB Background The potential benefits of intercropping are manifold and have been repeatedly demonstrated. Intercropping has the potential to create more productive and resilient agroecosystems, by improving land utilisation, yield and yield stability, soil quality, and pest, disease and weed suppression. Despite these potential benefits, significant gaps remain in the understanding of ecological mechanisms that govern the outcomes when crop species are grown together. A major part of plant-plant interactions takes place belowground and these are often overlooked. Scope This review synthesises current evidence for belowground plant-plant interactions of competition, niche differentiation and facilitation, with the aim of identifying root traits that influence the processes contributing to enhanced performance of intercrops compared with monocultures. We identify a suite of potentially complementary root traits for maximising the benefits of intercropping. These traits underpin improved soil exploration, more efficient resource use, and suppression of soil-borne pathogens and pests in intercrops. Conclusion This review brings together understanding of the mechanisms underpinning interactions between intercropped roots, and how root traits and their plasticity can promote positive outcomes. Root trait 'ideotypes' for intercropped partners are identified that could be selected for crop improvement. We highlight the importance of examining belowground interactions and consider both spatial and temporal distribution of roots and rhizosphere mechanisms that aid complementarity through niche differentiation and facilitation. Breeding of crop ideotypes with specific beneficial root traits, combined with considerations for optimal spatio-temporal arrangement and ratios of component crops, are essential next steps to promote the adoption of intercropping as a sustainable farming practice.

AB Harnessing nature-based climate solutions (NbCS) to help simultaneously achieve climate and conservation goals is an attractive win-win. The contribution of NbCS to climate action relies on both biogeochemical potential and the ability to overcome environmental, economic and governance constraints for implementation. As such, estimates of additional NbCS-related terrestrial biosphere storage potential range from less than 100 GtCO(2) to more than 800 GtCO(2). In this Review, we assess the negative emissions contributions of NbCS - including reforestation, improved forest management and soil carbon sequestration - alongside their environmental, social and governance constraints. Given near-term implementation challenges and long-term biogeochemical constraints, a reasonable value for the expected impact of NbCS is up to 100-200 GtCO(2) in negative emissions for the remainder of the twenty-first century. To sustainably reach this level, focus should be on projects with clear co-benefits, and must not come at the expense of a reduction in emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, rapid decarbonization and innovation from alternative negative emissions technologies.
   Nature-based climate solutions can help meet climate mitigation goals, but estimates of their carbon storage potential vary. This Review discusses the constraints and potential contributions of increasing carbon storage in the terrestrial biosphere, suggesting a conservative estimate of 100-200 GtCO(2) in negative emissions to 2100.

AB The past 40 years in Southeast Asia have seen about 50% of lowland rainforests converted to oil palm and other plantations, and much of the remaining forest heavily logged. Little is known about how fragmentation influences recovery and whether climate change will hamper restoration. Here, we use repeat airborne LiDAR surveys spanning the hot and dry 2015-16 El Nino Southern Oscillation event to measure canopy height growth across 3,300ha of regenerating tropical forests spanning a logging intensity gradient in Malaysian Borneo. We show that the drought led to increased leaf shedding and branch fall. Short forest, regenerating after heavy logging, continued to grow despite higher evaporative demand, except when it was located close to oil palm plantations. Edge effects from the plantations extended over 300 metres into the forests. Forest growth on hilltops and slopes was particularly impacted by the combination of fragmentation and drought, but even riparian forests located within 40m of oil palm plantations lost canopy height during the drought. Our results suggest that small patches of logged forest within plantation landscapes will be slow to recover, particularly as ENSO events are becoming more frequent. It is unclear whether tropical forest fragments within plantation landscapes are resilient to drought. Here the authors analyse LiDAR and ground-based data from the 2015-16 El Nino event across a logging intensity gradient in Borneo. Although regenerating forests continued to grow, canopy height near oil palm plantations decreased, and a strong edge effect extended up to at least 300m away.

AB This article presents a systematic review of the factors and motivations that explain participation in payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs in the Global South. PES are voluntary conservation incentive programs and participation is determined by eligibility, willingness, and ability to participate. Following the PRISMA guide-lines, we review 78 studies and summarize how willingness (financial and non-financial motivations) and ability (based on the capital assets framework) to participate are measured and the direction of influence of these variables. An increasing number of studies assess the role of both financial and non-financial motivators on PES participation. Financial and non-financial motivators, including pro-social, pro-environmental, and risk reduction, positively influence willingness to participate. Most studies consider the role of at least one capital asset in determining ability to participate in PES programs. In general, participants in PES programs have more capital assets than non-participants. Our findings suggest that the theory behind how PES mechanisms work needs to be updated to account for more complex behavioral theories and a wider set of factors and motivations. Results from this systematic review can be used to inform the design of PES programs and help shed light on why PES programs achieve their environmental or socioeconomic objectives.

AB Tropical ecosystems are undergoing unprecedented rates of degradation from deforestation, fire, and drought disturbances. The collective effects of these disturbances threaten to shift large portions of tropical ecosystems such as Amazon forests into savanna-like structure via tree loss, functional changes, and the emergence of fire (savannization). Changes from forest states to a more open savanna-like structure can affect local microclimates, surface energy fluxes, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions. A predominant type of ecosystem state change is the loss of tree cover and structural complexity in disturbed forest. Although important advances have been made contrasting energy fluxes between historically distinct old-growth forest and savanna systems, the emergence of secondary forests and savanna-like ecosystems necessitates a reframing to consider gradients of tree structure that span forest to savanna-like states at multiple scales. In this Innovative Viewpoint, we draw from the literature on forest-grassland continua to develop a framework to assess the consequences of tropical forest degradation on surface energy fluxes and canopy structure. We illustrate this framework for forest sites with contrasting canopy structure that ranges from simple, open, and savanna-like to complex and closed, representative of tropical wet forest, within two climatically distinct regions in the Amazon. Using a recently developed rapid field assessment approach, we quantify differences in cover, leaf area vertical profiles, surface roughness, albedo, and energy balance partitioning between adjacent sites and compare canopy structure with adjacent old-growth forest; more structurally simple forests displayed lower net radiation. To address forest-atmosphere feedback, we also consider the effects of canopy structure change on susceptibility to additional future disturbance. We illustrate a converse transition-recovery in structure following disturbance-measuring forest canopy structure 10 yr after the imposition of a 5-yr drought in the ground-breaking Seca Floresta experiment. Our approach strategically enables rapid characterization of surface properties relevant to vegetation models following degradation, and advances links between surface properties and canopy structure variables, increasingly available from remote sensing. Concluding, we hypothesize that understanding surface energy balance and microclimate change across degraded tropical forest states not only reveals critical atmospheric forcing, but also critical local-scale feedbacks from forest sensitivity to additional climate-linked disturbance.

AB Soil phosphorus (P) availability in lowland tropical rainforests influences the distribution and growth of tropical tree species. Determining the P-acquisition strategies of tropical tree species could therefore yield insight into patterns of tree beta-diversity across edaphic gradients. In particular, the synthesis of root phosphatases is likely to be of significance given that organic P represents a large pool of potentially available P in tropical forest soils. It has also been suggested that a high root phosphatase activity in putative nitrogen (N) -fixing legumes might explain their high abundance in lowland neotropical forests under low P supply. Here, we measured phosphomonoesterase (PME) activity on the first three root orders of co-occurring tropical tree species differing in their N-fixation capacity, growing on soils of contrasting P availability in Panama. Our results show that root PME activity was higher on average in P-poor than in P-rich soils, but that local variation in PME activity among co-occurring species within a site was larger than that explained by differences in soil P across sites. Legumes expressed higher PME activity than nonlegumes, but nodulated legumes (i.e., actively fixing nitrogen) did not differ from legumes without nodules, indicating that PME activity is unrelated to N fixation. Finally, PME activity declined with increasing root order, but the magnitude of the decline varied markedly among species, highlighting the importance of classifying fine roots into functional groups prior to measuring root traits. Our results support the hypothesis that low-P promotes a high root PME activity, although the high local variation in this trait among co-occurring species points toward a high functional diversity in P-acquisition strategies within an individual community.

AB Most strategies for limiting global climate change invoke the use of bioenergy, but biofuel crops vary in climate mitigation potential and in the provision of other ecosystem services. The predominant biofuel in North America is ethanol produced from corn Zea mays. Corn is grown on similar to 360,000 km(2) of land in the U.S. and similar to 40 % of the yield is used for ethanol production. Despite its prevalence, corn ethanol is a poor climate change mitigator and the spread of intensive corn agriculture also leads to the loss of biodiversity and an unknown complement of associated ecosystem services. To test for effects of land use intensity on the provision of ecosystem services from biofuel crops, we compared insect communities inhabiting long-term experiments in which land use intensity varied from annual corn production to less intensive native perennial biofuel crops (switchgrass and restored prairie) and unmanaged native forests. Within the experiments we focused on ants (Formicidae: Hymenoptera), including their diversity, abundance, functional traits, and predation of biofuel crop pests. Native perennial biofuel crops supported up to 185 % more ant species than corn fields and provided up to 55 % more natural pest suppression. They also contained higher functional richness by supporting social parasites and seed dispersing ants that were absent in corn. Biofuel crops did not differ in ant activity or the prevalence of introduced ants. Our results highlight tradeoffs in bioenergy production and suggest ways to maximize benefits for wildlife and people. Converting some corn fields to prairie or other native vegetation could restore landscapes while mitigating climate change and meeting energy needs.

AB The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon density (SOCD) is crucial for understanding land use impact on carbon budget. The spatial estimation and accurate mapping of SOCD in plains remain challenging, partly due to the relatively invariant topography and the lack of consideration of landscape patterns. Here, we propose a novel landscape metric-based regression Kriging (LMRK) for the spatial estimation of SOCD in plains. Using 242 topsoil samples collected in the Jianghan Plain, China, we (i) investigate the scale-dependent relationship between SOCD and 24 landscape metrics and (ii) develop LMRK models with multi-scale buffers (100-1000 m) for SOCD estimation and compare their performance with ordinary Kriging (OK) and regression Kriging (RK) that integrates land use types. Results showed that LMRK outperformed other models. The relationships between SOCD and landscape metrics were found to be scale-dependent, and the buffer of 300 m exhibited the optimal scale in our case. The LMRK also revealed that a highly connected and water-sufficient landscape was conducive to the accumulation of soil organic carbon in farmlands. These results indicated that landscape metrics serve as good predictors, and the proposed LMRK method is effective for SOCD mapping in plains. Our findings highlight the scale-dependent relationship between landscape metrics and SOCD and provide a new perspective for soil mapping in plains.

AB Biofilm heterogeneity has been characterized on various scales for both natural and engineered ecosystems. This heterogeneity has been attributed to spatial differences in environmental factors. Understanding their impact on localized biofilm heterogeneity in building plumbing systems is important for both management and representative sampling strategies. We assessed heterogeneity within the confined engineered ecosystem of a shower hose by high-resolution sampling (200 individual biofilm sections per hose) on varying scales (mm to m). We postulated that a biofilm grown on a single material under uniform conditions should be homogeneous in its structure, bacterial numbers, and community composition. A biofilm grown for 12 months under controlled laboratory conditions, showed homogeneity on large-scale. However, some small-scale heterogeneity was clearly observed. For example, biofilm thickness of cm-sections varied up to 4-fold, total cell concentrations (TCC) 3-fold, and relative abundance of dominant taxa up to 5-fold. A biofilm grown under real (i.e., uncontrolled) use conditions developed considerably more heterogeneity in all variables which was attributed to more discontinuity in environmental conditions. Interestingly, biofilm communities from both hoses showed comparably low diversity, with <400 taxa each, and only three taxa accounting for 57%, respectively, 73% of the community. This low diversity was attributed to a strong selective pressure, originating in migrating carbon from the flexible hoses as major carbon source. High-resolution sampling strategy enabled detailed analysis of spatial heterogeneity within an individual drinking water biofilm. This study gives insight into biofilm structure and community composition on cm-to m-scale and is useful for decision-making on sampling strategies in biofilm research and monitoring.

AB We investigate how variation in patch area and forest cover quantified for three different spatial scales (buffer size of 500, 1500 and 3000 m radius) affects species richness and functional diversity of bat assemblages in two ecosystems differing in fragment-matrix contrast: a landbridge island system in Panama and a countryside ecosystem in the Brazilian Amazon. Bats were sampled on 11 islands and the adjacent mainland in Panama, and in eight forest fragments and nearby continuous forest in Brazil. Species-area relationships (SAR) were assessed based on Chao1 species richness estimates, and functional diversity-area relationships (FAR) were quantified using Chao1 functional diversity estimates measured as the total branch length of a trait dendrogram. FARs were calculated using three trait sets: considering five species functional traits (FAR(ALL)), and trait subsets reflecting 'diet breadth' (FAR(DIET)) and 'dispersal ability' (FAR(DISPERSAL)). We found that in both study systems, FAR(ALL) was less sensitive to habitat loss than SAR, in the sense that an equal reduction in habitat loss led to a disproportionately smaller loss of functional diversity compared to species richness. However, the inhospitable and static aquatic matrix in the island ecosystem resulted in more pronounced species loss with increasing loss of habitat compared to the countryside ecosystem. Moreover, while we found a significant FAR(DISPERSAL) for the island ecosystem in relation to forest cover within 500 m landscape buffers, FAR(DIET) and FAR(DISPERSAL) were not significant for the countryside ecosystem. Our findings highlight that species richness and functional diversity in island and countryside ecosystems scale fundamentally differently with habitat loss, and suggest that key bat ecological functions, such as pollination, seed dispersal and arthropod suppression, may be maintained in fragments despite a reduction in species richness. Our study reinforces the importance of increasing habitat availability for decreasing the chances of losing species richness in smaller fragments.

AB In a world of increasing demand for natural resources, conservation actions are frequently postponed, even though this may impair biodiversity and the supply of ecosystem services (ES). Here, we evaluated the consequences of delaying conservation actions to protect ES in the Brazilian Cerrado, the most diverse tropical savanna in the world, which is threatened by rapid expansion of agriculture. We generated land use maps for the present and two future periods (2025 and 2050), using a comprehensive land use model. Based on these maps, we modeled the provision of six ES: water yield, sediment retention, nutrient retention, carbon storage, net primary productivity and wild food provision. We identified priority areas for safeguarding ES to meet four conservation targets (i.e. 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of each ES). We found that expected land use changes tended to diminish ES provision over time and modify their spatial distribution. Priority areas in the region also tended to differ spatially between present and future. Moreover, priority areas identified for the future will encompass more extensive altered environments than those for present day landscapes. Our study highlights the importance of avoiding delays in conservation actions, as this may exacerbate conflicts between conservation and development. Arguments based on ES could create new incentives to simultaneously conserve both ES and the biodiversity associated with them in the region.

AB Mapping vegetation types through remote sensing images has proved to be effective, especially in large biomes, such as the Brazilian Cerrado, which plays an important role in the context of management and conservation at the agricultural frontier of the Amazon. We tested several combinations of optical and radar images to identify the four dominant vegetation types that are prevalent in the Cerrado area (i.e., cerrado denso, cerradAo, gallery forest, and secondary forest). We extracted features from both sources of data such as intensity, grey level co-occurrence matrix, coherence, and polarimetric decompositions using Sentinel 2A, Sentinel 1A, ALOS-PALSAR 2 dual/full polarimetric, and TanDEM-X images during the dry and rainy season of 2017. In order to normalize the analysis of these features, we used principal component analysis and subsequently applied the Random Forest algorithm to evaluate the classification of vegetation types. During the dry season, the overall accuracy ranged from 48 to 83%, and during the dry and rainy seasons it ranged from 41 up to 82%. The classification using Sentinel 2A images during the dry season resulted in the highest overall accuracy and kappa values, followed by the classification that used images from all sensors during the dry and rainy season. Optical images during the dry season were sufficient to map the different types of vegetation in our study area.

AB The species richness-productivity relationship is one of the most debated patterns in ecology. Species coexistence theory suggests that it could be tightly linked to the type of nutrient limitation (no limitation, single-nutrient limitation, colimitation by several nutrients). Yet, the effects of nutrient limitation on the species richness-productivity relationship have been rarely studied at the regional and continental scales. Combining the predictions of the humped-back model and the niche dimension hypothesis, we hypothesized that an increase in plant species richness with the number of different limiting nutrients is detectable only at higher productivity levels, at which competition for nutrients is more intense. Therefore, we expected the shape of the diversity-productivity relationship to differ between sites colimited by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), sites limited by a single nutrient (either N or P), and sites not limited by any of these nutrients. To test this hypothesis, we used species richness data collected in 10 m x 10 m plots at 694 temperate dry grassland sites across eight regions in northern Eurasia. Productivity ranged from 10 to similar to 500 g/m(2) of above-ground standing biomass. The type of nutrient limitation was identified by critical nutrient ratios alone and their combination with critical nutrient concentrations measured in the plant tissue. Relationships were analysed using generalized linear and mixed-effect models. In line with our expectations, species richness of Eurasian temperate dry grasslands increased more steeply and peaked higher under higher productivity levels at N&P-colimited sites. When nutrient limitation was assessed by both ratios and concentrations, species richness at N&P-colimited sites continued to increase monotonically until the maximum productivity sampled in this study. In contrast, at sites with a single-nutrient limitation or no limitation, the peak in species richness was lower and occurred at a lower productivity of about 300-400 g/m(2). Synthesis. We provide the first evidence that the species richness-productivity relationship may depend on the type of nutrient limitation as predicted by the species coexistence theory. To generalize these findings, the role of nutrient limitation needs to be tested in other ecosystems, including more productive plant communities.

AB The increasing urban sprawl has contributed to the extensive fragmentation and reduction of natural habitat worldwide. Urbanization has a range of adverse effects on ecosystem functioning, including the disruption of plant dispersal processes across the landscape. Urban fragmentation can alter the distance and directionality of dispersal, leading to disrupted gene flow among populations. The dispersal processes of plants that rely on animal-mediated dispersal (zoochory) may be disproportionately affected by urbanization, as many animals avoid urban areas or restrict their movements within urban habitats. This could alter the efficiency of animal dispersal vectors and modify seed movements across urban habitats. While recent studies suggest that seed dispersal networks can be complex and dynamic even in highly managed green areas with relatively low biodiversity, zoochory in urban environments remains understudied. We synthesize the existing literature on zoochory in urban environments and place the findings in the context of ecosystem dynamics. We assess the ecological and evolutionary consequences for seed dispersal, following urbanization, by considering how zoochory is affected by specific features of urban environments. These include the complexity of habitats with varying continuity; high disturbance and intense management; a high proportion of alien species combined with low natural biodiversity; animal behavioral adjustments in different urban settings; and rapid evolutionary change due to urbanization. We conclude that (1) urbanization can disrupt and alter zoochory processes; and (2) successful zoochory can, in turn, alleviate or worsen the challenges to ecosystem dynamics originating from increased urbanization. The dynamic urban seed dispersal networks are emerging as useful models for the adaptability of seed dispersal communities. Their study can also shed light on eco-evolutionary processes under anthropogenic selective pressures, including species interactions. Finally, urban zoochory processes are critical to the functioning of urban ecosystems and as such, constitute an important ecosystem service with management implications. We propose directions for further research into urban zoochory processes to ensure the maintenance of ecosystem dynamics as urbanization continues.

AB High complexity habitat traits (i.e. high heterogeneity and/or size of discrete habitat units) often promote larger abundances of fauna. Sandy and rhodolith sea bottoms are typically interspersed as mosaics within coastal landscapes. The aim of this study was to experimentally assess the effect of two complexity attributes of rhodolith nodules (i.e. their heterogeneity and size) on the abundance and structure of vagile epibenthic assemblages. An early-colonization experiment was set up (July 2016), where experimental units containing rhodolith nodules of varying heterogeneity and size were deployed at two adjacent recipient habitats: a sandy bottom and a rhodolith seabed. After one month, the abundance of fauna colonizing the experimental units was similar in both habitats, but the assemblage structure (i.e. composition) notably differed. Importantly, the heterogeneity, rather than the size, of experimental rhodolith nodules influenced patterns of vagile macrofauna (> 0.5 mm) colonization, despite the habitat type where these experimental units were deployed considerably influenced colonization patterns. This result reinforces the idea of the importance of rhodolith tri-dimensional structure, as key influencer on faunal communities of nearshore habitats.

AB Payments for hydrological services (PHS) programs are expected to confer tangible benefits to households. Impact evaluations of PHS programs, however, find few to no changes in material indicators. One reason for this may be that non-financial motivations and benefits-including environmental or social-influence participation and are important outcomes for households participating in PHS programs. In this paper we test this hypothesis using 56 interviews and 181 surveys from households in Veracruz State, Mexico. Using logistic regression models we find that human, natural, physical and financial capital are important to the decision to participate in PHS, but so are pro-social and pro-environmental motivations. Using counterfactual impact evaluation methods we find few changes in material benefits but do find that PHS participants are more likely to report positive changes in their household and community quality of life over the last five years compared to households not participating in PHS programs. Qualitative information supports these findings. Our results contribute to the evolving theory on PHS that participation is driven by a mix of financial and non-financial motivations and that nonmaterial benefits are an important outcome of these programs.

AB With forest fragmentation continuing in many parts of the tropics, it is likely that fragmented forests will become the rule for most remaining global tropical forests in the next decades. In this context, there is a need for practical tools to assess and monitor fragmented forests if we are to conserve tree species diversity as much as possible. Several methods, either using (1) field-based or (2) remote-sensing approaches could be used to achieve this goal. This paper aims at providing a state-of-the-art review of both approaches in order to make recommendations for rapid and cost-effective assessments of tree species diversity and forest structure, with specific applications in studies of fragmented tropical forests. Overall both methods have pros and cons, depending on the type of data needed to address the research objectives and the quantity of resources available. We suggest combining the use of both field-based and remotely-sensed methods as they can be complementary. Remote-sensing data should be used to predict and map the tree species diversity and stand structure at regional scales, while field-inventories provide accurate information at local scales and allow validation of remotely sensed data. For field-inventories, we recommend the use of small (e.g. 20 x 50 m) plots with a 10 cm DBH minimum measurement. In terms of remotely-sensed techniques, if funding is sufficient, airborne imagery seems the best regarding the quality of information (i.e. hyperspectral and hyperspatial imagery, LiDAR). If funding is limited, a cost-effective alternative providing reasonably accurate estimates would be the use of high-resolution satellite imagery such as Worldview. Ultimately, for studies where data accessible for free is the only possible option, we recommend the use of Sentinel-2, although it is relatively coarser in terms of quality. However, further research needs to be done to validate these approaches in fragmented tropical forests.

AB Tropical forests harbor diverse ecological communities of plants and animals that are organized in complex interaction networks. The diversity and structure of plant-animal interaction networks may change along elevational gradients and in response to human-induced habitat fragmentation. While previous studies have analyzed the effects of elevation and forest fragmentation on species interaction networks in isolation, to our knowledge no study has investigated whether the effects of forest fragmentation on species interactions may differ along elevational gradients. In this study, we analyzed main and interaction effects of elevation and forest fragmentation on plant-frugivore interaction networks at plant and bird species level. Over a period spanning two years, we recorded plant-frugivore interactions at three elevations (1000, 2000 and 3000 m a.s.l.) and in two habitat types (continuous and fragmented forest) in tropical montane forests in southern Ecuador. We found a consistent effect of elevation on the structure of plant-frugivore networks. We observed a decrease in the number of effective bird partners of plants and, thus, a decline in the redundancy of bird species with increasing elevation. Furthermore, bird specialization on specific plant partners increased towards high elevations. Fragmentation had a relatively weak effect on the interaction networks for both plant and bird species, but resulted in a significant increase in bird specialization in fragmented forests at high elevations. Our results indicate that forest fragmentation may have stronger effects on plant-frugivore interaction networks at high compared to low elevations because bird species richness declined more steeply towards high elevations than plant species richness. We conclude that conservation efforts should prioritize the maintenance of consumer diversity, for instance by maintaining stretches of continuous forest. This applies in particular to species-poor communities, such as those at high elevations, as the ecological processes in these communities seem most sensitive towards forest fragmentation.

AB Terra firme forests make up more than three quarters of the western Amazon basin and are often considered functionally homogeneous in regional scale mapping and modelling efforts. However, the landforms underlying these systems are subject to dynamic processes of landscape evolution occurring within an otherwise geomorphically stable terrace formation. These processes may introduce systematic variability in local nutrient status of terra firme ecosystems. We utilised high-resolution airborne topographic and imaging spectroscopy data, with directed field soil surveys, to reveal that active stream incision and patterns of soil rock derived nutrient availability drive foliar canopy chemistry distributions across seven catchments within a single terrace formation. These results strongly suggest that fine-scale geomorphic processes directly affect biogeochemical cycles throughout the lowland western Amazon. Furthermore, links between landscape evolution and foliar chemical distributions indicate that geomorphic processes drive the fine-scale spatial organisation of this tropical ecosystem, with implications for the functional assembly and biogeography of Amazonian forests.

AB While deforestation and fragmentation can cause massive species loss in forest ecosystems, forest regeneration can also drive successional changes in species composition. Although studies have sometimes documented the effects of these compositional changes on interspecific interactions, few studies have investigated changes in the structure of plant-animal networks. We investigated how interaction networks of assemblages of rodents and tree seeds changed with forest fragmentation and succession in a subtropical region. We compared seed-rodent interactions between 14 secondary forest patches that ranged in area from 2 to 58 ha, and from 10 to at least 100 years old, representing a successional gradient. We expected that deforestation and fragmentation would reduce seed production and diversify rodent communities, resulting in higher interaction strengths and connectivity, but weak nestedness (i.e., specialists interact with subsets of the species interaction of generalists). We measured the frequency of rodents eating and removing seeds (interaction strength) in each patch during 3 successive years, using seed tagging and infrared camera trapping, and calculated the properties of the seed-rodent networks. We found that the relative abundances of seeds and rodents changed with stand age not patch size, as did seed-rodent interactions: older patches produced more seeds, contained fewer individuals and species of rodents, and had seed-rodent networks with lower connectance and interaction strength, but higher nestedness. Connectance and interaction strength decreased with metabolic per capita seed availability (as measured by seed energy value); nestedness increased with seed richness, but decreased with rodent abundance. At species level, we found stand age and patch size showed significant effects on seed or rodent abundance of a few species. We also found seed coat thickness and starch contents had significant effects on network metrics. Our results suggest that during succession after deforestation, seed-rodent interactions in these sub-tropical forests change from a state dominated by high seed removal and highly connected seed-rodent networks to a state with more seeds and highly nested networks. From a management perspective of our study region, succession age, not fragment size, and network structure should be paid more attention so as to facilitate the restoration processes of degraded forests. Rodent management should be applied to protect native forest species and exclude incursive ones from farmlands and human residences at early succession stage.

AB Negative conspecific density dependence is one of the principal mechanisms affecting plant performance and community spatial patterns. Although many studies identified the prevalence of density dependent effects in various vegetation types by analyzing conspecific spatial dispersal patterns (spatial patterning) of forest trees, interactions between individuals and heterospecific neighboring trees caused by density-dependent effects are often neglected. The effects of negative density dependence lead us to expect that neighbourhood species segregation would increase with increasing tree size and that larger trees would be surrounded by more heterospecific neighbours than would smaller trees. We studied four mapped 1-Ha plots on Changbaishan Mountain in North-eastern China and used marked point pattern analysis to explore whether trees of different sizes exhibited differences in neighbourhood species segregation; we also determined whether larger trees were more likely to have heterospecific neighbours than smaller trees were. Our results show that bigger trees generally have higher species mingling levels. Neighborhood species segregation ranged from lower than expected levels to random or nearly random patterns at small scales as tree size classes increased under heterogeneous Poisson null model tests. This study provides some evidence in support of negative density dependent effects in temperate forests.

AB The light environment of trees is a strong driver for their growth and morphology. Manipulating the light regime in forests is one of the main tools available to control the forest development. This study analysed the effect of a drastic light addition through gap creation on beech saplings (Pagus sylvalica L.) that had initially established under the canopy of mature trees. Altogether 6 gaps of varying size were created on an area of 4 ha. A total of 51 saplings were incorporated in this study. The saplings' above- and belowground biomass compartments were destructively harvested along a light gradient. Relationships between light availability and growth increment, stress relief, biomass allocation, and growth morphology were analysed. Along the gradient of increasing light availability, beech saplings responded with an increased diameter growth, whereas the height growth remained unaffected. Also the root mass fraction increased at the expense of the leaf mass fraction. Other biomass compartments showed no significant trend. The mean branch weight also increased and the specific leaf area decreased. Other morphological traits were not affected by the light availability. The results lead to the conclusion that the morphological plasticity of the beech saplings towards light was not as high as initially expected. Furthermore, the sudden increase of light availability did not impose stress on the saplings. Finally, managing the light regime is appropriate to achieve specific goals.

AB Freshwater ecosystems across the Amazon are largely comprised of small streams and headwaters of riparian zones. These areas are legally protected within private landholdings in Brazil, but recent changes in the environmental legislation have slackened protection requirements, with unpredictable consequences to the integrity and functioning of these freshwater environments. Local drivers of riparian forest loss and degradation should be understood by considering context-dependent land management practices and pressures within a region. Here, we examine the spatial determinants of the total amount and spectral quality of both headwater and overall riparian forests within private landholdings within a highly fragmented region of southern Amazonia. We built generalized linear models to assess how the amount and spectral quality of headwater and riparian forests respond to landholding size and distance to roads and an urban center, and document landholder compliance rates according to both the current and previous Brazilian environmental legislation. Although forest loss and degradation are typically associated, forest degradation responded independently to the same drivers. Headwater forests were generally more degraded than riparian forests, and smallholders complied less often with legal requirements than largeholders. Proximity to roads and the nearest town had a detrimental effect on both headwater and riparian forest amount and quality, and distance to the nearest town affected all variables, except for headwater forest quality. Compliance with environmental legislation is the first step in protecting riparian and headwater forests, but alternative landscape management strategies must be explored, particularly focusing on smallholdings, which are most vulnerable to deforestation and forest degradation.

AB Certain smallholder farmers in parts of sub-Saharan Africa engage in conservation agriculture and participate in agroforestry ecosystem services schemes that generate additional on-farm revenues through payment for ecosystem services (PES). However, smallholder farmers that are inadequately compensated for the foregone income from agricultural production due to marginal ecosystem services provision have no incentive to participate. On the other hand, over-compensating participating farmers will also lead to PES schemes inefficiencies. Therefore, stakeholders are confronted with the challenge of evaluating farm-level interactions between agricultural production and ecosystem services' provision when making strategic decisions on the efficient level of compensation. We propose in this contribution to assess the efficiency of PES schemes by measuring the marginal cost of ecosystem services based on farm level bio-economic interactions. The quantitative assessment is based on a theoretical classification of the relationship between marketed agricultural output and ecosystem services into complementary, supplementary or competitive. We use a flexible transformation function and cross-sectional data on 120 surveyed smallholder farmers with agroforestry certification in rural Mount Kenya. The results suggest that the joint production (of agricultural output and ecosystem services) for a substantial number of smallholder farms in Kenya may not show a complementary relationship. The biophysical linkage between marketed outputs and ecosystem services strongly influences the marginal cost of ecosystem services. PES schemes could become more efficient if they would target smallholder farms based on the aforementioned classifications by offering a range of contracts to encourage competitive bidding.

AB The complex orogenic history and structure of Southern South America, coupled with Pleistocene glacial cycles, have generated paleoclimatic and environmental changes that influenced the spatial distribution and genetic composition of natural populations. Despite the increased number of phylogeographic studies in this region and given the frequent idiosyncratic phylogeographic patterns, there is still the need to focus research especially on species that are currently distributed within a wide range of bioclimatic regimes, and that historically have been subject to contrasting scenarios. Liolaemus tennis is a widely distributed lizard species inhabiting latitudinally in almost 1000 km through central and southern Chile. Here we describe the geographical patterns of genetic variation and lineage diversification within L. tenuis, and their association with geography and Pleistocene glaciations, using sequences from one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes, and five microsatellite loci, and covering most of the species distributional range. Our results revealed a high diversity both within and among populations, as well as two phylogeographic breaks, which are consistent with two of the larger rivers of central Chile, the Maipo and Biobio Rivers. Liolaemus tenuis is characterized by several allopatric lineages, especially in its north and central range, which suggest a history of multiple vicariance processes. Conversely, populations found in the southern range, south of the Biobio River, show signatures of recent decreases in effective population sizes, coupled with recent range expansions and secondary contact. Niche "envelope" data are consistent with patterns of genetic variation; both suggest a history of discontinuous areas of relatively stable populations throughout all of the distribution of L. tennis. These data are also consistent with higher probabilities of habitat suitability north of the Maipo River (ca. 33 S), in both coastal areas and the "Intermediate Depression" between 34 and 37 S, as well as in the southern Coastal Cordillera between the Biobio and Araucania regions. Interestingly, both molecular and niche envelope modeling data suggest that some populations may have persisted in fragmented refugia in Andean valleys, within the limits of the ice sheet. Finally, our results suggest that several populations of L. tenuis colonized glaciated regions from refugial areas in lowlands and coastal regions, and in the southern distribution, historic migration events would have occurred from refugial areas within the limits of the ice sheet.

AB The competitive exclusion principle is one of the most influential concepts in ecology. The classical formulation suggests a correlation between competitor species similarity and competition severity, leading to rapid competitive exclusion where species are very similar; yet neutral models show that identical species can persist in competition for long periods. Here, we resolve the conflict by examining two components of similarity - niche overlap and competitive similarity - and modeling the effects of each on exclusion rate (defined as the inverse of time to exclusion). Studying exclusion rate, rather than the traditional focus on binary outcomes (coexistence versus exclusion), allows us to examine classical niche and neutral perspectives using the same currency. High niche overlap speeds exclusion, but high similarity in competitive ability slows it. These predictions are confirmed by a well-known model of two species competing for two resources. Under ecologically plausible scenarios of correlation between these two factors, the strongest exclusion rates may be among moderately similar species, while very similar and highly dissimilar competitors have very low exclusion rates. Adding even small amounts of demographic stochasticity to the model blurs the line between deterministic and probabilistic coexistence still further. Thus, focusing on exclusion rate, instead of on the binary outcome of coexistence versus exclusion, allows a variety of outcomes to result from competitive interactions. This approach may help explain species coexistence in diverse competitive communities and raises novel issues for future work.

AB QuestionsIs it possible to predict the composition of local plant assemblages? Trait-based approaches have offered some promise, especially in cases where deterministic processes such as environmental filtering and niche differentiation shape communities. In this study, we asked how much intraspecific variation contributes to trait distributions within and among plant communities, and whether trait distributions resulting from environmental filtering and niche differentiation can predict accurately the relative species abundances of montane plant species in local communities.
   LocationWest Elk Mountains, Colorado, USA.
   MethodsWe collected functional trait, species composition and environmental data from 14 sites along a broad climate gradient in Colorado, USA, ranging in elevation from 2480 to 3560m. We partitioned the variation within and among sites into intraspecific and interspecific components, and compared the results to values from a recent global meta-analysis, which examined intraspecific trait variability patterns. We also used these data to parameterize statistical models that have been shown to reproduce patterns associated with the processes of environmental filtering and niche differentiation. We fit two models to the data, one assuming that niche differentiation is invariant among sites, and another assuming that niche differentiation varies among sites.
   ResultsWe found that the trait-based models were worse at predicting species relative abundances in local communities than a null model assuming equal abundances of all species. One plausible explanation for the poor performance of the models is that intraspecific variation in functional traits, which in our system was higher than the global averages documented in the meta-analysis, swamped the effects of interspecific variation in functional traits along the climatic gradient. In particular, almost all variation in root traits was within rather than among species, even among sites.
   ConclusionOur results suggest that a greater focus be placed on measuring intraspecific trait variability and determining its consequences for community assembly and ecosystem properties.

AB Higher trophic level interactions are key mediators of ecosystem functioning in tropical forests. A rich body of theory has been developed to predict the effects of plant diversity on communities at higher trophic levels and the mechanisms underlying such effects. The 'enemies hypothesis' states that predators exert more effective top-down control of herbivorous insects with increasing plant diversity. Support for this hypothesis has been found in temperate forests and agroecosystems, but remains understudied in tropical forests. We compared incidence of attacks of different natural enemies using artificial caterpillars in a tropical forest landscape and investigated the role of plant community structure (i.e. species richness, composition and density), and the role of forest fragmentation (i.e. patch size, edge distance and canopy openness) on predation intensity. Plant community effects were tested with respect to three vegetation strata: trees, saplings and herbs. Observed predation was substantially due to ants. Predation rates increased with plant species richness for trees and herbs. Density of saplings, herb cover and herb species composition were important factors for predation. No significant patterns were found for fragmentation parameters, suggesting that forest fragmentation has not altered predation intensity. We conclude that in tropical forests, top-down control of herbivorous insects in the understory vegetation is affected by a combination of plant diversity, plant species composition and structural features of the plant community.

AB As primary or obligate sessile organisms, bryozoans depend upon a substratum resource that affects their abundance, distribution and diversity. These animals can colonize virtually any type of substratum, including other organisms and artificial structures. Associations between bryozoans and sponges are commonly reported in the literature, but there are few studies discussing the association between these two taxa in detail. Here we present data on the bryozoan community found on shallow-water sponges from Bahia coast, northeastern Brazil, including their taxonomic status, colony form and adaptative structures utilized by these bryozoans to grow on sponges. Twenty-one bryozoan species were found attached to the surface of sixteen species of sponges. Five new species of cheilostome bryozoans are described. A total of 105 colonies were studied and most of them are erect delicate branching (44 colonies) and encrusting patches (34 colonies). The majority of bryozoan colonies were attached to the surface of rugose-textured sponges (67 colonies; 61%). This suggests that bryozoans are more likely to settle on irregular and rough surfaces. Patches colonies were mainly attached to the portion of the sponge that was in contact with the seabed, and spot colonies were particularly found in spatial refuges, showing the preference of larvae to settle on shaded and less exposed substrata. Most erect bryozoans were attached to the lateral sponge surface, other colonies grew on the underside and few on the upper surface of the sponges. These colonies were attached either using anchoring rhizoids, rigid bases, or stolons. The bryozoan species and genera reported here are common in northeastern Brazil and considered generalists in terms of larval settlement requirements. The bryozoan-sponge association studied is considered a non-obligatory commensalism (inquilinism).

AB Hunting in the neotropics is a widespread form of resource extraction. However, there is increasing concern that current activities are leading to the decline and extirpation of vulnerable species; particulary ateline primates, large ungulates (such as tapirs and white-lipped peccaries) and large birds such as curassows. Hunting patterns are expected to be a product of two principal influences: the value of return for a given amount of effort invested into hunting, and cultural factors that determine the prestige and usefulness of prey. Previous work has suggested that hunting profiles change in a predictable way over time, becoming more diverse and more dependent on smaller bodied species as preferred, large-bodied prey become scarcer. In this paper, we evaluate the hunting profiles of 78 neotropical communities in Central and South America. We investigate the uniformity of species preferences, whether communities that are geographically closer have similar hunting profiles, and whether the age and size of settlements can be used to predict the type and diversity of species targeted. We found that there was only a weak correlation between the structure of communities' hunting profiles and their geographical proximity. Neither a community's size nor age was a good predictor of the shape and structure of its hunting profile. Our data suggest that either the availability of prey or the cultural influences dictating the value of different species can change rapidly over small distances, and that older and larger settlements do not impact prey species distributions in a predictable way.

AB Tropical forests are carbon rich ecosystems and small changes in tropical forest tree growth substantially influence the global carbon cycle. Forest monitoring studies report inconsistent growth changes in tropical forest trees over the past decades. Most of the studies highlighted changes in the forest level carbon gain, neglecting the species-specific growth changes which ultimately determine community-level responses. Tree-ring analysis can provide historical data on species-specific tree growth with annual resolution. Such studies are inadequate in Bangladesh, which is one of the most climate sensitive regions in the tropics. In this study, we investigated long-term growth rates of Toona ciliata in a moist tropical forest of Bangladesh by using tree-ring analysis. We sampled 50 trees of varying size, obtained increment cores from these trees and measured tree-ring width. Analyses of growth patterns revealed size-dependent growth increments. After correcting for the effect of tree size on tree growth (ontogenetic changes) by two different methods we found declining growth rates in T ciliata from 1960 to 2013. Standardized ring-width index (RWI) was strongly negatively correlated with annual mean and maximum temperatures suggesting that rising temperature might cause the observed growth decline in T ciliata. Assuming that global temperatures will rise at the current rate, the observed growth decline is assumed to continue. The analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes may reveal more insight on the physiological response of this species to future climatic changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Subjective and anatomy-based quantitative indices of distinctness of growth rings in tropical trees were related to deciduousness, species maximum height, and also potentially to local topography, independent of phylogenetic relationships.
   Most tropical tree species do not produce distinct growth rings, and the causes of this phenomenon have not received sufficient quantitative study. It has been shown that rainfall seasonality influences the formation of growth rings in some deciduous taxa. However, the numerous exceptions observed call for an examination of additional drivers of the phenomenon. We therefore hypothesized that in addition to seasonal climatic stress, functional and phylogenetic constraints may determine growth-ring distinctness. Ten potentially influential factors were examined in 38 Indian tropical tree species. Distinctness of growth rings was quantitatively assessed based on both subjective visual criteria and objective measures of anatomical characters. Multivariate and phylogenetically constrained analyses were used to test for functional, environmental, and phylogenetic effects. First, subjective scores of growth-ring distinctness correlated with objective anatomical measurements of vessel size and porosity related to water conductance, but also with additional anatomical characteristics unrelated to water dynamics. Second, ring distinctness variables were primarily related to deciduousness and species maximum height, and also weakly influenced by the topographic slope. A phylogenetic signal was detected in wood specific gravity values, the climatic variable of dry season rainfall, and the subjective distinctness score of growth rings, but accounting for phylogenetic structure did not significantly improve the prediction of ring distinctness. Thus, there was no evidence of an evolutionary constraint on the relationship in our sample of species. Our study thus demonstrates how distinctness of growth rings in tropical trees can be objectively represented on a continuous scale, and provides a quantitative explanation for its variability.

AB In this paper, we demonstrate how predictive methods can be used to investigate the effectiveness of conservation interventions prior to their implementation and ensure that limited resources are invested in those interventions that will achieve the strongest outcomes for conservation. Too often, operational, financial and logistical constraints lead to the design of interventions based on past experience and expert opinion, without an assessment of the probable outcomes of alternative approaches. Here, we employ a simple method that can be used by conservation managers to evaluate a range of credible alternatives and select the intervention predicted to have the greatest impact. We apply scenario-based interviews to investigate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing household forest clearance at a REDD + site in Cambodia. In this context, we show that collective performance payments, structured either as payments to individual households or to village development funds, have the greatest potential to reduce household clearance. In comparison, greater enforcement effort and individually contracted performance payments - options that might otherwise have been considered credible choices - are predicted to perform poorly, with only negligible reductions in forest clearance.

AB Floral visitors differ in their efficacy as pollinators, and the impact of different pollinator species on pollen flow and plant reproduction has been frequently evaluated. In contrast, the impact of intraspecific behavioural changes on their efficacy as pollinators has seldom been quantified.
   We studied a self-incompatible shrub Palicourea rigida (Rubiaceae) and its hummingbird pollinators, which adjust their behaviour according to floral resource availability. Fluorescence microscopy was used to access pollen tube growth and incompatibility reaction in pistils after a single visit of territorial or intruder hummingbirds in two populations. To characterise the plant populations and possible differences in resource availability between areas we used a three-term quadrat variance method to detect clusters of floral resources.
   Within-species variation in foraging behaviour, but not species identity, affected pollinator efficacy. Effectively, hummingbirds intruding into territories deposited more compatible pollen grains on P. rigida stigmas than territory holders in both study areas. Additionally, territory holders deposited more incompatible than compatible pollen grains.
   Our results imply that intraspecific foraging behaviour variation has consequences for pollination success. Quantifying such variation and addressing the implications of intraspecific variability contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics and consequences of plant-pollinator interactions.

AB We present a dated phylogenetic tree for the Neotropical genus Attalea (Arecaceae). We used six orthologues from the nuclear WRKY gene family across 98 accessions to address relationships among species and biogeographical hypotheses. We found that the formerly recognized groups within Attalea are not monophyletic and therefore there is no support for multiple genera as previously thought. Species of Attalea-like palms from the Atlantic forest form a well-supported clade sister to the Attalea species from Amazonia, the Andean valleys and Mesoamerica. Dates for the main divergence events suggest a relationship with the development of the dry forests that now span eastern South America and the now-lost Pebas Lake region in the western Amazon. Attalea crassispatha possibly colonized Hispaniola by a long-distance dispersal event, not via the land bridge Great Antilles Avian Ridge (GAAR), before the Panama channel closed. The common ancestor of Attalea appears to have been an Atlantic forest clade c. 30 Mya. The early split between the Atlantic-forest clade and the two Amazonian-northern Andean clades was probably the result of climatic changes that caused an increase in aridity in South America.

AB Ecuador has experienced one of the highest rates of deforestation in South America over the turn of the century with consequent threats to the provision of essential life-supporting environmental services. The Ecuadorian government instituted the 'Socio Bosque Program' (PSB) in 2008 in an effort to incentivize the conservation of privately-owned native forests. This study is the first to examine the PSB additionality in prevented deforestation through use of a geographic information system. Moreover, face-to-face surveys were conducted and analyzed to create a typology of forest owners based on their estimated likelihood to engage in forest land changes and elicit corresponding preferences for PSB-like forest conservation program participation. The survey data were collected from individual Ecuadorian forest owners in the Western region of the province of Pichincha. We estimate that less than 1% of forestland enrolled in the PSB would have been deforested were it not enrolled in the program. Landowners more likely to engage in deforestation practices denoted greater interest in participating in a conservation program when contracts allowed for the sustainable harvesting of timber. Landowners likely to conserve, showed greater interest in participating in a conservation program contingent on the amount of financial incentive provided. A design strategy, counter to the traditional focus, points to the allowance of sustainable forest harvesting, as a means of more effectively preventing deforestation in the Tropics.

AB The widespread clearing of tropical forests causes lower tree cover, drier microclimate, and higher and drier fuel loads of forest edges, increasing the risk of fire occurrence and its intensity. We used a manipulative field experiment to investigate the influence of fire and fuel loads on ant communities and their interactions with myrmecochorous seeds in the southern Amazon, a region currently undergoing extreme land-use intensification. Experimental fires and fuel addition were applied to 40 x 40-m plots in six replicated blocks, and ants were sampled between 15 and 30 days after fires in four strata: subterranean, litter, epigaeic, and arboreal. Fire had extensive negative effects on ant communities. Highly specialized cryptobiotic and predator species of the litter layer and epigaeic specialist predators were among the most sensitive, but we did not find evidence of overall biotic homogenization following fire. Fire reduced rates of location and transport of myrmecochorous seeds, and therefore the effectiveness of a key ecosystem service provided by ants, which we attribute to lower ant abundance and increased thermal stress. Experimental fuel addition had only minor effects on attributes of fire severity, and limited effects on ant responses to fire. Our findings indicate that enhanced fuel loads will not decrease ant diversity and ecosystem services through increased fire severity, at least in wetter years. However, higher fuel loads can still have a significant effect on ants from Amazonian rainforests because they increase the risk of fire occurrence, which has a detrimental impact on ant communities and a key ecosystem service they provide.

AB Incentivizing carbon storage can be a win-win pathway to conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. In savannas, however, the situation is more complex. Promoting carbon storage through woody encroachment may reduce plant diversity of savanna endemics, even as the diversity of encroaching forest species increases. This tradeoff has important implications for the management of biodiversity and carbon in savanna habitats, but has rarely been evaluated empirically. We quantified the nature of carbon-diversity relationships in the Brazilian Cerrado by analyzing how woody plant species richness changed with carbon storage in 206 sites across the 2.2 million km(2) region at two spatial scales. We show that total woody plant species diversity increases with carbon storage, as expected, but that the richness of endemic savanna woody plant species declines with carbon storage both at the local scale, as woody biomass accumulates within plots, and at the landscape scale, as forest replaces savanna. The sharpest trade-offs between carbon storage and savanna diversity occurred at the early stages of carbon accumulation at the local scale but the final stages of forest encroachment at the landscape scale. Furthermore, the loss of savanna species quickens in the final stages of forest encroachment, and beyond a point, savanna species losses outpace forest species gains with increasing carbon accumulation. Our results suggest that although woody encroachment in savanna ecosystems may provide substantial carbon benefits, it comes at the rapidly accruing cost of woody plant species adapted to the open savanna environment. Moreover, the dependence of carbon-diversity trade-offs on the amount of savanna area remaining requires land managers to carefully consider local conditions. Widespread woody encroachment in both Australian and African savannas and grasslands may present similar threats to biodiversity.

AB Plant responses to natural enemies include formation of secondary metabolites acting as direct or indirect defenses. Volatile terpenes represent one of the most diverse groups of secondary metabolites. We aimed to explore evolutionary patterns of volatile terpene emission. We measured the composition of damage-induced volatile terpenes from 202 Amazonian tree species, spanning the angiosperm phylogeny. Volatile terpenes were extracted with solid-phase micro extraction and desorbed in a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for compound identification. The chemical diversity of the terpene blend showed a strong phylogenetic signal as closely related species emitted a similar number of compounds. Closely related species also tended to have compositionally similar blends, although this relationship was weak. Meanwhile, the ability to emit a given compound showed no significant phylogenetic signal for 200 of 286 compounds, indicating a high rate of diversification in terpene synthesis and/or great variability in their expression. Three lineages (Magnoliales, Laurales, and Sapindales) showed exceptionally high rates of terpene diversification. Of the 70 compounds found in >10% of their species, 69 displayed significant correlated evolution with at least one other compound. These results provide insights into the complex evolutionary history of volatile terpenes in angiosperms, while highlighting the need for further research into this important class of compounds.

AB This paper investigates the effect of intelligence on deforestation rates, using data from 186 nations, over the period 1990-2010. Our findings provide novel evidence that human psychology, measured by nation-IQ is negatively related with deforestation. This paper documents that, on average moving from a country with the lowest IQ score (61) to the one with highest (107.1) is associated with a 1.15 percentage point reduction in the rate of deforestation. The negative link between intelligence and deforestation remains robust when we account for the feedback from environment to intelligence. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP) is one of three Panels that regularly informs the Parties (countries) to the Montreal Protocol on the effects of ozone depletion and the consequences of climate change interactions with respect to human health, animals, plants, biogeochemistry, air quality, and materials. The Panels provide a detailed assessment report every four years. The most recent 2014 Quadrennial Assessment by the EEAP was published as a special issue of seven papers in 2015 (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci., 2015, 14, 1-184). The next Quadrennial Assessment will be published in 2018/2019. In the interim, the EEAP generally produces an annual update or progress report of the relevant scientific findings. The present progress report for 2015 assesses some of the highlights and new insights with regard to the interactive nature of the effects of UV radiation, atmospheric processes, and climate change.

AB Green tree retention is thought to conserve biodiversity in harvested landscapes; however, the amount and distribution of retention that best meets conservation goals remains unclear. To clarify size of retention patches needed to effectively conserve saproxylic (i.e., deadwood-associated) beetles in western Canada, we compared beetle assemblages among patches of three size categories (small: 0.63-1.06 ha, medium: 1.43-2.93 ha, and large: 3.34-5.93 ha) left in harvested areas with those from intact forests and harvested matrix. To understand edge effects as a potential driver of faunal changes associated with patch size, we also compared assemblages from edges and centers of retention patches. Saproxylic beetle assemblages similar to those in intact forests were well maintained in all patch centers, but assemblages in small and medium patches were strongly influenced by edge effects and were least similar to those in intact forests. Particular trophic guilds showed distinct responses to patch size. Predator assemblages showed negative edge effects in small and medium patches, while phloeophage assemblages did not differ between edges and centers of different patch sizes. Although smaller patches may better emulate historical size distributions of fire skips, conservation value is likely maximized in large patches, mainly by decreasing edge effects. Our study dealt mainly with 'initial colonizers', but further studies to define minimum patch size for retention harvest must be conducted over time to incorporate effects on species associated with well-decayed deadwood.

AB Manipulative field experiments provide a window into the complexity of nature. Yet there is concern that we lack resolution by conducting experiments on a scale that is too small and short to include the relevant complexity of the study system. We addressed this issue by asking how and why the scale (local and global spatial extent, spatial grain, duration) and complexity (number of species, factors, treatment combinations) of experiments performed on marine hard substrata (rocky intertidal, RI; coral reef, CR; rocky subtidal, RS; mangrove root, MR) has changed by assessing 311 total experiments published since 1961 in Ecology and Ecological Monographs and since 1967 in Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. We show that the local spatial extent and all metrics of complexity increased as a positive, log-linear function of time. In contrast, the size of experimental units (spatial grain) decreased with time. Quantile regression analysis revealed that these trends are largely driven by changes in the upper bounds of experimental scale and complexity; most studies are still relatively simple in design and conducted over small areas. A structural equation model (SEM) incorporated the direct and indirect effects of six metrics indicating that the complexity of field experiments has increased both as a direct effect of time and because experiments have become smaller in spatial grain. The SEM also showed longer experiments tended to be more complex. We show striking habitat differences, as subtidal experiments (CR, RS) involved more species and were carried out on the largest global spatial scales. RI experiments were the longest. Future prospects to incorporate more of the complexity of nature into field experiments include site replication, as only 34.7% of all experiments were conducted at more than one site, open experimental designs monitored by technology, and integrating experimental manipulations with long-term monitoring to achieve mechanistic insight across scales relevant to human alteration of the biosphere. The increasing resolution of remote sensing also creates opportunities to track experiment-driven changes in community structure across large scales. We suggest applying these methods to a wider class of problems to enhance our understanding of marine communities and ecosystems.

AB Amazonia has an iconic status in global conservation due to its enormous area and vast stores of biodiversity. Nevertheless, much of its biodiversity remains unknown, and many of the region's forests are under threat of habitat loss due to deforestation and climatic instability. Based on the assumption that effective management and conservation of forest resources should be supported by geographically localized scientific knowledge, we mapped the spatial and temporal distribution of Amazonian conservation research and compared it to areas under threat from deforestation or with a high probability of climate change induced savannization/transition to seasonal forest. Specifically, we created a database of 4019 spatial coordinates of research sites collated from 857 conservation science research articles retrieved from Scopus. Research sites tend to cluster along major rivers and urban areas and new research sites tend to be located near existing sites. Information deficits are particularly acute in the south and southeast regions within the so called 'arc of deforestation'. Areas at risk of ecosystem transition due to climate instability are generally well studied with the exception of a large area of southwest Amazonia that has a high risk of savannization. Our results suggest that a more systematic approach to Amazonian conservation research is required, specifically targeting those areas most under threat from anthropogenic environmental change.

AB 1. The expansion of agriculture has led to forest loss and fragmentation, resulting in dramatic biodiversity impoverishment. Surprisingly, few studies have assessed forest fragmentation effects on leaf-cutting ant assemblages, and none has dealt with effects on their community richness and composition, despite their known role as key herbivores and ecosystem engineers.
   2. We analysed forest area and edge effects on leaf-cutting ant abundance, richness and assemblage composition, by recording and identifying colonies along edge and interior transects in 12 Chaco Serrano forest remnants of different sizes, in Central Argentina. We also explored leaf-cutting ant presence in the adjacent soybean matrix.
   3. We recorded five leaf-cutting ant species, in the genus Acromyrmex. In the soybean matrix, colonies of three species were observed, which were also found at the forest edge. Within the forest, edges sustained more species and colonies than interior habitats, whereas forest area was linked positively to colony abundance. Taxonomic composition of leaf-cutting ant assemblages reflected both area and edge effects.
   4. Our results revealed overall positive edge and area effects on leaf-cutting ant communities, highlighting differential species-specific responses and a possible role for Acromyrmex crassispinus as a forest status indicator. According to our findings, an increase in edge habitats may favour most leaf-cutting ant species, providing a suitable interface for access to the cultivated matrix, but hindering species associated with undisturbed forest conditions. As leaf-cutting ants are acknowledged as cornerstones of ecosystem functioning, the consequences of these trends may be far reaching.

   IMPACTS
AB Montane regions worldwide have experienced relatively low plant invasion rates, a trend attributed to increased climatic severity, low rates of disturbance, and reduced propagule pressure relative to lowlands. Manipulative experiments at elevations above the invasive range of non-native species can clarify the relative contributions of these mechanisms to montane invasion resistance, yet such experiments are rare. Furthermore, global climate change and land use changes are expected to cause decreases in snowpack and increases in disturbance by fire and forest thinning in montane forests. We examined the importance of these factors in limiting montane invasions using a field transplant experiment above the invasive range of two non-native lowland shrubs, Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) and Spanish broom (Spartium junceum), in the rain-snow transition zone of the Sierra Nevada of California. We tested the effects of canopy closure, prescribed fire, and winter snow depth on demographic transitions of each species. Establishment of both species was most likely at intermediate levels of canopy disturbance, but at this intermediate canopy level, snow depth had negative effects on winter survival of seedlings. We used matrix population models to show that an 86% reduction in winter snowfall would cause a 2.8-fold increase in population growth rates in Scotch broom and a 3.5-fold increase in Spanish broom. Fall prescribed fire increased germination rates, but decreased overall population growth rates by reducing plant survival. However, at longer fire return intervals, population recovery between fires is likely to keep growth rates high, especially under low snowpack conditions. Many treatment combinations had positive growth rates despite being above the current invasive range, indicating that propagule pressure, disturbance, and climate can all strongly affect plant invasions in montane regions. We conclude that projected reductions in winter snowpack and increases in forest disturbance are likely to increase the risk of invasion from lower elevations.

AB Whale-watching is one of the fastest growing tourism industries worldwide, often viewed as a sustainable, non-consumptive strategy for the benefits of cetacean conservation and the coastal communities, alternative to and incompatible with whaling. Yet, there is paucity of research on how things actually work out at the community-level. Drawing on the research literature and my own ethnographic fieldwork, this article bridges a knowledge gap in this field while examining an Azorean context where tourism has brought a re-commodification of the whale for the community (observing wildlife as opposed to harpooning it) in the last 20 years. The analysis is focused on four main community-level implications: governance of common maritime resources, and tourism's contribution to economic sustainability, cultural identity and social relations. It is shown that whale-watching, as any other form of community-based ecotourism, is not a panacea that always promotes biodiversity conservation and economic and sociocultural sustainability for the host communities. Moreover, expanding on the theorisation of emerging institutional fields by Lawrence and Phillips, the political, historical, economic and sociocultural context of the community involved is a key factor for understanding local agency and the local specific features of new fields.

AB Contradicting the notion that non-pioneer tree species are less tolerant to high irradiance due to their lower plasticity, some non-pioneer tropical species have shown high capacities to adjust to full sun. This ability has been attributed to the greater plasticity related to photosynthesis variables rather than morphological variables. To test this hypothesis, we performed the present study to identify the phenotypic variables of greatest plasticity in the non-pioneer species Cariniana estrellensis (Raddi) Kuntze, Cedrela odorata L., and Manilkara salzmannii (A. DC.) H.J. Lam., which are very representative of the rainforests of Brazil and have a large potential for reforestation. After 150 days of cultivation in full sun (1,820 +/- 110 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) or shade (250 +/- 84 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), measurements were made of growth, chloroplast pigments, net assimilation rate (NAR), soluble carbohydrates (glucose, fructose and sucrose), catalase and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity, and leaf and stem anatomy. The pigments and NAR showed greater plasticity than did the biochemical (carbohydrates and enzyme), growth or anatomy variables. Although the growth variables demonstrated low plasticity, the leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf area ratio (LAR) had plasticity index values over 0.5. Cedrela odorata was concluded to be the most plastic specie in leaf area, SLA, LAR, NAR, Carotenoids, APX, and the thickness of the periderm. The tolerance of Cariniana estrellensis, Cedrela odorata, and Manilkara salzmannii to full sun was attributed to the high plasticity of their physiological variables NAR and chloroplast pigments.

AB We present a synthesis of the first 10 years of Long Term Ecological Research project in Amazonian Forest. We elucidate the natural dynamics of forest ecosystem processes and associated biota, and its changes caused by distinct pressures of selective timber extraction and forest fragmentation. We found that, for both plants and animals, densities of individuals and distribution of species assemblages are spatially heterogeneous at the mesoscale, even in relatively undisturbed forests, and that associations with topo-edaphic variables allow prediction of a considerable part of this variation. For biological groups whose dynamics were studied in the short-term, levels of change in species composition and densities were relatively high, and these changes were generally in tune with spatial environmental variation. The impact of selective logging on assemblages and ecosystem processes was normally moderate, and around 19 years were needed for recovering forest biomass and tree size distribution. Continued studies are needed to determine the time required for recuperation of timber stocks and pre-logging floristic composition. Selective logging appears to be compatible with the biodiversity conservation, but reduction and better planning of road access may be more important than planned logging intensities. Habitat-loss' impact on organisms and ecosystem processes is large and long-lasting, since it induces the loss of many taxonomic groups and species, higher tree mortality and accelerated forest dynamics. There was a negative synergy between the impacts of habitat loss and climatic changes, and a better understanding of these processes can only be obtained through long-term research.

AB The physiological performance of a mid-intertidal limpet Cellana toreuma was determined to study the physiological adaptation of intertidal animals to rapid changes and extreme temperatures during emersion. The relationship between the Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (ABT) and in situ operative body temperature was studied to predict the possible impact of climate change on the species. The temperature coefficient (Q(10)) of emersed animals was higher than that of submersed animals and the ratio of aerial: aquatic heart rate rose with increasing temperature. The ABTs of submersed and emersed animals were 30.2 and 34.2 degrees C, respectively. The heart rate and levels of molecular biomarkers (hsps, ampk, ampk and sirt1 mRNA) were determined in 48 h simulated semi-diurnal tides. There were no obvious changes of heart rate and gene expression during the transition between emersion and submersion at room temperature, although expressions of hsp70 and hsp90 were induced significantly after thermal stress. These results indicate that C. toreuma can effectively utilize atmospheric oxygen, and the higher Q(10) and ABT of emersed animals are adaptations to the rapid change and extreme thermal stress during emersion. However, the in situ operative body temperature frequently exceeds the aerial ABT of C. toreuma, indicating the occurrence of large-scale mortality of C. toreuma in summer, and this species should be sensitive to increasing temperature in the scenario of climate change.

AB Hainan, the largest tropical island in China, belongs to the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. The Changhua watershed is a center of endemism for plants and birds and the cradle of Hainan's main rivers. However, this area has experienced recent and ongoing deforestation and habitat fragmentation. To quantify habitat loss and fragmentation of natural forests, as well as the land-cover changes in the Changhua watershed, we analyzed Landsat images obtained in 1988, 1995, and 2005. Land-cover dynamics analysis showed that natural forests increased in area (97,909 to 104,023 ha) from 1988 to 1995 but decreased rapidly to 76,306 ha over the next decade. Rubber plantations increased steadily throughout the study period while pulp plantations rapidly expanded after 1995. Similar patterns of land cover change were observed in protected areas, indicating a lack of enforcement. Natural forests conversion to rubber and pulp plantations has a general negative effect on biodiversity, primarily through habitat fragmentation. The fragmentation analysis showed that natural forests area was reduced and patch number increased, while patch size and connectivity decreased. These land-cover changes threatened local biodiversity, especially island endemic species. Both natural forests losses and fragmentation should be stopped by strict enforcement to prevent further damage. Preserving the remaining natural forests and enforcing the status of protected areas should be a management priority to maximize the watershed's biodiversity conservation value.

AB In this study, we evaluated how different lizard species were distributed in a fragmented Atlantic Forest landscape and the influence of landscape metrics on lizard species richness in sampled fragments. We sampled (between July 2007 and March 2010) three continuous forest sites of the Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu (REGUA), 12 forest fragments of different sizes and five pasture matrix areas. We recorded 8 lizard species, the most abundant being Ecpleopus gaudichaudii and Enyalius brasiliensis. Species richness in the continuous forest sites (N = 4) was lower than in the set of fragments (N = 8); fragments harbored both typical forest species and more generalist species. The forest areas differed in the composition of lizard species, with continuous forest sites having a composition similar to each other and to larger fragments, whereas the smaller fragments differed from the larger fragments but showed similarity to each other. These data indicated that fragment size (area) can be an important factor for the maintenance of lizard species diversity in fragmented Atlantic Forest landscapes.

AB Individual species are distributed inhomogeneously over space and time, yet, within large communities of species, aggregated patterns of biodiversity seem to display nearly universal behaviour. Neutral models assume that an individual's demographic prospects are independent of its species identity. They have successfully predicted certain static, time-independent patterns. But they have generally failed to predict temporal patterns, such as species ages or population dynamics. We construct a new, multispecies framework incorporating competitive differences between species, and assess the impact of this competition on static and dynamic patterns of biodiversity. We solve this model exactly for the special case of a Red Queen hypothesis, where fitter species are continually arising. The model predicts more realistic species ages than neutral models, without greatly changing predictions for static species abundance distributions. Our modelling approach may allow users to incorporate a broad range of ecological mechanisms.

AB This study explores the possibility of estimating different stages of ecological succession in tropical dry forests using CHRIS/PROBA hyperspectral and multi-angular satellite images. Tropical dry forests (TDFs) in the Americas are considered one of the most threatened ecosystems in region, experiencing also high rates of secondary growth. In this study, TDFs are studied along three successional stages (early, intermediate and late) in sites across a latitudinal gradient in the Americas. Sites are located in Mexico, Nicaragua and Brazil. Due to their strong annual phenological signal, reflectance values of CHRIS/PROBA Mode-4 were extracted for the dry and wet season, and afterwards analyzed using scatterplots, n-D visualization tools, and Transformed Divergence separability tests. Spectral separation of three successional stages within TDFs was observed in images corresponding to the dry season, at all study sites. In this season, it is possible to discriminate the different successional stages in all viewing angles. For the spectral separation of the three successional stages in images of the wet season, it is required the use of the 18 bands of the sensor. Our analysis also indicates that better spectral separation is achieved at 550, in both seasons. Our results confirm the utility of multi-angular and hyperspectral sensors as a critical tool for environmental planning in TDFs environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the factors that influence the distribution of understory vegetation is important for biological conservation and forest management. We compared understory species composition bymulti-response permutation procedure and indicator species analysis between plots dominated by Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) and Qilian juniper (Sabina przewalskii Kom.) in coniferous forests of the Qilian Mountains, northwestern China. Understory species composition differed markedly between the forest types. Many heliophilous species were significantly associated with juniper forest, while only one species was indicative of spruce forest. Using constrained ordination and the variation partitioning model, we quantitatively assessed the relative effects of two sets of explanatory variables on understory species composition. The results showed that topographic variables had higher explanatory power than did site conditions for understory plant distributions. However, a large amount of the variation in understory species composition remained unexplained. Forward selection revealed that understory species distributions were primarily affected by elevation and aspect. Juniper forest had higher species richness and alpha-diversity and lower beta-diversity in the herb layer of the understory plant community than spruce forest, suggesting that the former may be more important in maintaining understory biodiversity and community stability in alpine coniferous forest ecosystems.

AB In Finland, privately owned nature areas are widely used for recreation due to open public access. However, since landowners are not obligated to take everyman's rights into consideration when making management decisions, the recreational quality of nature areas is not guaranteed for users. We examined whether individual recreationists on private lands would be willing purchase management actions from landowners that influence recreational quality. In addition to willingness to pay, we assessed willingness to contribute labor to such actions. The results demonstrated that about half of the recreationists who participated in our survey were willing to contribute labor and about 10% were willing to pay to direct the management of their typical recreation site on private lands. The mean willingness to pay was 92 euros per year and the mean willingness to contribute labor 3.5 days per year. A latent class regression model revealed that recreationists were not, however, completely homogeneous in their preferences for the actions or in their preferred contribution forms. On the basis of the results, there is moderate demand from recreationists for management to improve recreational quality and the potential for local landscape management arrangements that allow individual recreationists to contribute labor.

AB Halting the loss of biodiversity while providing food security for a growing and prospering world population is a challenge. One possible solution to this dilemma is organic agriculture, which is expected to enhance biodiversity on the farmland. However, organic products often require larger areas. This study demonstrates how we can quantify and compare the direct land use impacts on biodiversity of organic and conventional food products such as milk.
   This study assessed direct land use impacts of 1 l of milk leaving the farm gate. Inventory data on land occupation were extracted from a life cycle assessment study of 15 farms in southern Sweden. Direct land use change data were derived from the FAO statistical database. Spatially differentiated characterization factors of occupation (CFOcc) and transformation (CFTrans) were calculated based on the relative difference of plant species richness on agricultural land compared to a (semi) natural regional reference. Data on plant species richness and regeneration times of ecosystems (for calculating transformation impacts) were derived from a literature review. To account for differences in biodiversity value between regions, a weighting system based on absolute species richness, vulnerability and irreplaceability was applied.
   Organic milk had a lower direct land use impact than conventional milk, although it required about double the area. Occupation impacts dominated the results and were much smaller for organic than conventional milk, as CFOcc of organic land uses were considerably smaller. For transformation impacts, differences between the two farming practices were even more pronounced. The highest impacts were caused by soymeal in concentrate feeds (conventional milk) due to large-scale deforestation in its country of cultivation (i.e. Brazil and Argentina). However, lack of reliable data posed a challenge in the assessment of transformation impacts. Overall, results were highly sensitive to differences in land occupation area between farms, the CFOcc and assumptions concerning transformed area. Sensitivity and robustness of results were tested and are discussed.
   Although organic milk required about twice as much land as conventional, it still had lower direct land use impacts on biodiversity. This highlights the importance of assessing land use impacts not only based on area but also considering the actual impacts on biodiversity. The presented approach allows to quantify and compare hot- and coldspots in the agricultural stage of milk production and could potentially also be applied to other agricultural products. However, more research is needed to allow quantification of indirect land use impacts.

AB We study a stochastic community model able to interpolate from a neutral regime to a niche partitioned regime upon varying a single parameter tuning the intensity of niche stabilization, namely the difference between intraspecific and interspecific competition. By means of a self-consistent approach, we obtain an analytical expression for the species abundance distribution, in excellent agreement with stochastic simulations of the model. In the neutral limit, the Fisher log-series is recovered, while upon increasing the stabilization strength the species abundance distribution develops a maximum for species at intermediate abundances, corresponding to the emergence of a carrying capacity. Numerical studies of species extinction-time distribution show that niche-stabilization strongly affects also the dynamical properties of the system by increasing the average species lifetimes, while suppressing their fluctuations. The results are discussed in view of the niche-neutral debate and of their potential relevance to field data. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Analysis of the phylogenetic similarity of co-occurring species at different spatial scales is increasingly used for decoding community assembly rules. Here, we integrated the analysis of phylobetadiversity and marked point pattern analysis to yield a new metric, the phylogenetic mark correlation function, k(d)(r), to quantify spatial phylogenetic structure of fully stem-mapped communities.k(d)(r) is defined as the expected phylogenetic distance of two heterospecifics separated by spatial distance r, and normalized with the expected phylogenetic distance of two heterospecifics taken randomly from a study area. It measures spatial phylogenetic turnover relative to spatial species turnover and is closely related with the spatially explicit Simpson index. We used simulated fully stem-mapped plant communities with known spatial phylogenetic structures to assess type I and II errors of the phylogenetic mark correlation function k(d)(r) under a null model of random phylogenetic spatial structure, and to test the ability of the k(d)(r) to detect scale-dependent signals of phylogenetic spatial structure. We also compared the performance of the k(d)(r) with two existing measures of phylobetadiversity that have been previously used to analyse fully stem-mapped plots. Finally, we explored the spatial phylogenetic structure of a 24-ha fully stem-mapped subtropical forest in China. Simulation tests showed that the new metric yielded correct type I and type II errors and accurately detected the spatial scales at which various processes (e.g. habitat filtering and competition) were invoked to generate spatial phylogenetic structures. The power of the k(d)(r) was not affected by a phylogenetic signal in species abundance and different topologies of the phylogenetic tree. Replacing phylogenetic distance by functional distance allows for application of the k(d)(r) to estimate spatial correlations in functional community structure. Thus, the k(d)(r) allows trait and phylogenetic structure to be analysed in the same framework. The phylogenetic mark correlation function is a powerful and accurate tool for revealing scale-dependent phylogenetic/functional footprints in community assemblages and allows ecologists to keep up with the increasingly available data of fully stem-mapped plots, functional traits and community phylogenies.

AB One of the many ecological processes expected to undergo alteration due to global change is the decomposition of organic matter, with little known concerning the effects that changing disturbance regimes may have. Fire, a critical process in many habitats, is expected to become more common. We measured the decomposition rates of four grass species that differed in litter quality, investigating them under different fire regimes across a savanna rainfall gradient in South Africa. We also collected data on the abundance and activity of fungus-growing termites and recorded measurements of temperature and canopy cover. Overall, decomposition rate followed global models, increasing under warmer and wetter conditions. Litter quality was also significant with higher quality grasses decomposing faster; however, this effect was less pronounced than expected. Fire regimes did not have a consistent effect on decomposition rate along the rainfall gradient. In the most arid savanna type examined, fire had no effect, whereas in the intermediate rainfall savanna burning increased decomposition rate under higher levels of fungus-growing termite activity. In the wetter savannas, fire slowed decomposition, possibly through modification of vegetation structure and potential effects on other invertebrates. Our results demonstrate that grass decomposition in African savannas varies significantly along precipitation gradients, with different factors becoming influential in different habitats. Importantly, we demonstrate that fire does not always act to slow decomposition and that it interacts with other factors to influence the process. These findings have important implications for decomposition in the light of global change models that predict wetter climates and a higher frequency of fires for southern African savannas.

AB The Amazonian Croton lechleri stem bark essential oil was tested for its anti-mutagenic potential by performing the Ames test against heterocyclic amines (HCAs), in continuing research on applicative functional profile of this phytocomplex as food ingredient (Rossi et al., 2011). Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 was used with and without metabolic activation (S9 mix). The anti-mutagenic properties was assayed with the following HCAs: 2-amino-3-methylimidazo-[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo-[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo-[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), the imidazoles 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido-[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) and 2-aminodipirydo-[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-2). All HCAs with 59 induced mutagenicity at 10(-10) mol/plate. Without S9, IQ and MelQ showed inutagenicity at 10(-8) mol/plate, MeIQx and Glu-P-1 at 10(-5) mol/plate, while Glu-P-2 was inactive. In presence of HACs (10(-9) mol/plate), C. lechleri essential oil was tested for mutagen-protective properties (concentration range: 0.01-0.10 mg/plate) taking the Highest Uneffective Dose (HUD) as threshold reference. With S9 mix, C. lechleri essential oil displayed a significant reduction of revertants at 0.05 mg/plate, from 21% to 34%. The essential oil showed mutagen-protective efficacy against IQ and MelQ tested as direct mutagens (10(-7) mol/plate), with a revertants percentage reduction of 39% and 40%, respectively. No anti-mutagen capacity was noted for MeIQx and Glu-P-1 (10-5 mol/plate). Since HACs are known as possible colon and liver cancer inducers, C. lechleri essential oil was tested for its cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative capacity against LoVo and HepG2 cancer cell lines showing IC50 of 74.95 +/- 0.05 mu g/ml (LoVo) and 82.28 +/- 0.03 mu g/ml (HepG2), displaying a promising role of this essential oil as a functional food ingredient with interesting mutagen preventing properties.

AB A dependent and independent growth distance model was fitted to evaluate how competition variables may account for the variation of periodic diameter increment of 132 Cedrela odorata trees. Using a Potential Relative Increment (PRI), the relative diameter increment (IRd) was estimated from the multiplication of maximum diameter growth (potential increment) by modified function (portion of the reduced growth due to competition by light and growth space). The significance of the reduced fitted model demonstrated the influence of asymmetric competition variables on diameter growth, explaining 71% of the total variation as well as indicated that competition responses were not constant, but it varied among the different size classes of trees.

AB Despite the potential for competition to generate equilibrium coexistence of infinitely tightly packed species along a trait axis, prior work has shown that the classical expectation of system-specific limits to the similarity of stably coexisting species is sound. A key reason is that known instances of continuous coexistence are fragile, requiring fine-tuning of parameters: A small alteration of the parameters leads back to the classical limiting similarity predictions. Here we present, but then cast aside, a new theoretical challenge to the expectation of limiting similarity. Robust continuous coexistence can arise if competition between species is modeled as a nonsmooth function of their differences-specifically, if the competition kernel (differential response of species' growth rates to changes in the density of other species along the trait axis) has a nondifferentiable sharp peak at zero trait difference. We will say that these kernels possess a "kink." The difference in predicted behavior stems from the fact that smooth kernels do not change to a first-order approximation around their maxima, creating strong competitive interactions between similar species. "Kinked" kernels, on the other hand, decrease linearly even for small species differences, reducing interspecific competition compared with intraspecific competition for arbitrarily small species differences. We investigate what mechanisms would lead to kinked kernels in the first place. It turns out that discontinuities in resource utilization generate them. We argue that such sudden jumps in the utilization of resources are unrealistic, and therefore, one should expect kernels to be smooth in reality.

AB Human-modified forested landscapes are prevalent in the tropics, and the role of complex mosaics of diverse vegetation types in biodiversity conservation remains poorly understood. Demographic traits and the spatial pattern of biodiversity are essential information when considering proper forest management and land use strategies. We compared the tree community structure (stem density, basal area, tree diversity, abundance of rare, endemic, and upper-layer trees, and species composition) and the forest dynamics (mortality, recruitment rate, and increments of basal area, and above- and below-ground biomass) of 39-46 plots among five dominant forest types: young and old fallows, rubber plantations, and fragmented and old-growth forests in Sarawak, Malaysia. We also explored how tree diversity was distributed across different spatial scales using additive partitioning of diversity. Swidden cultivation and rubber plantations showed decreased stem density, basal area, tree diversity, abundance of rare, endemic, and upper-layer trees, and increments of above- and below-ground biomass, which affected tree mortality, dominant trees, and species composition. Little distinction in species composition was observed among young and old fallows and rubber plantations, indicating a relatively quick recovery of the tree community in the early stages. The highest diversity was found among forest types, indicating that the whole forested landscape comprises a suitable scale for tree biodiversity conservation in the region. Our results suggest that although fragmented and old-growth forests have an irreplaceable role and a high priority in conserving biodiversity and sustaining the function of the forest ecosystem, secondary forests may also have a reinforcing role in maintaining tree diversity in the region, especially under the current circumstances in which a large portion of the landscape is human-modified and faces an increasing threat from the expansion of oil palm plantations.

AB We assessed the effect of conditions and resources on the species richness of epigaeic ants in a cloud forest of the Ibitipoca State Park, Brazil. We hypothesized that the characteristics that are best related with the epigaeic microhabitat affects ant richness more closely than other characteristics. At each sampling site (36 in total) we set up an epigaeic pitfall to capture ants and measured the following environmental variables (conditions and resources): tree density, tree height, circumference at breast height, density of the herbaceous and shrubby vegetation, weight and heterogeneity of the leaf litter, and canopy cover. We built general linear models and used a function that classifies alternative models according to the second-order Akaike information criterion (AICc), in order to assess which environmental variables affect ant species richness. We collected 37 ant species and the models that better explained the variations in ant richness were: (1) null model; (2) heterogeneity of the leaf litter; and (3) weight of the leaf litter. These two environmental variables are positively related to ant richness. It is possible that epigaeic ants are influenced by the high quantity and quality of food and nesting sites provided by a heterogeneous and abundant leaf litter. Relationships between species richness and environmental characteristics should consider different predictor variables related to the microhabitat, since each microhabitat may have a specific pattern and predictor variable. Thus, the understanding of the effects of the microhabitat variables on species richness could help predicting the consequences of anthropogenic impacts.

AB Logging and forest loss continues to be a major problem within Southeast Asia and as a result, many species are becoming threatened or extinct. The present study provides the first detailed and comprehensive ecological data on the Siberut macaque (Macaca siberu), a primate species living exclusively on the island of Siberut off the west coast of Sumatra. Our results show that M. siberu is ecologically similar to its closest relative M. nemestrina occurring on the mainland, both species being semi-terrestrial, mainly frugivorous (75-76%), exhibit a large daily travel distance for their group size and spend more time on traveling than any other macaque species. The habitat of Siberut macaques was floristically very diverse (Simpson's index D=0.97), although somewhat impoverished in tree species richness, and had a lower tree basal area and a lower rattan density compared to other forests in Malesia (both rattan and palm tree fruit being an important food resource for Macaca siberu due to their long fruiting periods). These factors may lead to a lower diversity and abundance of fruit resources, and coupled with a high degree of frugivory of Siberut macaques, may explain the large amount of traveling observed in this species. The large home range requirements and strong dependence on fruit are important factors that need to be considered when developing conservation measures for this IUCN-listed (Category Vulnerable) species.

AB Although hummingbirds are considered the major bromeliad pollinators, different species may contribute differently to pollination. This study analyses the importance of different hummingbirds to pollination of Vriesea rodigasiana (Bromeliaceae), based on visitation frequency (a quantity component) and germinated pollen load per visit (a quality component) in the Atlantic rainforest of southeastern Brazil. This bromeliad flowers for 3-4 months with a peak in March. Its yellow, tubular flowers last about 13 h and demonstrate approach herkogamy. During flowering peak, Thalurania glaucopis visited more flowers than Ramphodon naevius, whereas by the end of the flowering season the latter visited more. Differences in hummingbird bill length resulted in different pollen placement and stigma contact. The short-billed T. glaucopis received pollen on the top of its head, depositing it on the center of the stigma, while the long-billed R. naevius received it on the proximal part of its bill, depositing it on the lower lobe of the stigma. Flowers visited by T. glaucopis had six times more pollen tubes than those visited by R. naevius. Our results suggest that this functional group of hummingbirds may be split into even smaller groups, namely short-billed and long-billed hummingbirds, based on different sites of pollen placement. Although both species were pollen vectors of V. rodigasiana, the short-billed T. glaucopis was its most effective pollinator in the area supporting Stebbin's principle, linking floral features and good pollinators.

AB Spatial variability in the effects of fire on savanna vegetation structure is seldom considered in ecology, despite the inherent heterogeneity of savanna landscapes. Much has been learned about the effects of fire on vegetation structure from long-term field experiments, but these are often of limited spatial extent and do not encompass different hillslope catena elements. We mapped vegetation three-dimensional (3-D) structure over 21 000 ha in nine savanna landscapes (six on granite, three on basalt), each with contrasting long-term fire histories (higher and lower fire frequency), as defined from a combination of satellite imagery and 67 years of management records. Higher fire frequency areas contained less woody canopy cover than their lower fire frequency counterparts in all landscapes, and woody cover reduction increased linearly with increasing difference in fire frequency (r(2) = 0.58, P = 0.004). Vegetation height displayed a more heterogeneous response to difference in fire frequency, with taller canopies present in the higher fire frequency areas of the wetter sites. Vegetation 3-D structural differences between areas of higher and lower fire frequency differed between geological substrates and varied spatially across hillslopes. Fire had the greatest relative impact on vegetation structure on nutrient-rich basalt substrates, and it imparted different structural responses upon vegetation in upland, midslope, and lowland topographic positions. These results highlight the complexity of fire-vegetation relationships in savanna systems, and they suggest that underlying landscape heterogeneity needs more explicit incorporation into fire management policies.

AB Physico-chemical properties of soils have an indirect effect on ground-dwelling ant assemblages at regional scale. By contrast, little is known on their effect at the scale of the meter, at which direct interactions between subterranean ants and their environments occur.
   We aimed to study the effect of soil properties on the small-scale distribution of highly diverse subterranean ant assemblages. We expected ant species to be differentially associated with soil variables.
   This study was conducted in Bombuscaro and Copalinga (Ecuador), two premontane tropical forests 2 km apart, sharing the same climate and altitude. In each site, we delineated a 100 m line transect and every meter collected a sample of mineral soil (15 cm x 15 cm x 10 cm) and the associated ant fauna. Compared with traditional baiting this method should provide a relatively unbiased measure of subterranean ant diversity. Organic matter content, pH, electrical conductivity, degree of humification, soil texture and land slope were measured at each sampling point.
   Soil attributes of the two sites were contrasting and strongly spatially autocorrelated. The two ant assemblages shared only 12% of their 76 species. Ant diversity was higher in Bombuscaro (Fisher-alpha=21.7 vs. 16 in Copalinga). Species turnover was remarkably high at both regional (intersite) and local (intrasite) scales. Ant species richness was not correlated with any of the measured variables. Soil properties were not associated with the occurrence of any ant species in Copalinga. In Bombuscaro, Hypoponera sp.01R1 was correlated with lower pH values, and Acropyga fuhrmanni to higher clay content. A. fuhrmanni did not show correlation with this variable in Copalinga, where it is the dominant species (present in 48% of the samples). However, this species is associated with higher clay content at Copalinga (36.7 +/- 6% SD) compared with Bombuscaro (6.5 +/- 12%).
   Although weakly explained by the soil factors investigated, a high ant species turnover was observed at both small (1 m) and regional (2 km) spatial scales. The latter observation stresses the importance of designing large nature reserves including mosaics of habitats to conserve subterranean ant diversity in the Andes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Tolerance, the degree to which plant fitness is affected by herbivory, is associated with invasiveness and biological control of introduced plant species. It is important to know the evolutionary changes in tolerance of invasive species after introduction in order to understand the mechanisms of biological invasions and assess the feasibility of biological control. While many studies have explored the evolutionary changes in resistance of invasive species, little has been done to address tolerance. We hypothesized that compared with plants from native populations, plants from invasive populations may increase growth and decrease tolerance to herbivory in response to enemy release in introduced ranges. To test this hypothesis, we compared the differences in growth and tolerance to simulated herbivory between plants from invasive and native populations of Chromolaena odorata, a noxious invader of the tropics and subtropics, at two nutrient levels. Surprisingly, flower number, total biomass (except at high nutrient), and relative increase in height were not significantly different between ranges. Also, plants from invasive populations did not decrease tolerance to herbivory at both nutrient levels. The invader from both ranges compensated fully in reproduction after 50 % of total leaf area had been damaged, and achieved substantial regrowth after complete shoot damage. This strong tolerance to damage was associated with increased resource allocation to reproductive structures and with mobilization of storage reserves in roots. The innately strong tolerance may facilitate invasion success of C. odorata and decrease the efficacy of leaf-feeding biocontrol agents. Our study highlights the need for further research on biogeographical differences in tolerance and their role in the invasiveness of exotic plants and biological control.

AB The effects of habitat configuration on species persistence are predicted to be most apparent when remaining habitat cover is below 30%. We tested this prediction by comparing vertebrate communities in 21 landscapes located in the southern Amazonia, including 7 control landscapes (similar to 100% of forest cover) and 14 fragmented landscapes (4 x 4 km). The fragmented landscapes retained similar proportions of forest (similar to 25%), but had contrasting configurations, resulting from two different deforestation patterns: the "fish-bone pattern" common in small properties, and the large-property pattern generally used by large ranchers. Vertebrates were surveyed in all landscapes in February-July 2009 with interviews (n = 150). We found a significant difference in reported species richness among the fish-bone, large-property, and control areas (mean = 29.3, 38.8 and 43.5 respectively). Control areas and large-properties tended to have a higher number of specialist species (mean = 13.7, and 11.7, respectively), when compared with the fish-bone pattern (5.1). Vertebrate community composition in the control and large-properties was more similar to one another than to those of the fish-bone landscapes. The number of fragments was the main factor affecting the persistence of species, being negatively associated with specialist species richness. Species richness was also positively related with the size of the largest fragment structurally connected to the studied landscapes (i.e., a regional scale effect). Our results demonstrated that the large-property pattern, which results in less fragmented landscapes, can maintain a more diverse community of large vertebrates, including top predators, which are considered fundamental for maintaining ecosystem integrity. These results support the hypothesis that landscape configuration contributes to the persistence and/or extirpation of species.

AB Litterfall and litter decomposition are vital processes in tropical forests because they regulate nutrient cycling. Nutrient cycling can be altered by forest fragmentation. The Atlantic Forest is one of the most threatened biomes in the world due to human occupation over the last 500 years. This scenario has resulted in fragments of different size, age and regeneration phase. To investigate differences in litterfall and leaf decomposition between forest successional phases, we compared six forest fragments at three different successional phases and an area of mature forest on the Atlantic Plateau of Sao Paulo, Brazil. We sampled litter monthly from November 2008 to October 2009. We used litterbags to calculate leaf decomposition rate of an exotic species, Tipuana tipu (Fabaceae), over the same period litter sampling was performed. Litterfall was higher in the earliest successional area. This pattern may be related to the structural properties of the forest fragments, especially the higher abundance of pioneer species, which have higher productivity and are typical of early successional areas. However, we have not found significant differences in the decomposition rates between the studied areas, which may be caused by rapid stabilization of the decomposition environment (combined effect of microclimatic conditions and the decomposers activities). This result indicates that the leaf decomposition process have already been restored to levels observed in mature forests after a few decades of regeneration, although litterfall has not been entirely restored. This study emphasizes the importance of secondary forests for restoration of ecosystem processes on a regional scale.

AB We evaluated ants as bioindicators of environmental impacts caused by arsenic residuals in the soil. We tested the hypotheses that the presence of arsenic in the soil affects: (1) estimates of resources and habitat condition for arboreal and epigaeic ants; (2) species richness of arboreal and epigaeic ants and (3) arboreal and epigaeic ant species composition. Ants were sampled at an inactivated raticide factory in Nova Lima, Minas Gerais, Brasil, which used arsenic as one of its main byproducts. The following environmental variables were measured: bioavailable arsenic concentration in the soil, the number and density of tree species, plant cover and leaf litter depth. The species richness of arboreal ants decreased with increased bioavailable arsenic concentration whilst epigaeic ants increased with arsenic. Arboreal ants were positively related to the number of tree species, which in turn were negatively affected by arsenic. We verified which ants are good bioindicators of arsenic. Independent verification of the influence of arsenic on background environmental variables was fundamental in defining responses of ant communities, as well as in identifying the most effective pathways for the recovery of biological communities in degraded areas.

AB The way that carbon accounting is done greatly influences the value attributed to maintaining tropical forests. Accounting choices will be determining factors in the role that Brazil's Amazon forest plays in global mitigation efforts and in the role that funds from mitigation will play in redirecting the course of history in Amazonia. Critical decisions include the form of accounting (stocks versus flows) that are applicable under different circumstances, baselines for establishing additionality, and the restrictions and adjustments (including discounting to attribute value to time) applied to reflect differences in permanence, leakage and uncertainty. None of these problems is insurmountable, but addressing them will require both academic effort and the political courage of decision-makers to act on available information.

AB The near-threatened Serra Finch (Embernagra longicauda) is restricted to the main mountain ranges in eastern Brazil inhabiting campos rupestres (rocky fields). We mapped 17 mated pairs in a 138-ha area within Serra do Cipo National Park; a density of 0.25 adults/ha. Estimated average territory size varied from 2.52 +/- 0.77 ha (95% kernel) to 3.35 +/- 0.90 ha (100% minimum convex polygon). The distance between territory centers of neighboring pairs was 162.38 +/- 28.93 m. The overlap between neighboring territories was 15.3 +/- 5.9% (95% kernel) and 2.0 +/- 2.3% (polygon method). Pairs remained together throughout the year in the same territories and defended these against intruding neighbors. Analyses of habitat selection indicated preference for woodland and scrubland habitats associated with humid valleys, while grasslands were avoided. The Serra Finch used the available habitats more than expected from random at different spatial scales. Our data identified habitats that should be priority for conservation of the Serra Finch.

AB Blarinomys breviceps possesses cryptic and burrowing habits with poorly documented genetics and life history traits. Due to its rarity, only a few specimens and DNA sequences have been deposited in collections worldwide. Here, we present the most comprehensive cytogenetic and molecular characterization of this rare genus. Phylogenetic analyses based on partial cytochrome b sequences were performed, attempting to establish the relationships among individuals with distinct karyotypes along the geographic distribution of the genus in the Atlantic Forest. Classical and molecular cytogenetics, using banding patterns and FISH of telomeric and whole chromosome X-specific painting probes (obtained from the Akodontini Akodon cursor) were used to characterize and compare the chromosomal complements. Molecular phylogenetic analyses recovered 2 main geographically structured clades, northeastern and southeastern with pair-wise sequence divergences among specimens varying between 4.9 and 8.4%. Eight distinct karyomorphs are described: (A) 2n = 52 (50A, XX), (B) 2n = 52 (48A, XY+2Bs), (C) 2n = 45 (42A, XY+1B), (D) 2n = 43 (37A, XX+4Bs), (E) 2n = 37 (34A, XY+1B), (F) 2n = 34 (32A, XX), (G) 2n = 31 (27A, XX+2Bs), (H) 2n = 28 (26A, XY), all with the same number of autosomal arms (FNA = 50). Variation of 0-4 supernumerary chromosomes (Bs) presenting heterogeneity in morphology and distribution of interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs) is reported. ITSs are also found in some metacentric autosomes. The phylogeographic separation between 2 major lineages with high levels of genetic divergence, and the wide karyotypic diversity indicate that B. breviceps is a diverse group that warrants taxonomic re-evaluation.

AB Biomass allocation and leaf attributes are traits that discriminate between plants that exploit different light resource environments. Disturbed and high light environments provide easy access for resource-demanding, fast-growing invasive species. Comparing growth, ecophysiological and reproductive characteristics between invasives and non-invasives could help to predict a species' invasiveness and identify which habitat would be most susceptible to its invasion.
   In a common garden experiment we compared traits in Impatiens species that vary in their invasive status. They were the aggressive invader Impatiens glandulifera, which is invasive in mainland Europe and Ireland, I. parviflora, invasive in Central and Northern Europe but only established and not invasive in Ireland, and I. balfourii, naturalised in central and southern Europe but not reported in Ireland. We aimed to investigate their ecological requirements and to identify which traits promote invasion in this genus in a high-resource environment.
   Photosynthetic and allometric traits characterised the contrasting investment in light harvesting and carbon fixation of I. parviflora and I. glandulifera. The comparison of reproductive, photosynthetic and growth characteristics explained I. glandulifera's superior invasiveness when compared to I. parvilflora. However, there was no evidence that the invasive performed better than the non-invasive when it was compared to I. balfourii. Other traits that were not considered in this study, such as germination characteristics and adaptability, might also be responsible for invasiveness. We conclude that I. balfourii may possess an intrinsic invasiveness that, due to differences in invasion history, may not have reached its full potential yet.

AB Many studies have examined the phylogenetic utility of different kinds of molecular data, and have often compared these with morphology. However, relatively few studies have phylogenetically evaluated different morphological character systems. Using the Creophilus complex, the phylogenetic utility of external structural characters, male genitalia, female genitalia, and chaetotaxy of adults is examined for the first time in the megadiverse beetle family Staphylinidae. A data set of 121 phylogenetically informative characters of 24 terminal taxa was analysed separately and simultaneously using parsimony and the phylogenetic utility of each partition was compared with widely used statistics and support measures. External structures had the least homoplasy, resolved the most nodes separately, and largely determined the topology of the simultaneous analysis. Male and female genitalia contributed phylogenetic signal mostly congruent with external characters. Despite extensive homoplasy, chaetotaxy contributed the majority of hidden support, and was critical for resolving several terminal nodes in the simultaneous analysis. All character systems were informative throughout the tree, and when combined provided the best-supported hypothesis. However, there is a need to distinguish hidden support from dispersion of homoplasy when combining data sets of varying quality. The Creophilus complex, Creophilus Leach, Liusus Sharp, and the Creophilus erythrocephalus (Fabricius) and C. maxillosus (Linnaeus) species-groups are each strongly supported monophyletic groups. Hadrotes Maklin is not monophyletic and Hadrotes wakefieldi Cameron is the sister-species of the rest of the Creophilus complex, but included within it. Creophilus is revised to include 12 species, including Creophilus galapagensis sp. nov. and C. rekohuensis sp. nov. Creophilus huttoni (Broun) is removed from synonymy with C. oculatus (Fabricius), and C. insularis (Fauvel), C. villipennis Kraatz, and C. violaceus (Fauvel) are synonymized under C. flavipennis (Hope) comb. et stat. nov.

AB The marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas, locally known as the "loco", is the main target species of the benthonic Chilean fisheries. Genetic and genomic tools are necessary to study the genome of this species in order to understand the molecular basis of its development, growth, and other key traits to improve the management strategies and to identify local adaptation to prevent loss of biodiversity. Here, we use pyrosequencing technologies to generate the first transcriptomic database from adult specimens of the loco. After trimming, a total of 140,756 Expressed Sequence Tag sequences were achieved. Clustering and assembly analysis identified 19,219 contigs and 105,435 singleton sequences. BlastN analysis showed a significant identity with Expressed Sequence Tags of different gastropod species available in public databases. Similarly, BlastX results showed that only 895 out of the total 124,654 had significant hits and may represent novel genes for marine gastropods. From this database, simple sequence repeat motifs were also identified and a total of 38 primer pairs were designed and tested to assess their potential as informative markers and to investigate their cross-species amplification in different related gastropod species. This dataset represents the first publicly available 454 data for a marine gastropod endemic to the southeastern Pacific coast, providing a valuable transcriptomic resource for future efforts of gene discovery and development of functional markers in other marine gastropods.

AB Tropical forest management is a quintessential interdisciplinary (ID) problem straddling the social-natural divide, and has attracted scholars from many disciplines. This paper is a review of the ID research on tropical forests with a view to understanding the challenges involved in doing ID environmental research in general and the manner in which they might be addressed. Research on two core interdisciplinary questions in tropical forest research, namely causes of tropical forest loss and degradation and its impacts on society, is analysed to illuminate issues facing ID researchers. The challenges stem from differences in implicit values, theories and epistemologies across disciplines, as well as the relationship between individual disciplines, the ID space and the wider applied research audience. Understanding the value-laden nature of terms such as forest loss and degradation leads to a multidimensional and multidisciplinary characterization of the impact of forest change on human well-being. The analysis of causes of change has been enriched by ID research in which forest outcomes are characterized explicitly in terms of their values, measured in terms relevant to these values and linked to chains of socioeconomic variables at the appropriate scale. Explanations from different disciplines may be reconciled to some extent by seeing each as partial and perhaps having context-specific validity, although some core tensions, especially between economists and anthropologists, remain. Insights from ID research have been unevenly internalized in the literature, pointing to the absence of a broadly shared ID space as a consequence of individual social science disciplines appropriating environment as a subject of study. Shifting from theory-driven to problem-driven research and re-engaging self-consciously in this applied ID space will be required to generate more rigorous and relevant ID research on forests.

AB 1. Habitat fragmentation, anthropogenic disturbance and the introduction of invasive species are factors thought to structure ant assemblages. To understand responses of the ant community to changes in the environment, ants are commonly categorised into functional groups, a scheme developed and based on Australian ants.
   2. Behaviourally dominant and aggressive ants of the dominant dolichoderinae functional group have been suggested to structure the ant assemblages in arid and semi-arid habitats of these regions. Given the limited geographical distribution of dominant dolichoderinae, it is crucial to determine the responses of the ant community to changes in the environment in their absence.
   3. This study addresses this less studied aspect by considering the associations of ants of Western Ghats, India, with habitat, anthropogenic disturbance and introduced ants. We determined how ant functional groups respond to these factors in this region, where dominant dolichoderines are naturally absent, and whether responses are consistent with predictions derived from the ant functional group scheme.
   4. This study provides new information on ant assemblages in a little-studied region. As in other parts of the world, ant assemblages in Western Ghats were strongly influenced by habitat and disturbance, with different functional groups associated with different habitats and levels of disturbance.
   5. No functional group showed evidence of being influenced by the abundance of introduced species. In addition, predictions of negative interactions between functional groups were not supported. Our findings suggest that abiotic factors are universal determinants of ant assemblage structure, but that competitive interactions may not be.

AB We investigated the effect of broad-scale wildfire on ground foraging ants within southern California. In October and November of 2003, two wildfires burned large portions of the wildlands within San Diego County. Between January 2005 and September 2006, we surveyed 63 plots across four sites to measure the effect of the fires on the ant assemblages present in four vegetation types: 1) coastal sage scrub, 2) chaparral, 3) grassland, and 4) woodland riparian. Thirty-six of the 63 plots were sampled before the fires between March 2001 and June 2003. Mixed model regression analyses, accounting for the burn history of each plot and our pre- and postfire sampling efforts, revealed that fire had a negative effect on ant species diversity. Multivariate analyses showed that ant community structure varied significantly among the four vegetation types, and only the ant assemblage associated with coastal sage scrub exhibited a significant difference between burned and unburned samples. The most notable change detected at the individual species level involved Messor andrei (Mayr), which increased from <1% of prefire coastal sage scrub ant samples to 32.1% in burned plots postfire. We theorize that M. andrei responded to the increase of bare ground and postfire seed production, leading to an increase in the detection rate for this species. Collectively, our results suggest that wildfires can have short-term impacts on the diversity and community structure of ground foraging ants in coastal sage scrub. We discuss these findings in relation to management implications and directions for future research.

AB Demographic variability in the tree component of savannas, arising from both spatial and temporal variability in fire, herbivory, and climate, is thought to be a key driver maintaining tree-grass coexistence in savannas. Modeling work has shown that this variability can be vital to the persistence of savanna as a biome and that variability in climate, herbivory and fire affect tree establishment. However, empirical evaluations of the idea that savanna tree establishment is variable have so far been limited to tests of the effects of major events (such as the East African rinderpest epidemic) on tree establishment. The degree to which tree establishment varies in savannas under less extreme variability in climate, herbivory and fire remains unknown.
   We tested whether establishment of adult trees was constant or episodic using tree ring counting of three Acacia species in Hluhluwe iMfolozi Park in South Africa. Patterns of establishment of adult trees were analyzed at three spatial scales for temporal and spatial patchiness. Establishment of adult trees was not constant for any of the three species of Acacia, and all three species showed significant spatial patchiness and larger-scale temporal variability in establishment patterns. Spatial patchiness highlights the importance of landscape processes like fire and herbivory, while larger-scale temporal variability indicates that climatic variability also structures tree demography.
   These results suggest that current tree cover in savannas is a product of ecological history and is not necessarily determined by current ecological processes. An historical perspective is essential for interpreting patterns of tree cover in savannas, in models of the effects of climate, fire and herbivory (especially elephants), in experimental work, and in analyses of continental patterns of tree cover alike.

AB We studied the effects of anthropogenic edges on predation and parasitism of forest bird nests in an agriculturally fragmented landscape and a continuously forested landscape in Ontario, Canada. Nesting data were collected at 1937 nests across 10 species in the fragmented landscape from 2002-2008, and 464 nests across 4 species in the continuously forested landscape from 2006-2008. Brood parasitism only occurred in the fragmented landscape, and was positively related to the proportion of rural grassland and row crop habitats within 500-m of nests. Daily nest survival was negatively related to the density of roads within 500-m of nests in the fragmented landscape, but was not influenced by distance to anthropogenic edge in either landscape. Predation rates were higher in the fragmented landscape for Ovenbird and Rose-breasted Grosbeak nests, but did not differ between landscapes for Veery and American Redstart nests. Uniformly high predation in the fragmented landscape may be a result of (1) matrix predators that penetrate deep (> 300 m) into the forest interior, or (2) the additive effect of forest-dependent and matrix-associated predators that results in high predation pressure in both edge and interior habitats. Further research focused on the identification of nest predators, their population dynamics, and habitat use is required to understand the underlying mechanisms leading to uniformly high nest predation in fragmented landscapes.

AB Investigating the impacts of climate change highlights a need to rapidly quantify an organism's thermal environment. We investigated the reliability of non-contact thermal imaging for measuring temperatures in an intertidal gastropod. Thermal maxima from images of either dorsal or ventral surfaces correlated strongly with invasive temperature-probe readings, producing highly significant regression models to predict mantle temperatures from thermal images. Thermal imaging was then field-tested to non-invasively examine temperature changes of snails relative to their substrate: those exposed to sunlight had a mean temperature 4-8 degrees C above the substrate during the day but 2-4 degrees C below at night. Thermoregulation was also tested in the laboratory: when exposed to 45 degrees C for 24 hours, snails reached 35-44 degrees C, significantly higher than those (18 degrees C to 25 degrees C) held at 25 degrees C. Thermal imaging is reliable for rapidly measuring tissue temperatures in a shelled gastropod typical of intertidal environments, thus providing a powerful tool for testing hypotheses about thermal responses in the changing global environment.

AB Human modification of pristine habitats almost always leads to the local extinction of a subset of the species present. This means that the ecosystem processes carried out by the remaining species may change. It is well documented that particular species of ants carry out important ecosystem processes. However, while much work has been carried out to investigate the link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in other taxa, this has received relatively little attention for ant communities. In particular, no attempt has been made to link levels of ant diversity with the rates of nutrient redistribution carried out by scavenging species. Here we investigate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on the rate of scavenger-mediated nutrient redistribution, using bait-removal rate as a surrogate measure. We found that although ant species richness, diversity, biomass and rates of bait removal did not change systematically across the disturbance gradient, the rate of bait removal was related to ant species richness. Sites with more ant species experienced a faster rate of bait removal. This is the first documented positive relationship between ant species richness and the rate of an ecosystem process. If these results are applicable at larger spatial scales for a wider range of nutrient sources, loss of ant species could lead to important changes in the way that ecosystems function.

AB In recent years, there has been a growing interest in payments for environmental services (PES) for ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA). So far, however, experiences and theoretical analyses of PES specifically for adaptation have not been well documented. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the opportunities and constraints of PES as an instrument for EBA. Specifically, we examine the potential for PES to address key elements for adaptation by focusing on three pathways: the user side, the provider side and institutional and societal change. In addition, we assess whether PES fulfils key requirements for adaptation policy instruments, notably effectiveness, efficiency, equity and legitimacy. We find that PES are not a panacea for all environmental services and country contexts, but can be promising adaptation policy instruments where certain preconditions are met and synergies prevail. We conclude on four points especially relevant for the practical scope for PES-adaptation synergies: (i) natural adaptation co-benefits (where the targeted environmental service serves a dual function, e. g. secured water quality and increased adaptive capacity), (ii) piggy-backing (where adaptation benefits are coincidental outcomes), (iii) adaptation-relevant institutional and sectoral spillovers from PES schemes, and (iv) direct payments for adaptation benefits.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the effects of forest fragmentation on ant richness in a landscape of Atlantic Forest in Northeast Brazil. More specifically, the ant richness was related to the attributes of fragments (area and distance from the fragment central point to the edge), landscape (forest cover surrounding the fragments), and tree community (plant density, richness, and percentage of shade tolerant species). The surveys were carried out in 19 fragments located in Alagoas State from October 2007 to March 2008. Samples were collected through a 300 m transect established in the center of each fragment, where 30 1-m(2) leaf litter samples were collected at 10 m intervals. A total of 146 ant species was collected, which belonged to 42 genera, 24 tribes and nine subfamilies. The attributes of fragments and landscape did not influence ant richness. On the other hand, tree density explained ca. 23% of ant richness. In relation to functional groups, both density and richness of trees explained the richness of general myrmicines (the whole model explained ca. 42% of the variation in this group) and percentage of shade tolerant trees explained the richness of specialist predator ants (30% for the whole model). These results indicate that ant fauna is more influenced by vegetation integrity than by fragment size, distance to edge or forest cover surrounding fragments.

AB Many efforts are made to promote soil conservation in developing countries. This paper compares the effect of two programs promoting soil conservation in Peru on the adoption decision of households. One program applies a top-down approach with soil conservation as its core activity. The other program applies a participatory approach, offering a portfolio of activities in order to improve rural livelihoods. The decisions on participation and adoption are estimated with a trivariate probit model. The results show that each program attracts different types of households and achieves different outcomes in terms of soil conservation. (JEL C35, O13)

AB This study analyzed the influence of vegetation structure variation along a natural vegetation mosaic formed by Araucaria forest and Campos grassland in the southern Brazilian highlands, on the species richness and composition of epigeic ants The study site consisted of two different grassland forest ecotones, where 76 pitfall traps were installed We estimated the area covered by canopy vegetation by hemispherical photographs, and the structure of the understory vegetation by counting the number of vegetation touches, using a graduated stick. We collected 31 species or morphospecies of epigeic ants belonging to 17 genera and 6 subfamilies Cluster analysis defined three habitat groups (grassland, edge, and forest) with different ant species composition as revealed by ordination analysis. The highest richness was observed at the forest edge, and decreased towards the grassland and the forest interior. Variation in the richness and composition of epigeic ant species was significantly explained by the factor of distance from the forest The relationship between species richness and understory density was negative On the other hand, species composition of epigeic ant assemblages was significantly explained by canopy cover This finding indicates that the ecological responses of ant assemblages resulted predominantly from edge effects mediated by changes in vegetation structure.

AB Habitat availability for larval development is one of the main factors affecting the distribution of anuran species. However, little is known about the spatial distribution of these habitats, and estimates of the number of available ponds fir a given reserve size are not available in Amazonia. Temporary water bodies were surveyed in a 30-m strip around a 144-km system of trails in a terra firme tropical forest, and tadpoles were collected to evaluate differences in species composition between isolated and streamside ponds. More than 90% of the ponds were <150 m from a stream, and the tadpole species composition differed between isolated and streamside ponds. Isolated ponds were less common, but were, on average, more stable in time than streamside ponds. Despite the limited distribution of isolated forest ponds, species of frogs dependent on them were found throughout the reserve. The presence of both types of ponds is important for the maintenance of the local pond-breeding anuran community. This study shows that isolated and streamside forest ponds maintain a distinct assemblage of frogs, and isolated ponds are much less common, but are, on average, more predictable in time than streamside ponds.

AB We investigated the richness, composition, and species relative abundance of a terrestrial small mammal community in a Deciduous Forest area in the austral boundary of the Atlantic Forest. The microhabitat use of the most common species was also investigated. Six rodents Akodon montensis (Thomas, 1913), Oligoryzomys nigripes (Olfers, 1818), Sooretamys angouya (Thomas, 1913), Thaptomys nigrita (Lichtenstein, 1829), Mus musculus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Juliomys sp. and one marsupial Didelphis albiventris (Lund, 1840) were captured. Thaptomys nigrita is recorded in the state of Rio Grande do Sul for the first time. Species richness was poor when compared with communities in the central portions of the Atlantic Forest, but equivalent to that found in the Araucaria and Dense Ombrophilous forests of southern Brazil. The species most often captured in our study, A. montensis and O. nigripes, are also the most common in the majority of faunistic studies carried out in the Atlantic Forest. Akodon montensis and S. angouya used places with high abundance of bamboo, possibly to avoid predators. Oligorizomys nigripes used areas with a high density of scrubs, what could facilitate aboveground movements, and was negatively correlated to mature forest indicators, which reinforce the idea that this species has opportunistic habits.

AB Here we test the hypotheses that 19 years of simulated pollutant N deposition increases both losses of carbon (C) and the ability of plants to access P from organic material in upland heathland. The grass, Dactylis glomerata, and the dwarf shrub, Calluna vulgaris, were grown in soil containing microbial-derived organic matter labelled with C-14 and P-33. We found that both soil and root-surface phosphatase activity increased significantly in response to N deposition. We also found a significant positive relationship between root-surface phosphatase activity and P-33 uptake for Calluna, but a negative relationship for Dactylis. Efflux of C-14 from the microbial-derived organic matter was strongly dependent on an interaction among plant presence, plant species and N deposition. Our results show that mineralisation of C and P, and subsequent plant uptake of P from organic sources is decoupled. In our experimental conditions, stimulation of P turnover coupled with subsequent plant uptake through up-regulation of root phosphatases is little affected by N addition. However, our data indicate that root-surface phosphatases are likely to be more important for uptake of P derived from organic sources for Calluna than for Dactylis.

AB We determined the effect of heat shock on seed germination of 23 species growing in fire-prone areas covered by pine-oak and montane cloud forests. Seeds of each species were exposed to 60, 80, 100 or 120 degrees C for 5 or 60 min in dry and moist sand. Seeds of nine species were incubated for 15 h in moist sand and exposed to the temperature that best promoted germination. Eighteen species required heat shock for germination, and five tolerated it. Dry heat shock for 5 min promoted germination of these species; heat shock in moist sand at 100 degrees C induced germination of 10 species. Exposure for 60 min to heat shock in dry and moist sand improved germination of 14 and 5 species respectively. Logistic models indicate that germination probabilities of most species are increased by temperatures of 70-120 degrees C. Depending on substrate and seed hydration, heat shock increased or left unchanged the germination of most pine-oak and montane cloud forest species. Thus, montane cloud forest seeds can survive low-intensity surface fires. Most species with seeds hydrated before heat shock showed little or no germination. Prescribed burns at the end of the rainy season may therefore be harmful to pine-oak and montane cloud forest species.

AB Seawalls are a ubiquitous part of the Singapore coastline, providing a novel habitat for a suite of intertidal species. In this study, the diversity and community patterns of intertidal organisms of twelve seawalls located along the coasts of Singapore and its offshore islands were examined and described. Although the seawalls are made of similar material and are fairly uniform in physical attributes, the biological assemblages that occupy this habitat markedly differ at different locations. Species richness ranged from 26 to 5 1 intertidal taxa, total abundances varied from as low as 700+ individuals to an excess of 10,000 individuals and algae cover ranged from as low as 3% to almost 50%. Most of the intertidal organisms were common and several were found on all 12 Surveyed seawalls (e.g. cyanobacteria, chthamalid barnacles, and gastropods Echinoliltorina malaccana, Patelloida saccharina and Siphonaria guamensis), although there were a number of species that were only present on a single seawall (e.g. the rhodophyte Asparagopsis taxiformis on the seawall at Marina South and the bivalves Trapezium sp. and Irus sp. which were only observed at Pasir Ris). At each location, seawall communities were numerically dominated by a few taxa, which were usually siphonariid limpets or barnacles. This Study provides detailed information oil the diversity and community structure of intertidal communities inhabiting seawalls in Singapore in relation to location and shore height.

AB Tropical montane cloud forests constitute a rare and fragile ecosystem, which is threatened in many of the areas in which it is found due to the pressure of human-originated disturbances. Cloud forests have been identified as a forest type with high levels of species endemism and biodiversity. The aim of this study, which focuses on a patch of cloud forest located in the Piura region of the Peruvian Andes, is to assess the changes in species composition and to identify the factors involved in the loss of biodiversity using data from a single inventory.
   Random sampling plots were established throughout the forest area. An index of the difference in species richness between recruitment and older trees (Tree Diversity Change index, TDC index) was calculated for each plot. A Tree Diversity Change Index (TDC) and an index of species replacement based on the second order properties of the diameter distribution (RE) were defined to assess changes in species richness and to characterize the change in the functional groups of tree species within the plot. The factors involved in these processes were also identified by means of a Universal Kriging model.
   The negative correlation between the TDC and the distance to the nearest track indicates that species richness is decreasing close to these tracks and that it is only maintained in the inner areas. The negative correlation of the RE index with altitude and deeper zones indicates that dynamic replacement of humid-condition species by dry-condition species is occurring at lower elevations. A loss in diversity along with a change towards species adapted to dryer conditions was observed throughout the forest. Zones at lower altitudes, on spurs or at the edges of the forest are more prone to these processes. This suggests that a change in the functions of the ecosystem has been taking place and that a minimum extension of cloud forest is required to maintain the ecological processes necessary for the continued existence of the cloud forest.

AB Ficus arpazusa Casaretto is a fig tree native to the Atlantic Rain Forest sensu lato. High levels of genetic diversity and no inbreeding were observed in Ficus arpazusa. This genetic pattern is due to the action of its pollinator, Pegoscapus sp., which disperses pollen an estimated distance of 5.6 km, and of Ficus arpazusa's mating system which, in the study area, is allogamous. This study highlights the importance of adding both ecological and genetic data into population studies, allowing a better understanding of evolutionary processes and in turn increasing the efficacy of forest management and revegetation projects, as well as species conservation.

AB The principal defense of tropical forests has been to designate them as protected areas, but few of these protected areas have been studied to determine their effectiveness at preventing forest clearance within their boundaries. We used remote sensing techniques to quantify three fundamental forest cover change processes: forest clearance, re-growth and fragmentation over a 19-year time period, in a National Park of Jamaica. Results show that forest clearance occurred at similar high levels prior and subsequent to the establishment of the area as a National Park in 1993: 1.50% yr(-1) (1983-1992) and 1.42% yr(-1) (19922002), respectively. Fragmentation continued post-establishment, and manifested itself in an increasing number of smaller more vulnerable fragments; the number of fragments increased by 60%, and the mean fragment size decreased by 40%. Core areas decreased with ensuing increases in edge lengths, and fragments became more isolated from one another. After designation as a National Park however, increased forest re-growth occurred, resulting in a 63% decline in the net deforestation rate from 0.80% yr(-1) (19831992) to 0.26% yr(-1) (1992-2002). Image classifications gave accuracies of 90-97% (Kappa 0.80-0.93). Although the decrease in net deforestation may indicate some level of success of this National Park, forest clearance and fragmentation, leading to species shifts and biodiversity loss were still present at pre-National Park levels. We then examined the preponderance of successful protected areas, and found that success may be an artifact of the most widely used method of assessment, which compares deforestation rates inside versus outside protected areas.
