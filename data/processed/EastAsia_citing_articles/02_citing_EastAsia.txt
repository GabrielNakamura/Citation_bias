AB Atmospheric CO2 levels are increasing, but little is known about how this will affect tissue concentrations and the partitioning of agriculturally important nutrients such as nitrogen (N) within crop plants.  To investigate this, a glasshouse experiment was conducted in which wheat, a C3 species, and maize, a C4 species, were grown for 8 weeks at high CO2 (1500 cm3 m-3) on N supplies ranging from deficient (0.5 mol m-3) to more than adequate for maximum growth (25 mol m-3).
   Wheat responded to both CO2 enrichment and N supply; maize responded only to N supply.  CO2-enriched wheat produced about twice the dry matter of control plants at all levels of N supply.  Tiller and ear numbers were increased by CO2 enrichment irrespective of N supply.  Enriched wheat plants had a lower Leaf Area Ratio but higher Net Assimilation Rate and Relative Growth Rate than control plants.  There was no effect of CO2 enrichment on specific leaf weight.  The enriched plants had lower shoot to root dry matter ratios than thecontrols at 6 mol m-3 N and higher.  Shoot to root dry matter ratios of both wheat and maize increased with increasing N supply.
   CO2-enriched wheat plants accumulated more N than the controls but the proportional increase in N content was not as great as that in dry matter, with the result that concentrations of total-N and nitrate-N were lower in all organs of enriched plants, including ears.  Nitrate reductase activity was lower in enriched than in control wheat plants.  N-use efficiency by wheat was increased by CO2 enrichment.
   From a practical point of view, the study indicates that critical total-N and NO3-N concentrations used to diagnose the N status of wheat will need to be reassessed as global CO2 levels increase.  Elevated CO2 may also reduce the protein content of grain and thus the baking quality of hard wheats.

AB Thousands of small populations are at increased risk of extinction because genetics and evolutionary biology are not well-integrated into conservation planning-a major lost opportunity for effective actions. We propose that if the risk of outbreeding depression is low, the default should be to evaluate restoration of gene flow to small inbred populations of diploid outbreeding organisms that were isolated by human activities within the last 500 years, rather than inaction. We outline the elements of a scientific-based genetic management policy for fragmented populations of plants and animals, and discuss the reasons why the current default policy is, inappropriately, inaction.

AB We assessed whether diversity in plant hydraulic traits can explain the observed diversity in plant responses to water stress in seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs). The Ecosystem Demography model 2 (ED2) was updated with a trait-driven mechanistic plant hydraulic module, as well as novel drought-phenology and plant water stress schemes. Four plant functional types were parameterized on the basis of meta-analysis of plant hydraulic traits. Simulations from both the original and the updated ED2 were evaluated against 5yr of field data from a Costa Rican SDTF site and remote-sensing data over Central America. The updated model generated realistic plant hydraulic dynamics, such as leaf water potential and stem sap flow. Compared with the original ED2, predictions from our novel trait-driven model matched better with observed growth, phenology and their variations among functional groups. Most notably, the original ED2 produced unrealistically small leaf area index (LAI) and underestimated cumulative leaf litter. Both of these biases were corrected by the updated model. The updated model was also better able to simulate spatial patterns of LAI dynamics in Central America. Plant hydraulic traits are intercorrelated in SDTFs. Mechanistic incorporation of plant hydraulic traits is necessary for the simulation of spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation dynamics in SDTFs in vegetation models.

AB A central challenge for natural resource management is developing rigorous yet practical approaches for balancing the costs and benefits of diverse human uses of ecosystems. Economic theory has a long history of evaluating tradeoffs in returns from different assets to identify optimal investment strategies. There has been recent progress applying this framework to the delivery of ecosystem services in land use planning. However, despite growing national and international interest in marine spatial planning, there is a lack of parallel frameworks in the marine realm. This paper reviews an ecosystem service tradeoff analysis framework and provides a more comprehensive synthesis for how it can be applied to marine spatial planning and marine ecosystem-based management. A tradeoff analysis approach can reveal inferior management options, demonstrate the benefits of comprehensive planning for multiple, interacting services over managing single services, and identify 'compatible' services that provide win-win management options.

   FEMALE PROMISCUITY
AB The consequences of polyandry for female fitness are controversial. Sexual conflict studies and a meta-analysis of mating rates in insects suggest that there is a longevity cost when females mate repeatedly. Even so, compensatory material benefits can elevate egg production and fertility, partly because polyandry ensures an adequate sperm supply. Polyandry can therefore confer direct benefits. The main controversy surrounds genetic benefits. The argument is analogous to that surrounding the evolution of conventional female mate choice, except that with polyandry it is post-copulatory mechanisms that might bias paternity towards males with higher breeding values for fitness. Recent meta-analyses of extra-pair copulations in birds have cast doubt on whether detectable genetic benefits exist. By contrast, another meta-analysis showed that polyandry elevates egg hatching success (possibly due to a fertilization bias towards sperm with paternal genes that elevate embryo survival) in insects. A detailed summary of whether polyandry elevates other components of offspring performance is lacking. Here we present a comprehensive meta-analysis of 232 effect sizes from 46 experimental studies. These experiments were specifically designed to try to quantify the potential genetic benefits of polyandry by controlling fully for the number of matings by females assigned to monandry and polyandry treatments. The bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals for egg hatching success (d = -0.01 to 0.61), clutch production (d = 0.07 to 0.45) and fertility (d = 0.04 to 0.40) all suggest that polyandry has a beneficial effect (although P values from parametric tests were marginally non-significant at P = 0.075, 0.052 and 0.058, respectively). Polyandry was not significantly beneficial for any single offspring performance trait (e.g. growth rate, survival, adult size), but the test power was low due to small sample sizes (suggesting that many more studies are still needed). We then calculated a composite effect size that provides an index of general offspring performance. Depending on the model assumptions, the mean effect of polyandry was either significantly positive or marginally non-significant. A possible role for publication bias is discussed. The magnitude of the reported potential genetic benefits (d = 0.07 to 0.19) are larger than those from two recent meta-analyses comparing offspring sired by social and extra-pair mates in birds (d = 0.02 to 0.04). This difference raises the intriguing possibility that cryptic, post-copulatory female choice might be more likely to generate good gene or compatible gene benefits than female choice of mates based on the expression of secondary sexual traits.

AB We review how intertidal biodiversity is responding to globally driven climate change, focusing on long-term data from rocky shores in the British Isles. Physical evidence of warming around the British Isles is presented and, whilst there has been considerable fluctuation, sea surface temperatures are at the highest levels recorded, surpassing previous warm periods (i.e. late 1950s). Examples are given of species that have been advancing or retreating polewards over the last 50 to 100 yr. On rocky shores, the extent of poleward movement is idiosyncratic and dependent upon life history characteristics, dispersal capabilities and habitat requirements. More Southern, warm water species have been recorded advancing than northern, cold water species retreating. Models have been developed to predict likely assemblage composition based on future environmental scenarios. We present qualitative and quantitative forecasts to explore the functional consequences of changes in the identity, abundance and species richness of gastropod grazers and foundation species such as barnacles and canopy-forming algae. We forecast. that the balance of primary producers and secondary consumers is likely to change along wave exposure gradients matching changes Occurring with latitude, thereby shifting the balance between export and import of primary production. Increases in grazer and sessile invertebrate diversity are likely to be accompanied by decreasing primary production by large canopy-forming fucoids. The reasons for Such changes are discussed in the context of emerging theory on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

AB I present a dynamic bioenergetic model that couples individual energetics and population dynamics to predict current lizard ranges and those following climate warming. The model predictions are uniquely based on first principles of morphology, life history, and thermal physiology. I apply the model to five populations of a widespread North American lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, to examine how geographic variation in traits and life histories influences ranges. This geographic variation reflects the potential for species to adapt to environmental change. I then consider the range dynamics of the closely related Sceloporus graciosus. Comparing predicted ranges and actual current ranges reveals how dispersal limitations, species interactions, and habitat requirements influence the occupied portions of thermally suitable ranges. The dynamic model predicts individualistic responses to a uniform 3 degrees C warming but a northward shift in the northern range boundary for all populations and species. In contrast to standard correlative climate envelope models, the extent of the predicted northward shift depends on organism traits and life histories. The results highlight the limitations of correlative models and the need for more dynamic models of species' ranges.

AB The influence of land use patterns on stream water quality is scale-dependent in space and time. Understanding the relationship between landscape characteristics and water quality is of great importance to improve water contamination prediction in unmonitored watersheds and for providing guidelines for watershed land use planning. In this study, five water sampling sites in the upper Dan River basin were established to monitor seasonal water chemical contamination over the period of 2000 to 2008. The relationships between land use patterns and water quality were analyzed across multiple-scales using redundancy analysis. The results showed that stream water quality variables displayed highly temporal variations, with electrical conductivity (EC), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and total suspended solids (TSS) all generally displaying higher levels in the wet season, while there were higher concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), and dissolved oxygen (DO) in the dry season. The total contribution of land use patterns on overall water quality was stronger at the riparian scale than at the catchment and reach scales during the wet season. However, different land use metrics had different scale effects. Urban land had a higher positive relationship with degraded water quality at small scales than at large scales, whereas agricultural land displayed the opposite scale effects. Forest and grassland explained more water quality variations at the riparian scale than at other scales. Analyses of spatial development patterns suggested that size, density, aggregation, and diversity of landscape patterns were important factors impacting on stream water quality. The results provide important information regarding sustainable land use and landscape planning at multiple-scales that can be used to improve water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The last few decades have seen rapid proliferation of hard artificial structures (e.g., energy infrastructure, aquaculture, coastal defences) in the marine environment: ocean sprawl. The replacement of natural, often sedimentary, substrata with hard substrata has altered the distribution of species, particularly non-indigenous species, and can facilitate the assisted migration of native species at risk from climate change. This has been likened to urbanization as a driver of global biotic homogenization in the marine environment the process by which species invasions and extinctions increase the genetic, taxonomic, or functional similarity of communities at local, regional, and global scales. Ecological engineering research showed that small-scale engineering interventions can have a significant positive effect on the biodiversity associated with artificial structures, promoting more diverse and resilient communities on local scales. This knowledge can be applied to the design of multifunctional structures that provide a range of ecosystem services. In coastal regions, hybrid designs can work with nature to combine hard and soft approaches to coastal defence in a more environmentally sensitive manner. The challenge now is to manage ocean sprawl with the dual goal of supporting human populations and activities, simultaneously strengthening ecosystem resilience using an ecosystem-based approach.

AB Aboveground biomass estimation is critical in understanding forest contribution to regional carbon cycles. Despite the successful application of high spatial and spectral resolution sensors in aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation, there are challenges related to high acquisition costs, small area coverage, multicollinearity and limited availability. These challenges hamper the successful regional scale AGB quantification. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of the newly-launched medium-resolution multispectral Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) dataset with a large swath width, in quantifying AGB in a forest plantation. We applied different sets of spectral analysis (test I: spectral bands; test II: spectral vegetation indices and test III: spectral bands + spectral vegetation indices) in testing the utility of Landsat 8 OLI using two non-parametric algorithms: stochastic gradient boosting and the random forest ensembles. The results of the study show that the medium-resolution multispectral Landsat 8 OLI dataset provides better AGB estimates for Eucalyptus dunii, Eucalyptus grandis and Pinus taeda especially when using the extracted spectral information together with the derived spectral vegetation indices. We also noted that incorporating the optimal subset of the most important selected medium-resolution multispectral Landsat 8 OLI bands improved AGB accuracies. We compared medium-resolution multispectral Landsat 8 OLI AGB estimates with Landsat 7 ETM + estimates and the latter yielded lower estimation accuracies. Overall, this study demonstrates the invaluable potential and strength of applying the relatively affordable and readily available newly-launched medium-resolution Landsat 8 OLI dataset, with a large swath width (185-km) in precisely estimating AGB. This strength of the Landsat OLI dataset is crucial especially in sub-Saharan Africa where high-resolution remote sensing data availability remains a challenge.

Here, we review ongoing developments in connectivity science, providing perspectives on recent advances in identifying, quantifying, modelling and analysing connectivity, and highlight new applications for conservation. We also address ongoing challenges for connectivity research, explore opportunities for addressing them and highlight potential linkages with other fields of research. Continued development of connectivity science will provide insights into key aspects of ecology and the evolution of species, and will also contribute significantly towards achieving more effective conservation outcomes.

AB Land use change has a major impact on goods and services that our environment supplies for society. While detailed ecological or biophysical field studies are needed to quantify the exact amount of ecosystem service supply at local scales, such a monitoring might be unfeasible at the regional scale. Since field scale monitoring schemes for ecosystem services or ecosystem functioning are missing, proxy based indicators can help to assess the historic development of ecosystem services or ecosystem functioning at the regional scale. We show at the example of the historic development (1964-2004) in the district of Leipzig/Germany how land use/land cover data can be used to derive regional scale indicators for ecosystem functions. We focus thereby on two hypotheses: (1) the ecosystem functioning has degraded over time and (2) changes in land use configuration play an important role in this degradation. The study focuses on indicators for ecosystem functions related to (i) water purification by riparian buffer strips, (ii) pollination, (iii) food production and (iv) outdoor recreation. Each indicator builds on the analysis of land use configuration and land use composition information and is tested on sensitivity/robustness with respect to parameters which had to be estimated based on expert knowledge. We show that land use composition is an important aspect in our ecosystem service assessment. Although our study region is faced with a maximum land use change of 11% in the major land use classes between 1964 and 2004. we see a decrease of ecosystem function indicators up to 23%. The regional assessment shows an overall trend for degradation of ecosystem functioning from 1964 to 1984. This trend is reversed between 1984 and 1994 but the process slowed down until 2004 without reaching the level of 1964. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We modelled the future distribution in 2050 of 975 endemic plant species in southern Africa distributed among seven life forms, including new methodological insights improving the accuracy and ecological realism of predictions of global changes studies by: (i) using only endemic species as a way to capture the full realized niche of species, (ii) considering the direct impact of human pressure on landscape and biodiversity jointly with climate, and (iii) taking species' migration into account. Our analysis shows important promises for predicting the impacts of climate change in conjunction with land transformation. We have shown that the endemic flora of Southern Africa on average decreases with 41% in species richness among habitats and with 39% on species distribution range for the most optimistic scenario. We also compared the patterns of species' sensitivity with global change across life forms, using ecological and geographic characteristics of species. We demonstrate here that species and life form vulnerability to global changes can be partly explained according to species' (i) geographical distribution along climatic and biogeographic gradients, like climate anomalies, (ii) niche breadth or (iii) proximity to barrier preventing migration. Our results confirm that the sensitivity of a given species to global environmental changes depends upon its geographical distribution and ecological proprieties, and makes it possible to estimate a priori its potential sensitivity to these changes.

AB Advantages of dispersal on the scales that are possible in a long pelagic larval period are not apparent, even for benthic species. An alternative hypothesis is that wide dispersal may be an incidental byproduct of an ontogenetic migration from and then back to the parental habitat. Under this hypothesis, the water column is a better habitat than the bottom for early development. Because the parental area is often an especially favorable habitat for juveniles and adults, selection may even favor larval retention or larval return rather than dispersal. Where larval capabilities and currents permit, a high percentage of recruits may then be produced from local adults. Expected consequences of a high proportion of local recruitment are stronger links between stock and recruitment, greater vulnerability to recruitment overfishing and local modifications of habitat, greater local benefits from fishery reserves, and possibly more localized adaptation within populations. Export of some larvae is consistent with a high proportion of retained or returning larvae, could stabilize populations linked by larval exchange, and provide connectivity between marine reserves. Even a small amount of larval export could account for the greater gene flow, large ranges, and long evolutionary durations seen in species with long pelagic larval stages.

AB Benthic-pelagic coupling is manifested as the exchange of energy, mass, or nutrients between benthic and pelagic habitats. It plays a prominent role in aquatic ecosystems, and it is crucial to functions from nutrient cycling to energy transfer in food webs. Coastal and estuarine ecosystem structure and function are strongly affected by anthropogenic pressures; however, there are large gaps in our understanding of the responses of inorganic nutrient and organic matter fluxes between benthic habitats and the water column. We illustrate the varied nature of physical and biological benthic-pelagic coupling processes and their potential sensitivity to three anthropogenic pressures - climate change, nutrient loading, and fishing - using the Baltic Sea as a case study and summarize current knowledge on the exchange of inorganic nutrients and organic material between habitats. Traditionally measured benthic-pelagic coupling processes (e.g., nutrient exchange and sedimentation of organic material) are to some extent quantifiable, but the magnitude and variability of biological processes are rarely assessed, preventing quantitative comparisons. Changing oxygen conditions will continue to have widespread effects on the processes that govern inorganic and organic matter exchange among habitats while climate change and nutrient load reductions may have large effects on organic matter sedimentation. Many biological processes (predation, bioturbation) are expected to be sensitive to anthropogenic drivers, but the outcomes for ecosystem function are largely unknown. We emphasize how improved empirical and experimental understanding of benthic-pelagic coupling processes and their variability are necessary to inform models that can quantify the feedbacks among processes and ecosystem responses to a changing world.

AB Deciphering the mechanisms that link biodiversity with ecosystem functions is critical to understanding the consequences of changes in biodiversity. The hypothesis that complementarity and selection effects drive relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions is well accepted, and an approach to statistically untangle the relative importance of these effects has been widely applied. In contrast, empirical demonstrations of the biological mechanisms that underlie these relationships remain rare. Here, on the basis of a field experiment with young trees, we provide evidence that one form of complementarity in plant communities-complementarity among crowns in canopy space-is a mechanism, related to light interception and use, that links biodiversity with ecosystem productivity. Stem biomass overyielding increased sharply in mixtures with greater crown complementarity. Inherent differences among species in crown architecture led to greater crown complementarity in functionally diverse species mixtures. Intraspecific variation, specifically neighbourhood-driven plasticity in crowns, further modified spatial complementarity and strengthened the positive relationship with overyielding-crown plasticity and inherent interspecific differences contributed near equally in explaining patterns of overyielding. We posit that crown complementarity is an important mechanism that may contribute to diversity-enhanced productivity in forests.

ID CAPTURE-RECAPTURE MODELS; ESTIMATING ABUNDANCE
AB Recently developed spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models represent a major advance over traditional capture-recapture (CR) models because they yield explicit estimates of animal density instead of population size within an unknown area. Furthermore, unlike nonspatial CR methods, SCR models account for heterogeneity in capture probability arising from the juxtaposition of animal activity centers and sample locations. Although the utility of SCR methods is gaining recognition, the requirement that all individuals can be uniquely identified excludes their use in many contexts. In this paper, we develop models for situations in which individual recognition is not possible, thereby allowing SCR concepts to be applied in studies of unmarked or partially marked populations. The data required for our model are spatially referenced counts made on one or more sample occasions at a collection of closely spaced sample units such that individuals can be encountered at multiple locations. Our approach includes a spatial point process for the animal activity centers and uses the spatial correlation in counts as information about the number and location of the activity centers. Camera-traps, hair snares, track plates, sound recordings, and even point counts can yield spatially correlated count data, and thus our model is widely applicable. A simulation study demonstrated that while the posterior mean exhibits frequentist bias on the order of 5-10% in small samples, the posterior mode is an accurate point estimator as long as adequate spatial correlation is present. Marking a subset of the population substantially increases posterior precision and is recommended whenever possible. We applied our model to avian point count data collected on an unmarked population of the northern parula (Parula americana) and obtained a density estimate (posterior mode) of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.19-1.64) birds/ha. Our paper challenges sampling and analytical conventions in ecology by demonstrating that neither spatial independence nor individual recognition is needed to estimate population density-rather, spatial dependence can be informative about individual distribution and density.

AB This paper summarizes a broad range of studies that have examined influences of recent climate change on plant phenology or distribution. Spring events such as leafing and flowering have typically advanced, some by several weeks, with median advances of 4-5 d per degree Celsius. Autumn events, such as leaf coloring or leaf fall, have usually become delayed, though with more variability than spring events. Changes in summer events have been mixed. Phenological changes have varied geographically, as have recent temperature changes. Most studies of at least several decades duration show the initiation of rapid changes in the 1970s or 1980s, paralleling patterns of temperature change. Plants and animals in a given area have often responded at different rates to temperature change, which is likely to change patterns of interaction between plants and their pollinators and herbivores. Altitudinal changes in plant distributions have been demonstrated in several areas, especially in Scandinavia and in Mediterranean Europe, though these changes lag the measured temperature changes. Latitudinal changes in plant distribution have been demonstrated in only a few instances and it has been suggested that precipitation changes may have limited range shifts in response to warming in some areas. The observed and predicted changes in plant distribution and phenology have major implications for various ecological and evolutionary phenomena, including ecosystem productivity, species interactions, community structure, and conservation of biodiversity.

Nitrogen is very important for the growth and yield of safflower, however, the effect of N level on chlorophyll content, assimilation rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, substornatal CO2 concentration, and water use efficiency (WUE) have not been determined. A 2-year field study was conducted with the objective to determine the effect of N fertilization on yield, yield components, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic characteristics, and WUE of safflower grown under rainfed conditions. Three rates of N were used (0, 100, and 200 kg N ha(-1)) and two hybrids (CW9048 and CW9050). N fertilization increased seed yield by an average of 19%, the seed weight per plant by 60%, the seed weight per head by 18%, the number of heads per plant by 32%, and the number of seeds per plant by 41% compared with the control. N level also affected chlorophyll content, N concentration at anthesis, protein, and oil yield. N application increased assimilation rate by an average of 51%, stomatal conductance of water vapour by an average of 27%, and WUE by an average of 60% over the 2 years of the study when compared to the control. The present study indicates that N fertilization can affect yield, yield components, photosynthetic efficiency, and physiology of safflower under rainfed conditions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Interspecific variation in the response to transfer from low to high growth irradiance with respect to anatomical and photosynthetic characteristics was studied in mature leaves of three tree species, Betula ermanii Cham., Acer rufinerve Sieb. et Zucc. and Fagus crenata Blume, which occur in different successional stages in temperate deciduous forests. Transfer from low to high irradiance increased the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis per unit leaf area (P-max) significantly in B. ermanii and A. rufinerve, but not in F. crenata. Leaves of B. ermanii grown at low irradiance were relatively thick and had vacant spaces along the mesophyll cell surfaces which was not occupied by chloroplasts or other organelles. After transfer to high irradiance, chloroplasts enlarged to fill the space along with P-max without an increase in leaf thickness. Leaves of A. rufinerve were plastic in mesophyll cell surface area and in leaf thickness, both of which increased after the transfer to high irradiance, along with an increase in the amount of chloroplasts and in P-max. On the other hand, F. crenata had little mesophyll cell surface unoccupied by chloroplasts and leaf anatomy was not changed after the transfer. In all species, P-max was strongly correlated with chloroplast surface area adjacent to the exposed mesophyll surface across different growth irradiances. An increase in P-max was observed only when chloroplast volume also increased. We conclude that light acclimation potential is primarily determined by the availability of unoccupied cell surface into which chloroplasts expand, as well as by the plasticity of the mesophyll that allows an increase in its surface area.

AB The reef fish assemblage at Orpheus Island, Great Barrier Reef, was examined using visual censuses and the ichthyocide rotenone. Small 3.5 m(2) quantitative rotenone samples, using a fine-mesh net to enclose the site, were compared with visual-point censuses (prior to the placement of the net), random-point censuses and strip censuses. Furthermore, the fishes collected inside and outside the net were examined to determine the relative efficiency of enclosed versus open rotenone samples. Rotenone samples comprised 128 species in 28 families. Of these, only 49% of the species overlapped between the enclosed (inside net) and open (outside net) samples. Only 17.7 % of the species in the enclosed rotenone sample were seen prior to collection. Rotenone samples reveal that visual censuses underestimated the abundance of small taxa. Overall, rotenone samples increased the estimated number of species by 40.4 % and the total fish abundance by 50.1 % (75.3 % for fishes <50 mm). Biomass increased by less than 1.0%. However, through relatively high energetic demands, high turnover rates and their role as potential prey, small fish taxa may play a greater role in reef processes than previously assumed. The limits of visual censusing techniques are highlighted, emphasising the value of small, enclosed, intensive rotenone samples for providing reliable quantitative samples of small taxa.

AB Despite decades of research, how climate warming alters the global flux of soil respiration is still poorly characterized. Here, we use meta-analysis to synthesize 202 soil respiration datasets from 50 ecosystem warming experiments across multiple terrestrial ecosystems. We found that, on average, warming by 2 degrees C increased soil respiration by 12% during the early warming years, but warming-induced drought partially offset this effect. More significantly, the two components of soil respiration, heterotrophic respiration and autotrophic respiration showed distinct responses. The warming effect on autotrophic respiration was not statistically detectable during the early warming years, but nonetheless decreased with treatment duration. In contrast, warming by 2 degrees C increased heterotrophic respiration by an average of 21%, and this stimulation remained stable over the warming duration. This result challenged the assumption that microbial activity would acclimate to the rising temperature. Together, our findings demonstrate that distinguishing heterotrophic respiration and autotrophic respiration would allow us better understand and predict the long-term response of soil respiration to warming. The dependence of soil respiration on soil moisture condition also underscores the importance of incorporating warming-induced soil hydrological changes when modeling soil respiration under climate change.

AB Among the environmental factors that can be modified by farmers, water and nitrogen are the main ones controlling plant growth. Irrigation and fertilizer application overcome this effect, if adequately used. Agriculture thus consumes about 85% of the total fresh water used worldwide. While only 18% of the world's cultivated areas are devoted to irrigated agriculture, this total surface represents more than 45% of total agricultural production. These data highlight the importance of irrigated agriculture in a framework where the growing population demands greater food production. In addition, tighter water restrictions and competition with other sectors of society is increasing pressure to diminish the share of fresh water for irrigation, thus resulting in the decrease in water diverted for agriculture. The effect of water and nutrient application on yield has led to the overuse of these practices in the last decades. This misuse of irrigation and fertilizers is no longer sustainable, given the economic and environmental costs. Sustainable agriculture requires a correct balance between the agronomic, economic and environmental aspects of nutrient management. The major advances shown in this review are the following: (1) the measurement of the intensity of drought and N deficiency is a prerequisite for quantitative assessment of crop needs and management of both irrigation and fertilizer application. The N concentration of leaves exposed to direct irradiance allows both a reliable and high-resolution measurement of the status and the assessment of N nutrition at the plant level. (2) Two experiments on sunflower and on tall fescue are used to relate the changes in time and irrigation intensity to the crop N status, and to introduce the complex relationships between N demand and supply in crops. (3) Effects of water deficits on N demand are reviewed, pointing out the high sensitivity of N-rich organs versus the relative lesser sensitivity of organs that are poorer in N compounds. (4) The generally equal sensitivities of nitrifying and denitrifying microbes are likely to explain many conflicting results on the impact of water deficits on soil mineral N availability for crops. (5) The transpiration stream largely determines the availability of mineral N in the rhizosphere. This makes our poor estimate of root densities a major obstacle to any precise assessment of N availability in fertilized crops. (6) The mineral N fluxes in the xylem are generally reduced under water deficit and assimilation is generally known to be more sensitive to water scarcity. (7) High osmotic pressures are maintained during grain filling, which enables the plant to recycle large amounts of previously assimilated N. Its part in the total grain N yield is therefore generally higher under water deficits. (8) Most crop models currently used in agronomy use N and water efficiently but exhibit different views on their interaction.

AB This review assesses and predicts the impacts that rapid climate change will have on population connectivity in coral reef ecosystems, using fishes as a model group. Increased ocean temperatures are expected to accelerate larval development, potentially leading to reduced pelagic durations and earlier reef-seeking behaviour. Depending on the spatial arrangement of reefs, the expectation would be a reduction in dispersal distances and the spatial scale of connectivity. Small increase in temperature might enhance the number of larvae surviving the pelagic phase, but larger increases are likely to reduce reproductive output and increase larval mortality. Changes to ocean currents could alter the dynamics of larval supply and changes to planktonic productivity could affect how many larvae survive the pelagic stage and their condition at settlement; however, these patterns are likely to vary greatly from place-to-place and projections of how oceanographic features will change in the future lack sufficient certainty and resolution to make robust predictions. Connectivity could also be compromised by the increased fragmentation of reef habitat due to the effects of coral bleaching and ocean acidification. Changes to the spatial and temporal scales of connectivity have implications for the management of coral reef ecosystems, especially the design and placement of marine-protected areas. The size and spacing of protected areas may need to be strategically adjusted if reserve networks are to retain their efficacy in the future.

AB We investigate interactions between successive naturally occurring fires, and assess to what extent the environments in which fires burn influence these interactions. Using mapped fire perimeters and satellite-based estimates of post-fire effects (referred to hereafter as fire severity) for 19 fires burning relatively freely over a 31-year period, we demonstrate that fire as a landscape process can exhibit self-limiting characteristics in an upper elevation Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest. We use the term 'self-limiting' to refer to recurring fire as a process over time (that is, fire regime) consuming fuel and ultimately constraining the spatial extent and lessening fire-induced effects of subsequent fires. When the amount of time between successive adjacent fires is under 9 years, and when fire weather is not extreme (burning index <34.9), the probability of the latter fire burning into the previous fire area is extremely low. Analysis of fire severity data by 10-year periods revealed a fair degree of stability in the proportion of area burned among fire severity classes (unchanged, low, moderate, high). This is in contrast to a recent study demonstrating increasing high-severity burning throughout the Sierra Nevada from 1984 to 2006, which suggests freely burning fires over time in upper elevation Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests can regulate fire-induced effects across the landscape. This information can help managers better anticipate short-and long-term effects of allowing naturally ignited fires to burn, and ultimately, improve their ability to implement Wildland Fire Use programs in similar forest types.

AB SINE (short interspersed element) insertion analysis elucidates contentious aspects in the phylogeny of toothed whales and dolphins (Odontoceti), especially river dolphins. Here, we characterize 25 informative SINEs inserted into unique genomic loci during evolution of odontocetes to construct a cladogram. and determine a total of 2.8 kb per taxon of the flanking sequences of these SINE loci to estimate divergence times among lineages. We demonstrate that: (i) Odontocetes are monophyletic; (ii) Ganges River dolphins, beaked whales, and ocean dolphins diverged (in this order) after sperm whales; (iii) three other river dolphin taxa, namely the Amazon, La Plata, and Yangtze river dolphins, form a monophyletic group with Yangtze River dolphins being the most basal; and (iv) the rapid radiation of extant cetacean lineages occurred some 28-33 million years B.P., in strong accord with the fossil record. The combination of SINE and flanking sequence analysis suggests a topology and set of divergence times for odontocete relationships, offering alternative explanations for several long-standing problems in cetacean evolution.

AB Question How do multivariate methods perform in relating species- and community-level trait responses to the environment? Location (1) Field data from grazed semi-natural grasslands, NE Germany; (2) artificial data. Methods Research questions associated with traitenvironment relationships were briefly reviewed and seven available methods evaluated. The main distinction between research questions is whether traitenvironment relationships should be addressed at community or species level. A redundancy analysis (RDA) of mean trait values of species in a plot weighted by their abundances (CWM-RDA) is exclusively suitable for the community level. The other six methods address the species level. A double inertia analysis of two arrays (RLQ) and double canonical correspondence analysis (double CCA) use combinations of ordinations to simultaneously analyse species and trait responses to the environment. A combination of the outlying mean index with generalized additive models (OMI-GAM) predicts the response of species to environmental variables on trait gradients. RDA-RegTree first analyses species responses to the environment with RDA and then uses a regression tree to classify trait expressions according to scores of species responses on the ordination axes. Cluster regression uses cluster analyses and logistic regression to search for trait combinations with the best response to the environmental variables. This method models the distribution of functional groups on environmental gradients. All methods and data are available as R scripts. Results All methods consistently revealed the main trait responses to environment in the field data set, namely that life history was associated with available phosphorus while grazing intensity was related to leaf C:N ratio and canopy height. At community level, CWM-RDA gave a good overview of traitenvironment relationships, as also provided by the species-based methods RLQ and double CCA. OMI-GAM revealed non-linear relationships in the field data set. Field and artificial data gave that the number and stability of functional groups produced by Cluster regression and RDA-RegTree varied more strongly than RLQ, double CCA and OMI-GAM. Conclusions Each method addresses particular ecological concepts and research questions. If a user asks for the response of average trait expressions of communities to environmental gradients, CWM-RDA may be the first choice. However, species-based methods should be applied to address questions regarding co-existence of different life histories or to assess how groups of species respond to environmental changes. The artificial data set revealed that the methods differed in sensitivity to gradient lengths and random data.

AB Detailed large-scale information on mammal distribution has often been lacking, hindering conservation efforts. We used the information from the 2009 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as a baseline for developing habitat suitability models for 5027 out of 5330 known terrestrial mammal species, based on their habitat relationships. We focused on the following environmental variables: land cover, elevation and hydrological features. Models were developed at 300 m resolution and limited to within species' known geographical ranges. A subset of the models was validated using points of known species occurrence. We conducted a global, fine-scale analysis of patterns of species richness. The richness of mammal species estimated by the overlap of their suitable habitat is on average one-third less than that estimated by the overlap of their geographical ranges. The highest absolute difference is found in tropical and subtropical regions in South America, Africa and Southeast Asia that are not covered by dense forest. The proportion of suitable habitat within mammal geographical ranges correlates with the IUCN Red List category to which they have been assigned, decreasing monotonically from Least Concern to Endangered. These results demonstrate the importance of fine-resolution distribution data for the development of global conservation strategies for mammals.

DE Predictive modeling; Random forests; CART; Gradient
ID CLASSIFICATION; SCALE
AB Landscape ecology often adopts a patch mosaic model of ecological patterns. However, many ecological attributes are inherently continuous and classification of species composition into vegetation communities and discrete patches provides an overly simplistic view of the landscape. If one adopts a niche-based, individualistic concept of biotic communities then it may often be more appropriate to represent vegetation patterns as continuous measures of site suitability or probability of occupancy, rather than the traditional abstraction into categorical community types represented in a mosaic of discrete patches. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the high effectiveness of species-level, pixel scale prediction of species occupancy as a continuous landscape variable, as an alternative to traditional classified community type vegetation maps. We use a Random Forests ensemble learning approach to predict site-level probability of occurrence for four conifer species based on climatic, topographic and spectral predictor variables across a 3,883 km(2) landscape in northern Idaho, USA. Our method uses a new permutated sample-downscaling approach to equalize sample sizes in the presence and absence classes, a model selection method to optimize parsimony, and independent validation using prediction to 10% bootstrap data withhold. The models exhibited very high accuracy, with AUC and kappa values over 0.86 and 0.95, respectively, for all four species. The spatial predictions produced by the models will be of great use to managers and scientists, as they provide vastly more accurate spatial depiction of vegetation structure across this landscape than has previously been provided by traditional categorical classified community type maps.

AB We describe a novel model and algorithm for simultaneously estimating multiple molecular sequence alignments and the phylogenetic trees that relate the sequences. Unlike current techniques that base phylogeny estimates on a single estimate of the alignment, we take alignment uncertainty into account by considering all possible alignments. Furthermore, because the alignment and phylogeny are constructed simultaneously, a guide tree is not needed. This sidesteps the problem in which alignments created by progressive alignment are biased toward the guide tree used to generate them. Joint estimation also allows us to model rate variation between sites when estimating the alignment and to use the evidence in shared insertion/deletions (indels) to group sister taxa in the phylogeny. Our indel model makes use of affine gap penalties and considers indels of multiple letters. We make the simplifying assumption that the indel process is identical on all branches. As a result, the probability of a gap is independent of branch length. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to sample from the posterior of the joint model, estimating the most probable alignment and tree and their support simultaneously. We describe a new MCMC transition kernel that improves our algorithm's mixing efficiency, allowing the MCMC chains to converge even when started from arbitrary alignments. Our software implementation can estimate alignment uncertainty and we describe a method for summarizing this uncertainty in a single plot.

AB This study confirms reports by fishermen of a large and predictable aggregation of whale sharks Rhincodon typus along the Belize Barrier Reef. Although whale sharks are rarely sighted at this location during most of the year, we counted as many as 25 whale sharks in a 50 m diameter area on 1 occasion and tagged 6 sharks during a 22 min period on another. The whale shark aggregation coincides seasonally and temporally with a multispecies reef-fish spawning aggregation at a reef promontory, Gladden Spit, at sunset, during the full and last-quarter moon periods of April and May each year. We report here, for the first time, that whale sharks feed on the freshly released spawn of cubera snappers Lutjanus cyanopterus and dog snappers L, jocu (Lutjanidae), and have documented the phenomenon with still and digital video photography of hundreds of feeding events. There is consensus locally that this remarkable interaction is in need of immediate protection from overfishing of snappers and unregulated tourism development. Our continued investigations are providing management recommendations for a new marine reserve at the site.

AB The microhabitat use and seasonality of the juveniles of 24 littoral species in the north-west Mediterranean Sea were studied between March 1993 and March 1994. Labrids species recruit during summer months, from July to September, whereas sparids recruit at different times of the year. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the species recruit in well-defined habitats. Sparid species recruit primarily in the shallowest zone (0 to 2 m), and most of them prefer varied bottoms (sand, gravel or small blocks). Some species of the genus Diplodus have similar habitat requirements, but show a clear seasonal segregation, with each species occupying successively the same zones at a different time of the year. Labrid species show a high degree of seasonal and spatial co-occurrence, and are normally found on rocky substrates with high algal cover. Two species (Mullus surmuletus and Symphodus cinereus) recruit mainly in Posidonia oceanica beds, while other species (Serranus cabrilla, Coris julis, Symphodus ocellatus, S. rostratus), are abundant in both seagrass beds and on rocky substrates.

AB Climate, physical landscapes, and biota interact to generate heterogeneous hydrologic conditions in space and over time, which are reflected in spatial patterns of species distributions. As these species distributions respond to rapid climate change, microrefugia may support local species persistence in the face of deteriorating climatic suitability. Recent focus on temperature as a determinant of microrefugia insufficiently accounts for the importance of hydrologic processes and changing water availability with changing climate. Where water scarcity is a major limitation now or under future climates, hydrologic microrefugia are likely to prove essential for species persistence, particularly for sessile species and plants. Zones of high relative water availability - mesic microenvironments - are generated by a wide array of hydrologic processes, and may be loosely coupled to climatic processes and therefore buffered from climate change. Here, we review the mechanisms that generate mesic microenvironments and their likely robustness in the face of climate change. We argue that mesic microenvironments will act as species-specific refugia only if the nature and space/time variability in water availability are compatible with the ecological requirements of a target species. We illustrate this argument with case studies drawn from California oak woodland ecosystems. We posit that identification of hydrologic refugia could form a cornerstone of climate-cognizant conservation strategies, but that this would require improved understanding of climate change effects on key hydrologic processes, including frequently cryptic processes such as groundwater flow.

AB The morphological and biochemical properties of plant canopies are strong predictors of photosynthetic capacity and nutrient cycling. Remote sensing research at the leaf and canopy scales has demonstrated the ability to characterize the biochemical status of vegetation canopies using reflectance spectroscopy, including at the leaf level and canopy level from air- and spaceborne imaging spectrometers. We developed a set of accurate and precise spectroscopic calibrations for the determination of leaf chemistry (contents of nitrogen, area, carbon, and fiber constituents), morphology (leaf mass per area, M-area), and isotopic composition (delta N-15) of temperate and boreal tree species using spectra of dried and ground leaf material. The data set consisted of leaves from both broadleaf and needle-leaf conifer species and displayed a wide range in values, determined with standard analytical approaches: 0.7-4.4% for nitrogen(N-mass), 42-54% for carbon (C-mass), 17-58% for fiber (acid-digestible fiber, ADF), 7-44% for lignin (acid-digestible lignin, ADL), 3-31% for cellulose, 17-265 g/m(2) for M-area, and 9.4 parts per thousand to 0.8 parts per thousand for delta N-15. The calibrations were developed using a partial least-squares regression (PLSR) modeling approach combined with a novel uncertainty analysis. Our PLSR models yielded model calibration (independent validation shown in parentheses) R-2 and the root mean square error (RMSE) values, respectively, of 0.98 (0.97) and 0.10% (0.13%) for N-mass, R-2 = 0.77 (0.73) and RMSE = 0.88% (0.95%) for C-mass, R-2 = 0.89 (0.84) and RMSE=2.8% (3.4%) for ADF, R-2 = 0.77 (0.69) and RMSE = 2.4% (3.9%) for ADL, R-2=0.77 (0.72) and RMSE=1.4% (1.9%) for leaf cellulose, R-2=0.62 (0.60) and RMSE=0.91 parts per thousand (1.5 parts per thousand) for delta N-15, and R-2 = 0.88 (0.87) with RMSE = 17.2 g/m(2) (22.8 g/m(2)) for M-area. This study demonstrates the potential for rapid and accurate estimation of key foliar traits of forest canopies that are important for ecological research and modeling activities, with a single calibration equation valid over a wide range of northern temperate and boreal species and leaf physiognomies. The results provide the basis to characterize important variability between and within species, and across ecological gradients using a rapid, cost-effective, easily replicated method.

AB Temperature regulates the rate of biogeochemical cycles. One way it does so is through control of microbial metabolism. Warming effects on metabolism change with time as physiology adjusts to the new temperature. I here propose that such thermal adaptation is observed in soil microbial respiration and growth, as the result of universal evolutionary trade-offs between the structure and function of both enzymes and membranes. I review the basis for these trade-offs and show that they, like substrate depletion, are plausible mechanisms explaining soil respiration responses to warming. I argue that controversies over whether soil microbes adapt to warming stem from disregarding the evolutionary physiology of cellular metabolism, and confusion arising from the term thermal acclimation to represent phenomena at the organism- and ecosystem-levels with different underlying mechanisms. Measurable physiological adjustments of the soil microbial biomass reflect shifts from colder- to warmer-adapted taxa. Hypothesized declines in the growth efficiency of soil microbial biomass under warming are controversial given limited data and a weak theoretical basis. I suggest that energy spilling (aka waste metabolism) is a more plausible mechanism for efficiency declines than the commonly invoked increase in maintenance-energy demands. Energy spilling has many fitness benefits for microbes and its response to climate warming is uncertain. Modeled responses of soil carbon to warming are sensitive to microbial growth efficiency, but declines in efficiency mitigate warming-induced carbon losses in microbial models and exacerbate them in conventional models. Both modeling structures assume that microbes regulate soil carbon turnover, highlighting the need for a third structure where microbes are not regulators. I conclude that microbial physiology must be considered if we are to have confidence in projected feedbacks between soil carbon stocks, atmospheric CO2, and climate change.

AB 1. The impact of environmental disturbance and habitat loss on associated species is expected to be dependent on a species' level of specialization. We examined habitat use and specialization of coral reef fish from the diverse and ecologically important family Pomacentridae, and determined which species are susceptible to declines in coral cover due to disturbance induced by crown-of-thorns seastar (COTS, Acanthaster planci L.).
   2. A high proportion of pomacentrid species live in association with live coral as adults (40%) or juveniles (53%). Adults of many species had strong affiliations with branching corals, while juveniles favoured plating growth forms, reflecting the sizes of refuge provided by coral types.
   3. Juveniles of species that associated with coral had narrower niche breadths than adult conspecifics, due to associations with specific coral types. The especially high coral association and narrower niche breadth of juveniles suggest that the presence of live coral is crucial for many species during early life history, and that disturbance-induced coral loss may have serious flow-on effects on adult abundance.
   4. Microhabitat availability was a poor predictor of fish species abundance. Significant correlations between coverage of coral types and abundance of five adults and two juvenile species were detected; however, these relationships explained < 35% and < 10% of the variation in abundance of adult and juvenile species, respectively.
   5. Niche breadth explained 74% of the variation in species' mean response to coral decline and it is clear that disturbance has a greater impact on resource specialists, suggesting that increasing frequency and intensity of coral loss will cause reef fish communities to become dominated by habitat generalists at the expense of coral-dwelling specialists.

AB Asexual organisms usually have larger and more northern distributions than their sexual relatives. This phenomenon, called geographical parthenogenesis, has been controversially attributed to predispositions in certain taxa; advantages of polyploidy and/or hybrid origin; better colonizing abilities because of uniparental reproduction; introgression of apomixis into sexuals; niche differentiation of clones; or biotic interactions. This review on apomictic plants demonstrates that each of these factors alone has not been able to explain the observed distributions. Establishment of the complex regulatory system of apomixis requires taxonomic and geographical predispositions; hybridization and/or polyploidization do create diversity, but they do not necessarily result in large distributions; colonizing abilities depend on clonal diversity and are outweighed by sexuals by self-compatibility and higher potentials for speciation; niche differentiation, ploidy levels and selfing keep sympatric sexuals and apomicts separated; and the impact of biotic interactions on distributions is uncertain. In conclusion, the distributional success of apomicts has a complex causality and depends on certain circumstances and combinations of factors. The rare establishment of apomixis may help to explain the predominance of sexuality on the large scale.

AB The ruminants constitute the largest group of ungulates, with > 190 species, and its distribution is widespread throughout all continents except Australia and Antarctica. Six families are traditionally recognized within the suborder Ruminantia: Antilocapridae (pronghorns), Bovidae (cattle, sheep, and antelopes), Cervidae (deer), Giraffidae (giraffes and okapis), Moschidae (musk deer), and Tragulidae (chevrotains). The interrelationships of the families have been an area of controversy among morphology, palaeontology, and molecular studies, and almost all possible evolutionary scenarios have been proposed in the literature. We analyzed a large DNA data set (5,322 nucleotides) for 23 species including both mitochondrial (cytochrome b, 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and 16S rRNA) and nuclear (kappa-casein, cytochrome P-450, lactoferrin, and alpha-lactalbumin) markers. Our results show that the family Tragulidae occupies a basal position with respect to all other ruminant families, confirming the traditional view that separates Tragulina and Pecora. Within the pecorans, Antilocapridae and Giraffidae emerge first, and the families Bovidae, Moschidae, and Cervidae are allied, with the unexpected placement of Moschus close to bovids rather than to cervids. We used these molecular results to assess the homoplastic evolution of morphological characters within the Ruminantia. A Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach based on the continuous autocorrelation of evolutionary rates along branches was applied to estimate the divergence ages between the major clades of ruminants. The evolutionary radiation of Pecora occurred at the Early/Late Oligocene transition, and Pecoran families diversified and dispersed rapidly during the Early and Middle Miocene. We propose a biogeographic scenario to explain the extraordinary expansion of this group during the Cenozoic era.

AB In this study we constructed a bootstrapped distance tree of 500 small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences from organisms belonging to the so-called crown of eukaryote evolution. Taking into account the substitution rate of the individual nucleotides of the rRNA sequence alignment, our results suggest that (1) animals, true fungi, and choanoflagellates share a common origin: The branch joining these taxa is highly supported by bootstrap analysis (bootstrap support [BS] 1 90%), (2) stramenopiles and alveolates are sister groups (BS = 75%), (3) within the alveolates, dinoflagellates and apicomplexans share a common ancestor BS > 95%), while in turn they both share a common origin with the ciliates (BS > 80%), and (4) within the stramenopiles, heterokont algae, hyphochytriomycetes, and oomycetes form a monophyletic grouping well supported by bootstrap analysis (BS > 85%), preceded by the well-supported successive divergence of labyrinthulomycetes and bicosoecids.
   On the other hand, many evolutionary relationships between crown taxa are still obscure on the basis of 18S rRNA. The branching order between the animal-fungal-choanoflagellates clade and the chlorobionts, the alveolates and stramenopiles, red algae, and several smaller groups of organisms remains largely unresolved.
   When among-site rate variation is not considered, the inferred tree topologies are inferior to those where the substitution rate spectrum for the 18S rRNA is taken into account. This is primarily indicated by the erroneous branching of fast-evolving sequences. Moreover, when different substitution rates among sites are not considered, the animals no longer appear as a monophyletic grouping in most distance trees.

AB We reviewed the scientific literature to determine whether the construction of artificial reefs increases the regional production of marine fishes. An evaluation of this technique is warranted by its high cost and logistical difficulty. Our review indicated that reef construction may have potentially deleterious effects on reef fish populations, including (1) increasing fishing effort and catch rates, (2) boosting the potential for overexploitation of stocks by increasing access to previously unexploited stock segments, and (3) increasing the probability of overexploitation by concentrating previously exploited segments of the stock. In contrast, the literature contained few studies that unambiguously demonstrated that artificial reefs increased regional fish production rather than merely concentrated available biomass. In addition, the literature on population regulation in reef fishes did not provide convincing evidence that reef fishes were limited by insufficient quantities of hard-bottom habitat. Consequently, potential positive and negative aspects of reef construction should be carefully evaluated prior to the addition of new reefs to marine environments.

AB Gully erosion is identified as an important sediment source in a range of environments and plays a conclusive role in redistribution of eroded soils on a slope. Hence, addressing spatial occurrence pattern of this phenomenon is very important. Different ensemble models and their single counterparts, mostly data mining methods, have been used for gully erosion susceptibility mapping; however, their calibration and validation procedures need to be thoroughly addressed. The current study presents a series of individual and ensemble datamining methods including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), maximum entropy (ME), ANN-SVM, ANN-ME, and SVM-ME to map gully erosion susceptibility in Aghemam watershed, Iran. To this aim, a gully inventory map along with sixteen gully conditioning factors was used. A 70: 30% randomly partitioned sets were used to assess goodness-of-fit and prediction power of the models. The robustness, as the stability of models' performance in response to changes in the dataset, was assessed through three training/test replicates. As a result, conducted preliminary statistical tests showed that ANN has the highest concordance and spatial differentiation with a chi-square value of 36,656 at 95% confidence level, while the ME appeared to have the lowest concordance (1772). The ME model showed an impractical result where 45% of the study area was introduced as highly susceptible to gullying, in contrast, ANN-SVM indicated a practical result with focusing only on 34% of the study area. Through all three replicates, the ANN-SVM ensemble showed the highest goodness-of-fit and predictive power with a respective values of 0.897 (area under the success rate curve) and 0.879 (area under the prediction rate curve), on average, and correspondingly the highest robustness. This attests the important role of ensemble modeling in congruently building accurate and generalized models which emphasizes the necessity to examine different models integrations. The result of this study can prepare an outline for further biophysical designs on gullies scattered in the study area. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to an increasing awareness in environmental impact, consumers are more sensitive towards green products when making their purchasing decisions. The young generation, who represents the future of our society, seems to have a different attitude and belief which enables them to reflect on their choice of green products. This research empirically examines the influence of ecological affect and ecological knowledge on the green purchasing behaviour of the young generation. A survey was administered to young consumers between the age of 18 and 30. Structural equation modelling was applied to test the hypotheses. The analysis result confirms that the ecological effect and knowledge are significant in determining young consumers' green involvement as well as their actual purchase. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Since the first discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vents along the Galapagos Rift in 1977, numerous vent sites and endemic faunal assemblages have been found along mid-ocean ridges and back-arc basins at low to mid latitudes. These discoveries have suggested the existence of separate biogeographic provinces in the Atlantic and the North West Pacific, the existence of a province including the South West Pacific and Indian Ocean, and a separation of the North East Pacific, North East Pacific Rise, and South East Pacific Rise. The Southern Ocean is known to be a region of high deep-sea species diversity and centre of origin for the global deep-sea fauna. It has also been proposed as a gateway connecting hydrothermal vents in different oceans but is little explored because of extreme conditions. Since 2009 we have explored two segments of the East Scotia Ridge (ESR) in the Southern Ocean using a remotely operated vehicle. In each segment we located deep-sea hydrothermal vents hosting high-temperature black smokers up to 382.8 degrees C and diffuse venting. The chemosynthetic ecosystems hosted by these vents are dominated by a new yeti crab (Kiwa n. sp.), stalked barnacles, limpets, peltospiroid gastropods, anemones, and a predatory sea star. Taxa abundant in vent ecosystems in other oceans, including polychaete worms (Siboglinidae), bathymodiolid mussels, and alvinocaridid shrimps, are absent from the ESR vents. These groups, except the Siboglinidae, possess planktotrophic larvae, rare in Antarctic marine invertebrates, suggesting that the environmental conditions of the Southern Ocean may act as a dispersal filter for vent taxa. Evidence from the distinctive fauna, the unique community structure, and multivariate analyses suggest that the Antarctic vent ecosystems represent a new vent biogeographic province. However, multivariate analyses of species present at the ESR and at other deep-sea hydrothermal vents globally indicate that vent biogeography is more complex than previously recognised.

AB Molecular studies of speciation in birds over the last three decades have been dominated by a focus on the geography, ecology, and timing of speciation, a tradition traceable to Mayr's Systematics and the Origin of Species. However, in the recent years, interest in the behavioral and molecular mechanisms of speciation in birds has increased, building in part on the older traditions and observations from domesticated species. The result is that many of the same mechanisms proffered for model lineages such as Drosophila-mechanisms such as genetic incompatibilities, reinforcement, and sexual selection-are now being seriously entertained for birds, albeit with much lower resolution. The recent completion of a draft sequence of the chicken genome, and an abundance of single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the autosomes and sex chromosomes, will dramatically accelerate research on the molecular mechanisms of avian speciation over the next few years. The challenge for ornithologists is now to inform well studied examples of speciation in nature with increased molecular resolution-to clone speciation genes if they exist-and thereby evaluate the relative roles of extrinsic, intrinsic, deterministic, and stochastic causes for avian diversification.

AB A comparative analysis of daily carbon (C) budgets and aspects of the C physiology of clover (Trifolium repens L,) colonized by vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal fungi was carried out over a 70 d growth period under conditions designed to ensure that shoots of mycorrhizal (M) and non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants were of similar nutrient status. C budgets did not differ on day 24 but by day 42 M plants had a significantly higher rate of photosynthesis than their NM counterparts when expressed on a whole shoot basis or unit dry weight basis. As both sets of plants were of the same size it was concluded that this greater C gain was the result of increased sink strength provided by the mycorrhizal fungus, By day 53 M plants had become larger than their uncolonized counterparts and a sink-induced stimulation in the rate of photosynthesis was no longer apparent. M plants had higher root sucrose, glucose and fructose pools from day 24, Analyses suggested that these sugars were utilized for trehalose and lipid synthesis, for the production of the large extramatrical mycelium and for the support of the respiratory demands of the M root system. Increased C allocation to roots of M plants was associated with a stimulation of the activities of cell wall and cytoplasmic invertases and of sucrose synthase in roots colonized by VA fungi, Such increases in enzyme activity may provide the mechanism enabling increased partitioning of carbohydrate both to the M root system and the fungal symbiont.

AB Poverty, food insecurity, climate change and biodiversity loss continue to persist as the primary environmental and social challenges faced by the global community. As such, there is a growing acknowledgement that conventional sectorial approaches to addressing often inter-connected social, environmental, economic and political challenges are proving insufficient. An alternative is to focus on integrated solutions at landscape scales or landscape approaches'. The appeal of landscape approaches has resulted in the production of a significant body of literature in recent decades, yet confusion over terminology, application and utility persists. Focusing on the tropics, we systematically reviewed the literature to: (i) disentangle the historical development and theory behind the framework of the landscape approach and how it has progressed into its current iteration, (ii) establish lessons learned from previous land management strategies, (iii) determine the barriers that currently restrict implementation of the landscape approach and (iv) provide recommendations for how the landscape approach can contribute towards the fulfilment of the goals of international policy processes. This review suggests that, despite some barriers to implementation, a landscape approach has considerable potential to meet social and environmental objectives at local scales while aiding national commitments to addressing ongoing global challenges.

AB AimThe influence of soil properties on photosynthetic traits in higher plants is poorly quantified in comparison with that of climate. We address this situation by quantifying the unique and joint contributions to global leaf-trait variation from soils and climate.
   LocationTerrestrial ecosystems world-wide.
   MethodsUsing a trait dataset comprising 1509 species from 288 sites, with climate and soil data derived from global datasets, we quantified the effects of 20 soil and 26 climate variables on light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(area)), stomatal conductance (g(s)), leaf nitrogen and phosphorus (N-area and P-area) and specific leaf area (SLA) using mixed regression models and multivariate analyses.
   ResultsSoil variables were stronger predictors of leaf traits than climatic variables, except for SLA. On average, N-area, P-area and A(area) increased and SLA decreased with increasing soil pH and with increasing site aridity. g(s) declined and P-area increased with soil available P (P-avail). N-area was unrelated to total soil N. Joint effects of soil and climate dominated over their unique effects on N-area and P-area, while unique effects of soils dominated for A(area) and g(s). Path analysis indicated that variation in A(area) reflected the combined independent influences of N-area and g(s), the former promoted by high pH and aridity and the latter by low P-avail.
   Main conclusionsThree environmental variables were key for explaining variation in leaf traits: soil pH and P-avail, and the climatic moisture index (the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration). Although the reliability of global soil datasets lags behind that of climate datasets, our results nonetheless provide compelling evidence that both can be jointly used in broad-scale analyses, and that effects uniquely attributable to soil properties are important determinants of leaf photosynthetic traits and rates. A significant future challenge is to better disentangle the covarying physiological, ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that underpin trait-environment relationships.

AB With an ecological-evolutionary perspective increasingly applied toward the conservation and management of endangered or exploited species, the genetic estimation of effective population size (N-e) has proliferated. Based on a comprehensive analysis of empirical literature from the past two decades, we asked: (i) how often do studies link N-e to the adult census population size (N)? (ii) To what extent is N-e correctly linked to N? (iii) How readily is uncertainty accounted for in both N-e and N when quantifying N-e/N ratios? and (iv) how frequently and to what degree might errors in the estimation of N-e or N affect inferences of N-e/N ratios? We found that only 20% of available N-e estimates (508 of 2617; 233 studies) explicitly attempted to link N-e and N; of these, only 31% (160 of 508) correctly linked N-e and N. Moreover, only 7% (41 of 508) of N-e/N ratios (correctly linked or not) reported confidence intervals for both N-e and N; for those cases where confidence intervals were reported for N-e only, 31% of N-e/N ratios overlapped with 1, of which more than half also reached below N-e/N = 0.01. Uncertainty in N-e/N ratios thus sometimes spanned at least two orders of magnitude. We conclude that the estimation of N-e/N ratios in natural populations could be significantly improved, discuss several options for doing so, and briefly outline some future research directions.

AB Marine sponges are able to process a variety of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and silicon (Si) dissolved compounds, in addition to the particulate C, N, and P obtained through regular feeding. While Si fluxes through sponges are exclusively related to the elaboration of their skeleton of biogenic silica, C, N, and P fluxes derive from a complex combination of metabolic processes that include feeding, respiration, egestion, excretion, as well as hosting of large microbial populations within the sponge body. Because of the remarkable abundance of sponges in many benthic marine communities, they have the potential to impact the availability of the compounds they take up and release, affecting the benthic-pelagic coupling and cycling rates of chemical elements that are crucial to determine growth of bacterioplankton and primary producers at the ecosystem level. Unfortunately, our knowledge and understanding of the magnitude of the sponge-meditated nutrient fluxes and their ecological implications depends much on the compound type (i.e. C, N, P, or Si). Herein, we review the available knowledge on the subject with emphasis on recent developments.

AB The present study was designed to study the process of stress adaptation in roots and shoot of Zea mays seedlings grown under hydroponic conditions during exposure to lead (Pb) (0-200 mu M) for 1-7 d. The alterations in growth and in the level of various biochemical parameters were accessed vis-a-vis Pb accumulation. The accumulation of Pb increased in a concentration-duration-dependent manner, however its translocation from root to shoot was low. At the same time, the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased with increasing Pb concentration. However, growth parameters, such as dry weight and root length did not show a significant decline to any of the Pb concentrations. In addition, the level of photosynthetic pigments decreased only upon exposure to high Pb concentrations. These results suggested an alleviation of the stress that was presumably being achieved by antioxidants viz., superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) as well as ascorbic acid (AsA), which increased linearly with increasing Pb levels and exposure time. However, the level of non-protein thiols (NP-SH) in roots, in general. showed a decline beyond 4 d that could be attributed to their consumption for the purpose of Pb detoxification. In conclusion, Zea mays can be used as an indicator species for Pb, and the various antioxidants might play a key role in the detoxification of Pb induced toxic effects. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Research and policies aimed at biodiversity conservation in agricultural ecosystems are often less successful than expected. One common assumption is that more research is needed to develop improved measures and indicators of biodiversity. The authors' opinion is that this is only partly true and that most of the problems arise from the lack of a well-focussed approach to this subject. Based on the knowledge available in the scientific literature, a methodological framework was developed which can help researchers and policy makers to think in a better, more structured way about issues related to biodiversity conservation in a given agroecosystem. In order to frame the importance of biodiversity in agroecosystems, three main questions were addressed through literature search: (1) What does biodiversity mean in natural and agricultural ecosystems? (2) How is the concept of functionality used in relation to biodiversity? (3) Which biodiversity measures are currently used to express agriculture-biodiversity relationships?
   Analysis of the literature resulted in a framework consisting of three steps. At first the objectives of biodiversity research and policies have to be defined. Three options can be foreseen here: (a) species, community, habitat or overall biodiversity conservation regardless of its functions, (b) biodiversity conservation to attain production and environmental protection services, and (c) use of bio-indicators for agroecosystem monitoring. In the second step the appropriate target elements for conservation have to be chosen based on an agrorecosystem approach, and in the third step adequate biodiversity measures of composition, structure and function have to be selected for each target element.
   Functional biodiversity is important in relation to the provision of specific agroecosystem services. The study of functional biodiversity should start with the definition of agroecosystem functional groups comprising all elements that interact with the desired service, and the consequent determination of the role of diversity within these functional groups for the fulfilment of the agroecosystem service. Therefore a more precise definition of functional biodiversity' would be "that part of the total biodiversity composed of clusters of elements (at the gene, species or habitat level)providing the same (agro)ecosystem service, that is driven by within-cluster diversity".

AB Question: Will the predicted climate changes affect species distribution in the Iberian Peninsula?
   Location: Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal).
   Methods: We modelled current and future tree distributions as a function of climate, using a computational framework that made use of one machine learning technique, the random forest (RF) algorithm. This algorithm provided good predictions of the current distribution of each species, as shown by the area under the corresponding receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Species turnover, richness and the change in distributions over time to 2080 under four Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) scenarios were calculated using the species map outputs.
   Results and Conclusions: The results show a notable reduction in the potential distribution of the studied species under all the IPCC scenarios, particularly so for mountain conifer species such as Pinus sylvestris, P. uncinata and Abies alba. Temperate species, especially Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea, were also predicted to suffer a reduction in their range; also submediterranean species, especially Q. pyrenaica, were predicted to undergo notable decline. In contrast, typically Mediterranean species appeared to be generally more capable of migration, and are therefore likely to be less affected.

AB Background and Aims In a leaf canopy, there is a turnover of leaves; i.e. they are produced, senesce and fall. These processes determine the amount of leaf area in the canopy, which in turn determines canopy photosynthesis. The turnover rate of leaves is affected by environmental factors and is different among species. This mini-review discusses factors responsible for leaf dynamics in plant canopies, focusing on the role of nitrogen.
   Scope Leaf production is supported by canopy photosynthesis that is determined by distribution of light and leaf nitrogen. Leaf nitrogen determines photosynthetic capacity. Nitrogen taken up from roots is allocated to new leaves. When leaves age or their light availability is lowered, part of the leaf nitrogen is resorbed. Resorbed nitrogen is re-utilized in new organs and the rest is lost with dead leaves. The sink-source balance is important in the regulation of leaf senescence. Several models have been proposed to predict response to environmental changes. A mathematical model that incorporated nitrogen use for photosynthesis explained well the variations in leaf lifespan within and between species.
   Conclusion When leaf turnover is at a steady state, the ratio of biomass production to nitrogen uptake is equal to the ratio of litter fall to nitrogen loss, which is an inverse of the nitrogen concentration in dead leaves. Thus nitrogen concentration in dead leaves (nitrogen resorption proficiency) and nitrogen availability in the soil determine the rate of photosynthesis in the canopy. Dynamics of leaves are regulated so as to maximize carbon gain and resource-use efficiency of the plant. (C) 2004 Annals of Botany Company.

AB Forests are frequently exposed to natural disturbances, which are likely to increase with global change, and may jeopardize the delivery of ecosystem services. Mixed-species forests have often been shown to be more productive than monocultures, but it is unclear whether this results from mixed stands being in part more resistant to various biotic and abiotic disturbance factors. This review investigates the relationships between tree diversity and stand resistance to natural disturbances and explores the ecological mechanisms behind the observed relationships.
   Mixed forests appear to be more resistant than monocultures to small mammalian herbivores, soil-borne fungal diseases and specialized insect herbivores. Admixing broadleaves to conifers also increases the resistance to fire and windstorms when compared to pure conifer stands. However, mixed forests may be more affected by drought depending on the species in the mixture.
   Overall, our findings suggest that mixed forests are more resistant to natural disturbances that are relatively small-scale and selective in their effect. However, benefits provided by mixtures are less evident for larger-scale disturbances. Higher tree diversity translates into increased resistance to disturbances as a result of ecological trait complementarity among species, reduction of fuel and food resources for herbivores, enhancement of diversion or disruption processes, and multi-trophic interactions such as predation or symbiosis.
   To promote resistance, the selection of tree species with different functional characteristics appears more important than increasing only the number of species in the stand. Trees with different levels of susceptibility to different hazards should be intermixed in order to reduce the amount of exposed resources and to generate barriers against contagion.
   However, more research is needed to further improve associational resistance in mixed forests, through a better understanding of the most relevant spatial and temporal scales of species interactions and to optimize the overall provision of ecosystem services.

AB In the past two decades, a large number of studies have investigated the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, most of which focussed on a limited set of ecosystem variables. The Jena Experiment was set up in 2002 to investigate the effects of plant diversity on element cycling and trophic interactions, using a multi-disciplinary approach. Here, we review the results of 15 years of research in the Jena Experiment, focussing on the effects of manipulating plant species richness and plant functional richness. With more than 85,000 measures taken from the plant diversity plots, the Jena Experiment has allowed answering fundamental questions important for functional biodiversity research.
   First, the question was how general the effect of plant species richness is, regarding the many different processes that take place in an ecosystem. About 45% of different types of ecosystem processes measured in the 'main experiment', where plant species richness ranged from 1 to 60 species, were significantly affected by plant species richness, providing strong support for the view that biodiversity is a significant driver of ecosystem functioning. Many measures were not saturating at the 60-species level, but increased linearly with the logarithm of species richness. There was, however, great variability in the strength of response among different processes. One striking pattern was that many processes, in particular belowground processes, took several years to respond to the manipulation of plant species richness, showing that biodiversity experiments have to be long-term, to distinguish trends from transitory patterns. In addition, the results from the Jena Experiment provide further evidence that diversity begets stability, for example stability against invasion of plant species, but unexpectedly some results also suggested the opposite, e.g. when plant communities experience severe perturbations or elevated resource availability. This highlights the need to revisit diversity-stability theory.
   Second, we explored whether individual plant species or individual plant functional groups, or biodiversity itself is more important for ecosystem functioning, in particular biomass production. We found strong effects of individual species and plant functional groups on biomass production, yet these effects mostly occurred in addition to, but not instead of, effects of plant species richness.
   Third, the Jena Experiment assessed the effect of diversity on multitrophic interactions. The diversity of most organisms responded positively to increases in plant species richness, and the effect was stronger for above-than for belowground organisms, and stronger for herbivores than for carnivores or detritivores. Thus, diversity begets diversity. In addition, the effect on organismic diversity was stronger than the effect on species abundances.
   Fourth, the Jena Experiment aimed to assess the effect of diversity on N, P and C cycling and the water balance of the plots, separating between element input into the ecosystem, element turnover, element stocks, and output from the ecosystem. While inputs were generally less affected by plant species richness, measures of element stocks, turnover and output were often positively affected by plant diversity, e.g. carbon storage strongly increased with increasing plant species richness. Variables of the N cycle responded less strongly to plant species richness than variables of the C cycle.
   Fifth, plant traits are often used to unravel mechanisms underlying the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship. In the Jena Experiment, most investigated plant traits, both above-and belowground, were plastic and trait expression depended on plant diversity in a complex way, suggesting limitation to using database traits for linking plant traits to particular functions.
   Sixth, plant diversity effects on ecosystem processes are often caused by plant diversity effects on species interactions. Analyses in the Jena Experiment including structural equation modelling suggest complex interactions that changed with diversity, e.g. soil carbon storage and greenhouse gas emission were affected by changes in the composition and activity of the belowground microbial community. Manipulation experiments, in which particular organisms, e.g. belowground invertebrates, were excluded from plots in split-plot experiments, supported the important role of the biotic component for element and water fluxes.
   Seventh, the Jena Experiment aimed to put the results into the context of agricultural practices in managed grasslands. The effect of increasing plant species richness from 1 to 16 species on plant biomass was, in absolute terms, as strong as the effect of a more intensive grassland management, using fertiliser and increasing mowing frequency. Potential bioenergy production from high-diversity plots was similar to that of conventionally used energy crops. These results suggest that diverse 'High Nature Value Grasslands' are multifunctional and can deliver a range of ecosystem services including production-related services.
   A final task was to assess the importance of potential artefacts in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, caused by the weeding of the plant community to maintain plant species composition. While the effort ( in hours) needed to weed a plot was often negatively related to plant species richness, species richness still affected the majority of ecosystem variables. Weeding also did not negatively affect monoculture performance; rather, monocultures deteriorated over time for a number of biological reasons, as shown in plant-soil feedback experiments.
   To summarize, the Jena Experiment has allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the functional role of biodiversity in an ecosystem. A main challenge for future biodiversity research is to increase our mechanistic understanding of why the magnitude of biodiversity effects differs among processes and contexts. It is likely that there will be no simple answer. For example, among the multitude of mechanisms suggested to underlie the positive plant species richness effect on biomass, some have received limited support in the Jena Experiment, such as vertical root niche partitioning. However, others could not be rejected in targeted analyses. Thus, from the current results in the Jena Experiment, it seems likely that the positive biodiversity effect results from several mechanisms acting simultaneously in more diverse communities, such as reduced pathogen attack, the presence of more plant growth promoting organisms, less seed limitation, and increased trait differences leading to complementarity in resource uptake. Distinguishing between different mechanisms requires careful testing of competing hypotheses. Biodiversity research has matured such that predictive approaches testing particular mechanisms are now possible. (C) 2017 The Authors.

FX We sincerely thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the Swiss
   National Science Foundation (SNF) for continuous financial support of
   the Jena Experiment (Research Units FOR 456 and FOR 1451). We also thank
   the Friedrich Schiller University Jena and the Max Planck Institute for

   and maintenance of the Jena Experiment. Further student grants were
   provided by a number of foundations and the joint International Max
   Planck Research School for Global Biogeochemical Cycles (IMPRS-gBGC). We
   also thank all our postdocs, Ph.D.-students and Diploma students whose
   published work is summarized here. This experiment would not have been
   possible without the help of our gardener's team, in particular Gerlinde
   Kratzsch, Steffen Eismann, Heike Scheffler, Katja Kunze, Silke
   Hengelhaupt, Sylvia Junghans, Ulrike Wehmeier, and Ute Kober. Further
   technical help was provided by Uta Gerighausen and Steffen Ferber. All
   student helpers and various ecological volunteers also contributed
   greatly to this experiment. Enrica Luca contributed plant cover data to
   illustrate the long-term changes in the plant community. Norma Nitschke
   summarized data on voles and Manfred Turke kindly illustrated the
   mechanisms underlying the positive biodiversity effect on plant biomass
   (Fig. 23). The first author, who was the 'speaker' of the Jena
   Experiment from 2002-2015, would particularly like to thank all people
   involved in the experiment for their contribution to the joint work.
   Scientists come in different shapes and sizes and agreeing on something
   is not always easy. It is a particular feature of the Jena Experiment
   that the group was, mostly, in high spirit so that cooperation was good
   and fruitful. The many joint publications are testimony to the team
   spirit. We also thank Klaus Hoevemeyer for carefully editing the paper.
   A final thank you goes to Jan Leps and two anonymous reviewers who took
   up the challenge to critically read previous versions of this
   manuscript. Their comments helped to improve the manuscript
   considerably.

AB Water stress is one of the primary selective forces in plant evolution. There are characters often cited as adaptations to water stress, but links between the function of these traits and adaptation to drying climates are tenuous. Here we combine distributional, climatic, and physiological evidence from 42 species of conifers to show that the evolution of drought resistance follows two distinct pathways, both involving the coordinated evolution of tissues regulating water supply (xylem) and water loss (stomatal pores) in leaves. Only species with very efficient stomatal closure, and hence low minimum rates of water loss, inhabit dry habitats, but species diverged in their apparent mechanism for maintaining closed stomata during drought. An ancestral mechanism found in Pinaceae and Araucariaceae species relies on high levels of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) to close stomata during water stress. A second mechanism, found in the majority of Cupressaceae species, uses leaf desiccation rather than high ABA levels to close stomata during sustained water stress. Species in the latter group were characterized by xylem tissues with extreme resistance to embolism but low levels of foliar ABA after 30 d without water. The combination of low levels of ABA under stress with cavitation-resistant xylem enables these species to prolong stomatal opening during drought, potentially extending their photosynthetic activity between rainfall events. Our data demonstrate a surprising simplicity in the way conifers evolved to cope with water shortage, indicating a critical interaction between xylem and stomatal tissues during the process of evolution to dry climates.

AB Evolutionary principles are now routinely incorporated into medicine and agriculture. Examples include the design of treatments that slow the evolution of resistance by weeds, pests, and pathogens, and the design of breeding programs that maximize crop yield or quality. Evolutionary principles are also increasingly incorporated into conservation biology, natural resource management, and environmental science. Examples include the protection of small and isolated populations from inbreeding depression, the identification of key traits involved in adaptation to climate change, the design of harvesting regimes that minimize unwanted life-history evolution, and the setting of conservation priorities based on populations, species, or communities that harbor the greatest evolutionary diversity and potential. The adoption of evolutionary principles has proceeded somewhat independently in these different fields, even though the underlying fundamental concepts are the same. We explore these fundamental concepts under four main themes: variation, selection, connectivity, and eco-evolutionary dynamics. Within each theme, we present several key evolutionary principles and illustrate their use in addressing applied problems. We hope that the resulting primer of evolutionary concepts and their practical utility helps to advance a unified multidisciplinary field of applied evolutionary biology.

AB Owing to habitat conversion and conflict with humans, many carnivores are of conservation concern. Because of their elusive nature, camera trapping is a standard tool for studying carnivores. In many vertebrates, sex-specific differences in movements - and therefore detection by cameras - are likely. We used camera trapping data and spatially explicit sex-specific capture-recapture models to estimate jaguar density in Emas National Park in the central Brazilian Cerrado grassland, an ecological hotspot of international importance. Our spatially explicit model considered differences in movements and trap encounter rate between genders and the location of camera traps (on/off road). We compared results with estimates from a sex-specific non-spatial capture-recapture model. The spatial model estimated a density of 0.29 jaguars 100 km(-2) and showed that males moved larger distances and had higher trap encounter rates than females. Encounter rates with off-road traps were one tenth of those for on-road traps. In the non-spatial model, males had a higher capture probability than females; density was estimated at 0.62 individuals 100 km(-2). The non-spatial model likely overestimated density because it did not adequately account for animal movements. The spatial model probably underestimated density because it assumed a uniform distribution of jaguars within and outside the reserve. Overall, the spatial model is preferable because it explicitly considers animal movements and allows incorporating site-specific and individual covariates. With both methods, jaguar density was lower than reported from most other study sites. For rare species such as grassland jaguars, spatially explicit capture-recapture models present an important advance for informed conservation planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Predictive vegetation modeling (PVM), is defined as predicting the distribution of vegetation across a landscape based on the relationship between the spatial distribution of vegetation and environmental variables. PVM requires digital maps of the environmental variables, as well as spatial information on the vegetation attribute of interest (e.g., species, type, abundance), usually from a sample of locations. Often these predictive models are developed using traditional statistical methods and are based on the implicit assumption that the distribution of vegetation is random and, therefore, each observation is independent. This approach violates one of the basic tenets of geography, the direct relationship between distance and likeness, as well as of ecological theory that elements of an ecosystem close to one another are more likely to be influenced by the same generating process and will therefore be similar. Some of the spatial structure can be explained by the predictor variables used in the model. Environmental variables such as precipitation, temperature and elevation exhibit spatial dependence, some of which is responsible for spatial clustering in vegetation distribution, but remaining spatial dependence can result from either unmeasured environmental variables or biotic processes that cause spatial clustering. Spatial dependence in biogeographical data has been recently identified as an important area of future PVM research, and many studies have begun to explore ways to incorporate spatial dependence in predictive models. Here we review the different approaches to incorporating spatial dependence into predictive vegetation models focusing on four statistical methods: autoregressive models, geostatistics, geographically weighted regression, and parameter estimation models. Autoregressive models may be more capable of describing the fine-scaled spatial dependence that results from local biotic factors, such as disturbance, competition, or dispersal, while geostatistical methods may be more suitable for modeling broad-scale spatial dependence. The other methods focus on global and local parameter estimation in the presence of spatially structured or nonstationary data. While this review focuses on incorporating spatial dependence into statistical models for predictive purposes, explicitly including spatial dependence in models can also aid in clarifying the effect of different explanatory variables, thereby improving inferences.

AB The social networks is one factor determining the flow of information within communities and as such may be important in determining successful implementation of community based management. We mapped the social network used for communication of knowledge and information related to natural resource extraction among villagers in a coastal seascape in Kenya. We further identified subgroups and examined their interrelations while measuring to what extent personal attributes such as occupation can explain observed group structure. Finally, we compared the local ecological knowledge held by villagers of different occupations with the structure of the communication network to map how well this structure can explain distribution of ecological knowledge among them. Results show that communication occurs primarily between fishermen who use the same gear type, which may inhibit exchange of ecological knowledge within the community. This may partly explain why the community has been unsuccessful in regulating resource extraction, especially since potentially influential groups of nonfishermen have a limited communication with the various fisher groups. Analysis of network structure also shows that groups most central, and hence potentially most influential, are dominated in numbers by migrant deep sea fishermen, hypothetically less motivated to initiate collective action for resource management. Hence, we conclude that a lack of collective action to remedy an unsustainable situation may be attributed to various different but distinct aspects of the specific structure of the social network.

AB The effect of the evolutionary rate of a gene on the accuracy of phylogeny reconstruction was examined by computer simulation. The evolutionary rate is measured by the tree length, that is, the expected total number of nucleotide substitutions per site on the phylogeny. DNA sequence data were simulated using both fixed trees with specified brand lengths and random trees with branch lengths generated from a model of cladogenesis. The parsimony and likelihood methods were used for phylogeny reconstruction and the proportion of correctly recovered branch partitions by each method was estimated. Phylogenetic methods including parsimony appear quite tolerant of multiple substitutions at the same site The optimum levels of sequence divergence were even higher than upper limits previously suggested for saturation of substitutions, indicating that the problem of saturation may have been exaggerated. Instead, the lack of information at low levels of divergence should be seriously considered in evaluation of a gene's phylogenetic utility, especially when the gene sequence is short. The performance of parsimony relative to that of likelihood, does not necessarily decrease with the increase of the evolutionary rate.

AB A Bayesian coalescent-based method has recently been proposed to delimit species using multilocus genetic sequence data. Posterior probabilities of different species delimitation models are calculated using reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The method accounts for species phylogenies and coalescent events in both extant and extinct species and accommodates lineage sorting and uncertainties in the gene trees. Although the method is theoretically appealing, its utility in practical data analysis is yet to be rigorously examined. In particular, the analysis may be sensitive to priors on ancestral population sizes and on species divergence times and to gene flow between species. Here we conduct a computer simulation to evaluate the statistical performance of the method, such as the false negatives (the error of lumping multiple species into one) and false positives (the error of splitting one species into several). We found that the correct species model was inferred with high posterior probability with only one or two loci when 5 or 10 sequences were sampled from each population, or with 50 loci when only one sequence was sampled. We also simulated data allowing migration under a two-species model, a mainland-island model and a stepping-stone model to assess the impact of gene flow (hybridization or introgression). The behavior of the method was diametrically different depending on the migration rate. Low rates at < 0.1 migrants per generation had virtually no effect, so that the method, while assuming no hybridization between species, identified distinct species despite small amounts of gene flow. This behavior appears to be consistent with biologists' practice. In contrast, higher migration rates at >= 10 migrants per generation caused the method to infer one species. At intermediate levels of migration, the method is indecisive. Our results suggest that Bayesian analysis under the multispecies coalescent model may provide important insights into population divergences, and may be useful for generating hypotheses of species delimitation, to be assessed with independent information from anatomical, behavioral, and ecological data.

AB The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of species geographical and environmental ranges on the predictive performances of species distribution models (SDMs). We explored the usefulness of ensemble modelling approaches and tested whether species attributes influenced the outcomes of such approaches. Eight SDMs were used to model the current distribution of 35 fish species at 1110 stream sections in France. We first quantified the consensus among the resulting set of predictions for each fish species. Next, we created an average model by taking the average of the individual model predictions and tested whether the average model improved the predictive performances of single SDMs. Lastly, we described the ranges of fish species along four gradients: latitudinal, thermal, stream gradient (i.e. upstream-downstream) and elevation. After accounting for the effects of phylogenetic relatedness and species prevalence, these four species attributes were related to the observed variations in both consensus among SDMs and predictive performances by using generalized estimation equations. Our results highlight the usefulness of ensemble approaches for identifying geographical areas of agreement among predictions. Although the geographical extent of species had no effect on the performances of SDMs, we demonstrated that more consensual and accurate predictions were obtained for species with low thermal and elevation ranges, validating the hypothesis that specialist species yield models with higher accuracy than generalist ones. We emphasized that significant improvements in the accuracy of SDMs can be achieved by using an average model. Furthermore, these improvements were higher for species with smaller ranges along the four gradients studied. The geographical extent and ranges of species along environmental gradients provide promising insights into our understanding of uncertainties in species distribution modelling.

AB Planning, implementing, and managing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) requires that attention be paid not only to the biological and oceanographic issues that influence the performance of the MPA, but equally to the human dimensions: social, economic, and institutional considerations that can dramatically affect the outcome of MPA implementation. This paper explores ten human dimensions that are basic to the acceptance and ultimate success of MPAs: objectives and attitudes, "entry points" for introducing MPAs, attachment to place, meaningful participation, effective governance, the "people side" of knowledge, the role of rights, concerns about displacement, MPA costs and benefits, and the bigger picture around MPAs. These people-orientated factors and their impact on the success and effectiveness of MPAs are examined in relation to experiences with MPAs globally, and in relation to two Canadian examples specifically, one coastal (Eastport, Newfoundland) and the other offshore ( the Gully, Nova Scotia).

AB Microsatellite variability is widely used to infer levels of genetic diversity in natural populations. However, the ascertainment bias caused by typically selecting only the most polymorphic markers in the genome may lead to reduced sensitivity for judging genome-wide levels of genetic diversity. To test this potential limitation of microsatellite-based approaches, we assessed the degree of nucleotide diversity in noncoding regions of eight different carnivore populations, including inbred as well as outbred populations, by sequencing 10 introns (5.4-5.7 kb) in 20 individuals of each population (wolves, coyotes, wolverines and lynxes). Estimates of nucleotide diversity varied 30-fold (7.1 x 10(-5)-2.1 x 10(-3)), with densities of one single nucleotide polymorphism every 112-5446 bp. Microsatellite genotyping (10-27 markers) of the same animals revealed mean multilocus heterozygosities of 0.54-0.78, a 1.4-fold difference among populations. There was a positive yet not perfect (r(2) = 0.70) correlation between microsatellite marker heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity at the population level. For example, point estimates of nucleotide diversity varied in some cases with an order of magnitude despite very similar levels of microsatellite marker heterozygosity. Moreover, at the individual level, no significant correlation was found. Our results imply that variability at microsatellite marker sets typically used in population studies may not accurately reflect the underlying genomic diversity. This suggests that researchers should consider using resequencing-based approaches for assessing genetic diversity when accurate inference is critical, as in many conservation and management contexts.

AB Worldwide degradation of coral reef communities has prompted a surge in restoration efforts. They proceed largely without considering genetic factors because traditionally, coral populations have been regarded as open over large areas with little potential for local adaptation. Since, biophysical and molecular studies indicated that most populations are closed over shorter time and smaller spatial scales. Thus, it is justified to re-examine the potential for site adaptation in corals. There is ample evidence for differentiated populations, inbreeding, asexual reproduction and the occurrence of ecotypes, factors that may facilitate local adaptation. Discovery of widespread local adaptation would influence coral restoration projects mainly with regard to the physical and evolutionary distance from the source wild and/or captive bred propagules may be moved without causing a loss of fitness in the restored population. Proposed causes for loss of fitness as a result of (plant) restoration efforts include founder effects, genetic swamping, inbreeding and/or outbreeding depression. Direct evidence for any of these processes is scarce in reef corals due to a lack of model species that allow for testing over multiple generations and the separation of the relative contributions of algal symbionts and their coral hosts to the overall performance of the coral colony. This gap in our knowledge may be closed by employing novel population genetic and genomics approaches. The use of molecular tools may aid managers in the selection of appropriate propagule sources, guide spatial arrangement of transplants, and help in assessing the success of coral restoration projects by tracking the performance of transplants, thereby generating important data for future coral reef conservation and restoration projects.

AB Rapid anthropogenic climate change is already affecting species distributions and ecosystem functioning worldwide. We applied niche-based models to analyse the impact of climate change on tree species and functional diversity in Europe. Present-day climate was used to predict the distributions of 122 tree species from different functional types (FT). We then explored projections of future distributions under one climate scenario for 2080, considering two alternative dispersal assumptions: no dispersal and unlimited dispersal. The species-rich broadleaved deciduous group appeared to play a key role in the future of different European regions. Temperate areas were projected to lose both species richness and functional diversity due to the loss of broadleaved deciduous trees. These were projected to migrate to boreal forests, thereby increasing their species richness and functional diversity. Atlantic areas provided an intermediate case, with a predicted reduction in the numbers of species and occasional predicted gains in functional diversity. This resulted from a loss in species within the broadleaved deciduous FT, but overall maintenance of the group. Our results illustrate the fact that both species-specific predictions and functional patterns should be examined separately in order to assess the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and gain insights into future ecosystem functioning.

AB Invasions of fresh water by marine organisms have been of great interest to evolutionary biologists and paleontologists because they typically constitute major evolutionary transitions. Recent (< 200 years) invasions of fresh water by brackish or marine species offer an opportunity to understand mechanisms underlying these events, but pathways of invasion from salt water have not been confirmed using genetic data. This study employed mitochondrial DNA sequences (652 base pairs from the cytochrome oxidase I(COI) gene) to reconstruct the geographic and evolutionary history of freshwater invasion by the common estuarine and saltmarsh crustacean Eurytemora affinis (Copepoda; Poppe 1880). Phylogenetic analysis of populations from North America, Europe, and Asia revealed at least eight independent invasions of fresh water from genetically distinct lineages. At least five of these freshwater invasions most likely arose independently in different river drainages, recently from saltwater sources within each river drainage. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed at three geographic scales (among continents, among drainages, and within drainages) to assess the hierarchical distribution of genetic variance. Results indicated that 52% of the genetic variance was explained by differences among drainages, 43% by differences among continents, but only 5% by differences within drainages, thus supporting geographic patterns of invasions inferred from the phylogeny. Physiological experiments were performed to determine whether adults and larvae from saltwater populations could tolerate freshwater conditions. Transfer to zero salinity resulted in high mortalities, bur with some survival to the second generation in one population. This study provides genetic evidence and physiological support for rapid transitions from a saline life history into fresh water, with repeated invasions on a global scale.

AB Correlative species distribution models are frequently used to predict species' range shifts under climate change. However, climate variables often show high collinearity and most statistical approaches require the selection of one among strongly correlated variables. When causal relationships between species presence and climate parameters are unknown, variable selection is often arbitrary, or based on predictive performance under current conditions. While this should only marginally affect current range predictions, future distributions may vary considerably when climate parameters do not change in concert. We investigated this source of uncertainty using four highly correlated climate variables together with a constant set of landscape variables in order to predict current (2010) and future (2050) distributions of four mountain bird species in central Europe. Simulating different parameterization decisions, we generated a) four models including each of the climate variables singly, b) a model taking advantage of all variables simultaneously and c) an un-weighted average of the predictions of a). We compared model accuracy under current conditions, predicted distributions under four scenarios of climate change, and - for one species - evaluated back-projections using historical occurrence data. Although current and future variable-correlations remained constant, and the models' accuracy under contemporary conditions did not differ, future range predictions varied considerably in all climate change scenarios. Averaged models and models containing all climate variables simultaneously produced intermediate predictions; the latter, however, performed best in back-projections. This pattern, consistent across different modelling methods, indicates a benefit from including multiple climate predictors in ambiguous situations. Variable selection proved to be an important source of uncertainty for future range predictions, difficult to control using contemporary information. Small, but diverging changes of climate variables, masked by constant overall correlation patterns, can cause substantial differences between future range predictions which need to be accounted for, particularly when outcomes are intended for conservation decisions.

AB Predicting the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change requires a variety of approaches, including the use of experiments, models, and surveys. Among experiments, mesocosms have become increasingly popular because they provide an important bridge between smaller, more tightly controlled, microcosm experiments (which can suffer from limited realism) and the greater biological complexity of natural systems (in which mechanistic relationships often cannot be identified). A new evaluation of the contribution of the mesocosm approach, its potential for future research, as well as its limitations, is timely. As part of this review, we constructed a new database of over 250 post-1990 studies that have explored different components of climate change across a range of organisational levels, scales, and habitats. Issues related to realism, reproducibility and control are assessed in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial systems. Some general patterns emerged, particularly at the ecosystem level, such as consistent and predictable effects on whole-system respiration rates. There are, however, also many seemingly idiosyncratic, contingent responses, especially at the community level, both within and among habitat types. These similarities and differences in both the drivers and responses highlight the need for caution before making generalisations. Finally, we assess future directions and prospects for new methodological advances and the need for greater international coordination and interdisciplinarity.

AB Species distribution modeling (SDM: statistical and/or mechanistic approaches to the assessment of range determinants and prediction of species occurrence) offers new possibilities for estimating and studying past organism distributions. SDM complements fossil and genetic evidence by providing (i) quantitative and potentially high-resolution predictions of the past organism distributions, (ii) statistically formulated, testable ecological hypotheses regarding past distributions and communities, and (iii) statistical assessment of range determinants. In this article, we provide an overview of applications of SDM to paleobiology, outlining the methodology, reviewing SDM-based studies to paleobiology or at the interface of paleo- and neobiology, discussing assumptions and uncertainties as well as how to handle them, and providing a synthesis and outlook. Key methodological issues for SDM applications to paleobiology include predictor variables (types and properties: special emphasis is given to paleoclimate), model validation (particularly important given the emphasis on cross-temporal predictions in paleobiological applications), and the integration of SDM and genetics approaches. Over the last few years the number of studies using SDM to address paleobiology-related questions has increased considerably. While some of these studies only use SDM (23%), most combine them with genetically inferred patterns (49%), paleoecological records (22%), or both (6%). A large number of SDM-based studies have addressed the role of Pleistocene glacial refugia in biogeography and evolution, especially in Europe, but also in many other regions. SDM-based approaches are also beginning to contribute to a suite of other research questions, such as historical constraints on current distributions and diversity patterns, the end-Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions, past community assembly, human paleobiogeography, Holocene paleoecology, and even deep-time biogeography (notably, providing insights into biogeographic dynamics > 400 million years ago). We discuss important assumptions and uncertainties that affect the SDM approach to paleobiology - the equilibrium postulate, niche stability, changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations - as well as ways to address these (ensemble, functional SDM, and non-SDM ecoinformatics approaches). We conclude that the SDM approach offers important opportunities for advances in paleobiology by providing a quantitative ecological perspective, and hereby also offers the potential for an enhanced contribution of paleobiology to ecology and conservation biology, e.g., for estimating climate change impacts and for informing ecological restoration.

AB New Zealand has long been a conundrum to biogeographers, possessing as it does geophysical and biotic features characteristic of both an island and a continent. This schism is reflected in provocative debate among dispersalist, vicariance biogeographic and panbiogeographic schools. A strong history in biogeography has spawned many hypotheses, which have begun to be addressed by a flood of molecular analyses. The time is now ripe to synthesize these findings on a background of geological and ecological knowledge. It has become increasingly apparent that most of the biota of New Zealand has links with other southern lands (particularly Australia) that are much more recent than the breakup of Gondwana. A compilation of molecular phylogenetic analyses of ca 100 plant and animal groups reveals that only 10% of these are even plausibly of archaic origin dating to the vicariant splitting of Zealandia from Gondwana. Effects of lineage extinction and lack of good calibrations in many cases strongly suggest that the actual proportion is even lower, in keeping with extensive Oligocene inundation of Zealandia. A wide compilation of papers covering phylogeographic structuring of terrestrial, freshwater and marine species shows some patterns emerging. These include: east-west splits across the Southern Alps, east-west splits across North Island, north-south splits across South Island, star phylogenies of southern mountain isolates, spread from northern, central and southern areas of high endemism, and recent recolonization (postvolcanic and anthropogenic). Excepting the last of these, most of these patterns seem to date to late Pliocene, coinciding with the rapid uplift of the Southern Alps. The diversity of New Zealand geological processes (sinking, uplift, tilting, sea level change, erosion, volcanism, glaciation) has produced numerous patterns, making generalizations difficult. Many species maintain pre-Pleistocene lineages, with phylogeographic structuring more similar to the Mediterranean region than northern Europe. This structure reflects the fact that glaciation was far from ubiquitous, despite the topography. Intriguingly, then, origins of the flora and fauna are island-like, whereas phylogeographic structure often reflects continental geological processes.

AB Rafting of marine and terrestrial organisms has important ecological, biogeographical and evolutionary implications. Herein the general principles of rafting are described and how they contribute to population connectivity. Rafting dispersal has particular characteristics, which may differ substantially from those of species with planktonic larval dispersal. Dispersal distances achieved via rafting can vary considerably: journeys may be very short or in some cases extremely long, depending on currents and wind. Accumulation of rafts in convergence zones facilitates cohesion of travelling groups, possibly reducing the risk of founder populations being very small. This becomes particularly important over long distances where singular founder events could provoke strong reduction of the genetic variability in the founded population. The frequency of transport affects the degree of connectivity between local populations. Three important rafting routes are distinguished: frequent, intermittent and episodic. Frequent rafting routes are found in bays, lagoons and estuaries, and they are typically facilitated by substrata of biotic origin (seagrass, saltmarsh vegetation, intermediate-sized algae and mangroves). Intermittent rafting routes are found along temperate continental shores where they are facilitated primarily by giant kelps. In the subtropics and the Arctic intermittent rafting routes facilitated by wood are particularly important. Episodic rafting routes, which often cross vast areas of open ocean (biogeographic barriers), are facilitated by volcanic pumice, floating trees and occasionally by giant kelps when these are pushed beyond intermittent routes by strong winds or currents. Dispersal events occur in a highly sporadic manner in this latter category of rafting route, but when they happen, large amounts of floating substrata and rafters may be dispersed simultaneously. Intervals between events can be decades, centuries or even millennia, and consequently populations resulting from these events may be isolated from each other for long time periods. Population connectivity on frequent, intermittent and episodic rafting routes is high, intermediate and low, respectively. Genetic studies support these predictions, and furthermore underline that rafting may contribute to population connectivity over a wide range of geographic scales, from < 100 km up to > 5000 km. Rafting also has a strong effect on evolutionary processes of the organisms dispersed by this means. It is suggested that local recruitment (consequence of direct development) contributes to enhanced rates of population divergence among local populations of common rafters, but occasionally high genetic diversity may result from secondary admixture. Isolation of colonisers after singular episodic rafting events facilitates allopatric speciation. Through these processes rafting dispersal may support local species richness and thus have an influence on local biogeography and biodiversity. Human activities affect rafting connections in the oceans either by reducing or enhancing the possibility of transport and landfall. In many cases it cannot be safely decided whether the appearance of a species in a new habitat is due to rafting or to other transport mechanisms, and genetic studies can help to identify the most likely causes.
   Future field and laboratory studies on the ecology of potential rafters in combination with genetic studies on different spatial and temporal scales will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of rafting dispersal, consideration of wich is crucial in developing efficient conservation measures in the marine environment.

AB Most habitat maps are presented as if they were a certain fact, with no indication of uncertainties. In many cases, researchers faced with the task of constructing such maps are aware of problems with the modelling data and of decisions that they make within the modelling process that are likely to affect the output, but they find it difficult to quantify this information. In some cases they attempt to evaluate the modelled predictions against independent data, but the summary statistics have no spatial component and do not address errors in the predictions. It is proposed that maps of uncertainty would help in the interpretation of these summaries, and to emphasize patterns in uncertainty such as spatial clustering or links with particular covariates. This paper reviews the aspects of uncertainty that are relevant to habitat maps developed with logistic regression, and suggests methods for investigating and communicating these uncertainties. It addresses the problems of subjective judgement, model uncertainty and vague concepts along with the more commonly considered uncertainties of random and systematic error. Methods for developing realistic confidence intervals are presented along with suggestions on how to visualize the information for use by decision-makers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB We suggest that damaging mating tactics, such as physical aggression, the evolution of genital barbs and spines, and the transfer of seminal toxins may serve as a general means by which males can induce females to avoid or to delay remating. Provided that cumulative damage has an accelerating impact on fitness, a female who has already been harmed by previous partner(s) may do best to refrain from remating to avoid suffering still further damage. Consequently, a male can gain through the imposition of mating costs, even though this may reduce female fitness because by doing so he minimizes the chances that his mate will copulate again. We develop a game theoretical model of this possibility, focusing on toxin transfer as an illustrative example. We show that toxicity as a means of inhibiting remating is phenotypically stable over a broad range of conditions (although, under some circumstances, it may be necessary to invoke other selective pressures to account for the initial evolution of toxicity). The model predicts that toxin transfer should be more common (and involve greater levels of toxicity) in species with greater last-male mating advantage; it is also most likely where the poison inflicts strongly accelerating, dose-dependent costs on females.

AB Phylogenetic reconstruction is a fast-growing field that is enriched by different statistical approaches and by findings and applications in a broad range of biological areas. Fundamental to these are the mathematical models used to describe the patterns of DNA base substitution and amino acid replacement. These may become some of the basic models for comparative genome research. We discuss these models, including the analysis of observed DNA base and amino acid mutation patterns, the concept of site heterogeneity, and the incorporation of structural biology data, all of which have become particularly important in recent years. We also describe the use of such models in phylogenetic reconstruction and statistical methods for the comparison of different models.

AB Subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) in symbiosis with Glomus mosseae (Nicol. & Gerd.) Gerdemann & Trappe was grown in compartmented pots. Side compartments were filled with soil where recently added (1 wk) radio-labelled cadmium (Cd) at three levels of non-labelled Cd could be accessed by either roots or arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphae. All treatments were replicated with non-mycorrhizal plants. After a growth period of 52 d roots and shoots were analysed for Cd-109, and lengths of roots and hyphae in respective labelled compartments determined. Cadmium uptake by roots was not significantly influenced by the mycorrhizal status of the plant. Uptake of Cd from hyphal compartments was higher in mycorrhizal than in non-mycorrhizal plants, corresponding to 96, 127 and 131% of that in non-mycorrhizal plants when 1, 10 and 100 mg Cd kg(-1) was added, respectively. A large proportion of the increased Cd content of mycorrhizal plants was sequestered in the roots. It is concluded that extraradical hyphae of AM fungi can transport Cd from soil to plants, but that transfer from fungus to plant is restricted due to fungal immobilization. No reduction of hyphal growth into soil with up to 20 mg extractable Cd kg(-1) was observed.

AB A simple 'big leaf' ecosystem gas exchange model was developed, using eddy covariance data collected at an undisturbed tropical rainforest in south-western Amazonia (Brazil), The model used mechanistic equations of canopy biochemistry combined with an empirical stomatal model describing responses to light, temperature and humidity, After calibration, the model was driven using hourly data from a weather station at the top of the tower at the measurement site, yielding an estimate of gross primary productivity (annual photosynthesis) in 1992/1993 of about 200 mol C m(-2) year(-1). Although incoming photon flux density emerged as the major control on photosynthesis in this forest, at a given PAR CO2 assimilation rates were higher in the mornings than in the afternoons, This was attributable to stomatal closure in the afternoon in response to increasing canopy-to-air vapour pressure differences, Although most morning gas exchange was clearly limited by the rate of electron transport, afternoon gas exchange was generally observed to be very nearly co-limited by both Rubisco activity (V-max) and electron transport rate, The sensitivity of the model to changes in nitrogen allocation showed that the modelled ratio of V-max to electron transport (J(max)) served nearly to maximize the annual carbon gain, and indeed, would have resulted in almost maximum annual carbon gain at the pre-industrial revolution atmospheric CO2 concentration of 27 Pa, Modelled gross primary productivity (GPP) was somewhat lower at 27 Pa, being about 160 mol C m(-2) year(-1), The model suggests that, in the absence of any negative feedbacks on GPP, future higher concentrations of atmospheric CO2 win continue to increase the GPP of this rainforest, up to about 230 mol C m(-2) year(-1) at 70 Pa.

AB 1. During the last decade, there has been a proliferation of statistical methods for studying resource selection by animals. While statistical techniques are advancing at a fast pace, there is confusion in the conceptual understanding of the meaning of various quantities that these statistical techniques provide.
   Terms such as selection, choice, use, occupancy and preference often are employed as if they are synonymous. Many practitioners are unclear about the distinctions between different concepts such as probability of selection,' probability of use,' choice probabilities' and probability of occupancy'.
   Similarly, practitioners are not always clear about the differences between and relevance of relative probability of selection' vs. probability of selection' to effective management.
   Practitioners also are unaware that they are using only a single statistical model for modelling resource selection, namely the exponential probability of selection, when other models might be more appropriate. Currently, such multimodel inference is lacking in the resource selection literature.
   In this paper, we attempt to clarify the concepts and terminology used in animal resource studies by illustrating the relationships among these various concepts and providing their statistical underpinnings.

AB Alterations to the natural flow regime affect the structure and function of rivers and wetlands and contribute to loss of biodiversity worldwide. Although the effects of flow regulation have been relatively well studied, a lack of synthesis of the ecological consequences of low flows and droughts impedes research progress and our grasp of the mechanistic effects of human-induced water reductions on riverine ecosystems. We identified 6 ecologically relevant hydrological attributes of low flow (antecedent conditions, duration, magnitude, timing and seasonality, rate of change, and frequency) that act within the temporal hierarchy of the flow regime and a spatial context. We synthesized the literature to propose 4 principles that outline the mechanistic links between these low-flow attributes and the processes and patterns within riverine ecosystems. First, low flows control the extent of physical aquatic habitat, thereby affecting the composition of biota, trophic structure, and carrying capacity. Second, low flows mediate changes in habitat conditions and water quality, which in turn, drive patterns of distribution and recruitment of biota. Third, low flows affect sources and exchange of material and energy in riverine ecosystems, thereby affecting ecosystem production and biotic composition. Last, low flows restrict connectivity and diversity of habitat, thereby increasing the importance of refugia and driving multiscale patterns in biotic diversity. These principles do not operate in isolation, and many of the ecological pathways that are affected by low flows are likely to overlap or occur simultaneously, potentially resulting in synergistic and complex effects. Last, we outlined major human-induced threats to low-flow hydrology and how they act upon the ecologically relevant hydrological attributes of low flow to affect potential changes in riverine ecosystem integrity. The mechanistic links described in this synthesis can be used to develop and test hypotheses of low-flow hydrological ecological response relationships in a cause effect framework that will have value for both research and river flow management. Continued experimental research and ongoing consolidation of ecological information will improve our understanding and ability to predict consequences of low-flow alteration on river, floodplain, and estuarine ecosystems.

AB Wild populations face threats both from deterministic factors, e.g., habitat loss, overexploitation, pollution, and introduced species, and from stochastic events of a demographic, genetic, and environmental nature, including catastrophes. Inbreeding reduces reproductive fitness in naturally outbreeding species, but its role in extinctions of wild populations is controversial. To evaluate critically the role of inbreeding in extinction, we conducted realistic population viability analyses of 20 threatened species, with and without inbreeding depression, using initial population sizes of 50, 250, and 1000. Inbreeding markedly decreased median times to extinction by 28.5, 30.5, and 25% for initial populations of 50, 250, and 1000, respectively, and the impacts were similar across major taxa. The major variable explaining differences among species was initial population growth rate, whereas the impact of inbreeding was least in species with negative growth rates. These results demonstrate that the prospects for survival of threatened species will usually be seriously overestimated if genetic factors are disregarded, and that inappropriate recovery plans may be instituted if inbreeding depression is ignored.

AB Immigrants to habitats occupied by conspecific organisms are usually expected to be competitively inferior, because residents may be locally adapted. If residents are inbred, however, mating between immigrants and residents results in offspring that may enjoy a fitness advantage from hybrid vigor. We demonstrate this effect experimentally in a natural Daphnia metapopulation in which genetic bottlenecks and local inbreeding are common. We estimate that in this metapopulation, hybrid vigor amplifies the rate of gene flow several times more than would be predicted from the nominal migration rate. This can affect the persistence of local populations and the entire metapopulation.

AB Predictions on the consequences of the rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 levels and associated climate warming for population dynamics, ecological community structure and ecosystem functioning depend on mechanistic energetic models of temperature effects on populations and their interactions. However, such mechanistic approaches combining warming effects on metabolic (energy loss of organisms) and feeding rates (energy gain by organisms) remain a key, yet elusive, goal. Aiming to fill this void, we studied the metabolic rates and functional responses of three differently sized, predatory ground beetles on one mobile and one more resident prey species across a temperature gradient (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C). Synthesizing metabolic and functional-response theory, we develop novel mechanistic predictions how predator-prey interaction strengths (i.e., functional responses) should respond to warming. Corroborating prior theory, warming caused strong increases in metabolism and decreases in handling time. Consistent with our novel model, we found increases in predator attack rates on a mobile prey, whereas attack rates on a mostly resident prey remained constant across the temperature gradient. Together, these results provide critically important information that environmental warming generally increases the direct short-term per capita interaction strengths between predators and their prey as described by functional-response models. Nevertheless, the several fold stronger increase in metabolism with warming caused decreases in energetic efficiencies (ratio of per capita feeding rate to metabolic rate) for all predator-prey interactions. This implies that warming of natural ecosystems may dampen predator-prey oscillations thus stabilizing their dynamics. The severe long-term implications; however, include predator starvation due to energetic inefficiency despite abundant resources.

AB The aim of this investigation was to measure the relative contribution of hyphae and roots to the total uptake of phosphorus by mycorrhizal plants. Cucumber plants were grown in three-compartment systems where P-32 was applied to a lateral root-free compartment (HC) and P-33 applied to an identical lateral compartment with both roots and hyphae (RHC). The cucumber seeds were sown into the main root compartment (RC) which was inoculated with one of the following three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi: Scutellospora calospora (Nicol. & Gerd.) Walker & Sanders [isolate WUM 12(2)]; Glomus sp. [isolate WUM 10(1)]; Glomus caledonium (Nicol. & Gerd.) Trappe & Gerdemann (isolate RIS 42) or left uninoculated to represent a control treatment. The plants were harvested at 17 and 27 d. The hyphal uptake of P-32 from the HC increased as follows - S. calospora < Glomus sp. < G. caledonium. The uptake of P-32 from the HC was equivalent to 7, 21 and 109% of the uptake of P-33 from the RHC in plants colonized by S. calospora, Glomus sp. and G. caledonium, respectively. This indicates that the relative contribution of the roots in total P uptake varied greatly between the three mycorrhizal treatments. Although P-33 uptake was variable within treatments, the P uptake systems of roots colonized by G. caledonium appeared to be inactive when compared to hyphal P-32 uptake. This may have been due to feedback mechanisms being activated because of the high hyphal P uptake. The roots colonized by S. calospora had higher rates of root-P uptake compared with the control roots, suggesting that the root-P uptake systems have been stimulated by the presence of the fungus. This would ensure that the P supply was sufficient to maintain photosynthesis in this symbiosis where the fungus gives only little P in return for its use of plant carbon substrate from the host.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) constitute the most common class of models across ecology, evolution and conservation. The advent of ready-to-use software packages and increasing availability of digital geoinformation have considerably assisted the application of SDMs in the past decade, greatly enabling their broader use for informing conservation and management, and for quantifying impacts from global change. However, models must be fit for purpose, with all important aspects of their development and applications properly considered. Despite the widespread use of SDMs, standardisation and documentation of modelling protocols remain limited, which makes it hard to assess whether development steps are appropriate for end use. To address these issues, we propose a standard protocol for reporting SDMs, with an emphasis on describing how a study's objective is achieved through a series of modeling decisions. We call this the ODMAP (Overview, Data, Model, Assessment and Prediction) protocol, as its components reflect the main steps involved in building SDMs and other empirically-based biodiversity models. The ODMAP protocol serves two main purposes. First, it provides a checklist for authors, detailing key steps for model building and analyses, and thus represents a quick guide and generic workflow for modern SDMs. Second, it introduces a structured format for documenting and communicating the models, ensuring transparency and reproducibility, facilitating peer review and expert evaluation of model quality, as well as meta-analyses. We detail all elements of ODMAP, and explain how it can be used for different model objectives and applications, and how it complements efforts to store associated metadata and define modelling standards. We illustrate its utility by revisiting nine previously published case studies, and provide an interactive web-based application to facilitate its use. We plan to advance ODMAP by encouraging its further refinement and adoption by the scientific community.

AB 1. Knowing how many individuals are in a wildlife population allows informed management decisions to be made. Ecologists are increasingly using technologies, such as remotely piloted aircraft (RPA; commonly known as "drones," unmanned aerial systems or unmanned aerial vehicles), for wildlife monitoring applications. Although RPA are widely touted as a cost-effective way to collect high-quality wildlife population data, the validity of these claims is unclear.
   2. Using life-sized, replica seabird colonies containing a known number of fake birds, we assessed the accuracy of RPA-facilitated wildlife population monitoring compared to the traditional ground-based counting method. The task for both approaches was to count the number of fake birds in each of 10 replica seabird colonies.
   3. We show that RPA-derived data are, on average, between 43% and 96% more accurate than the traditional ground-based data collection method. We also demonstrate that counts from this remotely sensed imagery can be semi-automated with a high degree of accuracy.
   4. The increased accuracy and increased precision of RPA-derived wildlife monitoring data provides greater statistical power to detect fine-scale population fluctuations allowing for more informed and proactive ecological management.

AB Since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, ecosystem service science has made much progress in framing core concepts and approaches, but there is still debate around the notion of cultural services, and a growing consensus that ecosystem use and ecosystem service use should be clearly differentiated. Part of the debate resides in the fact that the most significant sources of conflict around natural resource management arise from the multiple managements (uses) of ecosystems, rather than from the multiple uses of ecosystem services.
   If the ecosystem approach or the ecosystem service paradigm are to be implemented at national levels, there is an urgent need to disentangle what are often semantic issues, revise the notion of cultural services, and more broadly, practically define the less tangible ecosystem services on which we depend. This is a critical step to identifying suitable ways to manage trade-offs and promote adaptive management.
   Here we briefly review the problems associated with defining and quantifying cultural ecosystem services and suggest there could be merit in discarding this term for the simpler non-material ecosystem services. We also discuss the challenges in valuing the invaluable, and suggest that if we are to keep ecosystem service definition focused on the beneficiary, we need to further classify these challenging services, for example by differentiating services to individuals from services to communities. Also, we suggest that focussing on ecosystem service change rather than simply service delivery, and identifying common boundaries relevant for both people and ecosystems, would help meet some of these challenges.

AB Ecology is often said to lack general theories sufficiently predictive for applications. Here, we examine the concept of a periodic table of niches and feasibility of niche classification schemes from functional trait and performance data. Niche differences and their influence on ecological patterns and processes could be revealed effectively by first performing data reduction/ordination analyses separately on matrices of trait and performance data compiled according to logical associations with five basic niche dimensions', or aspects: habitat, life history, trophic, defence and metabolic. Resultant patterns then are integrated to produce interpretable niche gradients, ordinations and classifications. Degree of scheme periodicity would depend on degrees of niche conservatism and convergence causing species clustering across multiple niche dimensions. We analysed a sample data set containing trait and performance data to contrast two approaches for producing niche schemes: species ordination within niche gradient space, and niche categorisation according to trait-value thresholds. Creation of niche schemes useful for advancing ecological knowledge and its applications will depend on research that produces functional trait and performance datasets directly related to niche dimensions along with criteria for data standardisation and quality. As larger databases are compiled, opportunities will emerge to explore new methods for data reduction, ordination and classification.

AB Camera-traps are a widely applied to monitor wildlife populations. For individually marked species, capture-recapture models provide robust population estimates, but for unmarked species, inference is often based on relative abundance indices (RAI, number of records per trap effort), although these do not account for imperfect and variable detection. We use a simulation study and empirical camera-trapping data to illustrate how ecological and sampling-related factors can bias RAIs. Our simulations showed that (1) differences in detection between species led to bias in RAT ratios toward the more detectable species, especially at low detection levels, (2) species with larger home ranges were photographed more often, inflating RAIs, (3) species specific responses to different types of trap setup biased RAT ratios, and (4) changes in detection over time blurred true population trends inferred from RAIs. Empirical data for leopard cats Prionailurus bengalensis and common palm civets Paradoxurus hermaphroditus showed that traps set up along roads led to higher RAIs than off-road traps, but targeting roads increased detection more for leopard cats than for common palm civets. Comparing RAIs of Sunda clouded leopards Neofelis diardi and leopard cats with spatial capture-recapture based density estimates across sites, RAIs did not reflect differences in density. Analytical options for estimating density from camera-trapping data of unmarked populations are limited. Consequently, we fear that RAIs will continue to be applied. This is alarming, since these measures often form the basis for conservation and management decisions. We suggest considering alternative analytical and survey methods, especially when dealing with threatened species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Researchers from a number of disciplines have long sought the ability to estimate the functional attributes of plant canopies, such as photosynthetic capacity, using remotely sensed data. To date, however, this goal has not been fully realized. In this study, fresh-leaf reflectance spectroscopy (lambda=450-2500 nm) and a partial least-squares regression (PLSR) analysis were used to estimate key determinants of photosynthetic capacity-namely the maximum rates of RuBP carboxylation (V-cmax) and regeneration (J(max))-measured with standard gas exchange techniques on leaves of trembling aspen and eastern cottonwood trees. The trees were grown across an array of glasshouse temperature regimes. The PLSR models yielded accurate and precise estimates of V-cmax and J(max) within and across species and glasshouse temperatures. These predictions were developed using unique contributions from different spectral regions. Most of the wavelengths selected were correlated with known absorption features related to leaf water content, nitrogen concentration, internal structure, and/or photosynthetic enzymes. In a field application of our PLSR models, spectral reflectance data effectively captured the short-term temperature sensitivities of V-cmax and J(max) in aspen foliage. These findings highlight a promising strategy for developing remote sensing methods to characterize dynamic, environmentally sensitive aspects of canopy photosynthetic metabolism at broad scales.

AB This paper provides a critique of the cost-benefit analysis tool for ecosystem services policy evaluation. We argue that when applied to public ecosystem services, the theoretical assumptions that underlie economic valuation and cost-benefit analysis fail to fully acknowledge the multiple dimensions of human well-being, the plural forms of value articulation, the complex nature of ecosystems, the distributional biases of markets and the fairness implications of spatio-temporal framing. The current monistic utilitarian approach to ecosystem services policy evaluation should therefore be replaced by a pluralist framework composed of a heterogeneous set of value-articulating instruments that are appropriate to the specific context within which decision-making takes place. It is argued that within this pluralist framework cost-benefit analysis may remain an appropriate tool to examine the contingent trade-offs of local policies that have limited impacts on ecosystems and their services.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) based on statistical relationships between occurrence data and underlying environmental conditions are increasingly used to predict spatial patterns of biological invasions and prioritize locations for early detection and control of invasion outbreaks. However, invasive species distribution models (iSDMs) face special challenges because (i) they typically violate SDM's assumption that the organism is in equilibrium with its environment, and (ii) species absence data are often unavailable or believed to be too difficult to interpret. This often leads researchers to generate pseudo-absences for model training or utilize presence-only methods, and to confuse the distinction between predictions of potential vs. actual distribution. We examined the hypothesis that true-absence data, when accompanied by dispersal constraints, improve prediction accuracy and ecological understanding of iSDMs that aim to predict the actual distribution of biological invasions. We evaluated the impact of presence-only, true-absence and pseudo-absence data on model accuracy using an extensive dataset on the distribution of the invasive forest pathogen Phytophthora ramorum in California. Two traditional presence/absence models (generalized linear model and classification trees) and two alternative presence-only models (ecological niche factor analysis and maximum entropy) were developed based on 890 field plots of pathogen occurrence and several climatic, topographic, host vegetation and dispersal variables. The effects of all three possible types of occurrence data on model performance were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and omission/commission error rates. Results show that prediction of actual distribution was less accurate when we ignored true-absences and dispersal constraints. Presence-only models and models without dispersal information tended to over-predict the actual range of invasions. Models based on pseudo-absence data exhibited similar accuracies as presence-only models but produced spatially less feasible predictions. We suggest that true-absence data are a critical ingredient not only for accurate calibration but also for ecologically meaningful assessment of iSDMs that focus on predictions of actual distributions.

AB Soils contain a stock of carbon that is about twice as large as that in the atmosphere and about three times that in vegetation. Small tosses from this large pool could have significant impacts on future atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, so the response of soils to global warming is of critical importance when assessing climate carbon cycle feedbacks. Models that have coupled climate and carbon cycles show a large divergence in the size of the predicted biospheric feedback to the atmosphere. Central questions that still remain when attempting to reduce this uncertainty in the response of soils to global warming are (1) the temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter, especially the more recalcitrant pools; (2) the balance between increased carbon inputs to the soil from increased production and increased losses due to increased rates of decomposition; and (3) interactions between global warming and other aspects of global change, including other climatic effects (e.g., changes in water balance), changes in atmospheric composition (e.g., increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration) and land-use change. In this chapter, we review trends in warming, factors affecting the response of soil carbon to global warming, evidence on the balance between changes in production and soil organic matter decomposition, recent research on the temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon pools, methods for measuring soil responses to global warming, approaches to modeling soil responses to global warming, regions/ecosystems likely to be most vulnerable to future warming, and available technologies to reduce vulnerability of soil carbon to the impacts of future global warming.

AB It has been argued that demographic and environmental factors will cause small, isolated populations to become extinct before genetic factors have a significant negative impact Islands provide an ideal opportunity to test this hypothesis because they often support small, isolated populations that are highly vulnerable to extinction. To assess the potential negative impact of isolation and small population size, we compared levels of genetic variation and fitness in island and mainland populations of the black-footed rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis [Marsupialia: Macropodidae]). Our results indicate that the Barrow Island population of P. lateralis has unprecedented low levels of genetic variation (H-e = 0.053, from 10 microsatellite loci) and suffers from inbreeding depression (reduced female fecundity, skewed sex ratio increased levels of fluctuating asymmetry). Despite a long period of isolation (similar to 1600 generations) and small effective population size (N-e similar to 15), demographic and environmental factors have not yet driven this population to extinction. Nevertheless, it has been affected significantly by genetic factors It has lost most of its genetic variation and become highly inbred (F-e = 0.91), and it exhibits reduced fitness. Because several other island populations of P. lateralis also exhibit exceptionally low levels of genetic variation, this phenomenon may be widespread Inbreeding in these populations is at a level associated with high rates of extinction in populations of domestic and laboratory species. Genetic factors cannot then be excluded as contributing to the extinction proneness of small, isolated populations.

AB The rate and mechanism of protein sequence evolution have been central questions in evolutionary biology since the 1960s. Although the rate of protein sequence evolution depends primarily on the level of functional constraint, exactly what determines functional constraint has remained unclear. The increasing availability of genomic data has enabled much needed empirical examinations on the nature of functional constraint. These studies found that the evolutionary rate of a protein is predominantly influenced by its expression level rather than functional importance. A combination of theoretical and empirical analyses has identified multiple mechanisms behind these observations and demonstrated a prominent role in protein evolution of selection against errors in molecular and cellular processes.

AB Plants that deploy a phosphorus (P)-mobilising strategy based on the release of carboxylates tend to have high leaf manganese concentrations ([Mn]). This occurs because the carboxylates mobilise not only soil inorganic and organic P. but also a range of micronutrients, including Mn. Concentrations of most other micronutrients increase to a small extent, but Mn accumulates to significant levels, even when plants grow in soil with low concentrations of exchangeable Mn availability. Here, we propose that leaf [Mn] can be used to select for genotypes that are more efficient at acquiring P when soil P availability is low. Likewise, leaf [Mn] can be used to screen for belowground functional traits related to nutrient-acquisition strategies among species in low-P habitats.

AB Background: Rescuing amphibian diversity is an achievable conservation challenge. Disease mitigation is one essential component of population management. Here we assess existing disease mitigation strategies, some in early experimental stages, which focus on the globally emerging chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. We discuss the precedent for each strategy in systems ranging from agriculture to human medicine, and the outlook for each strategy in terms of research needs and long-term potential.
   Results: We find that the effects of exposure to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis occur on a spectrum from transient commensal to lethal pathogen. Management priorities are divided between (1) halting pathogen spread and developing survival assurance colonies, and (2) prophylactic or remedial disease treatment. Epidemiological models of chytridiomycosis suggest that mitigation strategies can control disease without eliminating the pathogen. Ecological ethics guide wildlife disease research, but several ethical questions remain for managing disease in the field.
   Conclusions: Because sustainable conservation of amphibians in nature is dependent on long-term population persistence and co-evolution with potentially lethal pathogens, we suggest that disease mitigation not focus exclusively on the elimination or containment of the pathogen, or on the captive breeding of amphibian hosts. Rather, successful disease mitigation must be context specific with epidemiologically informed strategies to manage already infected populations by decreasing pathogenicity and host susceptibility. We propose population level treatments based on three steps: first, identify mechanisms of disease suppression; second, parameterize epizootiological models of disease and population dynamics for testing under semi-natural conditions; and third, begin a process of adaptive management in field trials with natural populations.

AB Loss of genetic variation may render populations more vulnerable to pathogens due to inbreeding depression and depletion of variation in genes responsible for immunity against parasites. Here we review the evidence for the significance of variation in genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) for conservation efforts. MHC molecules present pathogen-derived antigens to the effector cells of the immune system and thus trigger the adaptive immune response. Some MHC genes are the most variable functional genes in the vertebrate genome. Their variation is clearly of adaptive significance and there is considerable evidence that its maintenance is mainly due to balancing selection imposed by pathogens. However, while the evidence for selection shaping MHC variation on the historical timescale is compelling, a correlation between levels of MHC variation and variation at neutral loci is often observed, indicating that on a shorter timescale drift also substantially affects MHC, leading to depletion of MHC diversity. The evidence that the loss of MHC variation negatively affects population survival is so far equivocal and difficult to separate from effects of general inbreeding. Some species with depleted MHC variation seem to be particularly susceptible to infection, but other species thrive and expand following severe bottlenecks that have drastically limited their MHC variation. However, while the latter demonstrate that MHC variation is not always critical for population survival, these species may in fact represent rare examples of survival despite of the loss of MHC variation. There is clearly a compelling need for data that would disclose the possible consequences of MHC diversity for population viability. In particular, we need more data on the impact of MHC allelic richness on the abundance of parasites or prevalence of disease in populations, while controlling for the role of general inbreeding. Before such evidence accumulates, captive breeding programs and other conservation measures aimed at inbreeding avoidance should be favoured over those protecting only MHC variation, especially since inbreeding avoidance programs would usually conserve both types of genetic diversity simultaneously.

AB The soil sink for carbon is important in regulating climate and soil fertility. The sink strength is dependent on the balance of soil carbon decomposition and formation. Variation in the rates of these processes to manipulations of resource availabilities under global change, such as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, is not explained by soil microbial theory.
   To investigate disparate responses of soil carbon dynamics in field investigations, to altered carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus availability, we couple fractionation, isotope and mesocosm techniques to quantify soil carbon decomposition and formation under different resource regimes. These regimes involve addition of multiple levels of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, alone and in combination.
   We hypothesize that: (i) there is no net effect of labile carbon input rate on soil carbon stocks because reductions in soil carbon decomposition are offset by reductions in soil carbon formation; (ii) with simultaneous nutrient addition soil carbon stocks will increase because nitrogen will inhibit further soil carbon decomposition, and mitigate reductions in soil carbon formation observed under elevated labile carbon availability alone; (iii) this increase in soil carbon stocks will be a product of greater formation and decreased decomposition of slower-cycling, mineral-associated, soil carbon, whereas less stable, particulate soil carbon will simply turnover faster (due to greater soil carbon decomposition and formation).
   In contrast to our predictions formation of soil carbon is positively correlated with labile carbon input rates. In addition, nutrient amendment does not interact with carbon amendment to affect total soil carbon contents. However, there are significant interactive effects when the formation and decomposition responses of different soil carbon fractions are considered. For nitrogen alone, its effects on soil carbon fractions follow our hypotheses. However, phosphorus amendment increases decomposition of the soil carbon fraction that constitutes a longer-term sink.
   Our results highlight the need for rhizodeposition, phosphorus and soil carbon fractions to be explicitly considered when interpreting potential soil organic carbon responses to altered resource availability. In the discussion, we make four recommendations for future investigations to improve our understanding of soil carbon responses to altered carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus availabilities.

AB Many efforts are underway to produce broad-scale forest attribute maps by modelling forest class and structure variables collected in forest inventories as functions of satellite-based and biophysical information. Typically, variants of classification and regression trees implemented in Rulequest's (c) See5 and Cubist (for binary and continuous responses, respectively) are the tools of choice in many of these applications. These tools are widely used in large remote sensing applications, but are not easily interpretable, do not have ties with survey estimation methods, and use proprietary unpublished algorithms. Consequently, three alternative modelling techniques were compared for mapping presence and basal area of 13 species located in the mountain ranges of Utah, USA. The modelling techniques compared included the widely used See5/Cubist, generalized additive models (GAMs), and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB). Model performance was evaluated using independent test data sets. Evaluation criteria for mapping species presence included specificity, sensitivity, Kappa, and area under the curve (AUC). Evaluation criteria for the continuous basal area variables included correlation and relative mean squared error. For predicting species presence (setting thresholds to maximize Kappa), SGB had higher values for the majority of the species for specificity and Kappa, while GAMs had higher values for the majority of the species for sensitivity. In evaluating resultant AUC values, GAM and/or SGB models had significantly better results than the See5 models where significant differences could be detected between models. For nine out of 13 species, basal area prediction results for all modelling techniques were poor (correlations less than 0.5 and relative mean squared errors greater than 0.8), but SGB provided the most stable predictions in these instances. SGB and Cubist performed equally well for modelling basal area for three species with moderate prediction success, while all three modelling tools produced comparably good predictions (correlation of 0.68 and relative mean squared error of 0.56) for one species.

AB Migratory species are of special concern in the face of global climate change, since they may be affected by changes in the wintering area, along the migration route and at the breeding grounds. Here we show that migration and breeding times of a trans-Saharan migrant, the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, closely follow local temperatures along the migration route and at the breeding grounds. Because of differences in long-term temperature trends of short within-spring periods, the migration period and the time interval between migration and breeding dates of this species have extended in SW Finland. Temperatures in northern parts of Central Europe have risen at the time when the first migrants arrive there, facilitating their migration northward. Temperatures later in the spring have not changed, and the last individuals arrive at the same time as before. The timing of breeding has not advanced because temperatures at the breeding site after arrival have not changed. These results show that the pied flycatchers can speed up their migration in response to rising temperatures along the migration route. Our results strongly indicate that the effects of climate change have to be studied at the appropriate time and geographical scales for each species and population concerned.

AB Extant xenarthrans (armadillos, anteaters and sloths) are among the most derived placental mammals ever evolved. South America was the cradle of their evolutionary history. During the Tertiary, xenarthrans experienced an extraordinary radiation, whereas South America remained isolated from other comments. The 13 living genera are relicts of this earlier diversification and represent one of the four major clades of placental mammals. Sequences of the three independent protein-coding nuclear markers alpha2B adrenergic receptor (ADRA2B), breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA1), and von Willebrand Factor (VWF) were determined for 12 of the 13 living xenarthran genera. Comparative evolutionary dynamics of these nuclear exons using a likelihood framework revealed contrasting patterns of molecular evolution. All codon positions of BRCA1 were shown to evolve in a strikingly similar manner, and third codon positions appeared less saturated within placentals than those of ADRA2B and VWF. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of a 47 placental taxa data set rooted by three marsupial outgroups resolved the phylogeny of Xenarthra with some evidence for two radiation events in armadillos and provided a strongly supported picture of placental interordinal relationships. This topology was fully compatible with recent studies, dividing placentals into the Southern Hemisphere clades Afrotheria and Xenarthra and a monophyletic Northern Hemisphere clade (Boreoeutheria) composed of Laurasiatheria and Euarchontoglires. Partitioned likelihood statistical tests of the position of the root, under different character partition schemes, identified three almost equally likely hypotheses for early placental divergences: a basal Afrotheria, an Afrotheria + Xenarthra clade, or a basal Xenarthra (Epitheria hypothesis). We took advantage of the extensive sampling realized within Xenarthra to assess its impact on the location of the root on the placental tree. By resampling taxa within Xenarthra, the conservative Shimodaira-Hasegawa likelihood-based test of alternative topologies was shown to be sensitive to both character and taxon sampling.

AB A number of tick-borne diseases of humans have increased in incidence and geographic range over the past few decades, and there is concern that they will pose an even greater threat to public health in future. Although global warming is often cited as the underlying mechanism favoring the spread of tick-borne diseases, climate is just one of many factors that determine which tick species are found in a given geographic region, their population density, the likelihood that they will be infected with microbes pathogenic for humans and the frequency of tick human contact. This article provides basic information needed for microbiologists to understand the many factors that affect the geographic range and population density of ticks and the risk of human exposure to infected ticks. It first briefly summarizes the life cycle and basic ecology of ticks and how ticks and vertebrate hosts interact, then reviews current understanding of the role of climate, sociodemographic factors, agricultural development and changes in human behavior that affect the incidence of tick-borne diseases. These concepts are then illustrated in specific discussions of tick-borne encephalitis and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil microbes play key roles in ecosystems, yet the impact of their diversity on plant communities is still poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the diversity of belowground plant-associated soil fungi promotes plant productivity and plant coexistence. Using additive partitioning of biodiversity effects developed in plant biodiversity studies, we demonstrate that this positive relationship can be driven by complementarity effects among soil fungi in one soil type and by a selection effect resulting from the fungal species that stimulated plant productivity the most in another soil type. Selection and complementarity effects among fungal species contributed to improving plant productivity up to 82% and 85%, respectively, above the average of the respective fungal species monocultures depending on the soil in which they were grown. These results also indicate that belowground diversity may act as insurance for maintaining plant productivity under differing environmental conditions.

AB The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible consequences of climate change on a representative sample of forest herbs in Europe. A fuzzy climatic envelope was used to predict the location of suitable climatic conditions under two climatic change scenarios. Expected consequences in terms of lost and gained range size and shift in distribution for 26 forest herbs were estimated. These results were combined in an Index of Predicted Range Change for each species. Finally, the effects of habitat fragmentation for potential dispersal routes were evaluated and options for management on a European scale are discussed.
   Generally, a good agreement of the estimated suitability under the present climate and the observed current distribution was observed. However, species vary a lot in the degree to which they occupy the presently climatically suitable areas in Europe. Many species are absent from large areas with suitable climate and thus could be said to have poor range-filling capacity.
   A general change in location (range centroid) of the total suitable area was observed: The total suitable area will on average move strongly northwards and moderately eastwards under the relatively mild B1 scenario and more strongly so under the A2 scenario. The required average minimum migration rate per year to track the potential range shift is 2.1 km under the B1 scenario and 3.9 km under the A2 scenario.
   Moderate losses in the total suitable area in Europe are predicted for most species under both scenarios. However, the predicted changes are very variable, with one species (Actaea erythrocarpa) experiencing total range elimination in Europe (A2 scenario) while the total suitable area is predicted to show large increases for other species. The species that are predicted to experience the greatest proportional losses in their climatically suitable area within their presently realised range tend to have northern or eastern range centroids.
   The Index of Predicted Range Change roughly divides the species studied in four groups: One species face a high risk of extinction; eight species are expected to experience moderate to severe threat of extinction; 11 species are not considered at risk and, finally, six species may actually benefit from global warming.
   An analysis of potential migration routes shows the importance of maintaining and, if possible, improving the network of forest throughout Europe to make migration possible. It is also suggested to closely monitor the status of boreal and subalpine species that are most threatened by global warming. Finally it is recommended that special concern should be given to increased protection and restoration of forest habitats in southern montane areas for their crucial long-term importance for the maintenance of European plant diversity.

AB One goal of phytohormonal ecology is to study the interactions between biotic and abiotic stress at hierarchical levels of biological organization. From an ecological perspective, exposure to one stress may alter the Plant's probability of being exposed to another stress. From a mechanistic perspective, hormonal and biochemical signaling interactions between responses to each stress may influence the severity or ability to adaptively respond to the subsequent stress. In this article, we consider the relationship between plant water and salt stress and attack by pathogens and herbivores. Empirical data suggest that water stress and the probability of attack by pathogens and herbivores are correlated between habitats. Biochemical interactions between plant responses to water and salt stress and insect. and pathogen attack are also interrelated. Initial biochemical models indicated that abscisic acid (ABA), an important hormone in responses to water and salt stress, had a synergistic positive role with jasmonate-induced defenses against herbivores and an,antagonistic role with salicylate-based resistance to some pathogens. Based on this background, we developed predictions about how water and salt stress would alter plant resistance to insects and pathogens and tested the predictions using tomato plants as a model system. We: used polyphenol oxidase activity as a marker of the jasmonate response and, pathogenesis-related protein P4 as a marker of the salicylate response. First, we examined levels of chemical defense in wild-type and ABA-deficient plants and the ability of these plants to resist insect and pathogen attack. In the second experiment, we exposed plants to short-term salinity stress and tested their subsequent resistance to a chewing. insect Spodoptera exigua and the bacterial speck pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. We have two key findings. First, ABA-deficient plants had higher levels of salicylate-mediated responses and were more resistant to bacterial speck disease, consistent with the proposed role of salicylate in defense against pathogens. This suggests linkage between water availability to the plant and salicylate action in pathogenesis through ABA signaling. ABA-deficient plants had reduced resistance to the insect Spodoptera exigua, suggesting a positive correlation between responses to water stress and herbivory. The lack of difference in chemical expression of the jasmonate (JA) response (polyphenol oxidase activity) between wild-type and ABA-deficient plants did not support the proposed mechanism of synergism with the jasmonate response. Second, salt stress reduced the chemical induction, (e.g., pathogenesis-related protein P4) of the salicylate response, but this did not affect resistance to the pathogen. Salt stress did not alter resistance to the herbivore Trichoplusia ni, but did alter the negative signal interaction between the jasmonate and salicylate responses. Under control conditions, the jasmonate and salicylate responses are antagonistic to one another, with induction of one response reducing the inducibility of the other. Under salt stress conditions, the negative effect of salicylate on the jasmonate response was reduced. Thus, complex interactions occur between. ABA, JA, and SA, hormones that are important regulators of abiotic and biotic stress responses. Phytohormonal ecology is attempting to link ecological and hormonal interactions to develop a predictive framework for how and Why plants coordinate responses to the environment.

AB For decades, molecular clocks have helped to illuminate the evolutionary timescale of life, but now genomic data pose a challenge for time estimation methods. It is unclear how to integrate data from many genes, each potentially evolving under a different model of substitution and at a different rate. Current methods can be grouped by the Way the data are handled (genes considered separately or combined into a 'supergene') and the way gene-specific rate models are applied (global versus local clock). There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these approaches, and the optimal method has not yet emerged. Fortunately, time estimates inferred using many genes or proteins have greater precision and appear to be robust to different approaches.

AB This review discusses how genetically manipulated plants are being used to study the regulation of metabolism in plants, using carbohydrate metabolism as an example. The molecular tools required are introduced, including the history of Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer and other transformation techniques, the availability of promoters to achieve a specific or induced expression, strategies to target proteins to subcellular compartments of the cell, and the use of antisense or cosuppression to inhibit expression of endogenous genes. A discussion then follows of how such plants can be used in biochemical and physiological experiments to identify and quantify the importance of enzymes and processes that control metabolic fluxes, storage, and growth These results are leading to a reassessment of ideas about metabolic regulation and have consequences for design of bioengineering strategies in plants. Emerging commercial applications are also surveyed.

AB The practice of rewilding has been both promoted and criticized in recent years. Benefits include flexibility to react to environmental change and the promotion of opportunities for society to reconnect with nature. Criticisms include the lack of a clear conceptualization of rewilding, insufficient knowledge about possible outcomes, and the perception that rewilding excludes people from landscapes. Here, we present a framework for rewilding that addresses these concerns. We suggest that rewilding efforts should target trophic complexity, natural disturbances, and dispersal as interacting processes that can improve ecosystem resilience and maintain biodiversity. We propose a structured approach to rewilding projects that includes assessment of the contributions of nature to people and the social-ecological constraints on restoration.

AB P>The enemy release hypothesis is a common explanation for species invasions, suggesting that introduced species benefit from leaving behind natural enemies in the native range. However, any such advantage may attenuate over time. In this study, we test a prediction of this more dynamic enemy release hypothesis: that non-native plant species that became established longer ago exhibit stronger negative feedbacks with the soil. Consistent with declining enemy release over time, we found increasingly negative soil feedbacks for species established longer ago in New Zealand. Negative soil feedbacks were also stronger for more widespread species, but weaker for more locally abundant species, suggesting that species accumulate negative interactions as they spread and can be locally regulated by these interactions. We also present data to support the common assumption that relatives have similar impacts on and responses to soil communities. Together, these data highlight the dynamic nature of novel interactions arising from species introductions.

AB Determining the importance of independent variables is of practical relevance to ecologists and managers concerned with allocating limited resources to the management of natural systems. Although techniques that identify explanatory variables having the largest influence on the response variable are needed to design management actions effectively, the use of various indices to evaluate variable importance is poorly understood. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we compared six different indices commonly used to evaluate variable importance; zero-order correlations, partial correlations, semipartial correlations, standardized regression coefficients, Akaike weights, and independent effects. We simulated four scenarios to evaluate the indices under progressively more complex circumstances that included correlation between explanatory variables, as well as a spurious variable that was correlated with other explanatory variables, but not with the dependent variable. No index performed perfectly under all circumstances, but partial correlations and Akaike weights performed poorly in all cases. Zero-order correlations was the only measure that detected the presence of a spurious variable, whereas only independent effects assigned overlap areas correctly once the spurious variable was removed. We therefore recommend using zero-order correlations to eliminate predictor variables with correlations near zero, followed by the use of independent effects to assign overlap areas and rank variable importance.

AB Central paradigms of ecophysiology are that there are recognizable and even explicit and predictable patterns among species, genera, and life forms in the economics of water and nitrogen use in photosynthesis and in carbon isotope discrimination (Delta). However most previous examinations have implicitly assumed an infinite internal conductance (g(i)) and/or that internal conductance scales with the biochemical capacity for photosynthesis. Examination of published data for 54 species and a detailed examination for three well-characterized species -Eucalyptus globulus, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Phaseolus vulgaris- show these assumptions to be incorrect. The reduction in concentration of CO2 between the substomatal cavity (C-i) and the site of carbon fixation (C-c) varies greatly among species. Photosynthesis does not scale perfectly with g(i) and there is a general trend for plants with low g(i) to have a larger draw-down from C-i to C-c, further confounding efforts to scale photosynthesis and other attributes with g(i). Variation in the g(i)-photosynthesis relationship contributes to variation in photosynthetic 'use' efficiency of N (PNUE) and water (WUE). Delta is an information-rich signal, but for many species only about two-thirds of this information relates to A/g(s) with the remaining one-third related to A/g(i). Using data for three well-studied species we demonstrate that at common WUE, Delta may vary by up to 3 parts per thousand. This is as large or larger than is commonly reported in many interspecific comparisons of Delta, and adds to previous warnings about simplistic interpretations of WUE based on Delta. A priority for future research should be elucidation of relationships between g(i) and g(s) and how these vary in response to environmental conditions (e.g. soil water, leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit, temperature) and among species.

AB Given currently high rates of extinction, it is critical to be able to predict how ecosystems will respond to loss of species and consequent changes in community structure. Much previous research in this area has been based on terrestrial systems, using synthetically assembled communities. There has beer! much less research on inter-trophic effects in different systems, using in situ removal experiments. Problems with the design of early experiments have made it difficult to determine whether reductions in ecosystem functioning in low diversity treatments were due to the number of species present or merely to the reduced likelihood of including particular ("key") species, or functional groups. We established a field experiment, using cage enclosures, to test whether the number or identity of grazing gastropods present would affect the diversity and productivity of intertidal algal communities. We found that there was no relationship between ecosystem functioning and diversity per se, but that different species had idiosyncratic effects. This appears to be a common feature of intertidal systems, which often contain strongly interacting species. In this case, the limpet Patella ulyssiponensis was the most influential primary consumer. Additional treatments enabled us to test the potential for other grazers to compensate for its loss. Early results (after four months) suggested that compensation was possible, implying potential redundancy of P. ulyssiponensis. This effect disappeared after 13 months, however, highlighting the context dependence of so-called redundancy and underlining the importance of long-term field-based experiments in this area.

AB We sequenced nearly the entire carbomoylphosphate synthase (CPS) domain of CAD, or rudimentary, (ca. 4 kb) from 29 species of flies representing all major clades within Eremoneura, or higher flies, and several orthorrhaphous brachyceran outgroups. We compared these sequences with orthologs from Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster to assess structure, compositional bias, and phylogenetic utility. CAD is large (6.6+ kb), complex (comprised of three major and myriad minor functional domains) and relatively free of introns, extreme nucleotide bias (except third codon positions), and large hypervariable regions. The CPS domain possesses moderate levels of nonsynonymous divergence among taxa of intermediate evolutionary age and conveys considerable phylogenetic signal. Phylogenetic analysis of CPS sequences under varying methods and assumptions resulted in well-resolved, strongly supported trees concordant with many traditional ideas about higher dipteran phylogeny and with prior inferences from 28S rDNA. The most robustly supported major eremoneuran clades were Cyclorrhapha, Platypezoidea, Eumuscomorpha, Empidoidea, Atelestidae, Empidoidea exclusive of Atelestidae, Hybotidae s. l, Microphoridae + Dolichopodidae, and Empididae s. str. Because CAD is ubiquitous, apparently single copy (at least within holometabolous insects), readily obtained from several insect orders using primers described herein, and exhibits considerable phylogenetic utility, it should have wide applicability in insect molecular systematics.

   RESPONSES; PLANTS; RANGE; LEPIDOPTERA; MIGRATION; NUMBERS
AB Phenological changes in response to climatic warming have been detected across a wide range of organisms. Butterflies stand out as one of the most popular groups of indicators of climatic change, given that, firstly, they are poikilothermic and, secondly, have been the subject of thorough monitoring programmes in several countries for a number of decades. Here we provide for the first time strong evidence of phenological change as a consequence of recent climatic warming in butterflies at a Spanish site in the northwest Mediterranean Basin. By means of the widely used Butterfly Monitoring Scheme methodology, three different phenological parameters were analysed for the most common species to test for trends over time and relationships with temperature and precipitation. Between 1988 and 2002, there was a tendency for earlier first appearance dates in all 17 butterfly species tested, and significant advances in mean flight dates in 8 out of 19 species. On the other hand, the shape of the curve of adult emergence did not show any regular pattern. These changes paralleled an increase of 1 - 1.5 degreesC in mean February, March and June temperatures. Likewise, a correlation analysis indicated the strong negative effect of spring temperature on phenological parameters (i.e. higher temperatures tended to produce phenological advances), and the opposite effect of precipitation in certain months. In addition, there was some evidence to indicate that phenological responses may differ between taxonomic lineages or species with similar diets. We discuss the consequences that these changes may have on species' population abundances, especially given the expected increase in aridity in the Mediterranean Basin caused by current climatic warming. We predict that varying degrees of phenological flexibility may account for differences in species' responses and, for multivoltine species, predict strong selection favouring local seasonal adaptations such as diapause phenomena or migratory behaviour.

AB 1. This paper introduces, and summarises the key messages of, a series of papers that emanated from a symposium on the Role of Drought in the Ecology of Aquatic Systems, held in Australia in 2001.
   2. Defining drought hydrologically is problematic because the return times, intensity, duration and long-term trends in low-flow periods are specific to regions and times. Droughts may instead be referred to as 'significant low-flow periods', many of which have been replaced by 'anti-drought' conditions in rivers as they are used increasingly as irrigation conduits.
   3. Droughts can be divided into those that cause predictable, seasonal press disturbances and less predictable, protracted 'ramp' disturbances. However, while droughts may be 'ramp' disturbances, their effects on aquatic biota are most likely to be 'stepped' when geomorphological or hydrological thresholds are crossed, causing abrupt changes in biological community structure and ecosystem processes.
   4. Physical, morphological, physiological or behavioural refugia confer resistance or resilience to riverine populations and communities that experience drought conditions. The physical and chemical parameters associated with refugia habitats and their formation, influence population parameters within, and interactions among, species and can have protracted reproductive consequences, even well after the cessation of the drought.
   5. Fish, invertebrate and plant populations and assemblages seem to recover rapidly from drought. Most studies of the effects of drought, however, have arisen fortuitously and have involved relatively short temporal, and small spatial, scales. Innovative approaches, such as microsatellite DNA analyses, can reveal that the effects of drought may be profound and long-lasting, resulting in population bottlenecks and altering the course of the evolution of species.
   6. During periods of drought, decreases in inputs of dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus may lead to carbon limitation to microbial metabolism, resulting in autotrophic production being favoured over heterotrophic production.
   7. Long-term climate trends, as indicated by palaeoecological evidence, suggest that, at least for Australia, droughts are likely to occur more frequently in the future. Anthropogenic effects on climate are likely to exacerbate this.
   8. It is important that drought is seen for what it is: a natural extreme of the flow continuum, with flooding at the other extreme. Thus, despite the potential for dramatic impacts on aquatic biota and the negative social connotations associated with such events, drought must be incorporated into river management plans.

AB Empirically derived models of amino acid replacement are employed to study the association between various physical features of proteins and evolution. The strengths of these associations are statistically evaluated by applying the models of protein evolution to 11 diverse sets of protein sequences. Parametric bootstrap tests indicate that the solvent accessibility status of a site has a particularly strong association with the process of amino acid replacement that it experiences. Significant association between secondary structure environment and the amino acid replacement process is also observed. Careful description of the length distribution of secondary structure elements and of the organization of secondary structure and solvent accessibility along a protein did not always significantly improve the fit of the evolutionary models to the data sets that were analyzed. As indicated by the strength of the association of both solvent accessibility and secondary structure with amino acid replacement, the process of protein evolution-both above and below the species level-will not be well understood until the physical constraints that affect protein evolution are identified and characterized.

AB Estes and Steinberg hypothesized that the intensity of sublittoral marine plant-herbivore interactions among different temperate regions has differed over the past 5-10 million yr, due to differences in the influence of diving mammals that prey on marine herbivores. They argued that because diving predators have not occurred in temperate Australasia, densities of sublittoral herbivores have been historically higher there than in comparable North American systems. This has resulted in marine algae and herbivores in temperate Australasia having strong selective effects on each other. Estes and Steinberg predicted that one result of these strong interactions would be that invertebrate herbivores in temperate Australasia should have evolved greater tolerance to brown algal phlorotannins (polyphenolic compounds that are the dominant secondary metabolites in temperate brown seaweeds) than similar herbivores in North America. We tested this prediction for five invertebrate herbivores in temperate Australasia. Most work was done on three herbivores from New South Wales, Australia, the sea urchins (echinoids) Tripneustes gratilla and Centrostephanus rodgersii, and the gastropod (snail) Turbo undulata. Additional experiments were done using Evechinus chloroticus (urchin) and Cookia sulcata (gastropod) from New Zealand.
   Both the short-term effects of phlorotannins on feeding behavior, and the longer term effects of phlorotannins on the growth or mortality of herbivores were assessed by (a) feeding the herbivores an array of algal species that varied in their phenolic content, and (b) extracting mixed fractions of phlorotannins from the algae and using these extracts to experimentally manipulate the phlorotannin content of palatable agar disks. The phenolic content of algae used in feeding experiments in Australia was sampled seasonally for 3 yr, and the algae were divided into two groups. These included a phenolic-rich group of five species with a mean phenolic content = 7.02% dry mass (range of species means 6.6-7.2%), and a phenolic-poor group of four species with a mean of 2.69% (range of means = 2.2-3.1%). In strong contrast to earlier results from North America, no Australian herbivore consistently preferred phenolic-poor species over those rich in phenolics. Algal phenolic levels also were not correlated with feeding preferences of the New Zealand herbivores. The Australian herbivores were generally not deterred by the addition of extracted phlorotannins to agar disks at concentrations of 5 mg/mL (13.5% dry mass) in the disks. However, some extracts deterred some herbivores, indicating that the effects of phlorotannins on the herbivores are variable. The effects of phlorotannins at higher concentrations (8 mg/mL or 18.5% dry mass) were equivocal. Deterrence was increased in some instances, but elevated concentrations of phlorotannins from Carpophyllum maschalocarpum enhanced feeding by Tripneustes gratilla.
   Algal phenolic levels were not correlated with the growth of juvenile Tripneustes gratilla raised on a variety of algal diets for 7 mo in the field. Conversion efficiencies of algal biomass to urchin biomass by these echinoids also did not covary with algal phenolic content. Growth of T. gratilla on apr diets for 7 mo was not affected by the addition of phlorotannins extracted from Sargassum vestitum to the apr at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. Growth of the gastropod Turbo undulata over 9.5 mo on selected algal diets was fastest for one measure of growth for snails fed a diet of the phenolic-poor Sargassum linearifolium, but algal phenolic levels were not correlated with growth of T. undulata for two other measures of growth. Moreover, conversion efficiencies of Turbo undulata did not vary with diet, indicating that any differences in growth among different diets were due to differences in consumption rather than some physiological effect. This last conclusion was supported in an experiment where T. undulata was grown on agar diets. Growth of the snails was not affected by the addition of phlorotannins from Sargassum vestitum or Ecklonia radiata to agar diets, and in this experiment the amount of different agar diets consumed did not differ. These results do not support proposals that algal phlorotannins function as generally effective "digestibility reducers" against marine invertebrate herbivores. The pattern of geographical variation in the production of phenolics by brown algae, and the responses of marine herbivores to these compounds, are also not easily explained by current theoretical models such as those based on plant apparency or resource availability.
   A number of the algae studied here also contained smaller nonpolar secondary metabolites such as terpenes or lactones. In general, these algae were the least palatable to the herbivores, and the herbivores grew most slowly when fed monospecific diets of algae rich in nonpolar secondary compounds. The one nonpolar compound that was tested experimentally, the terpene geranylacetone extracted from Cystophora moniliformis, significantly deterred feeding by Tripneustes gratilla. We suggest that nonpolar compounds will generally have stronger effects against Australasian herbivores than do phlorotannins.

AB Focusing on the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (Pentatomidae), in central Japan the effects of climate change on true bugs (Insecta: Heteroptera) are reviewed. In the early 1960s, the northern edge of the species's distribution was in Wakayama Prefecture (34.1 degrees N) and distribution was limited by the +5 degrees C coldest month (January) mean temperature isothermal line. By 2000, N. viridula was recorded 70 km further north (in Osaka, 34.7 degrees N). Historical climate data were used to reveal possible causes of the northward range expansion. The increase of mean and lowest winter month temperatures by 1-2 degrees C in Osaka from the 1950s to the 1990s improved potential overwintering conditions for N. viridula. This promoted northward range expansion of the species. In Osaka, adult diapause in N. viridula is induced after mid-September, much later than in other local seed-feeding heteropterans. This late diapause induction results in late-season ineffective reproduction: some females start oviposition in autumn when the progeny have no chance of attaining adulthood and surviving winter. Both reproductive adults and the progeny die. A period from mid-September to early November represents a phenological mismatch: diapause is not yet induced in all adults, but it is already too late to start reproduction. Females that do not start reproduction but enter diapause in September have reduced postdiapause reproductive performance: they live for a shorter period, have a shorter period of oviposition and produce fewer eggs in smaller egg masses compared with females that emerge and enter diapause later in autumn. To some extent, N. viridula remains maladapted to Osaka environmental conditions. Ecological perspectives on establishment in recently colonized areas are discussed. A review of available data suggests that terrestrial and aquatic Heteroptera species respond to climate change by shifting their distribution ranges, changing abundance, phenology, voltinism, physiology, behaviour, and community structure. Expected responses of Heteroptera to further climate warming are discussed under scenarios of slight (< 2 degrees C) and substantial (> 2 degrees C) temperature increase.

AB We adopted previous N : P stoichiometric models for zooplankton relative growth to predict the relative growth rates of the leaves mu(L) of vascular plants assuming that annual leaf growth in dry mass is dictated by how leaf nitrogen N-L is allocated to leaf proteins and how leaf phosphorus P-L is allocated to rRNA. This model is simplified provided that N-L scales as some power function of P-L across the leaves of different species. This approach successfully predicted the mu(L) of 131 species of vascular plants based on the observation that, across these species, N-L scaled, on average, as the 3/4 power of P-L, i.e. N-L proportional to P-L(3/4). When juxtaposed with prior allometric theory and observations, our findings suggest that a transformation in N : P stoichiometry occurs when the plant body undergoes a transition from primary to secondary growth.

AB Adaptive evolution at the molecular level can be studied by detecting convergent and parallel evolution at the amino acid sequence level. For a set of homologous protein sequences, the ancestral amino acids at all interior nodes of the phylogenetic tree of the proteins can be statistically inferred. The amino acid sites that have experienced convergent or parallel changes on independent evolutionary lineages can then be identified by comparing the amino acids at the beginning and end of each Lineage. At present, the efficiency of the methods of ancestral sequence inference in identifying convergent and parallel changes is unknown. More seriously, when we identify convergent or parallel changes, it is unclear whether these changes are attributable to random chance. For these reasons, claims of convergent and parallel evolution at the amino acid sequence level have been disputed. We have conducted computer simulations to assess the efficiencies of the parsimony and Bayesian methods of ancestral sequence inference in identifying convergent and parallel-change sites. Our results showed that the Bayesian method performs better than the parsimony method in identifying parallel changes, and both methods are inefficient in identifying convergent changes. However, the Bayesian method is recommended for estimating the number of convergent-change sites because it gives a conservative estimate. We have developed statistical tests for examining whether the observed numbers of convergent and parallel changes are due to random chance. As an example, we reanalyzed the stomach lysozyme sequences of foregut fermenters and found that parallel evolution is statistically significant, whereas convergent evolution is not well supported.

AB This article considers the importance of robust planning for green infrastructure in fast changing Southern African cities. A key theme is the extent to which ecosystem services are valued publicly, and the opportunity costs of not investing in the green infrastructure. We explore green infrastructure through pairing insights of social-ecological resilience with perspectives on urban infrastructure transitions. By converging these views, we show how green infrastructure can be viewed as an innovative response to challenged urban environments.
   Through a Johannesburg case study, a number of ecosystem services constitute sources of resilience for an otherwise constrained city. While this is positive and to be valorised, many South African cities are in the midst of service delivery protests, so that resilient ecosystems, and the citizen networks that sustain these, are largely overlooked in planning processes.
   This article offers three key conclusions. First, a proper understanding of green infrastructure requires blending insights from social-ecological system thinking and infrastructure transition scholarship. Second, there is a paucity of knowledge around ecosystem services in Johannesburg, and that the planning to facilitate ecosystem service valuation is largely inadequate. Third, addressing this requires ecosystem valuations relevant to the unique conditions in developing world cities such as Johannesburg. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim Vegetation exhibiting landscape-scale regular spatial patterns has been reported for arid and semi-arid areas world-wide. Recent theories state that such structures are bound to low-productivity environments and result from a self-organization process. Our objective was to test this relationship between periodic pattern occurrence and environmental factors at a global scale and to parametrize a predictive distribution model.
   Location Arid and semi-arid areas world-wide.
   Methods We trained an empirical predictive model (Maxent) for the occurrence of periodic vegetation patterns, based on environmental predictors and known occurrences verified on Landsat satellite images.
   Results This model allowed us to discover previously unreported pattern locations, and to report the first ever examples of spotted patterns in natural systems. Relationships to the main environmental drivers are discussed.
   Main conclusions These results confirm that periodic patterned vegetations are ubiquitous at the interface between arid and semi-arid regions. Self-organized patterning appears therefore to be a biome-scale response to environmental conditions, including soil and topography. The set of correlations between vegetation patterns and their environmental conditions presented in this study will need to be reproduced in future modelling attempts.

AB Determining the relative temperature sensitivities of the decomposition of the different soil organic matter (SOM) pools is critical for predicting the long-term impacts of climate change on soil carbon (C) storage. Although kinetic theory suggests that the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition should increase with substrate recalcitrance, there remains little empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. In the study presented here, sub-samples from a single bulk soil sample were frozen and sequentially defrosted to produce samples of the same soil that had been incubated for different lengths of time, up to a maximum of 124 days. These samples were then placed into an incubation system which allowed CO(2) production to be monitored constantly and the response of soil respiration to short-term temperature manipulations to be investigated. The temperature sensitivity of soil CO(2) production increased significantly with incubation time suggesting that, as the most labile SOM pool was depleted the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition increased. This study is therefore one of the first to provide empirical support for kinetic theory. Further, using a modelling approach, we demonstrate that it is the temperature sensitivity of the decomposition of the more recalcitrant SOM pools that will determine long-term soil-C losses. Therefore, the magnitude of the positive feedback to global warming may have been underestimated in previous modelling studies. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The 1998 global coral bleaching event was the largest recorded historical disturbance of coral reefs and resulted in extensive habitat loss. Annual censuses of reef fish community structure over a 12-year period spanning the bleaching event revealed a marked phase shift from a prebleach to postbleach assemblage. Surprisingly, we found that the bleaching event had no detectable effect on the abundance, diversity or species richness of a local cryptobenthic reef fish community. Furthermore, there is no evidence of regeneration even after 5-35 generations of these short-lived species. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the response of coral reef ecosystems to global warming and highlight the importance of selecting appropriate criteria for evaluating reef resilience.

AB Although world oceans have been warming over the past 50 years, the impact on biotic components is poorly understood because of the difficulty of obtaining long-term datasets on marine organisms. The Southern Ocean plays a critical role in global climate and there is growing evidence of climate warming. We show that air temperatures measured by meteorological stations have steadily increased over the past 50 years in the southern Indian Ocean, the increase starting in mid 1960s and stabilizing in mid 1980s, being particularly important in the sub-Antarctic sector. At the same time, with a time lag of 2-9 years with temperatures, the population size of most seabirds and seals monitored on several breeding sites have decreased severely, whilst two species have increased at the same time. These changes, together with indications of a simultaneous decrease in secondary production in sub-Antarctic waters and the reduction of sea-ice extent further south, indicate that a major system shift has occurred in the Indian Ocean part of the Southern Ocean. This shift illustrates the high sensitivity of marine ecosystems, and especially upper trophic level predators, to climatic changes.

AB The effects of habitat fragmentation on processes within and among populations are important for conservation management. Despite a broad spectrum of lifestyles and the conservation significance of many reptiles, very little work on fine-scale population genetics has been carried out on this group. This study examines the dispersal patterns of a rock crevice-dwelling lizard, Cunningham's skink (Egernia cunningham), in a naturally vegetated reserve and an adjacent deforested site. Both genotypic and genic approaches were employed, using microsatellite loci. The spatial organization of individuals with respect to pairwise relatedness coefficients and allele frequencies, along with assignment tests, were used to infer dispersal characteristics for both sexes in a natural and a cleared area. The distribution of relatedness in both habitats was spatially structured, with E. cunninghami showing high pairwise relatedness within their rocky retreat sites. Analysis of relatedness over different spatial scales, spatial autocorrelation of alleles and assignment tests, all indicated that both sexes in the cleared area show Less dispersal than their counterparts in the reserve. Furthermore, deforestation may inhibit female dispersal to a greater extent than that of males. The geographical structuring of allele frequencies for adults in the cleared area, but not the reserve, indicates that habitat fragmentation has the potential to alter at least the microevolution of E. cunninghami populations.

AB The effects of localized zinc (ZnO) and cadmium (CdS) enrichment on the allocation of root biomass, root length and partitioning of current assimilate within root systems of the Zn hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens were investigated using a rhizobox system. The rhizoboxes contained either homogeneous soil or juxtaposed control and metal-enriched soil. In the heterogeneous treatments the Zn-enriched soil contained 250, 500 or 1000 mg Zn kg(-1). The plants consistently allocated c. 70% of their total root biomass and length into the metal-enriched soil. Moreover, 70% of the current assimilate ((14)C) allocated to the roots was localized in the Zn-enriched soil of the heterogeneous treatments. The concentration of Zn (250-1000 mg kg(-1)) in the enriched soil had no effect on these patterns of root allocation, nor were there significant effects of the Zn treatments on the total root or shoot biomass of the plants. The positive responses to the localized metal treatments were therefore characterized by a concomitant reduction in root allocation into the control soil. In contrast to T. caerulescens, when grown with juxtaposed control and Zn-enriched soil the non-accumulator Thlaspi arvense showed reduced root allocation into a patch enriched with 500 mg kg(-1) Zn. In a further experiment, two populations of T. caerulescens that differ in their abilities to accumulate Cd were grown with juxtaposed control and Cd-enriched soil. The plants from a population that accumulated Cd also showed increased root biomass and root length allocation into the Cd-enriched soil. Plants from the population that did not accumulate Cd showed no such increase. The possibility that T. caerulescens forages for metals, and the precision of its root allocation with respect to localized metal enrichment is highlighted. The significance of these findings for the selection of hyperaccumulator plants for use in the phytoextraction of Zn and Cd from mine spoils (phytomining) and the phytoremediation of heterogeneous contaminated soils are discussed.

AB The 54-kDa signal recognition particle and the receptor SR alpha, two proteins involved in the cotranslational translocation of proteins, are paralogs. They originate from a gene duplication that occurred prior to the last universal common ancestor, allowing one to root the universal tree of life. Phylogenetic analysis using standard methods supports the generally accepted cluster of Archaea and Eucarya. However, a new method increasing the signal-to-noise ratio strongly suggests that this result is due to a long-branch attraction artifact, with the Bacteria evolving fastest. In fact, the Archaea/Eucarya sisterhood is recovered only by the fast-evolving positions. In contrast, the most slowly evolving positions, which are the most likely to retain the ancient phylogenetic signal, support the monophyly of prokaryotes. Such a eukaryotic rooting provides a simple explanation for the high similarity of Archaea and Bacteria observed in complete-genome analysis, and should prompt a reconsideration of current views on the origin of eukaryotes.

AB Non-native fishes are frequently used to enhance aquaculture and fisheries; if introduced into the wider environment, then the majority will have negligible effects on native biodiversity. However, a minority will become invasive, causing adverse ecological effects, and so management actions may be needed to minimize their dispersal and impacts. These actions include eradication attempts from specific waters or well-defined spatial areas, population control by suppression (e.g. through removal programmes) and containment of existing populations to prevent their further spread. These remedial actions have generally only been undertaken across large spatial areas in developed countries; experience suggests a fundamental constraint is a lack of selective removal methods that target the non-native fish species only. For example, eradication methods tend to be limited to low technology, 'scorched-earth' techniques (e.g. biocide chemicals) whose use is generally constrained to relatively small and enclosed water bodies. Risk management of non-native fishes should ensure that actions taken are commensurate with the level of risk posed by that species in the environment; although pre-introduction risk assessment schemes have been developed, there remains a lack of decision support tools for post-introduction situations. Although this inhibits the management of non-native fishes in the environment, control programmes such as those against common carp Cyprinus carpio in Australia and topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva in England and Wales suggest there is potential for invasions to be managed and controlled within large spatial areas, even if their eradication may not be feasible.

AB The root system of permanent grasslands is of outstanding importance for resource acquisition. Particularly under semi-arid conditions, the acquisition of water and nutrients is highly variable during the vegetation growth period and between years. Additionally, grazing is repeatedly disturbing the functional equilibrium between the root system and the transpiring leaf canopy. However, very few data is available considering grazing effects on belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) and root-shoot dry mass allocation in natural grassland systems. We hypothesise that grazing significantly reduces BNPP due to carbon reallocation to shoot growth. Root biomass and BNPP were estimated by soil coring in 2004, 2005 and 2006 and from ingrowth cores in 2005 and 2006 at one site which has been protected from grazing since 1979 (UG79), at one winter grazing (WG), and one heavily grazed (HG) site. BNPP was estimated from the summation of significant increments of total and live root biomass and from accumulated root biomass of ingrowth cores. Belowground biomass varied from 1,490-2,670 g m(-2) and was significantly lower under heavy grazing than at site UG79. Root turnover varied from 0.23 to 0.33 year(-1) and was not significantly different between sites. Heavy grazing significantly decreased live root biomass and BNPP compared to site UG79. Taking BNPP estimates from live root biomass dynamics and ingrowth cores as the most reliable values, the portion of dry mass allocated belowground relative to total net primary productivity (BNPP/NPP) varied between 0.50-0.66 and was reduced under heavy grazing in 2005, but not in 2006. The positive correlation between cumulative root length density of ingrowth cores and leaf dry matter suggests that the ingrowth core method is suitable for studying BNPP in this semi-arid steppe system. Grazing effects on BNPP and BNPP/NPP should be considered in regional carbon models and estimates of belowground nutrient cycling.

AB Recently, the importance of the female to population dynamics-especially her non-genetic contribution to offspring fitness or maternal effect-has received much attention in studies of a diverse collection of animal and plant taxa. Of particular interest to fisheries scientists and managers is the role of the demographic structure of the adult component of fish populations in the formation of future year classes. Traditionally, fisheries managers tended to assess whole populations without regard to variation between the individuals within the population. In doing so, they overlooked the variation in spawning production between individual females as a source of variation to recruitment magnitude and fluctuation. Indeed, intensive and/or selective harvesting of larger and older females, those that may produce more-and higher quality-offspring, has been implicated in the collapse of a number of important fish stocks. In a fisheries resource management context, whether capture fisheries or aquaculture, female demographics and inter-female differences warrant serious consideration in developing harvesting and breeding strategies, and in understanding general population dynamics. Here I review the range of female traits and environmental conditions females encounter which may influence the number or quality of their offspring via a maternal effect.

AB The mitochondrial genome is one of the most frequently used loci in phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses, and it is becoming increasingly possible to sequence and analyze this genome in its entirety from diverse taxa. However, sequencing the entire genome is not always desirable or feasible. Which genes should be selected to best infer the evolutionary history of the mitochondria within a group of organisms, and what properties of a gene determine its phylogenetic performance? The current study addresses these questions in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework with reference to a phylogeny of plethodontid and related salamanders derived from 27 complete mitochondrial genomes; this topology is corroborated by nuclear DNA and morphological data. Evolutionary rates for each mitochondrial gene and divergence dates for all nodes in the plethodontid mitochondrial genome phylogeny were estimated in both Bayesian and maximum likelihood frameworks using multiple fossil calibrations, multiple data partitions, and a clock-independent approach. Bayesian analyses of individual genes were performed, and the resulting trees compared against the reference topology. Ordinal logistic regression analysis of molecular evolution rate, gene length, and the Gamma-shape parameter alpha demonstrated that slower rate of evolution and longer gene length both increased the probability that a gene would perform well phylogenetically. Estimated rates of molecular evolution vary 84-fold among different mitochondrial genes and different salamander lineages, and mean rates among genes vary 15-fold. Despite having conserved amino acid sequences, cox1, cox2, cox3, and cob have the fastest mean rates of nucleotide substitution, and the greatest variation in rates, whereas rrnS and rrnL have the slowest rates. Reasons underlying this rate variation are discussed, as is the extensive rate variation in cox1 in light of its proposed role in DNA barcoding.

AB Phylogenetic studies incorporating multiple loci, and multiple genomes, are becoming increasingly common. Coincident with this trend in genetic sampling, model-based likelihood techniques including Bayesian phylogenetic methods continue to gain popularity. Few studies, however, have examined model fit and sensitivity to such potentially heterogeneous data partitions within combined data analyses using empirical data. Here we investigate the relative model fit and sensitivity of Bayesian phylogenetic methods when alternative site-specific partitions of among-site rate variation (with and without autocorrelated rates) are considered. Our primary goal in choosing a best-fit model was to employ the simplest model that was a good fit to the data while optimizing topology and/or Bayesian posterior probabilities. Thus, we were not interested in complex models that did not practically affect our interpretation of the topology under study. We applied these alternative models to a four-gene data set including one protein-coding nuclear gene (c-mos), one protein-coding mitochondrial gene (ND4), and two mitochondrial rRNA genes (12S and 16S) for the diverse yet poorly known lizard family Gymnophthalmidae. Our results suggest that the best-fit model partitioned among-site rate variation separately among the c-mos, ND4, and 12S + 16S gene regions. We found this model yielded identical topologies to those from analyses based on the GTR+I+G model, but significantly changed posterior probability estimates of clade support. This partitioned model also produced more precise (less variable) estimates of posterior probabilities across generations of long Bayesian runs, compared to runs employing a GTR+I+G model estimated for the combined data. We use this three-way gamma partitioning in Bayesian analyses to reconstruct a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for the relationships of genera within the lizard family Gymnophthalmidae. We then reevaluate the higher-level taxonomic arrangement of the Gymnophthalmidae. Based on our findings, we discuss the utility of nontraditional parameters for modeling among-site rate variation and the implications and future directions for complex model building and testing.

AB Politicians, scientists, government agencies, and the public are all engaged in recovery planning for Pacific salmon. In order for science to fulfill its potential in the arena of salmon recovery planning, several shortcomings of the science and its application to decision-making must be rectified. The definition of conservation units using genetic and phylogenetic inference needs to be sharpened. Ecological analyses must get beyond casting blame for past declines in salmon numbers and examine mixed strategies of management that consider interactions between hatcheries, harvest, hydropower, and habitat factors as well as background natural stresses and invasive species. Glib acceptance of expert opinion and extrapolated or inferred data should be tempered. To deal with uncertainty, recovery teams should engage in scenario analyses in which a wide variety of assumptions are played out. Finally, there is a pressing need for analyses aimed at determining what circumstances and communication strategies give science an effective voice in decision-making.

AB Although experiments show a positive association between vascular plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) species richness, evidence from natural ecosystems is scarce. Furthermore, there is little knowledge about how AMF richness varies with belowground plant richness and biomass.
   We examined relationships among AMF richness, above-and belowground plant richness, and plant root and shoot biomass in a native North American grassland. Root-colonizing AMF richness and belowground plant richness were detected from the same bulk root samples by 454-sequencing of the AMF SSU rRNA and plant trnL genes.
   In total we detected 63 AMF taxa. Plant richness was 1.5 times greater belowground than aboveground. AMF richness was significantly positively correlated with plant species richness, and more strongly with below-than aboveground plant richness. Belowground plant richness was positively correlated with belowground plant biomass and total plant biomass, whereas aboveground plant richness was positively correlated only with belowground plant biomass. By contrast, AMF richness was negatively correlated with belowground and total plant biomass.
   Our results indicate that AMF richness and plant belowground richness are more strongly related with each other and with plant community biomass than with the plant aboveground richness measures that have been almost exclusively considered to date.

   GLOBAL CHANGE
AB Invasive plant species threaten native ecosystems, natural resources, and managed lands worldwide. Climate change may increase risk from invasive plant species as favorable climate conditions allow invaders to expand into new ranges. Here, we use bioclimatic envelope modeling to assess current climatic habitat, or lands climatically suitable for invasion, for three of the most dominant and aggressive invasive plants in the southeast United States: kudzu (Pueraria lobata), privet (Ligustrum sinense; L. vulgare), and cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica). We define climatic habitat using both the Maxent and Mahalanobis distance methodologies, and we define the best climatic predictors based on variables that best 'constrain' species distributions and variables that 'release' the most land area if excluded. We then use an ensemble of 12 atmosphere-ocean general circulation models to project changes in climatic habitat for the three invasive species by 2100. The combined methodologies, predictors, and models produce a robust assessment of invasion risk inclusive of many of the approaches typically used individually to assess climate change impacts. Current invasion risk is widespread in southeastern states for all three species, although cogongrass invasion risk is more restricted to the Gulf Coast. Climate change is likely to enable all three species to greatly expand their ranges. Risk from privet and kudzu expands north into Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and New England states by 2100. Risk from cogongrass expands as far north as Kentucky and Virginia. Heightened surveillance and prompt eradication of small pockets of invasion in northern states should be a management priority.

AB The dynamics of natural populations are thought to be dominated by demographic and environmental processes with little influence of intraspecific genetic variation and natural selection, apart from inbreeding depression possibly reducing population growth in small populations. Here we analyse hundreds of well-characterised local populations in a large metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia), which persists in a balance between stochastic local extinctions and recolonisations in a network of 4,000 discrete habitat patches. We show that the allelic composition of the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) has a significant effect on the growth of local populations, consistent with previously reported effects of allelic variation on flight metabolic performance and fecundity in the Glanville fritillary and Colias butterflies. The strength and the sign of the molecular effect on population growth are sensitive to the ecological context (the area and spatial connectivity of the habitat patches), which affects genotype-specific gene flow and the influence of migration on the dynamics of local populations. The biological significance of the results for Pgi is underscored by lack of any association between population growth and allelic variation at six other loci typed in the same material. In demonstrating, to our knowledge for the first time, that molecular variation in a candidate gene affects population growth, this study challenges the perception that differential performance of individual genotypes, leading to differential fitness, is irrelevant to population dynamics. These results also demonstrate that the spatial configuration of habitat and spatial dynamics of populations contribute to maintenance of Pgi polymorphism in this species.

AB Eight traditional subspecies of tiger (Panthera tigris), of which three recently became extinct, are commonly recognized on the basis of geographic isolation and morphological characteristics. To investigate the species' evolutionary history and to establish objective methods for subspecies recognition, voucher specimens of blood, skin, hair, and/or skin biopsies from 134 tigers with verified geographic origins or heritage across the whole distribution range were examined for three molecular markers: (1) 4.0 kb of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence; (2) allele variation in the nuclear major histocompatibility complex class II DRB gene; and (3) composite nuclear microsatellite genotypes based on 30 loci. Relatively low genetic variation with mtDNA, DRB, and microsatellite loci was found, but significant population subdivision was nonetheless apparent among five living subspecies. In addition, a distinct partition of the Indochinese subspecies P. t. corbetti into northern Indochinese and Malayan Peninsula populations was discovered. Population genetic structure would suggest recognition of six taxonomic units or subspecies: (1) Amur tiger P. t. altaica; (2) northern Indochinese tiger P. t. corbetti; (3) South China tiger P. t. amoyensis; (4) Malayan tiger P. t. jacksoni, named for the tiger conservationist Peter Jackson; (5) Sumatran tiger P. t. sumatrae; and (6) Bengal tiger P. t. tigris. The proposed South China tiger lineage is tentative due to limited sampling. The age of the most recent common ancestor for tiger mtDNA was estimated to be 72,000-108,000 y, relatively younger than some other Panthera species. A combination of population expansions, reduced gene flow, and genetic drift following the last genetic diminution, and the recent anthropogenic range contraction, have led to the distinct genetic partitions. These results provide an explicit basis for subspecies recognition and will lead to the improved management and conservation of these recently isolated but distinct geographic populations of tigers.

AB Here, model allowing covarion-like evolution of DNA sequences is introduced. In contrast to standard representation of the distribution of evolutionary rates, this model allows the site-specific rate to vary between lineages. This is achieved by adding as few as two parameters to the widely used among-site rate variation model, namely, (1) the proportion of sites undergoing rate changes and (2) the rate of rate change. This model is implemented in the likelihood framework, allowing parameter estimation, comparison of models, and tree reconstruction. An application to ribosomal RNA sequences suggests that covarions (i.e., site-specific rate changes) play an important role in the evolution of these molecules. Neglecting them results in a severe underestimate of the variance of rates across sites. It has, however, little influence on the estimation of ancestral G+C contents obtained from a nonhomogeneous model, or on the resulting inferences about the evolution of thermophyly. This theoretical effort should be useful for the study of protein adaptation, which presumably proceeds in a typical covarion-like manner.

AB Although it is generally accepted that females can gain material benefits by mating with more than one male, the proposal that polyandry provides genetic benefits remains controversial, largely because direct experimental support is lacking. Here, we report the results of a study testing for genetic benefits to polyandry in the pseudoscorpion Cordylochernes scorpioides, In an experiment that controlled for male mating experience and the number of spermatophores accepted by a female, twice-mated females received either one sperm-packet from each of two different males (the "DM" treatment) or two sperm-packets from a single male (the same male or "SM" treatment), Over their lifetime, DM females gave birth to 32% more offspring than did SM females, primarily because of a significantly reduced rate of spontaneous abortion. This result could not be attributed to male infertility nor to lack of sexual receptivity in males paired with previous mates, Spermatophore and sperm numbers did not differ between males presented with a previous mate and males paired with a new female. Because SM and DM females received the same quantity of ejaculate, it was possible to eliminate material benefits as a contributor to the enhanced reproductive success of DM females, The reduction in embryo failure rate achieved by DM females is most consistent with the genetic incompatibility avoidance hypothesis, i.e., that polyandry enables females to exploit postcopulatory mechanisms for reducing the risk and/or cost of fertilization by genetically incompatible sperm. This study, which rigorously controlled for material benefits and excluded inbreeding effects, demonstrates that polyandry provides genetic benefits that significantly enhance female lifetime reproductive success.

AB Analyses of both the nucleotide and amino acid sequences derived from all 13 mitochondrial protein-encoding genes (12,234 bp) of 19 metazoan species, including that of the lancelet Branchiostoma floridae ("amphioxus"), fail to yield the widely accepted phylogeny for chordates and, within chordates, for vertebrates. Given the breadth and the compelling nature of the data supporting that phylogeny, relationships supported by the mitochondrial sequence comparisons are almost certainly incorrect, despite their being supported by equally weighted parsimony, distance, and maximum-likelihood analyses. The incorrect groupings probably result in part from convergent base-compositional similarities among some of the taxa, similarities that are strong enough to overwhelm the historical signal. Comparisons among very distantly related taxa are likely to be particularly susceptible to such artifacts, because the historical signal is already greatly attenuated. Empirical results underscore the need for approaches to phylogenetic inference that go beyond simple site-by-site comparison of aligned sequences. This study and others indicate that, once a sequence sample of reasonable size has been obtained, accurate phylogenetic estimation may be better served by incorporating knowledge of molecular structures and processes into inference models and by seeking additional higher order characters embedded in those sequences, than by gathering ever larger sequence samples from the same organisms in the hope that the historical signal will eventually prevail.

AB Physical and functional properties of foliage were measured at a variety of microsites in a broad-leaved Nothofagus fusca (Hook. f.) Orst. canopy. The light climate of the foliage at these sites was monitored for 39 days in the late spring and early summer with in situ sensors. Foliage nitrogen content (N), mean leaf angle, and gas exchange characteristics were all correlated with the amount of light reaching the microsites during foliage development. Foliage N content on a leaf area basis ranged between similar to 1 and 2.5 g N m(-2) and was highest at the brightest sites. Light-saturated photosynthetic rates ranged between similar to 4 and 9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), increasing from the darkest to brightest sites.
   A biochemical model of photosynthesis was fitted to foliage characteristics at the different microsites and used to integrate foliage assimilation among the sites over 39 days. The actual arrangement of foliage physiological characteristics in the observed microsites led to higher total canopy rates of net assimilation than >99% of the combinations of observed foliage characteristics randomly assigned to the observed microsites. Additional simulations first related the maximum rates of electron transport (J(max)), ribulose bisphosphate turnover (V-e,V-max), and dark respiration (R(d)) Of Nothofagus fusca foliage to nitrogen content and then allowed foliage N (and consequently leaf gas exchange characteristics) to vary across the canopy. The observed N allocation pattern results in greater total canopy assimilation than uniform or >99% of the simulations with random distributions of N among the microsites (constrained so that the total N allocated was equivalent to that observed in the microsites). However, the observed pattern of N allocation places less N in the brightest microsites and results in substantially less total assimilation than a simulated canopy in which N was allocated in an optimal manner where the N distribution is such that the partial derivative of leaf assimilation (A) with respect to leaf nitrogen content, partial derivative A/partial derivative N, is constant among microsites. These results suggest that other factors such as wind or herbivory reduce the integrated assimilation of high-N foliage relatively more than lower-N foliage and that a partial derivative A/partial derivative N optimality criteria based only on formulations of leaf gas exchange overestimate canopy assimilation.

AB Conservation requires the accurate targeting of resources together with information on population processes. Molecular phylogenies can potentially contribute in both areas. Interspecific molecular phylogenies can identify clades undergoing rapid diversification or extinction and can assess the contribution of individual lineages to overall genetic diversity. Whether and how this should translate to conservation priorities is open to debate. Within species, molecular phylogenies along with information on allele frequencies can be used to identify evolutionarily significant population units or areas. In relation to population processes, molecular phylogenies may provide a perspective on population growth and connectivity over evolutionary time. As threatened species typically have undergone rapid changes in population size and/or migration rate, phylogeny-based estimates may be misleading about contemporary population processes. However, the comparison between historical and current estimates may identify significant changes to long-term trends, thus identifying population in need of urgent management. This information can potentially suggest strategies for managing declining or fragmented species, but this requires further theoretical and experimental study.

AB Plant economics run on carbon and nutrients instead of money. Leaf strategies aboveground span an economic spectrum from "live fast and die young" to "slow and steady," but the economy defined by root strategies belowground remains unclear. Here, we take a holistic view of the belowground economy and show that root-mycorrhizal collaboration can short circuit a one-dimensional economic spectrum, providing an entire space of economic possibilities. Root trait data from 1810 species across the globe confirm a classical fast-slow "conservation" gradient but show that most variation is explained by an orthogonal "collaboration" gradient, ranging from "do-it-yourself" resource uptake to "outsourcing" of resource uptake to mycorrhizal fungi. This broadened "root economics space" provides a solid foundation for predictive understanding of belowground responses to changing environmental conditions.

AB Phenotypic traits influence species distributions, but ecology lacks established links between multidimensional phenotypes and fitness for predicting species responses to environmental change. The common focus on single traits rather than multiple trait combinations limits our understanding of their adaptive value, and intraspecific trait covariation has been neglected in ecology despite its importance in evolutionary theory and its likely impact on species distributions. Here, we extend the adaptive landscape framework to ecological sorting of multidimensional phenotypes across environments and discuss how two analytical approaches can be used to quantify fitness as a function of the interaction between the phenotype and the environment. We encourage ecologists to consider how phenotypic integration will constrain species responses to environmental change.

AB Although plants have moved across the landscape in response to changing climate for millennia, projections of contemporary climate change suggest that forest tree species and populations will need to migrate faster than their natural ability. Therefore, climate change adaptation strategies, such as assisted migration, have gained attention since 2007. Effective implementation of assisted migration can only occur if target transfer guidelines are developed because our current seed transfer guidelines, established to guide the movement of plant materials, lack inherent spatial and temporal dynamics associated with climate change. This limitation restrains reforestation practitioners from making decisions about assisted migration. Lack of operating procedures, uncertainties about future climate conditions, risks associated with moving plants outside their current ranges, and existing policies have hampered formal actions in forest management and conservation. We review the current thinking on assisted migration of forest tree species and provide information that could facilitate implementation.

AB Species distribution modelling (SDM) is a widely used tool and has many applications in ecology and conservation biology. Spatial autocorrelation (SAC), a pattern in which observations are related to one another by their geographic distance, is common in georeferenced ecological data. SAC in the residuals of SDMs violates the independent errors assumption required to justify the use of statistical models in modelling species distributions. The autologistic modelling approach accounts for SAC by including an additional term (the autocovariate) representing the similarity between the value of the response variable at a location and neighbouring locations. However, autologistic models have been found to introduce bias in the estimation of parameters describing the influence of explanatory variables on habitat occupancy. To address this problem we developed an extension to the autologistic approach by calculating the autocovariate on SAC in residuals (the RAC approach). Performance of the new approach was tested on simulated data with a known spatial structure and on strongly autocorrelated mangrove species distribution data collected in northern Australia. The RAC approach was implemented as generalized linear models (GLMs) and boosted regression tree (BRT) models. We found that the BRT models with only environmental explanatory variables can account for some SAC, but applying the standard autologistic or RAC approaches further reduced SAC in model residuals and substantially improved model predictive performance. The RAC approach showed stronger inferential performance than the standard autologistic approach, as parameter estimates were more accurate and statistically significant variables were accurately identified. The new RAC approach presented here has the potential to account for spatial autocorrelation while maintaining strong predictive and inferential performance, and can be implemented across a range of modelling approaches.

AB The goal of this synthesis is to initiate development of a unified framework for threshold assessment that is able to link ecological theory and processes with management knowledge and application. Specific objectives include the investigation of threshold mechanisms, elaboration of threshold components, introduction of threshold categories and trajectories, and presentation of an operational definition of ecological thresholds. A greater understanding of ecological thresholds is essential because they have become a focal point within the state-and-transition framework and their occurrence has critical consequences for land management. Threshold occurrence may be best interpreted as a switch from the dominance of negative feedbacks that maintain ecosystem resilience to the dominance of positive feedbacks that degrade resilience and promote the development of post-threshold states on individual ecological sites. Threshold categories have been identified to serve as ecological benchmarks to describe the extent of threshold progression and increase insight into feedback mechanisms that determine threshold reversibility. Threshold trajectories describe the developmental pathway that post-threshold states may follow once a threshold has been exceeded. These trajectories may produce a continuum of potential post-threshold states, but the majority of them may be organized into four broad states. This framework lends itself to management application by providing an operational definition of thresholds that is based on a probabilistic interpretation. Probabilities associated with 1) the occurrence of triggers that initiate threshold progression, 2) the trajectory of post-threshold states, and 3) threshold reversibility will provide an operational procedure for threshold assessment and application. If thresholds are to play a central role in rangeland ecology and management, then the rangeland profession must accept responsibility for their conceptual development, ecological validity, and managerial effectiveness.

AB Cultural ecosystem services, such as aesthetic and recreational enjoyment, as well as sense of place and local identity, play an outstanding role in the contribution of landscapes to human well-being. Online data shared on social networks, particularly geo-tagged photos, are becoming an increasingly attractive source of information about cultural ecosystem services. Landscape photographs tell about the significance of human relationships with landscapes, human practices in landscapes and the landscape features that might possess value in terms of cultural ecosystem services. Despite all the recent advances in this emerging methodological approach, some challenges remain to be explored: (a) how to assess a broad suite of cultural ecosystem services, beyond aesthetic beauty of landscapes, (b) how to identify the landscape features that are relevant for providing cultural ecosystem services and determine trade-offs and synergies among cultural ecosystem services. To address these challenges, we have developed a methodological approach suitable for eliciting the importance of cultural ecosystem services and the landscape features underpinning their provision across five different sites in Europe (in Estonia, Greece, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland). We have performed a content analysis of 1.404 photos uploaded in Flickr and Panoramio platforms that can represent cultural ecosystem services. Four bundles of landscapes features and cultural ecosystem services showed the relation of recreation with mountain areas (terrestrial recreation) and with water bodies (aquatic recreation). Cultural heritage, social and spiritual values were particularly attached to landscapes with woodpastures and grasslands, as well as urban features and infrastructures, i.e. to more anthropogenic landscapes. A positive though weak relationship was found between landscape diversity and cultural ecosystem services diversity. Particularly wood-pastures and shrubs were more frequently portrayed in all study sites in comparison with their actual land cover. The results can be of interest both for methodological purposes in the face of an increasing trend in the use of geo-tagged photos in the ecosystem services research and for the elicitation and comparison of landscape values across European cultural landscapes.

AB Invasive alien species (IAS) are considered one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, particularly through their interactions with other drivers of change. Horizon scanning, the systematic examination of future potential threats and opportunities, leading to prioritization of IAS threats is seen as an essential component of IAS management. Our aim was to consider IAS that were likely to impact on native biodiversity but were not yet established in the wild in Great Britain. To achieve this, we developed an approach which coupled consensus methods (which have previously been used for collaboratively identifying priorities in other contexts) with rapid risk assessment. The process involved two distinct phases:
   1. Preliminary consultation with experts within five groups (plants, terrestrial invertebrates, freshwater invertebrates, vertebrates and marine species) to derive ranked lists of potential IAS. 2. Consensus-building across expert groups to compile and rank the entire list of potential IAS.
   Five hundred and ninety-one species not native to Great Britain were considered. Ninety-three of these species were agreed to constitute at least a medium risk (based on score and consensus) with respect to them arriving, establishing and posing a threat to native biodiversity. The quagga mussel, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, received maximum scores for risk of arrival, establishment and impact; following discussions the unanimous consensus was to rank it in the top position. A further 29 species were considered to constitute a high risk and were grouped according to their ranked risk. The remaining 63 species were considered as medium risk, and included in an unranked long list. The information collated through this novel extension of the consensus method for horizon scanning provides evidence for underpinning and prioritizing management both for the species and, perhaps more importantly, their pathways of arrival. Although our study focused on Great Britain, we suggest that the methods adopted are applicable globally.

AB Ecosystem services mapping and modeling has focused more on supply than demand, until recently. Whereas the potential provision of economic benefits from ecosystems to people is often quantified through ecological production functions, the use of and demand for ecosystem services has received less attention, as have the spatial flows of services from ecosystems to people. However, new modeling approaches that map and quantify service-specific sources (ecosystem capacity to provide a service), sinks (biophysical or anthropogenic features that deplete or alter service flows), users (user locations and level of demand), and spatial flows can provide a more complete understanding of ecosystem services. Through a case study in Puget Sound, Washington State, USA, we quantify and differentiate between the theoretical or in situ provision of services, i.e., ecosystems' capacity to supply services, and their actual provision when accounting for the location of beneficiaries and the spatial connections that mediate service flows between people and ecosystems. Our analysis includes five ecosystem services: carbon sequestration and storage, riverine flood regulation, sediment regulation for reservoirs, open space proximity, and scenic viewsheds. Each ecosystem service is characterized by different beneficiary groups and means of service flow. Using the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) methodology we map service supply, demand, and flow, extending on simpler approaches used by past studies to map service provision and use. With the exception of the carbon sequestration service, regions that actually provided services to people, i.e., connected to beneficiaries via flow paths, amounted to 16-66% of those theoretically capable of supplying services, i.e., all ecosystems across the landscape. These results offer a more complete understanding of the spatial dynamics of ecosystem services and their effects, and may provide a sounder basis for economic valuation and policy applications than studies that consider only theoretical service provision and/or use.

AB Aim Comparative analyses of fire regimes at large geographical scales can potentially identify ecological and climatic controls of fire. Here we describe Australia's broad fire regimes, and explore interrelationships and trade-offs between fire regime components. We postulate that fire regime patterns will be governed by trade-offs between moisture, productivity, fire frequency and fire intensity. Location Australia. Methods We reclassified a vegetation map of Australia, defining classes based on typical fuel and fire types. Classes were intersected with a climate classification to derive a map of fire regime niches'. Using expert elicitation and a literature search, we validated each niche and characterized typical and extreme fire intensities and return intervals. Satellite-derived active fire detections were used to determine seasonal patterns of fire activity. Results Fire regime characteristics are closely related to the latitudinal gradient in summer monsoon activity. Frequent low-intensity fires occur in the monsoonal north, and infrequent, high-intensity fires in the temperate south, demonstrating a trade-off between frequency and intensity: that is, very high-intensity fires are only associated with very low-frequency fire regimes in the high biomass eucalypt forests of southern Australia. While these forests occasionally experience extremely intense fires (>50,000kWm1), such regimes are exceptional, with most of the continent dominated by grass fuels, typically burning with lower intensity (<5000kWm1). Main conclusions Australia's fire regimes exhibit a coherent pattern of frequent, grass-fuelled fires in many differing vegetation types. While eucalypts are a quintessential Australian entity, their contribution as a dominant driver of high-intensity fire regimes, via their litter and bark fuels, is restricted to the forests of the continent's southern and eastern extremities. Our analysis suggests that the foremost driver of fire regimes at the continental scale is not productivity, as postulated conceptually, but the latitudinal gradient in summer monsoon rainfall activity.

AB The 50/500 rule has been used as a guiding principle in conservation for assessing minimum viable effective population size (N-e). There is much confusion in the recent literature about how the 500 value should be applied to assess extinction risk and set priorities in conservation biology. Here, we argue that the confusion arises when the genetic basis for a short-term N-e of 50 to avoid inbreeding depression is used to justify a long-term N-e of 500 to maintain evolutionary potential. This confusion can result in misleading conclusions about how genetic arguments alone are sufficient to set minimum viable population (MVP) thresholds for assessing the extinction risk of threatened species, especially those that emphasize that MVPs should be in the thousands to maintain evolutionary potential.

AB The authors consider Bayesian analysis for continuous-time Markov chain models based on a conditional reference prior. For such models, inference of the elapsed time between chain observations depends heavily on the rate of decay of the prior as the elapsed time increases. Moreover, improper priors on the elapsed time may lead to improper posterior distributions. In addition, an infinitesimal rate matrix also characterizes this class of models. Experts often have good prior knowledge about the parameters of this matrix. The authors show that the use of a proper prior for the rate matrix parameters together with the conditional reference prior for the elapsed time yields a proper posterior distribution. The authors also demonstrate that, when compared to analyses based on priors previously proposed in the literature, a Bayesian analysis on the elapsed time based on the conditional reference prior possesses better frequentist properties. The type of prior thus represents a better default prior choice for estimation software.

AB We aimed to gain knowledge on the changes in intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climate change over the last century. We investigated the variation in the iWUE of mature Fagus sylvatica trees located in the higher, central and lower altitudinal forest limits (HFL, CFA and LFL) of one of the southernmost sites of beech distribution in Europe, the Montseny Mountains in Catalonia (northeast Spain), during the last century by analysing the delta C-13 of their tree rings. Pre- and post-maturation phases of the trees presented different trends in delta C-13, Delta C-13, Ci (internal CO2 concentration), iWUE and basal area increment (BAI). Moreover, these variables showed different trends and absolute values in the LFL than in the other altitudinal sites, CFA and HFL. Our results show the existence of an age effect on delta C-13 in the CFA and HFL (values increased by ca. 1.25 parts per thousand coinciding with the BAI suppression and release phases, previous to maturation). These age-related changes were not found in the LFL, whose beech trees arrived to maturation earlier and experienced drier conditions during the suppression phase. In the last 26 years of comparable mature trees, the increase of iWUE deduced from the Delta C-13 analyses was ca. 10% in LFL, ca. 6% in CFA and not significant in HFL. These results show that climate change towards more arid conditions accounted for these higher Delta C-13-values and increases in the LFL more than the continuous increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This increased iWUE in the LFL did not avoid a decline in growth in these lowest altitudes of this beech southern range-edge as a result of warming. Furthermore, since there was no apparent change in iWUE and growth in the beech forests growing in the more standard-adequate environments of higher altitudes in the last 26 years, the rate of sequestration of C into temperate ecosystems may not increase with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations as predicted by most models based on short-term small scale experiments.

AB Algorithmic details to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of parameters on a large phylogeny are discussed. On a large tree, an efficient approach is to optimize branch lengths one at a time while updating parameters in the substitution model simultaneously. Codon substitution models that allow for variable nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios (omega = d(N)/d(S)) among sites are used to analyze a data set of human influenza virus type A hemagglutinin (HA) genes. The data set has 349 sequences. Methods for obtaining approximate estimates of branch lengths for codon models are explored, and the estimates are used to test fur positive selection and to identify sites under selection. Compared with results obtained from the exact method estimating all parameters by maximum likelihood, the approximate methods produced reliable results. The analysis identified a number of sites in the vital gene under diversifying Darwinian selection and demonstrated the importance of including many sequences in the data in detecting positive selection at individual sites.

AB 1. Distribution of leaf chlorophyll (Chi), nitrogen and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC, ethanol-soluble sugars and starch) in leaves along a natural light gradient was studied in saplings of four deciduous woody species: Acer platanoides, Padus avium, Populus tremula and Quercus robur (from most shade tolerant to intolerant).
   2. Leaf dry mass per area (LMA) increased linearly with increasing relative irradiance (RI) in all species and therefore it may be considered as a species-specific estimate of long-term light conditions.
   3. Decreasing irradiance enhanced chlorophyll synthesis, and consistently resulted in highest Chi per leaf dry mass in low-light environments. Chi content per leaf area was correlated negatively with RI in A. platanoides and was independent of RI in three other species.
   4. Leaf nitrogen content per leaf area (N-a) increased linearly with LMA in all species, and with RI in all except A. platanoides.
   5. The slopes and intercepts of N-a vs LMA relationships were negatively correlated. Moreover, it appeared that the slope decreased and the intercept increased with increasing species shade tolerance. Thus, average nitrogen content per mass (N-m) increases and maximum concentrations of leaf nitrogen shift towards more open habitats with decreasing shade tolerance. Distribution of foliar nitrogen in this way is likely to contribute to greater photosynthetic potentials at higher irradiances in shade-intolerant species. Inversely, more tolerant species have greater concentrations of foliar nitrogen at low irradiance - an investment pattern, which provides resources to enhance the capacity of light harvesting in light-limited conditions.
   6. NSC per leaf dry mass was positively related to relative irradiance and the slope of this relationship was highest for shade-intolerant species, which have intrinsically higher photosynthetic capacities. Nevertheless, the conclusions were robust and were not significantly biased by using the parameters expressed either on a total or on a NSC-free dry mass.
   7. The analysis was further extended by including a number of other species from several independent studies. Examination of both sets of data resulted in identical conclusions. Based on this evidence it may be concluded that the variability in leaf nitrogen concentration in relation to irradiance plays a central role in species shade tolerance.

AB Spatial and temporal variation in the recruitment of dispersive life stages can strongly affect the distribution, dynamics, structure, and gene flow of local populations. I investigated the causes of variable larval recruitment to populations of a temperate reef fish, the kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus). Spatial and temporal variation in the density of settlement habitat on a reef, the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), explained much of the variation in recruitment of kelp bass. Although recruitment was positively related to Macrocystis density, the relationship was asymptotic at high plant densities, indicating that kelp bass recruitment saturates at intermediate densities of Macrocystis (approximate to 100-130 stipes/ 30 m(2)). Field experiments demonstrated causation between Macrocystis density and kelp bass recruitment and indicated that kelp bass recruitment was linearly related to the local abundance of kelp structure (i.e., the number and biomass of overlapping Macrocystis blades). This linear (nonasymptotic) relationship between Macrocystis blade biomass and density of fish recruits indicated that both the quantity and quality of the recruitment habitat limited larval recruitment. Structural complexity per unit length of plant (e.g., blade biomass per unit plant length) was inversely related to plant density. This relationship underlies the asymptotic relationship between structural complexity per unit reef area (the product of per-plant structural complexity and plant density) and recruit density. Thus, density-dependent constraints on blade biomass in this macroalga, rather than larval supply, better explained the general asymptotic nature of the relationship between Macrocystis and kelp bass recruitment. These results indicate that density-dependent effects on plant biomass and architecture (e.g., plant height and structural complexity), common among both macrophytes and terrestrial plants, can greatly influence the relationship between plant density and recruitment of other species. For organisms with dispersive life stages whose local recruitment is influenced by the occurrence of living habitat structure, spatial and temporal variability characteristic of such biogenic habitats can be a major source of variation in their recruitment.

AB It is well established that resource quantity and elemental stoichiometry play major roles in shaping below and aboveground plant biodiversity, but their importance for shaping microbial diversity in soil remains unclear. Here, we used statistical modeling on a regional database covering 179 locations and six ecosystem types across Scotland to evaluate the roles of total carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availabilities and ratios, together with land use, climate and biotic and abiotic factors, in determining regional scale patterns of soil bacterial diversity. We found that bacterial diversity and composition were primarily driven by variation in soil resource stoichiometry (total C:N:P ratios), itself linked to different land uses, and secondarily driven by other important biodiversity drivers such as climate, soil spatial heterogeneity, soil pH, root influence (plant-soil microbe interactions) and microbial biomass (soil microbe-microbe interactions). In aggregate, these findings provide evidence that nutrient stoichiometry is a strong predictor of bacterial diversity and composition at a regional scale.

AB Research into the benefits that ecosystems contribute to human wellbeing has multiplied over the last few years following from the seminal contributions of the international Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. In comparison, the fact that some ecosystem goods and services undermine or harm human wellbeing has been seriously overlooked. These negative impacts have become known as ecosystem disservices. The neglect of ecosystem disservices is problematic because investments into the management or reduction of ecosystem disservices may yield better outcomes for human wellbeing, or at a lower investment, than management of ecosystem services. Additionally, management to optimise specific ecosystem services may simultaneously exacerbate associated disservices. We posit that one reason for the neglect of ecosystem disservices from the discourse and policy debates around ecosystems and human wellbeing is because there is no widely accepted definition or typology of ecosystem disservices. Here, we briefly examine current understandings of the term ecosystem disservices and offer a definition and a working typology to help generate debate, policy and management options around ecosystem disservices. We differentiate ecosystem disservices from natural hazards and social hazards, consider some of their inherent properties and then classify them into six categories. A variety of examples are used to illustrate the different types of, and management strategies to, ecosystem disservices.

AB Understanding the flow of ecosystem services and the capacity of ecosystems to generate these services is an essential element for understanding the sustainability of ecosystem use as well as developing ecosystem accounts. We conduct spatially explicit analyses of nine ecosystem services in Telemark County, Southern Norway. The ecosystem services included are moose hunting, sheep grazing, timber harvest, forest carbon sequestration and storage, snow slide prevention, recreational residential amenity, recreational hiking and existence of areas without technical interference. We conceptually distinguish capacity to provide ecosystem services from the actual flow of services, and empirically assess both. This is done by means of different spatial models, developed with various available datasets and methods, including (multiple layer) look-up tables, causal relations between datasets (including satellite images), environmental regression and indicators derived from direct measurements. Capacity and flow differ both in spatial extent and in quantities. We discuss five conditions for a meaningful spatial capacity-flow-balance. These are (1) a conceptual difference between capacity and flow, (2) spatial explicitness of capacity and flow, (3) the same spatial extent of both, (4) rivalry or congestion, and (5) measurement with aligned indicators. We exemplify spatially explicit balances between capacity and flow for two services, which meet these five conditions. Research in the emerging field of mapping ES should focus on the development of compatible indicators for capacity and flow. The distinction of capacity and flow of ecosystem services provides a parsimonious estimation of over- or underuse of the respective service. Assessment of capacity and flow in a spatially explicit way can thus support monitoring sustainability of ecosystem use, which is an essential element of ecosystem accounting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The 26 definitions of species often yield different numbers of species and disparate groupings, with financial, legal, biological and conservation implications. Using conservation genetic considerations, we demonstrate that different species concepts have a critical bearing on our ability to conserve species. Many species of animals and plants persist as small isolated populations suffering inbreeding depression, loss of genetic diversity, and elevated extinction risks. Such small populations usually can be rescued by restoring gene flow, but substantial genetic drift effects can lead them to be classified as distinct species under the diagnostic phylogenetic species concept. Minimum harm to fitness is done and maximum potential fitness and evolutionary potential benefits accrue when reproductive isolation (pre- and/or post-zygotic) is used as the criterion to define distinct species. For sympatric populations, distinct species are diagnosed by very limited gene flow. For allopatric populations, both minimal gene flow and evidence of reduced reproductive fitness in crosses (or effects predicted from adaptive differentiation among populations and/or fixed chromosomal differences) are required to satisfy conservation issues. Species delineations based upon the biological and differential fitness species concepts meet the above requirements. Conversely, if species are delineated using the diagnostic phylogenetic species concept, genetic rescue of small genetically isolated populations may require crosses between species, with consequent legal and regulatory ramifications that could preclude actions to prevent extinction. Consequently, we conclude that the diagnostic phylogenetic species concept is unsuitable for use in conservation contexts, especially for classifying allopatric populations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is a great interest in ecology in understanding the role of soil microbial diversity for plant productivity and coexistence. Recent research has shown increases in species richness of mutualistic soil fungi, the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), to be related to increases in aboveground productivity of plant communities. However, the impact of AMF richness on plant-plant interactions has not been determined. Moreover, it is unknown whether species-rich AMF communities can act as insurance to maintain productivity in a fluctuating environment (e.g., upon changing soil conditions).
   We tested the impact of four different AMF taxa and of AMF diversity (no AMF, single AMF taxa, and all four together) on competitive interactions between the legume Trifolium pratense and the grass Lolium multiflorum grown under two different soil conditions of low and high sand content. We hypothesized that more diverse mutualistic interactions (e.g., when four AMF taxa are present) can ease competitive effects between plants, increase plant growth, and maintain plant productivity across different soil environments. We used quantitative PCR to verify that AMF taxa inoculated at the beginning of the experiment were still present at the end.
   The presence of AMF reduced the competitive inequality between the two plant species by reducing the growth suppression of the legume by the grass. High AMF richness enhanced the combined biomass production of the two plant species and the yield of the legume, particularly in the more productive soil with low sand content. In the less productive (high sand content) soil, the single most effective AMF had an equally beneficial effect on plant productivity as the mixture of four AMF. Since contributions of single AMF to plant productivity varied between both soils, higher AMF richness would be required to maintain plant productivity in heterogeneous environments. Overall this work shows that AMF diversity promotes plant productivity and that AMF diversity can act as insurance to sustain plant productivity under changing environmental conditions.

AB Captive breeding for species of conservation concern is the act of bringing rare or endangered animals into captivity with the hope of rearing sustained captive populations for eventual reintroduction into the wild. Within captivity, genetic changes can occur that may reduce a species' ability to persist once a population is reintroduced back into its natural habitat. We sought to determine the efficacy of recommendations made to minimize genetic adaptation to captivity by addressing the following questions: (i) Are these recommendations already being carried out in captive programs? (ii) How practical is each recommendation? and (iii) Which recommendations call for future investigation? We performed an extensive search of the published literature for studies of non-domestic, non-model, captive animals in which the investigators used and reported a strategy that can minimize genetic adaptation to the captive environment. We found different forms of each recommendation already being executed in captive programs to varying degrees. in all, we reviewed 90 articles covering four broad categories of strategies. We conclude that the best approach to minimize genetic adaptation is to reduce the number of generations that a species spends in captivity. If this is not possible, then we suggest attempting to minimize generations first by delaying reproduction and then by cryopreservation of germplasm. Other strategies are effective to varying degrees depending on the species' natural history. A large gap in the current literature is the interactive effects of multiple strategies being implemented simultaneously, future research should focus on this issue. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over-exploitation and habitat degradation are the two major drivers of global environmental change and are responsible for local extinctions and declining ecosystem services. Here we compare the top-down effect of exploitation by fishing with the bottom-up influence of habitat loss on fish communities in the most diverse of ecological systems, coral reefs. Using a combination of multivariate techniques and path analyses, we illustrate that the relative importance of coral cover and fishing in controlling fish abundance on remote Fijian reefs varies between species and functional groups. A decline in branching Acropora coral is strongly associated with a decline in abundance of coral-feeding species, and a decrease in coral-associated habitat complexity, which has indirectly contributed to reduced abundance of small-bodied damselfish. In contrast, reduced fishing pressure, brought about by declining human populations and a shift to alternate livelihoods, is associated with increased abundance of some piscivores and fisheries target species. However, availability of prey is controlled by coral-associated habitat complexity and appears to be a more important driver of total piscivore abundance compared with fishing pressure. Effects of both fishing and coral loss are stronger on individual species than functional groups, as variation in the relative importance of fishing or coral loss among species within the same functional group attenuated the impact of either of these potential drivers at the functional level. Overall, fishing continues to have an influence on Fijian fish communities; however, habitat loss is currently the overriding agent of change. The importance of coral loss mediated by climate change is expected to have an increasing contribution to fish community dynamics, particularly in remote locations or where the influence of fishing is waning.

AB Climate change has already altered global patterns of biodiversity by modifying the geographic distributions of species. Forecasts based on bioclimatic envelop modeling of distributions of species suggests greater impacts can be expected in the future, but such projections are contingent on assumptions regarding future climate and migration rates of species. Here, we present a first assessment of the potential impact of climate change on a global biodiversity hotspot in southwestern Western Australia. Across three representative scenarios of future climate change, we simulated migration of 100 Banksia (Proteaceae) species at a rate of 5 km decade(-1) and compared projected impacts with those under the commonly applied, but acknowledged as inadequate, assumptions of 'full-' and 'no-migration.' Across all climate x migration scenarios, 66% of species were projected to decline, whereas only 6% were projected to expand or remain stable. Between 5% and 25% of species were projected to suffer range losses of 100% by 2080, depending mainly on climate scenario. Species losses were driven primarily by changes in current precipitation regimes, with the greatest losses of species projected to occur in a transition zone between wet coastal areas and interior arid regions and which is projected to become more arid in the future. Because the ranges of most species tended to collapse in all climate scenarios, we found that climate change impacts to flora of southwestern Western Australia may be large, even under optimistic assumptions regarding migration abilities. Taken together, our results suggest that the future of biodiversity in southwestern Western Australia may lie largely in the degree to which this hotspot experiences increased drought and in the ability of species to tolerate such decreases in precipitation. More broadly, our study is among a growing number of theoretical studies suggesting the impacts of future climate change on global biodiversity may be considerable.

AB The increase in spring temperatures in temperate regions over the last two decades has led to an advancing spring phenology, and most resident birds have responded to it by advancing their onset of breeding. The pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) is a long-distance migrant bird with a relatively late onset of breeding with respect to both resident birds and spring phenology in Europe. In the present correlational study, we show that some fitness components of pied flycatchers are suffering from climate change in two of the southernmost European breeding populations. In both montane study areas, temperature during May increased between 1980 and 2000 and an advancement of oak leafing was detected by using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to assess tree phenology. This might result in an advancement of the peak in availability of caterpillars, the main prey during the nestling stage. Over the past 18 yr, the time of egg laying and clutch size of pied flycatchers were not affected by the increase in spring temperatures in these Mediterranean populations. However, this increase seems to have an adverse effect on the reproductive output of pied flycatchers over the same period. Our data suggest that the mismatch between the timing of peak food supply and nestling demand caused by recent climate change might result in a reduction of parental energy expenditure that is reflected in a reduction of nestling growth and survival of fledged young in our study populations. The data seem to indicate that the breeding season has not shifted and it is the environment that has shifted away from the timing of the pied flycatcher breeding season. Mediterranean pied flycatchers were not able to advance their onset of breeding, probably, because they are constrained by their late arrival date and their restricted high altitude breeding habitat selection near the southern border of their range.

AB Representatives of the genus Salamandra occur in Europe, Northern Africa and the Near East. Many local variants are known but species and subspecies status of these is still a matter of dispute. We have analysed samples from locations covering the whole expansion range of Salamandra by sequence analysis of mitochondrial D-loop regions. In addition, we have calibrated the rate of divergence of the D-loop on the basis of geologically dated splits of the closely related genus Euproctus. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences suggests that six major monophyletic groups exist (S. salamandra, S. algira, S. infraimmaculata, S. corsica, S. atra and S. lanzai) which have split between 5 and 13 million years ago (Ma). We find that each of the Salamandra species occupies a distinct geographical area, with the exception of S. salamandra. This species occurs all over Europe from Spain to Greece, suggesting that it was the only species that has recolonized Central Europe after the last glaciation. The occurrence of specific east and west European haplotypes, as well as allozyme alleles in the S. salamandra populations suggests that this recolonization has started from at least two source populations, possibly originating in the Iberian peninsula and the Balkans. Two subpopulations of S. salamandra were found that are genetically very distinct from the other populations. One lives in northern Spain (S. s. bernardezi) and one in southern Italy (S. s. gigliolii). Surprisingly, the mitochondrial lineages of these subpopulations group closer together than the remainder S. salamandra lineages. We suggest that these populations are remnants of a large homogeneous population that had colonized Central Europe in a previous interglacial period, approximately 500 000 years ago. Animals from these populations were apparently not successful in later recolonizations. Still, they have maintained their separate genetic identity in their areas, although they are not separated by geographical barriers from very closely related neighbouring populations.

AB For species with metapopulation structures, variation in abundance among patches can arise from variation in the input rate of colonists. For reef fishes, variability in larval supply frequently is invoked as a major determinant of spatial patterns. We examined the extent to which spatial variation in the amount of suitable habitat predicted variation in the abundance of the damselfish Dascyllus aruanus, an abundant planktivore that occupies live, branched coral throughout the Indo-Pacific. Reef surveys established that size, branching structure and location (proximity to sand) of the coral colonies together determined the "suitability" of microhabitats for different ontogenetic stages of D. aruanus. Once these criteria were known, patterns of habitat use were quantified within lagoons of five Pacific islands. Availability of suitable habitat generally was an excellent predictor of density, and patterns were qualitatively consistent at several spatial scales, including among different lagoons on the same island, among different islands and between the central (French Polynesia and Rarotonga) and western (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) South Pacific. A field experiment that varied the amount of suitable coral among local plots indicated that habitat for settlers accounted for almost all of the spatial variation in the number of D. aruanus that settled at that location, suggesting that spatial patterns of abundance can be established at settlement without spatial variation in larval supply. Surveys of four other species of reef-associated fish revealed that a substantial fraction of their spatial variation in density also was explained by availability of suitable reef habitat, suggesting that habitat may be a prevalent determinant of spatial patterns. The results underscore the critical need to identify accurately the resource requirements of different species and life stages when evaluating causes of spatial variation in abundance of reef fishes.

AB The effect of the growth of barley, wheat, prairie grass, Italian ryegrass, white clover and lupin on the aggregate stability and related properties of a heavily cropped soil was investigated in a greenhouse experiment. For the non-leguminous crops, root mass and root length followed the order barley = wheat < prairie grass < Italian ryegrass. Less marked, but similar trends were found for microbial biomass C, cold and hot water-extractable carbohydrate content and aggregate stability. It was postulated that a higher root mass results in greater rhizodeposition of carbonaceous material and, therefore, a higher microbial biomass which in turn produces carbohydrate binding agents which increase aggregate stability. The hot water-extractable carbohydrate fraction was found to have a galactose plus mannose-to-arabinose plus xylose ratio of 2.1 confirming that it was predominantly of microbial origin. In comparison with the non-legumes, growth of white clover and lupin resulted in an unexpectedly high aggregate stability and to a lesser extent microbial biomass C content relative to their rather small root mass and length. Lupin, for example, had the highest aggregate stability of all the crops, while white clover had an aggregate stability similar to that of Italian ryegrass yet the two legumes had the lowest root length densities of all the crops studied. It was suggested that the rhizosphere microbial population of leguminous plants differed in some way to that of non-legumes (possibly due to the higher N content of rhizodeposited material) and that this, contributed to the higher measured aggregate stability. A subsidiary experiment showed that fungal hyphal length in aggregates affected by lupin growth was four times that under wheat. There Is a need for further research into aggregation in the rhizosphere of a wider range of legumes. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In order to parametrize a leaf submodel of a canopy level gas-exchange model, a series of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance measurements were made on leaves of white oak (Quercus alba L,) and red maple (Acer rubrum L,) in a mature deciduous forest near Oak Ridge, TN, Gas-exchange characteristics of sun leaves growing at the top of a 30 m canopy and of shade leaves growing at a depth of 3-4 m from the top of the canopy were determined, Measured rates of net photosynthesis at a leaf temperature of 30 degrees C and saturating photosynthetic photon flux density, expressed on a leaf area basis, were significantly lower (P = 0.01; n = 8) in shade leaves (7.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) than in sun leaves (11.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Specific leaf area increased significantly with depth in the canopy, and when photosynthesis rates were expressed on a dry mass basis, they were not significantly different for shade and sun leaves, The percentage leaf nitrogen did not vary significantly with height in the canopy; thus, rates expressed on a per unit nitrogen basis were also not significantly different in shade and sun leaves, A widely used model integrating photosynthesis and stomatal conductance was parametrized independently for sun and shade leaves, enabling us to model successfully diurnal variations in photosynthesis and evapotranspiration of both classes of leaves, Key photosynthesis model parameters were found to scale with leaf nitrogen levels, The leaf model parametrizations were then incorporated into a canopy-scale gas-exchange model that is discussed and tested in a companion paper (Baldocchi & Harley 1995, Plant, Cell and Environment 18, 1157-1173).

AB Plants adapt phenotypically to different conditions of light and nutrient supply, supposedly in order to achieve colimitation of these resources. Their key variable of adjustment is the ratio of leaf area to root length, which relies on plant biomass allocation and organ morphology. We recorded phenotypic differences in leaf and root mass fractions (LMF, RMF), specific leaf area (SLA) and specific root length (SRL) of 12 herbaceous species grown in factorial combinations of high/low irradiance and fertilization treatments. Leaf area and root length ratios, and their components, were influenced by nonadditive effects between light and nutrient supply, and differences in the strength of plant responses were partly explained by Ellenberg's species values representing ecological optima. Changes in allocation were critical in plant responses to nutrient availability, as the RMF contribution to changes in root length was 2.5x that of the SRL. Contrastingly, morphological adjustments (SLA rather than LMF) made up the bulk of plant response to light availability. Our results suggest largely predictable differences in responses of species and groups of species to environmental change. Nevertheless, they stress the critical need to account for adjustments in below-ground mass allocation to understand the assembly and responses of communities in changing environments.

AB The increased availability of spatial data and methodological developments in species distribution modelling has lead to concurrent advances in phylogeography, broadening the scope of questions studied, as well as providing unprecedented insights. Given the species-specific nature of the information provided by ecological niche models (ENMs), whether it is on the environmental tolerances of species or their estimated distribution, today or in the past, it is perhaps not surprising that ENMs have rapidly become a common tool in phylogeographic analysis. Such information is essential to phylogeographic tests that provide important biological insights. Here, we provide an overview of the different applications of ENMs in phylogeographic studies, detailing specific studies and highlighting general limitations and challenges with each application. Given that the full potential of integrating ENMs into phylogeographic cannot be realized unless the ENMs themselves are carefully applied, we provide a summary of best practices with using ENMs. Lastly, we describe some recent advances in how quantitative information from ENMs can be integrated into genetic analyses, illustrating their potential use (and key concerns with such implementations), as well as promising areas for future development.

AB This article analyses the pressures on seahorses and explores conservation responses. It focuses on seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) but also considers pipefishes and seadragons, especially where they can fill gaps in seahorse knowledge. The charisma of many syngnathids can make them good flagship species for threats and solutions in marine conservation. The article combines a synthesis of published literature with new data on the trade in seahorses for traditional medicine, aquarium display and curiosities. Most traded seahorses come from trawl by-catch, although seahorses are also targeted. The total extraction is large, tens of millions of animals annually, and unsustainable. A first review of the effect of habitat change on syngnathids raises many questions, while suggesting that some species may cope better than others. The combination of pressures means that many species of syngnathid are now included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species or national equivalents. In addition, seahorse exports from 175 countries are limited to sustainable levels under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora. Possible conservation measures include marine protected areas, fisheries management, select aquaculture ventures, trade regulation, improved governance (particularly) and consumer engagement.

AB Temperature is one of the most important factors controlling the biogeographic distribution of seaweeds and is expected to increase due to the rise in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, especially in polar and cold-temperate regions. To estimate prospective distributional shifts in cold-water key structural seaweeds from both hemispheres, we related temperature requirements and recent distributions of seaweeds to observed mean sea surface temperature (SST) isotherms for the periods 1980-1999 (Meteorological Office Hadley Centre's SST data set; HadISST) and to modelled temperatures for 2080-2099 [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP3) database prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) report] based on moderate greenhouse gas emissions Special Report on Emission Scenarios - Scenario B1 (SRESA1B). Under this scenario, North Atlantic polar to cold-temperate seaweeds investigated will extend their distribution into the High Arctic until the end of the 21st century, but retreat along the northeastern Atlantic coastline. In contrast, selected Antarctic seaweeds will probably not significantly alter their latitudinal distributions, as deduced from our presently incomplete knowledge of their temperature requirements. We identified several cold-temperate regions where seaweed composition and abundance will certainly change with elevated temperatures. The results are discussed in the context of local temperature conditions, effects of multifactorial abiotic and biotic interactions and expected ecological consequences for seaweed-dominated ecosystems.

AB We illustrate the fundamental importance of fluctuations in natural water flows to the long-term sustainability and productivity of riverine ecosystems and their riparian areas. Natural flows are characterized by temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the magnitude, frequency, duration, timing, rate of change, and predictability of discharge. These characteristics, for a specific river or a collection of rivers within a defined region, shape species life histories over evolutionary (millennial) time scales as well as structure the ecological processes and productivity of aquatic and riparian communities. Extreme events - uncommon floods or droughts - are especially important in that they either reset or alter physical and chemical conditions underpinning the long-term development of biotic communities. We present the theoretical rationale for maintaining flow variability to sustain ecological communities and processes, and illustrate the importance of flow variability in two case studies - one from a semi-arid savanna river in South Africa and the other from a temperate rainforest river in North America. We then discuss the scientific challenges of determining the discharge patterns needed for environmental sustainability in a world where rivers, increasingly harnessed for human uses, are experiencing substantially altered flow characteristics relative to their natural states.

AB Aim To test statistical models used to predict species distributions under different shapes of occurrence-environment relationship. We addressed three questions: (1) Is there a statistical technique that has a consistently higher predictive ability than others for all kinds of relationships? (2) How does species prevalence influence the relative performance of models? (3) When an automated stepwise selection procedure is used, does it improve predictive modelling, and are the relevant variables being selected?
   Location We used environmental data from a real landscape, the state of California, and simulated species distributions within this landscape.
   Methods Eighteen artificial species were generated, which varied in their occurrence response to the environmental gradients considered (random, linear, Gaussian, threshold or mixed), in the interaction of those factors (no interaction vs. multiplicative), and on their prevalence (50% vs. 5%). The landscape was then randomly sampled with a large (n = 2000) or small (n = 150) sample size, and the predictive ability of each statistical approach was assessed by comparing the true and predicted distributions using five different indexes of performance (area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve, Kappa, correlation between true and predictive probability of occurrence, sensitivity and specificity). We compared generalized additive models (GAM) with and without flexible degrees of freedom, logistic regressions (general linear models, GLM) with and without variable selection, classification trees, and the genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP).
   Results Species with threshold and mixed responses, additive environmental effects, and high prevalence generated better predictions than did other species for all statistical models. In general, GAM outperforms all other strategies, although differences with GLM are usually not significant. The two variable-selection strategies presented here did not discriminate successfully between truly causal factors and correlated environmental variables.
   Main conclusions Based on our analyses, we recommend the use of GAM or GLM over classification trees or GARP, and the specification of any suspected interaction terms between predictors. An expert-based variable selection procedure was preferable to the automated procedures used here. Finally, for low-prevalence species, variability in model performance is both very high and sample-dependent. This suggests that distribution models for species with low prevalence can be improved through targeted sampling.

AB Introductions of non-indigenous species (NIS) are mostly discussed through their impact on biodiversity. However, NIS can also act as ecosystem engineers, influencing the habitat itself, positively or negatively, directly or indirectly, which should be included when making risk assessments. Special concern should be given to changes in ecological services provided by the ecosystem. Physically, NIS may affect the substrate itself, or alter habitat architecture, indirectly influencing water movements, sediment accumulation, and light conditions. Chemical changes brought upon by NIS occur both on small and large scales, some having positive effects on ecosystem services, others can perturb epibionts. Furthermore, NIS may negatively affect natural resources, aquaculture or create fouling communities, all resulting in a negative impact on economics. However, if removed, already established NIS can be used as bioremediators, having a positive effect on different ecosystems. Using NIS for habitat management may be economically profitable, but could affect the habitat adversely. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The lack of comprehensive sighting data sets precludes the application of standard habitat suitability modeling approaches to predict distributions of the majority of marine mammal species on very large scales. As an alternative, we developed an ecological niche model to map global distributions of 115 cetacean and pinniped species living in the marine environment using more readily available expert knowledge about habitat usage. We started by assigning each species to broad-scale niche categories with respect to depth, sea-surface temperature, and ice edge association based on synopses of published information. Within a global information system framework and a global grid of 0.5' latitude/longitude cell dimensions, we then generated an index of the relative environmental suitability (RES) of each cell for a given species by relating known habitat usage to local environmental conditions. RES predictions closely matched published maximum ranges for most species, thus representing useful, more objective alternatives to existing sketched distributional outlines. In addition, raster-based predictions provided detailed information about heterogeneous patterns of potentially suitable habitat for species throughout their range. We tested RES model outputs for 11 species (northern fur seal, harbor porpoise, sperm whale, killer whale, hourglass dolphin, fin whale, humpback whale, blue whale, Antarctic minke, and dwarf minke whales) from a broad taxonomic and geographic range, using data from dedicated surveys. Observed encounter rates and species-specific predicted environmental suitability were significantly and positively correlated for all but 1 species. In comparison, encounter rates were correlated with < 1 % of 1000 simulated random data sets for all but 2 species. Mapping of large-scale marine mammal distributions using this environmental envelope model is helpful for evaluating current assumptions and knowledge about species' occurrences, especially for data-poor species. Moreover, RES modeling can help to focus research efforts on smaller geographic scales and usefully supplement other, statistical, habitat suitability models.

AB Phytoremediation of organic pollutants depends on plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere, but the extent and intensity of such rhizosphere effects are likely to decrease with increasing distance from the root surface. We conducted a time-course pot experiment to measure dissipation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the rhizosphere of clover and ryegrass grown together on two industrially polluted soils (containing 0.4 and 2 g kg(-1) of 12 PAHs). The impact of the fungal root symbiosis arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) on PAH degradation was also assessed, as these fungi have previously improved plant establishment on PAH-polluted soils and enhanced PAH degradation in spiked soil. The two soils behaved differently with respect to the time-course of PAH dissipation. The less polluted and more highly organic soil showed low initial PAH dissipation rates, with small positive effects of plants after 13 weeks. At the final harvest (26 weeks), the amounts of PAHs extracted from nonplanted pots were higher than the initial concentrations. In parallel planted pots, PAH concentrations decreased as a function of proximity to roots. The most polluted soil showed higher initial PAH dissipation (25% during 13 weeks), but at the final harvest PAH concentrations had increased to values between the initial concentration and those at 13 weeks. An effect of root proximity was observed for the last harvest only. The presence of mycorrhiza generally enhanced plant growth and favored growth of clover at the expense of ryegrass. Mycorrhiza enhanced PAH dissipation when plant effects were observed.

AB Climatic variation associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a widespread influence on the population dynamics of many organisms worldwide. While previous analyses have related the dynamics of northern ungulates to the NAO, there has been no comparable assessment for the species rich assemblages of tropical and subtropical Africa. Census records for 11 ungulate species in South Africa's Kruger National Park over 1977-96 reveal severe population declines by seven species, which were inadequately explained by indices of ENSO or its effects on annual rainfall totals. An additional influence was an extreme reduction in dry season rainfall, concurrent with and perhaps related to a regional temperature rise, possibly a signal of global warming. Boundary fencing now restricts range shifts by such large mammals in response to climatic variation. Our models project near extirpation of three ungulate species from the park's fauna should these climatic conditions recur.

AB While there has been much recent interest about the relationships between plant diversity and plant productivity, much remains unknown about how the diversity of mycorrhizal fungi affects plant productivity. We investigated the effects of ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition and diversity on the productivity and growth characteristics of seedlings of two tree species (Pinus sylvetris and Betula pendula) as well as their interactions with each other. This involved setting up a mycorrhizal fungal diversity gradient from one to eight species using a design previously demonstrated to be able to separate diversity effects from compositional effects. We found that the eight mycorrhizal fungal species differed in their effects on seedling productivity and that the nature of effects was determined by the fertility of the substrate. Fungal species richness effects were also important in affecting seedling productivity over and above what could be explained by "sampling effect" but only in some situations. For B. pendula in a low fertility substrate there were clear positive causative effects between fungal species richness and productivity with the eight species treatment having over double the productivity of any of the eight monoculture treatments; no diversity effects were, however, detected in a high fertility substrate. For P. sylvestris in a high fertility substrate there were significant negative effects of fungal diversity on productivity while in a low fertility substrate no effects were apparent. The possible mechanistic bases for these results are discussed. The growth of P. sylvestris relative to that of B. pendula when grown in combination was unaffected by mycorrhizal treatments. Our results provide clear evidence that effects of mycorrhizal fungal diversity on productivity are context dependent and may be positive, negative or neutral depending on the situation considered.

This has hindered efforts to analyze fine-root trait variation and link it with plant function and environmental conditions at a global scale. This Viewpoint addresses the need for a centralized fine-root trait database, and introduces the Fine-Root Ecology Database (FRED, http://roots.ornl.gov) which so far includes >70 000 observations encompassing a broad range of root traits and also includes associated environmental data. FRED represents a critical step toward improving our understanding of below-ground plant ecology. For example, FRED facilitates the quantification of variation in fine-root traits across root orders, species, biomes, and environmental gradients while also providing a platform for assessments of covariation among root, leaf, and wood traits, the role of fine roots in ecosystem functioning, and the representation of fine roots in terrestrial biosphere models. Continued input of observations into FRED to fill gaps in trait coverage will improve our understanding of changes in fine-root traits across space and time.

AB Soil aggregation is a crucial aspect of ecosystem functioning in terrestrial ecosystems. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play a key role in soil aggregate formation and stabilization. Here we quantitatively analyzed the importance of experimental settings as well as biotic and abiotic factors for the effectiveness of AMF to stabilize soil macroaggregates.
   We gathered 35 studies on AMF and soil aggregation and tested 13 predictor variables for their relevance with a boosted regression tree analysis and performed a meta-analysis, fitting individual random effects models for each variable.
   The overall mean effect of inoculation with AMF on soil aggregation was positive and predictor variable means were all in the range of beneficial effects. Pot studies and studies with sterilized sandy soil, near neutral soil pH, a pot size smaller than 2.5 kg and a duration between 2.2 and 5 months were more likely to result in stronger effects of AMF on soil aggregation than experiments in the field, with non-sterilized or fine textured soil or an acidic pH. This is the first study to quantitatively show that the effect of AMF inoculation on soil aggregation is positive and context dependent. Our findings can help to improve the use of this important ecosystem process, e.g. for inoculum application in restoration sites.

AB Microbial communities can potentially mediate feedbacks between global change and ecosystem function, owing to their sensitivity to environmental change and their control over critical biogeochemical processes. Numerous ecosystem models have been developed to predict global change effects, but most do not consider microbial mechanisms in detail. In this idea paper, we examine the extent to which incorporation of microbial ecology into ecosystem models improves predictions of carbon (C) dynamics under warming, changes in precipitation regime, and anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enrichment. We focus on three cases in which this approach might be especially valuable: temporal dynamics in microbial responses to environmental change, variation in ecological function within microbial communities, and N effects on microbial activity. Four microbially-based models have addressed these scenarios. In each case, predictions of the microbial-based models differ-sometimes substantially-from comparable conventional models. However, validation and parameterization of model performance is challenging. We recommend that the development of microbial-based models must occur in conjunction with the development of theoretical frameworks that predict the temporal responses of microbial communities, the phylogenetic distribution of microbial functions, and the response of microbes to N enrichment.

AB Fire is a major modifier of communities, but the evolutionary origins of its prevalent role in shaping current biomes are uncertain. Australia is among the most fire-prone continents, with most of the landmass occupied by the fire-dependent sclerophyll and savanna biomes. In contrast to biomes with similar climates in other continents, Australia has a tree flora dominated by a single genus, Eucalyptus, and related Myrtaceae. A unique mechanism in Myrtaceae for enduring and recovering from fire damage likely resulted in this dominance. Here, we find a conserved phylogenetic relationship between post-fire resprouting (epicormic) anatomy and biome evolution, dating from 60 to 62 M Ma, in the earliest Palaeogene. Thus, fire-dependent communities likely existed 50 million years earlier than previously thought. We predict that epicormic resprouting could make eucalypt forests and woodlands an excellent long-term carbon bank for reducing atmospheric CO2 compared with biomes with similar fire regimes in other continents.

AB Field experiments were conducted at the Luancheng Agro-Ecosystem Experimental Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences during the winter wheat growing seasons in 2006-2007 and 2007-2008. Experiments involving winter wheat with 1, 2, and 3 irrigation applications at jointing, heading, or milking were conducted, and the total irrigation water supplied was maintained at 120 mm. The results indicated that irrigation during the later part of the winter wheat growing season and increase in irrigation frequency decreased the available soil water; this result was mainly due to the changes in the vertical distribution of root length density. In <= 30-cm-deep soil profiles, 3 times irrigation at jointing, heading, and milking increased the root length density, while in >30-cm-deep soil profiles, 1 time irrigation at jointing resulted in the highest root length density. With regard to evapotranspiration (ET), there was no significant (LSD, P<0.05) difference between the regimes wherein irrigation was applied only once at jointing; 2 times at jointing and heading; and 3 times at jointing, heading, and milking. Compared with 1 and 3 times irrigation during the winter wheat growing season, 2 times irrigation increased grain yield and 2 times irrigation at jointing and heading produced the highest water-use efficiency (WUE). Combining the results obtained regarding grain yield and WUE, it can be concluded that irrigation at the jointing and heading stages results in high grain yield and WUE, which will offer a sound measurement for developing deficit irrigation regimes in North China.

AB The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) has identified climate change, habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation and pollution as the major drivers of biodiversity loss and sources of concern for human well-being. Understanding how these drivers operate and interact and how they might be mitigated are among the most pressing questions facing humanity. Here, we show how macrophysiology - the investigation of variation in physiological traits over large geographical, temporal and phylogenetic scales can contribute significantly to answering these questions. We do so by demonstrating, for each of the MA drivers, how a macrophysiological approach can or has helped elucidate the impacts of these drivers and their interactions. Moreover, we illustrate that a large-scale physiological perspective can provide insights into previously unrecognized threats to diversity, such as the erosion of physiological variation and stress tolerance, which are a consequence of the removal of large species and individuals from the biosphere. In so doing we demonstrate that environmental physiologists have much to offer the scientific quest to resolve major environmental problems.

AB Phylogenetic analyses based on mtDNA cytochrome b were performed in 42 lizards of the Gymnodactylus darwinii complex from three regions within Brazil's Atlantic Forest. Mainland regions and continental shelf islands in the south-eastern range and mainland areas from the north-east were sampled. The criteria of maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods were explored, with the robustness for nodes assessed, by bootstrapping (MP and ML) and posterior probabilities (Bayesian searches). By all methods, three distinctive phylogroups were recovered: a south-eastern clade (SE) and two clades from northern regions (NE1 and NE2). The pattern of genetic structure of the major clades coincided with the presence of river systems in the Atlantic Forest, and based on corrected genetic distances between those clades, divergence times were tentatively estimated using mtDNA rates calibrated for squamate reptiles. The putative role of Atlantic Forest rivers in generating differentiation is discussed. We present a hypothesis of species limits for G. darwinii, based on concordant lines of evidence including cytogenetic and mtDNA analyses. Two chromosome races (cytotype A, 2n = 38; and cytotype B, 2n = 40) had distributions concordant with clades SE and NE1 + NE2, respectively. These races are interpreted to be full species on the basis of a number of empirical criteria. (c) 2005 The Linnean Society of London.

AB Large-scale climatic fluctuations, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)(1,2), have been shown to affect many ecological processes(3-6). Such effects have been typically assumed to be linear. Only one study has reported a nonlinear relation(7); however, that nonlinear relation was monotonic (that is, no reversal). Here we show that there is a strong nonlinear and non-monotonic (that is, reversed) effect of the NAO on body weight during the subsequent autumn for 23,838 individual wild red deer (Cervus elaphus) and 139,485 individual domestic sheep (Ovis aries) sampled over several decades on the west coast of Norway. These relationships are, at least in part, explained by comparable nonlinear and nonmonotonic relations between the NAO and local climatic variables (temperature, precipitation and snow depth). The similar patterns observed for red deer and sheep, the latter of which live indoors during winter and so experience a stable energy supply in winter, suggest that the (winter) climatic variability (for which the index is a proxy) must influence the summer foraging conditions directly or indirectly.

AB The prevailing notion that interspecific competition has little impact on the abundances of tropica!reef fishes has been tested by few experiments, all of which examined its effects on recruitment and juvenile demography rather than on adult abundances. This study, in Caribbean Panama, examined whether a common territorial damselfish, Stegastes planifrons, limits the abundances of adults of four ecologically similar congeners in S. planifrons' primary habitat: S. partitus and S. variabilis, which commonly occur in that habitat, and S. diencaeus and S. leucostictus, which rarely do.
   When S. planifrons was nearly eliminated from 16 natural patch reefs for 4-6 yr, adult populations of S. partitus, which is less aggressive and half the size of S. planifrons, doubled and expanded their range into a microhabitat previously used almost exclusively by adults of S. planifrons. Population increases by S. partitus occurred within 1 yr of the removal of S. planifrons, were persistent, but only reached their maximum approximate to 4 yr (and about four generations) after the initial removal. Adult populations of S. variabilis, which is less aggressive and 20% smaller than S. planifrons, also doubled following the removal of S. planifrons. Combined populations of S. partitus plus S. variabilis increased most on reefs where S. planifrons previously had been most dense. However, increases by those two species reached only approximate to 70% of the population density and approximate to 40% of the biomass density that S. planifrons had before the removals. Removal of S. planifrons had no effect on the abundances of S. diencaeus and S. leucostictus. Removal of S. partitus from eight reefs for 3 yr did not affect the abundances of S. planifrons or S. variabilis.
   Eleven years monitoring of adult populations and juvenile recruitment by S. partitus before and during the experiment show that its population increase after the removal of S. planifrons occurred while its overall abundance was gradually increasing, but was not associated with a period of unusually high juvenile recruitment.
   Thus asymmetric competition among closely related, ecologically similar, territorial coral reef fishes does sometimes control both abundances and microhabitat use in shared habitat. Interspecific territoriality and differences in body size and aggressiveness that lead to asymmetric competitive ability occur commonly among reef fishes in various trophic groups. Interspecific interactions within such groups of species often affect their patterns of habitat use. Hence the role that interspecific competition plays in limiting abundances of coral reef fishes requires reevaluation.

AB A growing body of literature documents the pressing need to develop soil biogeochemistry models that more accurately reflect contemporary understanding of soil processes and better capture soil carbon (C) responses to environmental perturbations. Models that explicitly represent microbial activity offer inroads to improve representations of soil biogeochemical processes, but have yet to consider relationships between litter quality, functional differences in microbial physiology, and the physical protection of microbial byproducts in forming stable soil organic matter (SOM). To address these limitations, we introduce the MIcrobialMIneral Carbon Stabilization (MIMICS) model, and evaluate it by comparing site-level soil C projections with observations from a long-term litter decomposition study and soil warming experiment. In MIMICS, the turnover of litter and SOM pools is governed by temperature-sensitive MichaelisMenten kinetics and the activity of two physiologically distinct microbial functional types. The production of microbial residues through microbial turnover provides inputs to SOM pools that are considered physically or chemically protected. Soil clay content determines the physical protection of SOM in different soil environments. MIMICS adequately simulates the mean rate of leaf litter decomposition observed at temperate and boreal forest sites, and captures observed effects of litter quality on decomposition rates. Moreover, MIMICS better captures the response of SOM pools to experimental warming, with rapid SOM losses but declining temperature sensitivity to long-term warming, compared with a more conventional model structure. MIMICS incorporates current microbial theory to explore the mechanisms by which litter C is converted to stable SOM, and to improve predictions of soil C responses to environmental change.

AB Peatlands contain approximately one third of all soil organic carbon (SOC). Warming can alter above- and belowground linkages that regulate soil organic carbon dynamics and C-balance in peatlands. Here we examine the multiyear impact of in situ experimental warming on the microbial food web, vegetation, and their feedbacks with soil chemistry. We provide evidence of both positive and negative impacts of warming on specific microbial functional groups, leading to destabilization of the microbial food web. We observed a strong reduction (70%) in the biomass of top-predators (testate amoebae) in warmed plots. Such a loss caused a shortening of microbial food chains, which in turn stimulated microbial activity, leading to slight increases in levels of nutrients and labile C in water. We further show that warming altered the regulatory role of Sphagnum-polyphenols on microbial community structure with a potential inhibition of top predators. In addition, warming caused a decrease in Sphagnum cover and an increase in vascular plant cover. Using structural equation modelling, we show that changes in the microbial food web affected the relationships between plants, soil water chemistry, and microbial communities. These results suggest that warming will destabilize C and nutrient recycling of peatlands via changes in above- and belowground linkages, and therefore, the microbial food web associated with mosses will feedback positively to global warming by destabilizing the carbon cycle. This study confirms that microbial food webs thus constitute a key element in the functioning of peatland ecosystems. Their study can help understand how mosses, as ecosystem engineers, tightly regulate biogeochemical cycling and climate feedback in peatlands

The fragmentation model can establish correlations between landscape pattern and animal distribution patterns. However, it is limited in its ability to generate a process-based understanding of species distribution patterns. Here we propose a process-based conceptual landscape model. The "continuum model" is derived from continuum theory, and recognises the importance of space-related ecological variables alongside other factors, such as the availability of suitable food, shelter, and climatic conditions. The continuum model allows for gradual changes in these variables through space, and assumes species respond individualistically to their environment. We contrast the continuum model with the fragmentation model, and outline how it can be used to interpret and design empirical studies. While the fragmentation model may provide a satisfactory description of ecological patterns where many species are confined to human-defined "patches", the continuum model can help to establish links between fundamental ecological processes and individualistic species distribution patterns. Conservation guidelines arising from the fragmentation model will emphasise the importance of large and well-connected pre-defined "habitat" patches. Conversely, the continuum model recognises potentially large discrepancies between different species' ecological requirements. Conservation guidelines arising from the continuum model therefore will focus on habitat heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales to enhance the number of niches available to different species.

AB The potential for long-lasting effects of larval experience on early juvenile stages is growing in recognition as an important aspect of the ecology of organisms with complex life cycles. For marine species, most studies of recruitment have focused on the numbers of settlers that arrive to a site, largely ignoring the potential variability in larval condition or quality and how such variability may influence the likelihood of recruitment success. In this study, I investigated the effect of larval nutritional history on early juvenile performance, and whether these effects are mediated by conditions in the juvenile habitat for the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. I raised larvae in the laboratory under different food concentrations. Larvae raised with the highest food concentrations were significantly larger in size at metamorphosis and had higher proportional lipid content at metamorphosis than those from lower food concentrations. Half of the newly metamorphosed juveniles were outplanted into intertidal and subtidal habitats for 2 wk. The other half were maintained in the laboratory at two different juvenile rations for up to 20 d. Juveniles raised with high larval food had higher juvenile growth rates and attained larger juvenile sizes than those from lower larval food in all cases. There was a significant positive relationship between size at metamorphosis and juvenile growth for juveniles maintained in the laboratory. Early juvenile growth rates did not change over time (between 10 and 20 d post-metamorphosis). Juveniles raised in higher juvenile rations had elevated growth rates and attained larger final sizes after 20 d than juveniles from low juvenile rations across all sizes at metamorphosis. For juveniles in the field. there was no effect of tidal height on growth for 2 wk post-metamorphosis. Field conditions were more favorable than laboratory conditions for juvenile growth, yet even these more favorable conditions did not compensate for the effects of larval nutritional history on early juvenile growth. Losses of juveniles from both the field and the laboratory were higher for those that had been raised in lower larval food conditions than for those that had been raised in higher larval food, suggesting that vulnerability to early juvenile mortality may also be affected by larval history.

AB Foliar light-saturated net assimilation rates (A) generally decrease with increasing tree height (H) and tree age (Y), but it is unclear whether the decline in A is attributable to size- and age-related modifications in foliage morphology (needle dry mass per unit projected area; M-A), nitrogen concentration, stomatal conductance to water vapor (G), or biochemical foliage potentials for photosynthesis (maximum carboxylase activity of Rubisco; V-cmax). I studied the influences of H and Y on foliage structure and function in a data set consisting of 114 published studies reporting observations on more than 200 specimens of various height and age of Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Pinus sylvestris L. In this data set, foliar nitrogen concentrations were independent of H and Y, but net assimilation rates per unit needle dry mass (A(M)) decreased strongly with increasing H and Y. Although M-A scaled positively with H and Y, net assimilation rates per unit area (A(A) = M-A x A(M)) were strongly and negatively related to H, indicating that the structural adjustment of needles did not compensate for the decline in mass-based needle photosynthetic rates. A relevant determinant of tree height- and age-dependent modifications of A was the decrease in G. This led to lower needle intercellular CO2 concentrations and thereby to lower efficiency with which the biochemical photosynthetic apparatus functioned. However, V-cmax per unit needle dry mass and area strongly decreased with increasing H, indicating that foliar photosynthetic potentials were lower in larger trees at a common intercellular CO2 concentration. Given the constancy of foliar nitrogen concentrations, but the large decline in apparent V-cmax with tree size and age, I hypothesize that the decline in Vc(max) results from increasing diffusive resistances between the needle intercellular air space and carboxylation sites in chloroplasts. Increased diffusive limitations may be the inevitable consequence of morphological adaptation (changes in M-A and needle density) to greater water stress in needles of larger trees. Foliage structural and physiological variables were nonlinearly related to Hand Y, possibly because of hyperbolic decreases in shoot hydraulic conductances with increasing tree height and age. Although H and Y were correlated, foliar characteristics were generally more strongly related to H than to Y, suggesting that increases in height rather than age are responsible for declines in foliar net assimilation capacities.

AB The current massive degradation of habitat and extinction of species is taking place on a catastrophically short timescale, and their effects will fundamentally reset the future evolution of the planet's biota. The fossil record suggests that recovery of global ecosystems has required millions or even tens of millions of years. Thus, intervention by humans, the very agents of the current environmental crisis, is required for any possibility of short-term recovery or maintenance of the biota. Many current recovery efforts have deficiencies, including insufficient information on the diversity and distribution of species, ecological processes, and magnitude and interaction of threats to biodiversity (pollution, overharvesting, climate change, disruption of biogeochemical cycles, introduced or invasive species, habitat loss and fragmentation through land use, disruption of community structure in habitats, and others). A much greater and more urgently applied investment to address these deficiencies is obviously warranted. Conservation and restoration in human-dominated ecosystems must strengthen connections between human activities, such as agricultural or harvesting practices, and relevant research generated in the biological, earth, and atmospheric sciences. Certain threats to biodiversity require intensive international cooperation and input from the scientific community to mitigate their harmful effects, including climate change and alteration of global biogeochemical cycles. In a world already transformed by human activity, the connection between humans and the ecosystems they depend on must frame any strategy for the recovery of the biota.

AB Melastomataceae are among the most abundant and diversified groups of plants throughout the tropics, but their intrafamily relationships and morphological evolution are poorly understood. Here we report the results of parsimony and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses of cpDNA sequences from the rbcL and ndhF genes and the rpl16 intron, generated for eight outgroups (Crypteroniaceae, Alzateaceae, Rhynchocalycaceae, Oliniaceae, Penaeaceae, Myrtaceae, and Onagraceae) and 54 species of melastomes. The sample represents 42 of the family's currently recognized similar to 150 genera, the 13 traditional tribes, and the three subfamilies, Astronioideae, Melastomatoideae, and Memecyloideae (= Memecylaceae DC.). Parsimony and ML yield congruent topologies that place Memecylaceae as sister to Melastomataceae. Pternandra, a Southeast Asian genus of 15 species of which five were sampled, is the first-branching Melastomataceae. This placement has low bootstrap support (72%), but agrees with morphological treatments that placed Pternandra in Melastomatacaeae because of its acrodromal leaf venation, usually ranked as a tribe or subfamily. The interxylary phloem islands found in Memecylaceae and Pternandra, but not most other Melastomataceae, likely evolved in parallel because Pternandra resembles Melastomataceae in its other wood characters. A newly discovered plesiomorphic character in Pternandra, also present in Memecylaceae, is a fibrous anther endothecium. Higher Melastomataceae lack an endothecium as do the closest relatives of Melastomataceae and Memecylaceae. The next deepest split is between Astronieae, with anthers opening by slits, and all remaining Melastomataceae, which have anthers opening by pores. Within the latter several generic groups, corresponding to traditional tribes, receive solid statistical support, but relationships among them, with one exception, are different from anything predicted on the basis of morphological data. Thus, Miconieae and Merianieae are sister groups, and both are sister to a trichotomy of Bertolonieae, Microlicieae + Melastomeae, and Dissochaeteae + Blakeeae. Sonerileae/Oxysporeae are nested within Dissochaeteae, Rhexieae within Melastomeae, and African and Asian Melastomeae within neotropical Melastomeae. These findings have profound implications for our understanding of melastome morphological evolution land biogeography), implying, for example, that berries evolved from capsules minimally four times, stamen connectives went from dorsally enlarged to basal/ventrally enlarged, and loss of an endothecium preceded poricidal dehiscence.

AB Appropriate integration of remote sensing technologies into ecosystem services concepts and practices leads to potential practical benefits for the protection of biodiversity and the promotion of sustainable use of Earth's natural assets. The last decade has seen the rapid development of research efforts on the topic of ecosystem services, which has led to a significant increase in the number of scientific publications. This systematic review aims to identify, evaluate and synthesise the evidence provided in published peer reviewed studies framing their work in the context of spatially explicit remote sensing assessment and valuation of ecosystem services. Initially, a search through indexed scientific databases found 5920 papers making direct and/or indirect reference to the topic of "ecosystem services" between the years of 1960 and 2013. Among these papers, 211 make direct reference to the use of remote sensing. During the search we aimed at selecting papers that were peer-reviewed publications available through indexed bibliographic databases. For this reason, our literature search did not include books, grey literature, extended abstracts and presentations. We quantitatively present the growth of remote sensing applications in ecosystem services' research, reviewing the literature to produce a summary of the state of available and feasible remote sensing variables used in the assessment and valuation of ecosystem services. The results provide valuable information on how remotely sensed Earth observation data are used currently to produce spatially-explicit assessments and valuation of ecosystem services. Using examples from the literature we produce a concise summary of what has been done, what can be done and what can be improved upon in the future to integrate remote sensing into ecosystem services research. The reason for doing so is to motivate discussion about methodological challenges, solutions and to encourage an uptake of remote sensing technology and data where it has potential practical applications.

SO LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY

DT Editorial Material
ID GOVERNANCE; SCIENCE
AB Despite growing knowledge of ecosystem services (ES), and heightened awareness of their political and socio-economic relevance, mainstreaming and implementing ES in landscape planning and decision-making are still in their infancy. The objective of this special issue, therefore, is to explore requirements for, approaches to, and potential impacts of, integrating ES in landscape planning and management. The issue includes three key research themes: (i) Requirements and interests of planners and decision-makers for integrating ES in different application contexts, (ii) Approaches to applying ES in (participatory) planning, and (iii) Potential impacts of integrating ES in policy and decision-making. These themes are addressed by 12 papers that refer to case studies in Africa, Australia, and Europe. Four lessons are highlighted: (i) Information on ES is considered useful by many practitioners, but the type, production and communication of ES information need to be adapted to the specific context of a planning case; (ii) A broad range of approaches are available for integrating the ES concept in (participatory) planning with different and complementary contributions to decision-support; (iii) Effectively integrating ES in planning requires careful scoping of the context, objectives and capacities; (iv) Integrating ES in planning can effectively support the co-production of relevant knowledge and the collaboration of diverse actors. A new research field of 'Planning-for-ES Science' is emerging which focuses on, among other issues, the critical evaluation of real-world case studies of applying the ES concept in different fields of practice.

AB P>1. Hosts may evolve defences that make them less susceptible and suitable to herbivores impacting their fitness. Due to climate change-driven range expansion, herbivores are encountering naive host populations with increasing frequency.
   2. Aggressive bark beetles are among the most important agents of disturbance in coniferous forest ecosystems. The presence of bark beetle outbreaks in areas with a historically unsuitable climate, in part a consequence of climate change, provided an opportunity to assess the hypothesis that the mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae has higher reproductive success in lodgepole pine Pinus contorta trees growing in areas that have not previously experienced frequent outbreaks.
   3. We felled and sampled mountain pine beetle-killed trees from historically climatically suitable and unsuitable areas, i.e. areas with and without a historical probability of frequent outbreaks. Reproductive success was determined from a total of 166 trees from 14 stands.
   4. Brood productivity was significantly affected by climatic suitability class, such that mean brood production per female increased as historical climatic suitability decreased.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The current study demonstrates that the mountain pine beetle has higher reproductive success in areas where its host trees have not experienced frequent beetle epidemics, which includes much of the current outbreak area in north central British Columbia. This increased productivity of mountain pine beetle is likely to have been a key reason for the rapid population buildup that resulted in unprecedented host tree mortality over huge areas in western Canada. The outbreak thus provides an example of how climate change-driven range expansion of native forest insects can have potentially disastrous consequences. Since an increased reproductive success is likely to accelerate the progression of outbreaks, it is particularly critical to manage forests for the maintenance of a mosaic of species and age classes at the landscape level in areas where host tree populations are naive to eruptive herbivores.

AB Aims
   Although the niche concept is of prime importance in ecology, the quantification of plant species' niches remains difficult. Here we propose that plant functional traits, as determinants of species performance, may be useful tools for quantifying species niche parameters over environmental gradients.
   Important findings
   Under this framework, the mean trait values of a species determine its niche position along gradients, and intraspecific trait variability determines its niche breadth. This trait-based approach can provide an operational assessment of niche for a potentially large number of species, making it possible to understand and predict species niche shifts under environmental changes. We further advocate a promising method that recently appeared in the literature, which partitions trait diversity into among- and within-community components as a way to quantify the species niche in units of traits instead of environmental parameters. This approach allows the switch of the focus from ecological niches to trait niches, facilitating the examination of species coexistence along undefined environmental gradients. Altogether, the trait-based approach provides a promising toolkit for quantifying the species ecological niche and for understanding the evolution of species niche and traits.

AB Many carnivores have been seriously impacted by the expansion of transportation systems and networks; however we know little about carnivore response to the extent and magnitude of road mortality, or which age classes may be disproportionately impacted. Recent research has demonstrated that wildlife-vehicle-collisions (WVC) involving carnivores are modulated by temporal and spatial factors. Thus, we investigated road mortality on a guild of small and medium-sized carnivores in southern Portugal using road-kill data obtained from a systematic 36 months monitoring period along highways (260 km) and national roads (314 km) by addressing the following questions: (a) which species and age class are most vulnerable to WVC? (b) are there temporal and/or spatial patterns in road-kill? and (c) which life-history and/or spatial factors influence the likelihood of collisions? We recorded a total of 806 carnivore casualties, which represented an average of 47 ind./100 km/year. Red fox and stone marten had the highest mortality rates. Our findings highlight three key messages: (1) the majority of road-killed individuals were adults of common species; (2) all carnivores, except genets, were more vulnerable during specific life-history phenological periods: higher casualties were observed when red fox and stone marten were provisioning young, Eurasian badger casualties occurred more frequently during dispersal, and higher Egyptian mongoose mortality occurred during the breeding period; and (3) modeling demonstrated that favorable habitat, curves in the road, and low human disturbance were major contributors to the deadliest road segments. Red fox carcasses were more likely to be found on road sections with passages distant from urban areas. Conversely, stone marten mortalities were found more often on national roads with high of cork oak woodland cover; Egyptian mongoose and genet road-kills were found more often on road segments close to curves. Based on our results, two key mitigation measures should help to reduce WVC in Portugal. The first involves the improvement of existing crossings with buried and small mesh size fence to guide the individuals towards to the passages, in road segments with high traffic volume (>1200 vehicles/night) and located in preferred carnivore habitats. The second mitigation involves cutting or removal of dense vegetation in verges of road segments with curves to aid motorists in seeing animals about to cross. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi play an important role in the absorption of soil nutrients and water by most plants. It has been suggested that hydraulically lifted water might maintain the integrity of the external mycorrhizal mycelium during drought. We tested this hypothesis in the obligately mycorrhizal species, coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), using a microcosm system that separated the effects of hydraulic lift in roots from those in the external mycelium. Mycorrhizal oak seedlings were established in microcosms comprising three discrete compartments for (1) upper roots, (2) tap roots, and (3) external fungal mycelium. Eight months after planting, a drought treatment was initiated: irrigation to the upper root and fungal chambers was terminated and only irrigation to the taproot compartment was maintained. After 3, 12, 30, 50, 70 and 80 days of drought, tracers were injected into the taproot compartment at dusk. At dawn the following morning, mycorrhizal hyphae (EM and AM) and spores (AM) in upper root and fungal compartments were extensively labeled with the tracers. In contrast, no labeling was observed when tracers were injected into the taproot compartment during daytime. Nocturnal water translocation from plant to mycorrhizal fungi occurred in association with hydraulic lift. Saprotrophic/parasitic fungi in the microcosms were not labeled, suggesting a direct water transfer from plants to their mycorrhizal mutualists and not to other fungi in the soil. Even after prolonged drought (70-80 days), mycorrhizal hyphae persisted in soils with water potential values as low as -20 MPa. Maintaining mycorrhizal activity through direct water translocation could potentially improve the nutrient status of deep-rooted plants during periods when the fertile upper soil is dry.

AB The recent evolutionary history, population structure and movement patterns of beluga whales in the western Nearctic were inferred from an analysis of mitochondrial DNA control region sequence variation of 324 whales from 32 locations representing five summer concentration areas in Alaska and north-west Canada. Phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes were inferred from parsimonious networks, and genetic subdivision was examined using haplotypic frequency-based indices and an analysis of variance method modified for use with interhaplotypic distance data. MtDNA relationships were characterized by a series of star-like phylogenies which, when viewed in conjunction with information on haplotype frequency and distribution, suggested a rapid radiation of beluga whales into the western Nearctic following the Pleistocene, and an early divergence of the Beaufort Sea from the Chukchi and Bering Seas subpopulations. Overall nucleotide diversity was low (0.51%) yet all major summering concentrations were significantly differentiated (Phi(ST) = 0.33) from one another. Stratification of samples by gender and age from the three northernmost subpopulations suggested that female cohorts from neighbouring subpopulations were more differentiated than males. Further stratification of adult animals by age revealed that older adults were substantially less subdivided among locations than younger adults, particularly for males, suggesting that dispersal, although limited, is biased toward older adult males. Overall, the patterns of mtDNA variation in beluga whales indicated that the summering concentrations are demographically, if not phyletically distinct. Population structure appears to be maintained primarily by natal homing behaviour, while asymmetries in dispersal may be associated with the type of mating system.

AB Genetic differences within a 495 base pair section of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene reveal a striking concordance among species in two monophyletic groups of Indo-west Pacific butterflyfishes. In both species groups, an approximately 2.0% genetic break clearly partitions individuals between the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. However, levels of intra-Pacific mtDNA variation are low, on average less than 1.0%, and fail to cluster by species boundaries defined by colour pattern. Individuals from different species, separated by thousands of kilometers, often possess identical cytochrome b sequences, whereas conspecifics from the same reefs can show up to 1.5% difference. The discrepancy between the mtDNA gene tree and species boundaries may reflect retained ancestral variation or may be the result of hybridization. The strong temporal and phylogenetic concordance between these two independent species groups suggests that genetic differentiation was influenced by common environmental factors. Low levels of within- and between-species genetic differences imply a recent divergence time and suggest a link between speciation within each group and Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. These results paint a turbulent picture of the recent evolutionary history of the Indo-West Pacific.

AB Two long-term field trials in South Australia were used to detect and characterise changes in soil biological properties that were a consequence of different agricultural management. The properties examined were total bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes; total pseudomonads; cellulolytic bacteria and fungi; mycorrhizal fungi; plant root pathogens (Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium irregulare); bacterial-feeding protozoa; soil mesofauna (collembola and acari); earthworms; microbial biomass; C and N mineralisation; in situ CO2 respiration; cellulose decomposition; acid soil enzyme activity (peptidase, phosphatase, sulfatase). The sensitivity of these biological properties was assessed to tillage (no-tillage v. conventional cultivation), stubble management (stubble retained v. stubble harvested), crop rotation (continuous wheat v. wheat-sown pasture), and N fertilisation (nil v. 80 kg N/ha applied during the crop phase). Tillage, stubble management, crop relation, and N fertilisation significantly (P<0.01) affected C mineralisation and microbial biomass. Tillage with stubble management significantly affected root pathogenic fungi, protozoa, collembola, earthworms, and cellulose decomposition. Crop rotation affected mycorrhizal fungi, protozoa, and soil peptidase activity, and N fertiliser had a significant effect on mycorrhizal fungi, protozoa, and cellulose decomposition. As these biological properties are responsive to agricultural management, they may have potential as bioindicators. Total bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes, cellulose-decomposing bacteria and fungi, soil phosphatase and sulfatase activity, and N mineralisation were less affected by these treatments and may therefore have limited potential as bioindicators.

AB The relative importance of predation and competition (resource limitation) in influencing the components of a below-ground food-web consisting of three trophic levels (bacteria and fungi; bacterial-feeding and fungal-feeding nematodes; and top predatory nematodes) was estimated using microbial biomass and nematode frequency data collected throughout a 1-year period in two agro-ecosystems. The study suggested that bacterial and fungal biomass were likely to be regulated by grazing and competition respectively, and that these differences were likely to be attributed to the biological (probably morphological) differences between bacteria and fungi, in contrast to the predictions of the hypothesis of Hairston et al. (1960). Top predatory nematodes were sometimes strongly related to the microbial but not microbial-feeding trophic levels, indicating that microbial biomass may directly influence top predator numbers, and that the intermediate level may simply serve as a conduit by which resources pass from the bottom to top trophic levels. This study also suggests that the detritus food-web acts as two distinct (bacterial-and fungal-based) compartments.

AB The amounts of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), total chlorophyll (Chl), and total leaf nitrogen were measured in fully expanded, young leaves of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L), and pea (Pisum sativum L.). In addition, the activities of whole-chain electron transport and carbonic anhydrase were measured. All plants were grown hydroponically at different nitrogen concentrations. Although a greater than proportional increase in Rubisco content relative to leaf nitrogen content and Chl was found with increasing nitrogen supply for rice, spinach, bean, and pea, the ratio of Rubisco to total leaf nitrogen or Chl in wheat was essentially independent of nitrogen treatment. In addition, the ratio of Rubisco to electron transport activities remained constant only in wheat. Nevertheless, gas-exchange analysis showed that the in vivo balance between the capacities of Rubisco and electron transport in wheat, rice, and spinach remained almost constant, irrespective of nitrogen treatment. The in vitro carbonic anhydrase activity in wheat was very low and strongly responsive to increasing nitrogen content. Such a response was not found for the other C3 plants examined, which had 10- to 30-fold higher carbonic anhydrase activity than wheat at any leaf-nitrogen content. These distinctive responses of carbonic anhydrase activity in wheat were discussed in relation to CO2-transfer resistance and the in vivo balance between the capacities of Rubisco and electron transport.

TI Estimating population size by spatially explicit capture-recapture

ID CLOSED POPULATION; DENSITY-ESTIMATION; MIXTURE-MODELS; INFERENCE; VARY;

AB The number of animals in a population is conventionally estimated by capturerecapture without modelling the spatial relationships between animals and detectors. Problems arise with non-spatial estimators when individuals differ in their exposure to traps or the target population is poorly defined. Spatially explicit capturerecapture (SECR) methods devised recently to estimate population density largely avoid these problems. Some applications require estimates of population size rather than density, and population size in a defined area may be obtained as a derived parameter from SECR models. While this use of SECR has potential benefits over conventional capturerecapture, including reduced bias, it is unfamiliar to field biologists and no study has examined the precision and robustness of the estimates. We used simulation to compare the performance of SECR and conventional estimators of population size with respect to bias and confidence interval coverage for several spatial scenarios. Three possible estimators for the sampling variance of realised population size all performed well. The precision of SECR estimates was nearly the same as that of the null-model conventional population estimator. SECR estimates of population size were nearly unbiased (relative bias 010%) in all scenarios, including surveys in randomly generated patchy landscapes. Confidence interval coverage was near the nominal level. We used SECR to estimate the population of a species of skink Oligosoma infrapunctatum from pitfall trapping. The estimated number in the area bounded by the outermost traps differed little between a homogeneous density model and models with a quadratic trend in density or a habitat effect on density, despite evidence that the latter models fitted better. Extrapolation of trend models to a larger plot may be misleading. To avoid extrapolation, a large region of interest should be sampled throughout, either with one continuous trapping grid or with clusters of traps dispersed widely according to a probability-based and spatially representative sampling design.

AB The collapse of socialist governance structures in Central and Eastern Europe led to the widespread abandonment of agricultural land. We estimated and compared the determinants of cropland abandonment in Albania and Romania during the postsocialist transitional period from 1990 to 2005. The data set included cropland abandonment derived from satellite image analysis, spatially continuous biogeophysical indicators, and socioeconomic surveys. Data were analyzed using boosted regression trees. Boosted regression trees can account for nonlinearities and interactions between variables and combine high predictive accuracy with appealing options to interpret the results. The results revealed important similarities between cropland abandonment in the countries and showed a strong correlation of abandonment with elevation and slope. Differences between cropland abandonment in Albania and Romania were apparent when the influence of topography was excluded. While physical accessibility tended to be more important in Albania, the density of cropland and input intensity were more decisive in Romania. The immediate time period following the collapse of socialism was dominated by extensive cropland abandonment in areas where agricultural production was no longer profitable. Gradual changes were observed in later stages of the transition period. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Motivated by the need to solve ecological problems (climate change, habitat fragmentation and biological invasions), there has been increasing interest in species distribution models (SDMs). Predictions from these models inform conservation policy, invasive species management and disease-control measures. However, predictions are subject to uncertainty, the degree and source of which is often unrecognized. Here, we review the SDM literature in the context of uncertainty, focusing on three main classes of SDM: niche-based models, demographic models and process-based models. We identify sources of uncertainty for each class and discuss how uncertainty can be minimized or included in the modelling process to give realistic measures of confidence around predictions. Because this has typically not been performed, we conclude that uncertainty in SDMs has often been underestimated and a false precision assigned to predictions of geographical distribution. We identify areas where development of new statistical tools will improve predictions from distribution models, notably the development of hierarchical models that link different types of distribution model and their attendant uncertainties across spatial scales. Finally, we discuss the need to develop more defensible methods for assessing predictive performance, quantifying model goodness-of-fit and for assessing the significance of model covariates.

AB Phylogeographical inferences, applied in a comparative framework across multiple species at a regional scale, provide the means for detecting regional and landscape-level patterns of biodiversity, which are important for understanding macroecology and evolution in a geographical mosaic against a backdrop broadly impacted by geological events. Although information on Patagonian phylogeographical patterns has accumulated for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms in recent years, no attempt has been made to compare patterns across major organismal groups. In this review, we compiled studies on the phylogeography of co-distributed plants and terrestrial vertebrates from Patagonia. From each study, we extracted information on levels of genetic diversity, and inferred demographic processes and phylogeographical breaks, as well as on putative refugia, to produce the first summary of emerging phylogeographical patterns for this region. This review reveals some congruent phylogeographical patterns within and among plants and terrestrial vertebrates, and suggests that PreQuaternary as well as Quaternary geological events would have been important driving forces in the evolutionary history of Patagonian lineages. Different processes and directional range shifts suggest a mosaic of phylogeographical patterns, far more complex than the several north-south common patterns traditionally proposed.

AB The population component of a species' niche corresponds to the distribution of individuals across environments within a region. As evolutionary clades of species diversify, they presumably fill niche space, and, consequently, the rate of increase in species numbers slows. Total niche space and species numbers appear to be relatively stable over long periods, and so an increase in the species richness of one clade must be balanced by decrease in others. However, in several analyses, the total population niche space occupied per clade is independent of the number of species, suggesting that species in more diverse clades overlap more in niche space. This overlap appears to be accommodated by variation in the populations of each species, including their absence, within suitable niche space. I suggest that the uneven filling of niche space results from localized outcomes of the dynamic coevolutionary interactions of populations with their pathogens or other antagonists. Furthermore, I speculate that relationships with pathogens might constrain diversification if pathogen diversity increased with host diversity and resulted in more frequent host switching and emergent disease. Many indirect observations are consistent with these scenarios. However, the postulated influence of pathogens on the filling of niche space and diversification of clades primarily highlights our lack of knowledge concerning the space and time dimensions of coevolutionary interactions and their influence on population distribution and species diversification.

AB Thresholds and their relevance to conservation have become a major topic of discussion in the ecological literature. Unfortunately, in many cases the lack of a clear conceptual framework for thinking about thresholds may have led to confusion in attempts to apply the concept of thresholds to conservation decisions. Here, we advocate a framework for thinking about thresholds in terms of a structured decision making process. The purpose of this framework is to promote a logical and transparent process for making informed decisions for conservation.
   Specification of such a framework leads naturally to consideration of definitions and roles of different kinds of thresholds in the process. We distinguish among three categories of thresholds. Ecological thresholds are values of system state variables at which small changes bring about substantial changes in system dynamics. Utility thresholds are components of management objectives (determined by human values) and are values of state or performance variables at which small changes yield substantial changes in the value of the management outcome. Decision thresholds are values of system state variables at which small changes prompt changes in management actions in order to reach specified management objectives. The approach that we present focuses directly on the objectives of management, with an aim to providing decisions that are optimal with respect to those objectives. This approach clearly distinguishes the components of the decision process that are inherently subjective (management objectives, potential management actions) from those that are more objective (system models, estimates of system state). Optimization based on these components then leads to decision matrices specifying optimal actions to be taken at various values of system state variables. Values of state variables separating different actions in such matrices are viewed as decision thresholds. Utility thresholds are included in the objectives component, and ecological thresholds may be embedded in models projecting consequences of management actions. Decision thresholds are determined by the above-listed components of a structured decision process. These components may themselves vary over time, inducing variation in the decision thresholds inherited from them. These dynamic decision thresholds can then be determined using adaptive management. We provide numerical examples (that are based on patch occupancy models) of structured decision processes that include all three kinds of thresholds.

AB The question whether environmental pollution affects genetic diversity in natural populations remains unanswered to date despite the fact that genetic variation is one of the three pillars of biodiversity recognized in the Rio convention of 1993. The loss of genetic diversity in populations subjected to anthropogenic stress can be designated as "genetic erosion" and may be considered as a factor of concern in risk assessment of toxic chemicals. Theoretically there are four different ways in which toxicants can affect genetic variation: (i) by increasing mutation rates, (ii) by directional selection on tolerant genotypes, (iii) by causing bottleneck events, and (iv) by altering migration. This paper reviews studies that have documented genetic change in animal populations exposed to environmental pollution. In these studies, genetic variation is measured in a variety of ways: heritability of quantitative characters, heterozygosity of allozyme loci, haplotype diversity in mitochondrial DNA, and variability in RAPD fingerprints. Studies on cadmium tolerance of Collembola living in metal-contaminated soil suggest that strong directional selection pressure may decrease genetic variability of traits immediately linked to tolerance. Allozyme studies in fish have documented a similar decrease of genetic variation in populations living in strongly acidified waters. A correlation between RAPD-PCR-based genetic similarity and site contamination has been documented in crayfish. Overall, there is significant support for the genetic erosion hypothesis, but the issue cannot be considered settled. In most studies insufficient attention is given to factors such as population size, bottlenecks and mutation, which may influence genetic variability in addition to the toxicant selection regime. At the moment, there does not seem to be a sound scientific basis for incorporating genetic diversity measurements into risk assessment, despite the variety of easily applicable molecular techniques available. It is often not known what kind of variation is measured by these techniques (neutral or selectable) and how the markers are inherited. Given the importance of the issue, as stressed by the Rio Convention, a concentrated research effort is necessary to better define the question and find a general approach to evaluate its importance in ecological risk assessment.

AB A short-term glasshouse experiment was carried out with two grassland soils to investigate phosphorus (P) availability and associated processes in the rhizosphere of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don.) using a thin slicing technique. Results showed that readily extracted forms of soil inorganic P were depleted by both ryegrass and radiata pine, although depletion zones extended further adjacent to radiata pine (5 mm) compared with ryegrass (3 mm). Accumulation of bicarbonate extractable organic P occurred in rhizosphere soil under both ryegrass and radiata pine, which was related to increased levels of microbial biomass. Enhanced depletion of sodium hydroxide extractable organic P apparent in the rhizosphere of radiata pine compared with ryegrass was related to the presence of greater concentrations of water-soluble organic C, microbial biomass and higher alkaline phosphatase and phosphodiesterase enzyme activities. These results confirmed that microbial and enzyme activities played an important role in the mineralization of soil organic P, particularly under radita pine. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Background: The duplication of genes can occur through various mechanisms and is thought to make a major contribution to the evolutionary diversification of organisms. There is increasing evidence for a large-scale duplication of genes in some chelicerate lineages including two rounds of whole genome duplication (WGD) in horseshoe crabs. To investigate this further, we sequenced and analyzed the genome of the common house spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum.
   Results: We found pervasive duplication of both coding and non-coding genes in this spider, including two clusters of Hox genes. Analysis of synteny conservation across the P. tepidariorum genome suggests that there has been an ancient WGD in spiders. Comparison with the genomes of other chelicerates, including that of the newly sequenced bark scorpion Centruroides sculpturatus, suggests that this event occurred in the common ancestor of spiders and scorpions, and is probably independent of the WGDs in horseshoe crabs. Furthermore, characterization of the sequence and expression of the Hox paralogs in P. tepidariorum suggests that many have been subject to neo-functionalization and/or sub-functionalization since their duplication.
   Conclusions: Our results reveal that spiders and scorpions are likely the descendants of a polyploid ancestor that lived more than 450 MYA. Given the extensive morphological diversity and ecological adaptations found among these animals, rivaling those of vertebrates, our study of the ancient WGD event in Arachnopulmonata provides a new comparative platform to explore common and divergent evolutionary outcomes of polyploidization events across eukaryotes.

AB 1. Camera trapping is a widely applied method to study mammalian biodiversity and is still gaining popularity. It can quickly generate large amounts of data which need to be managed in an efficient and transparent way that links data acquisition with analytical tools.
   2. We describe the free and open-source R package camtrapR, a new toolbox for flexible and efficient management of data generated in camera trap-based wildlife studies. The package implements a complete workflow for processing camera trapping data. It assists in image organization, species and individual identification, data extraction from images, tabulation and visualization of results and export of data for subsequent analyses. There is no limitation to the number of images stored in this data management system; the system is portable and compatible across operating systems.
   3. The functions provide extensive automation to minimize data entry mistakes and, apart from species and individual identification, require minimal manual user input. Species and individual identification are performed outside the R environment, either via tags assigned in dedicated image management software or by moving images into species directories.
   4. Input for occupancy and (spatial) capture-recapture analyses for density and abundance estimation, for example in the R packages unmarked or secr, is computed in a flexible and reproducible manner. In addition, survey summary reports can be generated, spatial distributions of records can be plotted and exported to GIS software, and single-and two-species activity patterns can be visualized.
   5. camtrapR allows for streamlined and flexible camera trap data management and should be most useful to researchers and practitioners who regularly handle large amounts of camera trapping data.

AB Current rates of climate change require organisms to respond through migration, phenotypic plasticity, or genetic changes via adaptation. We focused on questions regarding species' and populations' ability to respond to climate change through adaptation. Specifically, the role adaptive introgression, movement of genetic material from the genome of 1 species into the genome of another through repeated interbreeding, may play in increasing species' ability to respond to a changing climate. Such interspecific gene flow may mediate extinction risk or consequences of limited adaptive potential that result from standing genetic variation and mutation alone, enabling a quicker demographic recovery in response to changing environments. Despite the near dismissal of the potential benefits of hybridization by conservation practitioners, we examined a number of case studies across different taxa that suggest gene flow between sympatric or parapatric sister species or within species that exhibit strong ecotypic differentiation may represent an underutilized management option to conserve evolutionary potential in a changing environment. This will be particularly true where advanced-generation hybrids exhibit adaptive traits outside the parental phenotypic range, a phenomenon known as transgressive segregation. The ideas presented in this essay are meant to provoke discussion regarding how we maintain evolutionary potential, the conservation value of natural hybrid zones, and consideration of their important role in adaptation to climate.

AB Refugia - areas that may facilitate the persistence of species during large-scale, long-term climatic change -are increasingly important for conservation planning. There are many methods for identifying refugia, but the ability to quantify their potential for facilitating species persistence (ie their capacity) remains elusive. We propose a flexible framework for prioritizing future refugia, based on their capacity. This framework can be applied through various modeling approaches and consists of three steps: (1) definition of scope, scale, and resolution; (2) identification and quantification; and (3) prioritization for conservation. Capacity is quantified by multiple indicators, including environmental stability, microclimatic heterogeneity, size, and accessibility of the refugium. Using an integrated, semi-mechanistic modeling technique, we illustrate how this approach can be implemented to identify refugia for the plant diversity of Tasmania, Australia. The highest-capacity climate-change refugia were found primarily in cool, wet, and topographically complex environments, several of which we identify as high priorities for biodiversity conservation and management.

AB Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) remain a major cause of coral mortality in the Indo-Pacific, contributing to widespread and accelerating degradation of coral reef environments. This review examines the evidence for and against the principal hypotheses put forward to explain spatial and temporal patterns of outbreaks and also explores whether it is possible or feasible to intervene and limit ongoing degradation caused by crown-of-thorns starfish. The inherent biological characteristics of Acanthaster spp., such as exceptional fecundity, early maturation, and extreme flexibility in resource use, clearly contribute to extreme fluctuations in their abundance. Of the many hypotheses put forward to explain the occurrence of outbreaks, none has universal or unequivocal support. Clearly, however, the high incidence and severity of outbreaks at many reef locations cannot be sustained because anthropogenic changes to marine environments either have caused fundamental shifts in the population dynamics of Acanthaster spp. or have undermined the capacity of reef ecosystems to withstand these periodic disturbances. Reducing the incidence or severity of outbreaks of Acanthaster spp. is critical for reversing widespread and protracted declines in coral cover throughout the Indo-Pacific. Improved efficiency of direct controls provides opportunities to limit the progression and spread of outbreaks if detected early, but effective management of Acanthaster spp. really depends on definitive knowledge and appropriate action to address the ultimate causes of outbreaks. There are considerable, but not insurmountable, challenges to addressing important and persistent knowledge gaps relating to the biology of Acanthaster spp. This research is fundamental to ensure the persistence of coral reef ecosystems, especially given other emerging threats associated with global climate change.

AB Improvement of leaf photosynthesis is an important strategy for greater crop productivity. Here we show that the quantitative trait locus GPS (GREEN FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) controls photosynthesis rate by regulating carboxylation efficiency. Map-based cloning revealed that GPS is identical to NAL1 (NARROW LEAF1), a gene previously reported to control lateral leaf growth. The high-photosynthesis allele of GPS was found to be a partial loss-of-function allele of NAL1. This allele increased mesophyll cell number between vascular bundles, which led to thickened leaves, and it pleiotropically enhanced photosynthesis rate without the detrimental side effects observed in previously identified nal1 mutants, such as dwarf plant stature. Furthermore, pedigree analysis suggested that rice breeders have repeatedly selected the high-photosynthesis allele in high-yield breeding programs. The identification and utilization of NAL1 (GPS) can enhance future high-yield breeding and provides a new strategy for increasing rice productivity.

   GENETIC BENEFITS; SEMINAL FLUID; TESTES SIZE; EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES
AB The Darwin-Bateman paradigm recognizes competition among males for access to multiple mates as the main driver of sexual selection. Increasingly, however, females are also being found to benefit from multiple mating so that polyandry can generate competition among females for access to multiple males, and impose sexual selection on female traits that influence their mating success. Polyandry can reduce a male's ability to monopolize females, and thus weaken male focused sexual selection. Perhaps the most important effect of polyandry on males arises because of sperm competition and cryptic female choice. Polyandry favours increased male ejaculate expenditure that can affect sexual selection on males by reducing their potential reproductive rate. Moreover, sexual selection after mating can ameliorate or exaggerate sexual selection before mating. Currently, estimates of sexual selection intensity rely heavily on measures of male mating success, but polyandry now raises serious questions over the validity of such approaches. Future work must take into account both pre- and post-copulatory episodes of selection. A change in focus from the products of sexual selection expected in males, to less obvious traits in females, such as sensory perception, is likely to reveal a greater role of sexual selection in female evolution.

AB Recently, the global state of marine fisheries and its effects on ecosystems have received much scientific (and public) scrutiny. There is little doubt that global limits to exploitation have been reached and that recovery of depleted stocks must become a cornerstone of fisheries management. Yet, current trends appear to be diverging between well-assessed regions showing stabilization of fish biomass and other regions continuing to decline. This divergence can be explained by improved controls on exploitation rates in several wealthy countries, but low management capacity elsewhere. Here, we identify an urgent need to direct priorities towards 'fisheries-conservation hotspots' of increasing exploitation rates, high biodiversity, and poor management capacity, and conclude that the future of fish depends, at least in part, on redoubling science, co-management and conservation efforts in those regions.

AB Aim The study and prediction of speciesenvironment relationships is currently mainly based on species distribution models. These purely correlative models neglect spatial population dynamics and assume that species distributions are in equilibrium with their environment. This causes biased estimates of species niches and handicaps forecasts of range dynamics under environmental change. Here we aim to develop an approach that statistically estimates process-based models of range dynamics from data on species distributions and permits a more comprehensive quantification of forecast uncertainties.
   Innovation We present an approach for the statistical estimation of process-based dynamic range models (DRMs) that integrate Hutchinson's niche concept with spatial population dynamics. In a hierarchical Bayesian framework the environmental response of demographic rates, local population dynamics and dispersal are estimated conditional upon each other while accounting for various sources of uncertainty. The method thus: (1) jointly infers species niches and spatiotemporal population dynamics from occurrence and abundance data, and (2) provides fully probabilistic forecasts of future range dynamics under environmental change. In a simulation study, we investigate the performance of DRMs for a variety of scenarios that differ in both ecological dynamics and the data used for model estimation.
   Main conclusions Our results demonstrate the importance of considering dynamic aspects in the collection and analysis of biodiversity data. In combination with informative data, the presented framework has the potential to markedly improve the quantification of ecological niches, the process-based understanding of range dynamics and the forecasting of species responses to environmental change. It thereby strengthens links between biogeography, population biology and theoretical and applied ecology.

AB A key challenge in ecology is to define species' niches on the basis of functional traits. Size and shape are important determinants of a species' niche but their causal role is often difficult to interpret. For endotherms, size and shape define the thermal niche through their interaction with core temperature, insulation, and environmental conditions, determining the thermoneutral zone (TNZ) where energy and water costs are minimized. Laboratory measures of metabolic rate used to describe TNZs cannot be generalized to infer the capacity for terrestrial animals to find their TNZ in complex natural environments. Here, we derive an analytical model of the thermal niche of an ellipsoid furred endotherm that accurately predicts field and laboratory data. We use the model to illustrate the relative importance of size and shape on the location of the TNZ under different environmental conditions. The interaction between body shape and posture strongly influences the location of the TNZ and the expected scaling of metabolic rate with size at constant temperature. We demonstrate that the latter relationship has a slope of approximately 1/2 rather than the commonly expected surface area/volume scaling of 2/3. We show how such functional traits models can be integrated with spatial environmental datasets to calculate null expectations for body size clines from a thermal perspective, aiding mechanistic interpretation of empirical clines such as Bergmann's Rule. The combination of spatially explicit data with biophysical models of heat exchange provides a powerful means for studying the thermal niches of endotherms across climatic gradients.

AB Questions: Can a statistical model be designed to represent more directly the nature of organismal response to multiple interacting factors'? Can multiplicative kernel smoothers be used for this purpose? What advantages does this approach have over more traditional habitat modelling methods?
   Methods: Non-parametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) was developed from the premises that: the response variable has a minimum of zero and a physiologically-determined maximum, species respond Simultaneously to multiple ecological factors, the response to any one factor is conditioned by the values of other factors, and that if any of the factors is intolerable then the response is zero. Key features of NPMR are interactive effects of predictors, no need to specify all overall model form in advance, and built-in controls on overfitting. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with simulated and real data sets.
   Results: Empirical and theoretical relationships of species response to multiple interacting predictors call be represented effectively by multiplicative kernel smoothers. NPMR allows us to abandon simplistic assumptions about overall model form, while embracing the ecological truism that habitat factors interact.

AB Although the mechanisms controlling gene flow among populations are particularly important for evolutionary processes, they are still poorly understood, especially in the case of large carnivoran mammals with extensive continuous distributions. We studied the question of factors affecting population genetic structure in the grey wolf, Canis lupus, one of the most mobile terrestrial carnivores. We analysed variability in mitochondrial DNA and 14 microsatellite loci for a sample of 643 individuals from 59 localities representing most of the continuous wolf range in Eastern Europe. We tested an array of geographical, historical and ecological factors to check whether they may explain genetic differentiation among local wolf populations. We showed that wolf populations in Eastern Europe displayed nonrandom spatial genetic structure in the absence of obvious physical barriers to movement. Neither topographic barriers nor past fragmentation could explain spatial genetic structure. However, we found that the genetic differentiation among local populations was correlated with climate, habitat types, and wolf diet composition. This result shows that ecological processes may strongly influence the amount of gene flow among populations. We suggest natal-habitat-biased dispersal as an underlying mechanism linking population ecology with population genetic structure.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly envisaged as a tool to manage coastal ecosystems and fisheries. Assessment of their performance with respect to management objectives is therefore important. A number of WAS provided conservation benefits for fished species. Observed benefits do not apply to all species at all times, and responses to protection are also highly variable among fish taxa. Among the many empirical studies on marine reserves, only a few designs considered 'before and after data' and spatial variation. In this paper, we are interested in assessing the effect of a no-take reserve on the reef fish assemblage in a northwestern Mediterranean example. Data were obtained from a three-year survey using underwater visual censuses (UVC), before and after MPA establishment. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and multivariate regression trees (MRT) were used to evaluate the effects of reserve protection on the reef fish assemblage, while accounting for habitat. Modelled biological responses were abundances and diversity indices calculated at different levels of the assemblage. Significant effects were found for many of these metrics. in addition to PERMANOVA, univariate models provided more insight into the magnitude and direction of effects. The most sensitive metrics were related to large species and species targeted by fishing. These results may be used to choose the metrics that are more suitable as community-based indicators of MPA impact in the perspective of monitoring programs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Despite the recent large-scale efforts dedicated to comprehensive phylogenetic analyses using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences, several relationships among mammalian orders remain controversial. Here, we present an extensive application of retroposon (L1) insertion analysis to the phylogenetic relationships among almost all mammalian orders. In addition to demonstrating the validity of Glires, Euarchontoglires, Laurasiatheria, and Boreoeutheria, we demonstrate an interordinal clade that links Chiroptera, Carnivora, and Perissodactyla within Laurasiatheria. Re-examination of a large DNA sequence data set yielded results consistent with our conclusion. We propose a superordinal name "Pegasoferae" for this clade of Chiroptera + Perissodactyla + Carnivora + Pholidota. The presence of a single incongruent L1 locus generates a tree in which the group of Carnivora + Perissodactyla associates with Cetartiodactyla but not with Chiroptera. This result suggests that incomplete lineage sorting of an ancestral dimorphism occurred with regard to the presence or absence of retroposon alleles in a common ancestor of Scrotifera (Pegasoferae + Cetartiodactyla), which was followed by rapid divergence into the extant orders over an evolutionarily short period. Accordingly, Euungulata (Cetartiodactyla + Perissodactyla) and Fereuungulata (Carnivora + Pholiclota + Perissodactyla + Cetartiodactyla) cannot be validated as natural groups. The interordinal mammalian relationships presented here provide a cornerstone for future studies in the reconstruction of mammalian classifications, including extinct species, on evolution of large genomic sequences and structure, and in developmental analysis of morphological diversification.

AB There is a strong natural light gradient from the top to the bottom in plant canopies and along gap-understorey continua. Leaf structure and photosynthetic capacities change close to proportionally along these gradients, leading to maximisation of whole canopy photosynthesis. However, other environmental factors also vary within the light gradients in a correlative manner. Specifically, the leaves exposed to higher irradiance suffer from more severe heat, water, and photoinhibition stresses. Research in tree canopies and across gap-understorey gradients demonstrates that plants have a large potential to acclimate to interacting environmental limitations. The optimum temperature for photosynthetic electron transport increases with increasing growth irradiance in the canopy, improving the resistance of photosynthetic apparatus to heat stress. Stornatal constraints on photosynthesis are also larger at higher irradiance because the leaves at greater evaporative demands regulate water use more efficiently. Furthermore, upper canopy leaves are more rigid and have lower leaf osmotic potentials to improve water extraction from drying soil. The current review highlights that such an array of complex interactions significantly modifies the potential and realized whole canopy photosynthetic productivity, but also that the interactive effects cannot be simply predicted as composites of additive partial environmental stresses. We hypothesize that plant photosynthetic capacities deviate from the theoretical optimum values because of the interacting stresses in plant canopies and evolutionary trade-offs between leaf- and canopy-level plastic adjustments in light capture and use.

AB The objective of this experiment was to understand how atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and soil-nitrogen (N) availability influence Populus tremuloides fine-root growth and morphology. Soil-N availability may limit the growth response of forests to elevated CO2 and interact with atmospheric CO2 to alter litter quality and ecosystem carbon (C) and N cycling. We established a CO2 x N factorial field experiment and grew six genotypes of P. tremuloides for 2.5 growing seasons in 20 large open-top chamber/root-box experimental units at the University of Michigan Biological Station in northern lower Michigan (USA). Ln this paper we describe an integrated examination of how atmospheric CO2 and soil-N availability influence fine-root morphology, growth, mortality, and biomass. We also studied the relationship between root biomass and total soil respiration.
   Over 80% of the absorbing root length of P. tremuloides was accounted fur by roots <0.4 mm in diameter, and specific root length(100-250 m/g) was much greater than reports for other temperate and boreal deciduous trees. Elevated atmospheric CO2 increased the diameter and length of individual roots. In contrast, soil N had no effect on root morphology. Fine-root length production and mortality, measured with minirhizotrons, was controlled by the interaction between atmospheric CO2 and soil N. Rates of root production and mortality were significantly greater at elevated CO2 when trees grew in high-N soil, but there were no CO2 effects at low soil N. Fine-root biomass increased 137-194% in high-N compared to low-N soil, and elevated atmospheric CO2 increased fine-root biomass (52%) in high soil N, but differences in low soil N were not significant. Across all treatments, dynamic estimates of net fine-root production were highly correlated with fine-root biomass (soil cores; r = 0.975). Mean rates of soil respiration were more than double in high-N compared to low-N soil. and elevated atmospheric CO2, when compared to ambient atmospheric CO2, increased mean rates of soil respiration 19% in 1995 and 25% in 1996. Across all treatments, total root biomass was linearly related to mean rates of soil respiration (r(2) = 0.96).
   Our results indicate that atmospheric CO2 and soil-N availability strongly interact to influence P. tremuloides fine-root morphology, growth, and C turnover. Aspen-dominated ecosystems of the future are likely to have greater productivity fueled by greater nutrient uptake due to greater root length production. Further, it appears that elevated atmospheric CO2 will result in greater C inputs to soil through greater rates of fine-root production and turnover, especially in high-fertility soils. Increased C inputs to soil result in greater rates of soil respiration. At this rime, it is not clear what effects increased rates of root turnover will have on C storage in the soil.

AB Both within and between species, leaves of plants display wide ranges in structural features. These features include: gross investments of carbon and nitrogen substrates (e.g. leaf mass per unit area); stomatal density, distribution between adaxial and abaxial surfaces, and aperture; internal and external optical scattering structures; defensive structures, such as trichomes and spines; and defensive compounds, including UV screens, antifeedants, toxins, and silica abrasives. I offer a synthesis of selected publications, including some of my own. A unifying theme is the adaptive value of expressing certain structural features, posed as metabolic costs and benefits, for (1) competitive acquisition and use of abiotic resources (such as water, light and nitrogen) and (2) regulation of biotic interactions, particularly fungal attack and herbivory. Both acclimatory responses in one plant and adaptations over evolutionary time scales are covered where possible. The ubiquity of trade-offs in function is a recurrent theme; this helps to explain diversity in solutions to the same environmental challenges but poses problems for investigators to uncover numerous important trade-offs. I offer some suggestions for research, such as on the need for models that integrate biotic and abiotic effects (these must be highly focused), and some speculations, such as on the intensity of selection pressures for these structures.

AB Assessing species' vulnerability to climate change is a prerequisite for developing effective strategies to conserve them. The last three decades have seen exponential growth in the number of studies evaluating how, how much, why, when, and where species will be impacted by climate change. We provide an overview of the rapidly developing field of climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) and describe key concepts, terms, steps and considerations. We stress the importance of identifying the full range of pressures, impacts and their associated mechanisms that species face and using this as a basis for selecting the appropriate assessment approaches for quantifying vulnerability. We outline four CCVA assessment approaches, namely trait-based, correlative, mechanistic and combined approaches and discuss their use. Since any assessment can deliver unreliable or even misleading results when incorrect data and parameters are applied, we discuss finding, selecting, and applying input data and provide examples of open-access resources. Because rare, small-range, and declining-range species are often of particular conservation concern while also posing significant challenges for CCVA, we describe alternative ways to assess them. We also describe how CCVAs can be used to inform IUCN Red List assessments of extinction risk. Finally, we suggest future directions in this field and propose areas where research efforts may be particularly valuable. This article is categorized under: Climate, Ecology, and Conservation > Extinction Risk

AB The ability to explain why multispecies assemblages produce greater biomass compared to monocultures, has been a central goal in the quest to understand biodiversity effects on ecosystem function. Species contributions to ecosystem function can be driven by two processes: niche complementarity and a selection effect that is influenced by fitness (competitive) differences, and both can be approximated with measures of species' traits. It has been hypothesised that fitness differences are associated with few, singular traits while complementarity requires multidimensional trait measures. Here, using experimental data from plant assemblages, I show that the selection effect was strongest when trait dissimilarity was low, while complementarity was greatest with high trait dissimilarity. Selection effects were best explained by a single trait, plant height. Complementarity was correlated with dissimilarity across multiple traits, representing above and below ground processes. By identifying the relevant traits linked to ecosystem function, we obtain the ability to predict combinations of species that will maximise ecosystem function.

AB Substantial progress has been made in understanding how pathways underlie and mediate biological invasions. However, key features of their role in invasions remain poorly understood, available knowledge is widely scattered, and major frontiers in research and management are insufficiently characterized. We review the state of the art, highlight recent advances, identify pitfalls and constraints, and discuss major challenges in four broad fields of pathway research and management: pathway classification, application of pathway information, management response, and management impact. We present approaches to describe and quantify pathway attributes (e.g., spatiotemporal changes, proxies of introduction effort, environmental and socioeconomic contexts) and how they interact with species traits and regional characteristics. We also provide recommendations for a research agenda with particular focus on emerging (or neglected) research questions and present new analytical tools in the context of pathway research and management.

AB Inconsistent terms, definitions, and classifications hinder advancement of the study and application of ecosystem services. A unified approach among disciplines involved in researching and implementing ecosystem services is imperative to moving concepts into practice. An operational definition needs to be adopted by the ecosystem service community as the basis of a classification system so that ecosystem goods and services may be measured by ecologists, valued by economists, and utilized by decision-makers. We propose a transdisciplinary approach centered upon shared principles, an ecosystem services definition, and a classification system. This shared foundation provides a common set of ecosystem goods and services that serves as the focus for and connection among multiple disciplines. This foundation is specific enough to be operational while remaining relevant to a multitude of ecosystem service objectives for which frameworks and implementation plans may be developed. Although numerous ecosystem service frameworks exist in the literature, many of them are non-operational or are focused toward a single discipline. An evaluation of these frameworks identifies knowledge gaps and suggests how we may advance ecosystem services into practice. Our evaluation demonstrates that foundational concepts (especially a definition and classification system, and community involvement) are often poorly addressed in ecosystem service frameworks.

AB To what extent, and under which circumstances, are population dynamics influenced by concurrent natural selection? Density dependence and environmental stochasticity are generally expected to subsume any selective modulation of population growth rate, but theoretical considerations point to conditions under which selection can have an appreciable impact on population dynamics. By contrast, empirical research has barely scratched the surface of this fundamental question in population biology. Here, we present a diverse body of mostly empirical evidence that demonstrates how selection can influence population dynamics, including studies of small populations, metapopulations, cyclical populations and host-pathogen interactions. We also discuss the utility, in this context, of inferences from molecular genetic data, placing them within the broader framework of quantitative genetics and life-history evolution.

AB Ecological impacts from roads may be the rule rather than the exception in most of the conterminous United States. We measured the proportion of land area that was located within nine distances from the nearest road of any type, and mapped the results for 164 ecoregions and 2108 watersheds nationwide. Overall, 20% of the total land area was within 127 m of a road, and the proportion increased rapidly with distance, so that 83% was within 1061 m of a road, and only 3% was more than 5176 m away. For forest land area only, the proportions differed by less than 2% for all distances. Regions with more than 60% of their total land area within 382 m of a road may be at greatest risk of cumulative ecological impacts from roads. These regions include nearly all coastal zones, as well as substantial portions of the southeast US and the basins of the Ohio, Brazos, Colorado, Sacramento, and San Joaquin Rivers.

TI Conserving groundwater for irrigation in the North China Plain
SO IRRIGATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID WHEAT
AB Winter wheat and summer maize are the staple crops in the piedmont of Mt. Taihang in the North China Plain. High levels of production depend largely on the use of irrigation. However, irrigation is causing a rapid decline of the groundwater table. To assure sustainable agricultural development in this densely populated region, improvement is needed in farmland water-use efficiency (WUE) to reduce the overall application of irrigation water. This paper investigated two ways to improve WUE, which could be easily implemented by local farmers. One way was to regulate the irrigation scheduling of winter wheat. The other was to utilize straw mulching with winter wheat and maize to reduce soil evaporation. Field experimental results, carried out at Luancheng Station from 1997 to 2000, showed that the common practice of irrigating winter wheat four times each season did not produce as high a yield as three irrigations in a dry year, or one irrigation in a wet year. The latter produced the highest grain production and highest relative WUE. Measurements of evapotranspiration and soil evaporation using a large-scale weighing lysimeter and microlysimeters showed that about 30% of the total evapotranspiration was from soil evaporation. Straw mulching reduced soil evaporation by 40 mm for winter wheat and 43 mm for maize in the 1998/1999 seasons. WUE was improved by over 10%. The combination of these two measures could reduce irrigation applications in the region.

AB Theory predicts that populations of animals with late maturity, low fecundity, large body size and low body growth rates will have low potential rates of population increase at low abundance. If this is true, then these traits may be used to predict the intrinsic rate of increase for species or populations, as well as extinction risks. We used life-history and population data for 63 stocks of commercially exploited fish species from the northeast Atlantic to test relationships between life-history parameters and the rate of population increase at low abundance. We used cross-taxonomic analyses among stocks and among species, and analyses that accounted for phylogenetic relationships. These analyses confirmed that large-bodied, slow-growing stocks and species had significantly lower rates of recruitment and adult production per spawning adult at low abundance. Furthermore, high ages at maturity were significantly correlated with low maximum recruit production. Contrary to expectation, fecundity was significantly negatively related to recruit production, due to its positive relationship with maximum body size. Our results support theoretical predictions, and suggest that a simply measured life-history parameter can provide a useful tool for predicting rates of recovery from low population abundance.

AB Hystricognath rodents include Old World Phiomorpha and New World Caviomorpha. These two groups have an enigmatic biogeographical history. Using a nuclear marker, the exon 28 of the von Willebrand Factor gene (vWF), we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among 23 Hystricognathi species. These taxa encompass the complete familial diversity of the Hystricognathi. Our results indicate a basal trifurcation of hystricognaths leading to Hystricidae, Phiomorpha s.s. (Bathyergidae, Thryonomyidae, and Petromuridae), and Caviomorpha. The monophyly of caviomorphs is robustly supported, confirming a single colonization event of South America by hystxricognaths. Caviomorpha are divided into four lineages: Cavioidea, Erethizontoidea, Chinchilloidea, and Octodontoidea. Furthermore, we suggest that (1) Chinchillidae and Dinomyidae are sister clades, (2) Abrocomidae is a true Octodontoidea, and (3) Capromyidae, Echimyidae, and Myocastoridae cluster together. Surprisingly, Erethizontidae does not appear to be the most diverged caviomorph lineage. The molecular results are discussed in the light of previous paleontological and morphological observations. Local molecular clocks are used to estimate divergence dates among hystricognath lineages. An Asian origin is suggested for Caviomorpha, and a colonization route through Australia and Antarctica is indicated as an alternative to the hypothesis of a transatlantic migration of Caviomorpha from Africa to South America.

AB A mass mortality event of the red coral Corallium rubrum (L.) occur-red in the NW Mediterranean region in summer 1999. The main objectives of the present study were to document the mortality suffered by the red coral populations in the Provence region and assess ecological correlates of the mortality which could help to identify the putative agent or agents of the event. The mortality outbreak resulted in partial to complete loss of the coenenchyme. The first observations of red coral mortality in the study area were in early October 1999 and continued until November 1999, To determine the extent of mortality on red coral populations, the incidence (= % colonies suffering mortality) and the virulence [= % coenenchyme loss) were quantified. Twelve surveys were carried out from November 1999 to January 2000. A total of 874 colonies of the 2375 observed showed some mortality. Incidence and virulence differed significantly among surveys. In some cases about 80 % of the colonies were affected, while in others only 5 % of colonies showed some mortality. Depth had a strong influence on the incidence of mortality. Shallower populations had the greatest incidence, while populations deeper than 30 m depth showed no mortality. However, virulence was similar in the 10 to 30 m depth range. With regard to habitat, the entrances of caves displayed a significantly higher incidence but not virulence than the interiors. Given the life history traits of red coral (mainly slow growth and low recruitment), it seems that recovery from the outbreak will be a long-term process. However, further studies are urgently required to provide basic information regarding red coral population dynamics as a basis for hypotheses on the actual recovery capability Of affected populations. The cause of the mass mortality is unknown. However, during late summer 1999, the NW Mediterranean area affected by the mass mortality event experienced high temperatures and hydrographic stability over a period of several weeks, This temperature anomaly could have caused physiological stress or/and triggered the development of pathogenic agents that otherwise would have remained non-virulent. This hypothesis is reinforced by the absence of signs of mass mortality below 30 m depth in red coral populations. Since the NW Mediterranean seems to be affected by the global warming trend, if the temperature hypothesis is confirmed, the long-term consequences of a repetition of this kind of event could severely endanger the persistence of shallow-water red coral populations.

AB A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that biodiversity stabilizes ecosystem functioning over time in grassland ecosystems. However, the relative importance of different facets of biodiversity underlying the diversity-stability relationship remains unclear. Here we use data from 39 grassland biodiversity experiments and structural equation modelling to investigate the roles of species richness, phylogenetic diversity and both the diversity and community-weighted mean of functional traits representing the 'fast-slow' leaf economics spectrum in driving the diversity-stability relationship. We found that high species richness and phylogenetic diversity stabilize biomass production via enhanced asynchrony in the performance of co-occurring species. Contrary to expectations, low phylogenetic diversity enhances ecosystem stability directly, albeit weakly. While the diversity of fast-slow functional traits has a weak effect on ecosystem stability, communities dominated by slow species enhance ecosystem stability by increasing mean biomass production relative to the standard deviation of biomass over time. Our in-depth, integrative assessment of factors influencing the diversity-stability relationship demonstrates a more multicausal relationship than has been previously acknowledged.

AB Worldwide, banana production is severely hindered by Fusarium wilt, a devastating disease caused by the soil-borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc). With no widely adopted efficient method of control or prevention, the emergence of a new Foc variant, tropical race 4 (Foc TR4), has led to the widespread destruction of plantations in Cavendish-producing areas. Recently, banana Fusarium wilt has been controlled by the consecutive application of biofertilizer (BIO) in newly reclaimed fields. In this study we examine the temporal effects of BIO versus compost application in newly converted banana fields on the composition and abundance of the rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities and the survival of the biocontrol inoculant, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens NJN-6. Our findings show that BIO-amended rhizosphere soils increased the abundance of bacteria while decreasing fungal abundance. This corresponded to higher bacterial richness and diversity in the BIO amendment, while no trends were observed with the fungal community. Rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal community composition were significantly different between BIO and compost amendment and treatment, not time, exhibited the largest impact. Other potential taxa involved in disease suppression were also identified, such as increased abundances of Sphingobium, Dyadobacter, and Cryptococcus and lower abundances of Fusarium, Ralstonia, and Burkholderia. Overall, decreased abundances of F. oxysporum and a lack of variability in the abundance of the biocontrol agent NJN-6 over three years contributed to disease suppression, in combination with alterations in fungal and bacterial composition and abundance, pointing to the sustainability of BIO as an amendment for disease suppression.

AB Phylogeography, born to bridge population genetics and phylogenetics in an explicit geographic context, has provided a successful platform for unveiling species evolutionary histories. The Mediterranean Basin, one of the earth's 25 biodiversity hotspots, is known for its complex geological and palaeoclimatic history. Aiming to throw light on the causes and circumstances that underlie such a rich biota, a review of the phylogeographic literature on plant lineages from the Mediterranean Basin is presented focusing on two levels. First, phylogeographic patterns are examined, arranged by potential driving forces such as longitude, latitude - and its interaction with altitude -, straits or glacial refugia. Spatial coincidences in phylogeographic splits are found but, in comparison to other regions such as the Alps or North America, no largely common phylogeographic patterns across species are found in this region. Factors contributing to phylogeographic complexity and scarcity of common patterns include less drastic effects of Pleistocene glaciations than other temperate regions, environmental heterogeneity, the blurring of genetic footprints via admixing over time and, for older lineages, possibly a greater stochasticity due to the accumulation of responses to palaeoclimatic changes. At a second level, processes inferred in phylogeographically framed studies that are potential drivers of evolution are examined. These include gradual range expansion, vicariance, long-distance dispersal, radiations, hybridization and introgression, changes in reproductive system, and determinants of successful colonization. Future phylogeographic studies have a great potential to help explaining biodiversity patterns of plant groups and understanding why the Basin has come to be one of the biodiversity hotspots on earth. This potential is based on the crucial questions that can be addressed when geographic gaps are adequately filled (mainly northern Africa and the eastern part of the region), on the important contribution of younger lineages - for which phylogeographic approaches are most useful - to the whole diversity of the Basin, and on the integration of new methods, particularly those that allow refining the search for spatio-temporal concordance across genealogies.

   3. These functions retrieve data, via the Internet, for either a desired spatiotemporal extent or interpolated to a point in space and time. The package also contains functions to temporally aggregate data, producing user- defined variables, and to visualise these data on a map.
   4. By making access to atmospheric data and integration with biological data easier and more flexible, we hope to facilitate and encourage the exploration of relationships between biological systems and atmospheric conditions.

AB We present a GIS method to interpret qualitatively expressed socio-economic scenarios in quantitative map-based terms. (i) We built scenarios using local stakeholders and experts to define how major land cover classes may change under different sets of drivers; (ii) we formalised these as spatially explicit rules, for example agriculture can only occur on certain soil types; (iii) we created a future land cover map which can then be used to model ecosystem services. We illustrate this for carbon storage in the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania using two scenarios: the first based on sustainable development, the second based on 'business as usual' with continued forest woodland degradation and poor protection of existing forest reserves. Between 2000 and 2025 4% of carbon stocks were lost under the first scenario compared to a loss of 41% of carbon stocks under the second scenario. Quantifying the impacts of differing future scenarios using the method we document here will be important if payments for ecosystem services are to be used to change policy in order to maintain critical ecosystem services.

AB The effects of fire on vegetation vary based on the properties and amount of existing biomass (or fuel) in a forest stand, weather conditions, and topography. Identifying controls over the spatial patterning of fire-induced vegetation change, or fire severity, is critical in understanding fire as a landscape scale process. We use gridded estimates of fire severity, derived from Landsat ETM+ imagery, to identify the biotic and abiotic factors contributing to the observed spatial patterns of fire severity in two large natural fires. Regression tree analysis indicates the importance of weather, topography, and vegetation variables in explaining fire severity patterns between the two fires. Relative humidity explained the highest proportion of total sum of squares throughout the Hoover fire (Yosemite National Park, 2001). The lowest fire severity corresponded with increased relative humidity. For the Williams fire (Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Parks, 2003) dominant vegetation type explains the highest proportion of sum of squares. Dominant vegetation was also important in determining fire severity throughout the Hoover fire. In both fires, forest stands that were dominated by lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) burned at highest severity, while red fir (Abies magnifica) stands corresponded with the lowest fire severities. There was evidence in both fires that lower wind speed corresponded with higher fire severity, although the highest fire severity in the Williams fire occurred during increased wind speed. Additionally, in the vegetation types that were associated with lower severity, burn severity was lowest when the time since last fire was fewer than 11 and 17 years for the Williams and Hoover fires, respectively. Based on the factors and patterns identified, managers can anticipate the effects of management ignited and naturally ignited fires at the forest stand and the landscape levels.

AB The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the world's major biodiversity hotspots and is threatened by a severe habitat loss. Yet little is known about the processes that originated its remarkable richness of endemic species. Here we present results of a large-scale survey of the genetic variation at the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of the pitviper, jararaca lancehead (Bothrops jararaca), and two closely related insular species (Bothrops insularis and Bothrops alcatraz), endemic of this region. Phylogenetic and network analyses revealed the existence of two well-supported clades, exhibiting a southern and a northern distribution. The divergence time of these two phylogroups was estimated at 3.8 million years ago, in the Pliocene, a period of intense climatic changes and frequent fragmentation of the tropical rainforest. Our data also suggest that the two groups underwent a large size expansion between 50 000 and 100 000 years ago. However, the southern group showed a more marked signal of population size fluctuation than the northern group, corroborating evidences that southern forests may have suffered a more pronounced reduction in area in the late Pleistocene. The insular species B. alcatraz and B. insularis presented very low diversity, each one sharing haplotypes with mainland individuals placed in different subclades. Despite their marked morphological and behavioural uniqueness, these two insular species seem to have originated very recently and most likely from distinct costal B. jararaca populations, possibly associated with late Pleistocene or Holocene sea level fluctuations.

AB The mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt-b) gene is widely used in systematic studies to resolve divergences at many taxonomic levels. The present study focuses mainly on the utility of cyt-b as a molecular marker for inferring phylogenetic relationship at various levels within the fish family Cichlidae. A total of 78 taxa were used in the present analysis, representing all the major groups in the family Cichlidae (72 taxa) and other families from the suborders Labroidei and Percoidei. Gene trees obtained from cyt-b are compared to a published total evidence tree derived from previous studies. Minimum evolution trees based on cyt-b data resulted in topologies congruent with all previous analyses. Parsimony analyses downweighting transitions relative to transversions (ts1:tv4) or excluding transitions at third codon positions resulted in more robust bootstrap support for recognized clades than unweighted parsimony. Relative rate tests detected significantly long branches for some taxa (LB taxa) which were composed mainly by dwarf Neotropical cichlids. An improvement of the phylogenetic signal, as shown by the four-cluster likelihood mapping analysis, and higher bootstrap values were obtained by excluding LB taxa. Despite some limitations of cyt-b as a phylogenetic marker, this gene either alone or in combination with other data sets yields a tree that is in agreement with the well-established phylogeny of cichlid fish.

AB A nitrogen-based model of maintenance respiration (R(m)) would link R(m) with nitrogen-based photosynthesis models and enable simpler estimation of dark respiration flux from forest canopies. To test whether an N-based model of R(m) would apply generally to foliage of boreal and subalpine woody plants, I measured R(m) (CO2 efflux at night from fully expanded foliage) for foliage of seven species of trees and shrubs in the northern boreal forest (near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada) and seven species in the subalpine montane forest (near Fraser, Colorado, USA). At 10 degrees C, average R(m) for boreal foliage ranged from 0.94 to 6.8 mu mol kg(-1) s(-1) (0.18-0.58 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and for subalpine foliage it ranged from 0.99 to 7.6 mu mol kg(-1) s(-1) (0.28-0.64 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). CO2 efflux at 10 degrees C for the samples was only weakly correlated with sample weight (r = 0.11) and leaf area (r = 0.58). However, CO2 efflux per unit foliage weight was highly correlated with foliage N concentration [r = 0.83, CO2 flux at 10 degrees C (mol kg(-1) s(-1)) = 2.62 x foliage N (mol kg(-1))], and slopes were statistically similar for the boreal and subalpine sites (P = 0.28), CO2, efflux per unit of foliar N was 1.8 times that reported for a variety of crop and wildland species growing in warmer climates.

AB We evaluated both the photosynthetic plasticity and acclimation to light of seedlings of five co-occurring tropical tree species in the Moraceae, Cecropia obtusifolia, Ficus insipida, Poulsenia armata, Brosimum alicastrum, and Pseudolmedia oxyphyllaria. Distinct differences in the species' abilities to respond to increasing irradiance correlated with their known habitat breadths and successional status. The early successionals Cecropia and Ficus exhibited the highest photosynthetic rates and conductance values in high light. There was a several-fold difference in assimilation across light regimes, consistent with a high physiological plasticity. When individuals grown at low light were transferred to higher irradiances, seedlings of both Cecropia and Ficus produced leaves which photosynthesized at rates as high or higher than those of plants continuously grown in high light, indicating a high photosynthetic acclimation potential. In contrast, the late successionals were characterized by both a more restricted physiological plasticity and acclimation potential. Higher light levels resulted in only moderate increases in assimilation among the late successionals, and only Brosimum acclimated fully to increased irradiances. Neither Poulsenia nor Pseudolmedia increased appreciably their photosynthetic rates when transferred to high light. This suggests that acclimation potential cannot always be inferred from plasticity responses, and calls for a reevaluation of arguments developed solely from plasticity studies. Finally, differences between the early and late successional species in the allocation of nitrogen into RuBP carboxylase and thylakoid nitrogen pools or non-photosynthetic compounds are suggested by the distinct relationships between maximum photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen content.

AB Model transferability (extrapolative accuracy) is one important feature in species distribution models, required in several ecological and conservation biological applications. This study uses 10 modelling techniques and nationwide data on both (1) species distribution of birds, butterflies, and plants and (2) climate and land cover in Finland to investigate whether good interpolative prediction accuracy for models comes at the expense of transferability i.e. markedly worse performance in new areas. Models interpolation and extrapolation performance was primarily assessed using AUC (the area under the curve of a receiver characteristic plot) and Kappa statistics, with supplementary comparisons examining model sensitivity and specificity values. Our AUC and Kappa results show that extrapolation to new areas is a greater challenge for all included modelling techniques than simple filling of gaps in a well-sampled area, but there are also differences among the techniques in the degree of transferability. Among the machine-learning modelling techniques, MAXENT, generalized boosting methods (GBM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) showed good transferability while the performance of GARP and random forest (RF) decreased notably in extrapolation. Among the regression-based methods, generalized additive models (GAM) and generalized linear models (GLM) showed good transferability. A desirable combination of good prediction accuracy and good transferability was evident for three modelling techniques: MAXENT, GBM, and GAM. However, examination of model sensitivity and specificity revealed that model types may differ in their tendencies to either increased over-prediction of presences or absences in extrapolation, and some of the methods show contrasting changes in sensitivity vs specificity (e.g. ANN and GARP). Among the three species groups, the best transferability was seen with birds, followed closely by butterflies, whereas reliable extrapolation for plant species distribution models appears to be a major challenge at least at this scale. Overall, detailed knowledge of the behaviour of different techniques in various study settings and with different species groups is of utmost importance in predictive modelling.

AB P>With rapidly increasing rates of contemporary extinction, predicting extinction vulnerability and identifying how multiple stressors drive non-random species loss have become key challenges in ecology. These assessments are crucial for avoiding the loss of key functional groups that sustain ecosystem processes and services. We developed a novel predictive framework of species extinction vulnerability and applied it to coral reef fishes. Although relatively few coral reef fishes are at risk of global extinction from climate disturbances, a negative convex relationship between fish species locally vulnerable to climate change vs. fisheries exploitation indicates that the entire community is vulnerable on the many reefs where both stressors co-occur. Fishes involved in maintaining key ecosystem functions are more at risk from fishing than climate disturbances. This finding is encouraging as local and regional commitment to fisheries management action can maintain reef ecosystem functions pending progress towards the more complex global problem of stabilizing the climate.

AB 1. Climate change has already caused distribution shifts in many species, and climate predictions strongly suggest that these will accelerate in the future. Obtaining reliable predictions of species range shifts under climate change is thus currently one of the most crucial challenges for both ecologists and stakeholders.
   2. Here we simulate the distributions of 16 North American tree species at a continental scale for the 21st century according to two IPCC storylines, using a process-based species distribution model that for the first time allows identification of the possible causes of distribution change.
   3. Our projections show local extinctions in the south of species ranges (21% of the present distribution, on average), and colonizations of new habitats in the north, though these are limited by dispersal ability for most species. Areas undergoing local extinctions are slightly larger under climate scenario A2 (+3.2 degrees C, +22% on average) than B2 (+1.0 degrees C, +19% on average). This small difference is caused by nonlinear responses of processes (leaves and flowers phenological processes in particular) to temperature. We also show that local extinction may proceed at a slower rate than forecasted so far.
   4. Although predicted distribution shifts are very species-specific, we show that the loss of habitats southward will be mostly due to increased drought mortality and decreased reproductive success, while northward colonizations will be primarily promoted by increased probability of fruit ripening and flower frost survival.
   5. Synthesis. Our results show that different species will not face the same risks due to climate change, because their responses to climate differ as well as their dispersal rate. Focusing on processes, our study therefore tempers the alarming conclusions of widely used niche-based models about biodiversity loss, mainly because our predictions take into account the local adaptation and trait plasticity to climate of the species.

AB The importance of hybridization in the evolution of plant species is widely accepted, but its contributions to animal species evolution remain less recognized. Here we review evidence that hybridization has contributed to the evolution of reef corals, a group underpinning the coral reef ecosystem. Increasingly threatened by human and climate-related impacts, there is need to understand the evolutionary processes that have given rise to their diversity and contribute to their resilience. Reticulate evolutionary pathways among the ecologically prominent, mass-spawning genus Acropora suggest that hybridization, although rare on ecological timescales, has been instrumental in their diversification on evolutionary timescales. Evidence that coral hybrids colonize marginal habitats distinct from those of parental species' and that hybridization may be more frequent at peripheral boundaries of species' ranges supports a role for hybridization in range expansion and adaptation to changing environments. We conclude that outcomes of hybridization are significant for the future resilience of reef corals and warrant inclusion in conservation strategies.

AB 1. The influence of hydraulic conditions on the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages was investigated in three riffles in a perennial Australian river.
   2. Velocity, depth and variability of substrate roughness were measured at each of 56 macroinvertebrate sampling locations. Complex hydraulic variables (roughness Reynolds number, shear velocity, Froude number) were calculated from combinations of two or three of the directly measured variables. The biological significance of directly measured and complex hydraulic variables was determined by a combination of univariate and multivariate statistical procedures.
   3. Macroinvertebrate abundance, number of taxa and community composition were significantly different between the identified roughness Reynolds number, Froude number, velocity and shear velocity microhabitats throughout the studied riffles.
   4. Regression analysis showed macroinvertebrate abundance and number of taxa were negatively related to roughness Reynolds number, shear velocity, velocity and Froude number. Depth was negatively related to abundance. In general, the majority of the macroinvertebrate community preferred the areas of riffles with the lowest near-bed turbulence.
   5. Roughness Reynolds number explained more of the spatial variation in invertebrate abundance, number of taxa and community composition than the other hydraulic variables, either directly measured or calculated. Of the directly measured variables, velocity had the greatest explanatory power, which was marginally less than roughness Reynolds number and shear velocity.
   6. This study demonstrated that small-scale differences in hydraulic conditions created by combinations of velocity, depth and substrate roughness have an important role in the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages in riffle habitats.

AB 1. After an absence of almost 100 years, the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx is slowly recovering in Germany along the German-Czech border. Additionally, many reintroduction schemes have been discussed, albeit controversially, for various locations. We present a habitat suitability model for lynx in Germany as a basis for further management and conservation efforts aimed at recolonization and population development.
   2. We developed a statistical habitat model using logistic regression to quantify the factors that describe lynx home ranges in a fragmented landscape. As no data were available for lynx distribution in Germany, we used data from the Swiss Jura Mountains for model development and validated the habitat model with telemetry data from the Czech Republic and Slovenia. We derived several variables describing land use and fragmentation, also introducing variables that described the connectivity of forested and non-forested semi-natural areas on a larger scale than the map resolution.
   3. We obtained a model with only one significant variable that described the connectivity of forested and non-forested semi-natural areas on a scale of about 80 km(2). This result is biologically meaningful, reflecting the absence of intensive human land use on the scale of an average female lynx home range. Model testing at a cut-off level of P > 0.5 correctly classified more than 80% of the Czech and Slovenian telemetry location data of resident lynx. Application of the model to Germany showed that the most suitable habitats for lynx were large-forested low mountain ranges and the large forests in east Germany.
   4. Our approach illustrates how information on habitat fragmentation on a large scale can be linked with local data to the potential benefit of lynx conservation in central Europe. Spatially explicit models like ours can form the basis for further assessing the population viability of species of conservation concern in suitable patches.

AB The influence of litter quality on root growth, ectomycorrhizal communities and decay processes was investigated through a litter bag experiment. Litter bags containing either pine needles, oak leaves or oak+ pine mix were placed within the O horizon of a lowland pitch pine (Pinus rigida) forest in the New Jersey Pinelands. Upon retrieval, ingrown pine roots were removed and quantified for total length and percent ectomycorrhizal colonization by morphotype. Phosphatase activity was determined for dominant morphotypes. In addition, litter decay rates and N and P litter content were measured. Mixed litter (oaks pine) had highest total pine root ingrowth. Dominant ectomycorrhizal morphotypes differed in response to litter type. A tuberculate form dominated (35%) in pine litters while distinctly different nontuberculate morphotypes dominated in oak and mixed litters. High phosphatase activity of morphotypes was correlated with high phosphorus immobilization during oak leaf decay. Results indicate that a mix of forest litters (oak and pine) optimizes retention of scarce nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The diverse chemical environment of these different litter types induces different ectomycorrhizal community development which show functional differences in the way phosphorus is likely to be cycled. The influence of litter type on diversity and function of ectomycorhizae is an important step in identifying linkages between biodiversity of this group and ecosystem functions.

AB Small species (<100 mm total length) are a diverse and abundant component of coral-reef fish assemblages. However, difficulties identifying and estimating the abundance of small species has meant that they are often ignored or undersampled in community level studies. We use studies that sampled whole assemblages in order to examine size/diversity and size/abundance patterns within coral-reef fish assemblages. We then examine body size in relation to patterns of habitat use, species interactions (competition and predation) and life histories of coral-reef fishes.
   Species diversity typically peaks in small size classes (<100 mm) and there are many low diversity larger size classes. In some assemblages, diversity also declines among the smallest species (<50 mm). The high diversity of small coral-reef fishes may partly be attributed to the complex structure of coral reefs. However, we find no evidence that diversity/size distributions are controlled by increased availability of niches or greater living space for small fishes. Regional-scale processes also influence local diversity of coral-reef fishes. In particular, high rates of speciation among small species might contribute to the observed diversity/size distributions.
   Declines in abundance with increasing body size have been attributed to equal partitioning of energy among species of different body sizes ("energetic equivalence rule"). We find no support for the "energetic equivalence rule" in assemblages of coral-reef fishes. Although body size was generally a poor predictor of abundance for coral-reef fishes, the upper bound of the size/abundance distribution was very uniform among the assemblages we examined. This upper bound may prove useful for selecting species most likely to be resource-limited.
   Small species of coral-reef fishes are more closely associated with the reef matrix than their larger counterparts. We propose that this is largely the result of high predation risk for small species. It is generally believed that smaller species and smaller size classes within species are subject to higher mortality rates. However, further studies are required to test this assumption.
   The diversity and abundance of small reef fishes, and their restriction to specialized habitats may increase the likelihood of competitive interactions. There is ample evidence of intraspecific competition among individuals of similar size in small coral-reef fishes. There is less evidence of interspecific competition among coral-reef fishes. However, the outcome of interspecific interactions will, in part, depend on the relative size of species. Because body size can influence the intensity with which predation and competition act, consideration of population size-structure may help develop multifactorial models of population dynamics of coral-reef fishes.

AB Changes in global fire activity are influenced by a multitude of factors including land-cover change, policies, and climatic conditions. This study uses 17 climate models to evaluate when changes in fire weather, as realized through the Fire Weather Index, emerge from the expected range of internal variability due to anthropogenic climate change using the time of emergence framework. Anthropogenic increases in extreme Fire Weather Index days emerge for 22% of burnable land area globally by 2019, including much of the Mediterranean and the Amazon. By the midtwenty-first century, emergence among the different Fire Weather Index metrics occurs for 33-62% of burnable lands. Emergence of heightened fire weather becomes more widespread as a function of global temperature change. At 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels, the area of emergence is half that for 3 degrees C. These results highlight increases in fire weather conditions with human-caused climate change and incentivize local adaptation efforts to limit detrimental fire impacts.
   Plain Language Summary Observed increases in the frequency and severity of fire weather have been observed across portions of the globe over the past half century. We used climate models to identify where and when anthropogenic climate change causes fire weather conditions to exceed that of natural variability. Modeling results show that emergence for some fire weather indices is already under way for a sizable portion of the globe, including much of southern Europe and the Amazon, and with an expansion of this area with continued warming over the twenty-first century. These findings suggest substantial increases in fire potential in regions where vegetation abundance and ignitions are not limiting, highlighting the urgency to adapt to changes in fire disturbances and hazards.

AB A unisexual species is generally associated with polyploidy, and reproduced by a unisexual reproduction mode, such as gynogenesis, hybridogenesis or parthenogenesis. Compared with other unisexual and polyploid species, gibel carp (Carassius auratus gibelio) has a higher ploidy level of hexaploid. It has undergone several successive rounds of genome polyploidy, and experienced an additional, more recent genome duplication event. More significantly, the dual reproduction modes, including gynogenesis and sexual reproduction, have been demonstrated to coexist in the polyploid gibel carp. This article reviews the genetic basis concerning polyploidy origin, clonal diversity and dual reproduction modes, and outlines the progress in new variety breeding and gene identification involved in the reproduction and early development. The data suggests that gibel carp are under an evolutionary trajectory of diploidization. As a novel evolutionary developmental (Evo-Devo) biology model, this work highlights future perspectives about the functional divergence of duplicated genes and the sexual origin of vertebrate animals.

AB Transportation infrastructures such as roads, railroads and canals can have major environmental impacts. Ecological road effects include the destruction and fragmentation of habitat, the interruption of ecological processes and increased erosion and pollution. Growing concern about these ecological road effects has led to the emergence of a new scientific discipline called road ecology. The goal of road ecology is to provide planners with scientific advice on how to avoid, minimize or mitigate negative environmental impacts of transportation. In this review, we explore the potential of molecular genetics to contribute to road ecology. First, we summarize general findings from road ecology and review studies that investigate road effects using genetic data. These studies generally focus only on barrier effects of roads on local genetic diversity and structure and only use a fraction of available molecular approaches. Thus, we propose additional molecular applications that can be used to evaluate road effects across multiple scales and dimensions of the biodiversity hierarchy. Finally, we make recommendations for future research questions and study designs that would advance molecular road ecology. Our review demonstrates that molecular approaches can substantially contribute to road ecology research and that interdisciplinary, long-term collaborations will be particularly important for realizing the full potential of molecular road ecology.

AB Mothers in a range of taxa manipulate the phenotype of their offspring in response to environmental change in order to maximize their own fitness. Most studies have focused on changes in the mean phenotype of offspring. Focusing on mean offspring phenotypes is appropriate for species in which mothers are likely to successfully predict the environment their offspring will experience, but what happens when the offspring's environment is unpredictable? Theory suggests that when mothers face uncertainty regarding their offspring's environment, they should increase within-clutch variation in the offspring phenotype (i.e. they should bet hedge). While comparative analyses support the idea that mothers do bet hedge in response to environmental unpredictability, empirical tests are very rare and it remains unclear whether mothers adaptively adjust variance in offspring traits ( a phenomenon we call dynamic bet hedging). As a first step towards examining dynamic bet hedging, we reanalysed data from five previously published studies. These studies were across a range of taxa, but all manipulated the maternal environment/phenotype and then examined changes in mean offspring size. We found some support for the theoretical predictions that mothers should increase within-clutch offspring size variation when faced with unpredictable environments. We predict that dynamic bet hedging is more common than previously anticipated and suggest that it has some interesting implications for the studies that focus on shifts in mean offspring traits alone. Hence, future studies should examine maternal effects on both the mean and the variance of offspring traits.

AB Soil C decomposition is sensitive to changes in temperature, and even small increases in temperature may prompt large releases of C from soils. But much of what we know about soil C responses to global change is based on short-term incubation data and model output that implicitly assumes soil C pools are composed of organic matter fractions with uniform temperature sensitivities. In contrast, kinetic theory based on chemical reactions suggests that older, more-resistant C fractions may be more temperature sensitive. Recent research on the subject is inconclusive, indicating that the temperature sensitivity of labile soil organic matter (OM) decomposition could either be greater than, less than, or equivalent to that of resistant soil OM. We incubated soils at constant temperature to deplete them of labile soil OM and then successively assessed the CO(2)-C efflux in response to warming. We found that the decomposition response to experimental warming early during soil incubation (when more labile C remained) was less than that later when labile C was depleted. These results suggest that the temperature sensitivity of resistant soil OM pools is greater than that for labile soil OM and that global change-driven soil C losses may be greater than previously estimated.

AB Policy makers are increasingly recognising the role of environmental valuation to guide and support the management and conservation of biodiversity. This paper presents a goods and services approach to determine the economic value of marine biodiversity in the UK, with the aim of clarifying the role of valuation in the management of marine biodiversity. The goods and services resulting from UK marine biodiversity are detailed, and 8 of the 13 services are valued in monetary terms. It is found that a decline in UK marine biodiversity could result in a varying, and at present unpredictable, change in the provision of goods and services, including reduced resilience and resistance to change, declining marine environmental health, reduced fisheries potential, and loss of recreational opportunities. The results suggest that this approach can facilitate biodiversity management by enabling the optimal allocation of limited management resources and through raising awareness of the importance of marine biodiversity.

AB Drought leads to a loss of longitudinal and lateral hydrologic connectivity, which causes direct or indirect changes in stream ecosystem properties. Changes in macrohabitat availability from a riffle-pool sequence to isolated pools are among the most conspicuous consequences of connectivity loss. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were compared among 3 distinct stream macrohabitats (riffles [R], pools connected to riffles [Pc], disconnected pools [Pd]) of 19 Mediterranean-climate sites in northern California to examine the influence of loss of habitat resulting from drought disturbance. At the time of sampling, 10 sites were perennial and included R and Pc macrohabitats, whereas 9 sites were intermittent and included only Pd macrohabitats. Taxa richness was more variable in Pd, and taxa richness was significantly lower in Pd than in Pc but not R. These results suggested a decline in richness between Pc and Pd that might be associated with loss of connectivity. Lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness relative to Odonata, Coleoptera, and Heteroptera (OCH) richness was observed for Pd than R and Pc macrohabitats. Family composition was more similar between R and Pc than between R or Pc and Pd macrohabitats. This similarity may be associated with greater connectivity between R and Pc macrohabitats. Correspondence analysis indicated that macroinvertebrate composition changed along a gradient from R to Pc and Pd that was related to a perennial-intermittent gradient across sites. High variability among macroinvertebrate assemblages in Pd could have been related to variability in the duration of intermittency. In cluster analysis, macroinvertebrate assemblages were grouped by macrohabitat first and then by site, suggesting that the macrohabitat filter had a greater influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages than did local site characteristics. Few taxa were found exclusively in Pc, and this macrohabitat shared numerous taxa with R and Pd, indicating that Pc may act as a bridge between R and Pd during drought. Drought is regarded as a ramp disturbance, but our results suggest that the response of macroinvertebrate assemblages to the loss of hydrological connectivity among macrohabitats is gradual, at least in Mediterranean-climate streams where drying is gradual. However, the changes may be more dramatic in and and semiarid streams or in Mediterranean-climate streams if drying is rapid.

AB Movement of coral reef fishes across marine reserve boundaries subsequent to their initial settlement from the plankton will affect the ability of no-take reserves to conserve stocks and to benefit adjacent fisheries. However, the mobility of most exploited reef species is poorly known. We tagged 1443 individuals of 35 reef fish species captured in Antillean fish traps in the Barbados Marine Reserve and adjacent non-reserve over a two-month period. Trapping and visual surveys were used to monitor the movements of these fish during the trapping period and the subsequent two months. Estimates of distances moved were corrected for the spatial distribution of sampling effort and for the number of recaptures of individual fish. Recapture rates for individual species ranged from 0-100% (median=38%). Species mobility estimated by recapture and resighting were highly correlated. Most species were strongly site attached, with the majority of recaptures and resightings occurring at the site of tagging. However, only one of 59 tagged jacks (Caranx latus, C. ruber) was ever resighted, suggesting emigration from the study area. All species were occasionally recorded away from the sites where they had been tagged (20-500 m), and several species, including surgeonfish, Acanthurus bahianus, A. coeruleus, filefish, Cantherhines pullus, butterflyfish, Chaetodon striatus, angelfish Holocanthus tricolor and parrotfish, Sparisoma viride, ranged widely within reefs. In contrast, few movements were observed between reefs separated by more than 20 m of sand and rubble, and no emigration from the Reserve was recorded. Most reef fishes vulnerable to Antillean traps appear sufficiently site-attached to benefit from reserves. However, many species move over a wide enough area to take them out of small reserves on continuous reef. Use of natural home range boundaries could minimize exposure of fishes in reserves to mortality from adjacent fisheries.

AB We studied genetic structure in polar bear (Ursus maritimus) populations by typing a sample of 473 individuals spanning the species distribution at 16 highly Variable microsatellite loci. No genetic discontinuities were found that would be consistent with evolutionarily significant periods of isolation between groups. Direct comparison of movement data and genetic data from the Canadian Arctic revealed a highly significant correlation. Genetic data generally supported existing population (management unit) designations, although there were two cases where genetic data failed to differentiate between pairs of populations previously resolved by movement data. A sharp contrast was found between the minimal genetic structure observed among populations surrounding the polar basin and the presence of several marked genetic discontinuities in the Canadian Arctic. The discontinuities in the Canadian Arctic caused the appearance of four genetic clusters of polar bear populations. These clusters vary in total estimated population size from 100 to over 10 000, and the smallest may merit a relatively conservative management strategy in consideration of its apparent isolation. We suggest that the observed pattern of genetic discontinuities has developed in response to differences in the seasonal distribution and pattern of sea ice habitat and the effects of these differences on the distribution and abundance of seals.

AB The entire mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA D-loop) was sequenced in the seven extant species of Alectoris partridges. The D-loop length is very conserved (1155 +/- 2 nucleotides), and substitution rates are lower than for the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of the same species, on average. Comparative analyses suggest that these D-loops can be divided into three domains, corresponding to the highly variable peripheral domains I and III and to the central conserved domain II of vertebrates (Baker and Marshall 1997). Nevertheless, the first 161 nucleotides of domain I of the Alectoris, immediately flanking the tRNA(Glu), evolve at an unusually low rate and show motifs similar to the mammalian extended termination-associated sequences [ETAS1 and ETAS2 (Sbisa et al. 1997)], which can form stable secondary structures. The second part of domain I contains a hypervariable region with two divergent copies of a tandemly repeated sequence described previously in other species of anseriforms and galliforms (Quinn and Wilson 1993; Fumihito et al. 1995). Some of the conserved sequence blocks of mammals can be mapped in the central domain of Alectoris. Domain III is highly variable and has sequences similar to mammalian CSB 1. The bidirectional transcription promoter HSP/LSP box of the chicken is partially conserved among the Alectoris. This structural organization can be found in the anseriform and,galliform species studied so far, suggesting that strong functional constraints might have controlled the evolution of the D-loop since the origin of Galloanserae.
   Their conserved organization and slow molecular evolution make D-loops of galliforms appropriate for phylogenetic studies, although homoplasy can be be generated at a few hypervariable sites and at some sites which probably have mutated by strand slippage during DNA replication. Phylogenetic analyses of D-loops of Alectoris are concordant with previously published cytochrome b and allozyme phylogenies (Randi 1996). Alectoris is monophyletic and includes three major clades: (1) basal bnl-bal a and melanocephala; (2) intermediate rufa and graeca; and (3) recent philbyi, magna, and chukar. Comparative description of the organization and substitution patterns of the mitochondrial control region can aid in mapping hypervariable sites and avoid some sources of homoplasy in data sets which are to be used in phylogenetic analyses.

AB Costs and benefits to group living in animals may affect the fitness of individual group members and also demography of the population. The effects of grouping on the growth, survival, and attainment of maturity of juveniles of an Hawaiian coral-reef damselfish (Dascyllus albisella) were evaluated from 1987 through 1989. In this species, pelagic larvae settle (at approximate to 14 mm total length) on coral heads, joining temporary groups of up to 15 juveniles. Group members establish a dominance hierarchy based on size, and fish leave these groups upon reaching mature size (70 mm total length) to enter the nearby adult population. Previously, I had demonstrated that larvae preferentially join larger groups and I expected to find clear advantages to group membership. Survival, especially of smaller fish, was enhanced in large groups, but growth, especially by individuals of low social status, was reduced. Consequently, the time to reach maturity increased with group size in both years of the study, suggesting a more rapid entry into the adult population of fish in smaller groups or living alone. However, the probability of reaching mature size (a function of size-specific growth and survival) increased with group size in 1988 but not in 1987, thus indicating a benefit to group living during only one of the two years of the study. Although this study demonstrated density-dependent juvenile growth and survival, with consequent fitness effects of group living, it has also highlighted considerable inter- and intra-annual variability in these relationships. Such variability will have major consequences for predictions of the effects of juvenile ecology on the demography of organisms.

AB The global distribution of the optimum air temperature for ecosystem-level gross primary productivity (T-opt(eco))is poorly understood, despite its importance for ecosystem carbon uptake under future warming. We provide empirical evidence for the existence of such an optimum, using measurements of in situ eddy covariance and satellite-derived proxies, and report its global distribution. T-opt(eco) is consistently lower than the physiological optimum temperature of leaf-level photosynthetic capacity, which typically exceeds 30 degrees C. The global average T-opt(eco) is estimated to be 23 +/- 6 degrees C, with warmer regions having higher T-opt(eco) values than colder regions. In tropical forests in particular, T-opt(eco) is close to growing-season air temperature and is projected to fall below it under all scenarios of future climate, suggesting a limited safe operating space for these ecosystems under future warming.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Given the substantial contributions of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services to society, forest sciences have a large potential to contribute to the integrity and sustainability of our future. This is especially true when the roles of biodiversity for sustaining ecosystem services are considered. The rapid expansion of sustainable forest management (SFM) has resulted in the adoption of various forest management frameworks intended to safeguard biodiversity. Concurrently, the importance of forest ecosystem services has been increasingly recognized. Although some initiatives aimed at conserving both biodiversity and ecosystem services are emerging, knowledge gaps still exist about their relationships and potential trade-offs in forests. Given recent advancements, increasing opportunities and some lags in forest ecology, further research on biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services will play substantial roles in the development of SFM practices. Here, we identified key issues including (i) relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function as a foundation of ecological integrity, (ii) resilience thinking to better prepare for and adapt to environmental changes, (iii) social-ecological perspectives that facilitate real-world conservation and management and (iv) theory-driven restoration that bridges science and practice. Thus, we illustrate priorities and future possibilities in applied ecology studies in forests, which will help society and ecosystems to build capacity and resilience to face uncertainty in the changing environment.Synthesis and applications. Under substantial human influences, forests are highly likely to be largely altered, potentially leading to the emergence of novel ecosystems or alternative stable states. Management thus needs more flexible, novel measures to address the significant uncertainty this generates. Resilience-based approaches are important to respond adaptively to future changes and cope with surprises, potentially providing multiple options. Although challenges exist, theory should play an important role in managing, conserving and restoring forest ecosystems. The issues discussed here should receive further attention in the context of the multiple goals of sustainable forest management.

AB Despite decades of research on the ecological consequences of stream network expansion, contraction and fragmentation, surprisingly little is known about the hydrological mechanisms that shape these processes. Here, we present field surveys of the active drainage networks of four California headwater streams (4-27km(2)) spanning diverse topographic, geologic and climatic settings. We show that these stream networks dynamically expand, contract, disconnect and reconnect across all the sites we studied. Stream networks at all four sites contract and disconnect during seasonal flow recessions, with their total active network length, and thus their active drainage densities, decreasing by factors of two to three across the range of flows captured in our field surveys. The total flowing lengths of the active stream networks are approximate power-law functions of unit discharge, with scaling exponents averaging 0.27 +/- 0.04 (range: 0.18-0.40). The number of points where surface flow originates obey similar power-law relationships, as do the lengths and origination points of flowing networks that are continuously connected to the outlet, with scaling exponents averaging 0.36-0.48. Even stream order shifts seasonally by up to two Strahler orders in our study catchments. Broadly, similar stream length scaling has been observed in catchments spanning widely varying geologic, topographic and climatic settings and spanning more than two orders of magnitude in size, suggesting that network extension/contraction is a general phenomenon that may have a general explanation. Points of emergence or disappearance of surface flow represent the balance between subsurface transmissivity in the hyporheic zone and the delivery of water from upstream. Thus the dynamics of stream network expansion and contraction, and connection and disconnection, may offer important clues to the spatial structure of the hyporheic zone, and to patterns and processes of runoff generation.

AB Predicting when, where and with what magnitude climate change is likely to affect the fitness, abundance and distribution of organisms and the functioning of ecosystems has emerged as a high priority for scientists and resource managers. However, even in cases where we have detailed knowledge of current species' range boundaries, we often do not understand what, if any, aspects of weather and climate act to set these limits. This shortcoming significantly curtails our capacity to predict potential future range shifts in response to climate change, especially since the factors that set range boundaries under those novel conditions may be different from those that set limits today. We quantitatively examine a nine-year time series of temperature records relevant to the body temperatures of intertidal mussels as measured using biomimetic sensors. Specifically, we explore how a 'climatology' of body temperatures, as opposed to long-term records of habitat-level parameters such as air and water temperatures, can be used to extrapolate meaningful spatial and temporal patterns of physiological stress. Using different metrics that correspond to various aspects of physiological stress (seasonal means, cumulative temperature and the return time of extremes) we show that these potential environmental stressors do not always occur in synchrony with one another. Our analysis also shows that patterns of animal temperature are not well correlated with simple, commonly used metrics such as air temperature. Detailed physiological studies can provide guidance to predicting the effects of global climate change on natural ecosystems but only if we concomitantly record, archive and model environmental signals at appropriate scales.

AB During the past few decades, urban and suburban developments have grown at unprecedented rates and extents with. unknown consequences for ecosystem function. Carbon pools of soil and vegetation on landscaped properties were examined in the Front Range of Colorado, USA, in order to characterize vegetation and soils found in urban green spaces; analyze their aboveground biomass, vegetative C storage, and soil C storage; and compare these suburban ecosystem properties to their counterparts in native grassland and cultivated fields.
   Anthropogenic activities leave clear signatures on all three C compartments measured. Management level dominates the response of grass production, biomass, and N tissue concentration. This, in turn, influences the amount of C and N both stored in and harvested from sites. The site age dominates the amount of woody biomass as well as soil C and N. Soil texture only secondarily affects total soil carbon and total bulk density.
   Established urban green spaces harbor larger C pools, more than double in some cases, than native grasslands or agricultural fields on a per-area basis. Lawn grass produces more biomass and stores more C than local prairie or agricultural fields. Introduced woody vegetation comprises a substantial C pool in urban green spaces and represents a new ecosystem feature. After an initial decrease with site development, soil organic carbon (SOC) pools surpass those in grasslands within two decades. In addition to the marked increase of C pools through time, a shift in storage from belowground to aboveground occurs. Whereas grasslands store similar to 90% of C belowground, urban green spaces store a decreasing proportion of the total C belowground in soils through time, reaching similar to 70% 30-40 years after construction. Despite the substantial increase in C pools in this urban area, it is important to recognize that this shift is distinct from C sequestration since it does not account for a total C budget, including increased anthropogenic C emissions from these sites.

AB Coral reef ecosystems are at the crossroads. While significant gaps still exist in our understanding of how "normal" reefs work, unprecedented changes in coral reef systems have forced the research community to change its focus from basic research to understand how one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world works to basic research with strong applied implications to alleviate damage, save, or restore coral reef ecosystems. A wide range of stressors on local, regional, and global spatial scales including over fishing, diseases, large-scale disturbance events, global climate change (e.g., ozone depletion, global warming), and over population have all contributed to declines in coral cover or phase shifts in community structure on time scales never observed before. Many of these changes are directly or indirectly related to anthropogenically induced changes in the global support network that affects all ecosystems. This review focuses on some recent advances in the experimental biology of coral reef ecosystems, and in particular scleractinian corals, at all levels of biological organization. Many of the areas of interest and techniques discussed reflect a progression of technological advances in biology and ecology but have found unique and timely application in the field of experimental coral reef biology. The review, by nature, will not be exhaustive and reflects the authors interests to a large degree. Because of the voluminous literature available, an attempt has been made to capture the essential elements and references for each topic discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Seven experiments were conducted. In each experiment, trials were run using two adult males and one female in a large arena. The first experiment tested the influence of body size. All males tested had no recent fighting experience for 6-12 months, and one male of each pair was 8-10% longer in snout-vent length and had greater mass. In all cases, larger males won fights and were first to locate, court and guard females; thus, larger snout-vent length was an important determinant of fighting success and priority of access to potential mates. Males with either winning or losing experience from the first experiment were used in six subsequent experiments on the relative importance of snout-vent length and agonistic experience in attaining dominance and mating success. Losing experience had a greater effect than snout-vent length on subsequent fighting success and gaining priority of access to females. Winning experience, in contrast, did not increase the probability of winning subsequent fights; however, winners appeared more excitable and none deferred from challenges of other males. The asymmetry in effects of single experiences of victory and defeat is consistent with studies on other vertebrates and supports the hypothesis that losing lights in males negatively affects behaviour directly related to their fitness.

AB Abundance of early juvenile Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) is dramatically higher in intertidal shell habitats compared to mud habitats in several coastal estuaries of the Pacific Northwest. To define the mechanisms underlying this habitat-specific pattern in abundance, we concurrently examined four components of recruitment to intertidal shell and mud habitats at two locations within the Grays Harbor estuary (Washington, USA): (1) water column supply of crab megalopae (postlarvae); (2) settlement patterns of crab megalopae 48 h after settlement substrates were deployed; (3) density of first benthic juvenile instars (J1) 48 h after deployment of such substrates; and (4) density of early juvenile crab in shell and mud habitats over a 4-mo period. We also describe the physical processes likely to be influencing postlarval supply within Grays Harbor, and take advantage of natural variation in postlarval supply between two locations, in combination with a predator exclusion experiment, to define the relative importance of postlarval supply vs. post-settlement survival in regulating population size of juvenile crab in certain intertidal habitats.
   Water column postlarval supply (measured with plankton and neuston nets, and artificial settlement substrates) in terms of both megalopal density (number per cubic metre) and flux (number per hour) was significantly higher in the southern part of the estuary vs. the northern part during a week-long settlement pulse. Our field observations and measurements suggest that spatial variation in postlarval supply was due to local differences in wind-driven surface currents, since tidal current speeds in the two locations were similar. Moreover, there was no correlation between current speed and flux of megalopae over the bottom. There was generally no difference in postlarval supply between shell and mud habitats. Our experimental results further indicate that: (1) the abundance of recently settled crab megalopae in 0.25 m(2) settlement trays was significantly higher in shell than in mud habitats, irrespective of whether the trays were placed in 3-5 ha of shell vs. mud; (2) there was a positive and significant correlation between postlarval supply and density of megalopae in shell and mud habitats; and (3) there was a positive and significant correlation between postlarval supply and density of J1 instars only in habitats where specific predators were excluded. Once the number of J1 instars at both geographic locations was reduced to similar levels, equivalent but steadily decreasing densities persisted throughout the summer growing season. The decoupling of settlement patterns and density of J1 instars took place within our 48-h sampling interval. Thus, future attempts to examine the correspondence between larval supply and post-settlement abundance of marine benthic species with planktonic larvae should do so at extremely small temporal scales or a critical life history phase may be overlooked. The results from this study demonstrate that substrate selection can affect distribution of juvenile crab, and that predation (including cannibalism) is a key factor regulating local population size of early juvenile crabs in intertidal habitats where postlarval supply is relatively high.

AB Rarity has been a central topic for conservation and evolutionary biologists aiming to determine the species characteristics that cause extinction risk. More recently, beyond the rarity of species, the rarity of functions or functional traits, called functional rarity, has gained momentum in helping to understand the impact of biodiversity decline on ecosystem functioning. However, a conceptual framework for defining and quantifying functional rarity is still lacking. We introduce 12 different forms of functional rarity along gradients of species scarcity and trait distinctiveness. We then highlight the potential key role of functional rarity in the long-term and large-scale maintenance of ecosystem processes, as well as the necessary linkage between functional and evolutionary rarity.

AB Managed relocation is defined as the movement of species, populations, or genotypes to places outside the areas of their historical distributions to maintain biological diversity or ecosystem functioning with changing climate. It has been claimed that a major extinction event is under way and that climate change is increasing its severity Projections indicating that climate change may drive substantial losses of biodiversity have compelled some scientists to suggest that traditional management strategies are insufficient. The managed relocation of species is a controversial management response to climate change. The published literature has emphasized biological concerns over difficult ethical, legal, and policy issues. Furthermore, ongoing managed relocation actions lack scientific and societal engagement. Our interdisciplinary team considered ethics, law, policy, ecology, and natural resources management in order to identify the key issues of managed relocation relevant for developing sound policies that support decisions for resource management. We recommend that government agencies develop and adopt best practices for managed relocation.

AB 1. The need to understand the processes shaping population distributions has resulted in a vast increase in the diversity of spatial wildlife data, leading to the development of many novel analytical techniques that are fit-for-purpose. One may aggregate location data into spatial units (e.g. grid cells) and model the resulting counts or presenceabsences as a function of environmental covariates. Alternatively, the point data may be modelled directly, by combining the individual observations with a set of random or regular points reflecting habitat availability, a method known as a use-availability design (or, alternatively a presence pseudo-absence or casecontrol design).
   2. Although these spatial point, count and presence-absence methods are widely used, the ecological literature is not explicit about their connections and how their parameter estimates and predictions should be interpreted. The objective of this study is to recapitulate some recent statistical results and illustrate that under certain assumptions, each method can be motivated by the same underlying spatial inhomogeneous Poisson point process (IPP) model in which the intensity function is modelled as a log-linear function of covariates.
   3. The Poisson likelihood used for count data is a discrete approximation of the IPP likelihood. Similarly, the presence-absence design will approximate the IPP likelihood, but only when spatial units (i.e. pixels) are extremely small (Electric Journal of Statistics, 2010, 4, 1151-1201). For larger pixel sizes, presence-absence designs do not differentiate between one or multiple observations within each pixel, hence leading to information loss.
   4. Logistic regression is often used to estimate the parameters of the IPP model using point data. Although the response variable is defined as 0 for the availability points, these zeros do not serve as true absences as is often assumed; rather, their role is to approximate the integral of the denominator in the IPP likelihood (The Annals of Applied Statistics, 2010, 4, 1383-1402). Because of this common misconception, the estimated exponential function of the linear predictor (i.e. the resource selection function) is often assumed to be proportional to occupancy. Like IPP and count models, this function is proportional to the expected density of observations.
   5. Understanding these (dis-)similarities between different species distribution modelling techniques should improve biological interpretation of spatial models and therefore advance ecological and methodological cross-fertilization.

AB We present an approach for diagnosing errors in land surface models in the time and frequency domains. The approach is applied to the Community Atmosphere-Biosphere-Land Exchange (CABLE). We compare modeled and observed fluxes of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), latent heat (LE) and sensible heat (H) at two different forested flux station sites. Using wavelet analysis, we identify the frequencies where model errors are relatively large, and then analyze the sensitivities of model errors at those frequencies to selected model parameters, yielding significant improvements in several measures of model performance. At Harvard Forest, the predictions by CABLE using the modified parameter values reduce model errors at daily to yearly timescales for all three fluxes, but not at interannual timescales for NEE. At the Tumbarumba site, predictions by CABLE with modified parameter values reduce the variance of model errors of all three fluxes from daily to interannual timescales, but do not improve the agreement with the observed mean diurnal or daily time series for H. We conclude that analyzing both mean and variance of model errors at a range of time/frequency scales is useful for identifying and reducing errors of a land surface model.

AB Complex population structure can result from either sex-biased gene flow or population overlap during migrations. Loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) have both traits, providing an instructive case history for wildlife management. Based on surveys of maternally inherited mtDNA, pelagic post-hatchlings show no population structure across the northern Atlantic (phi(ST) < 0.001, P = 0.919), subadults in coastal habitat show low structure among locations (phi(ST) = 0.01, P < 0.005), and nesting colonies along the southeastern coast of the United States have strong structure (phi(ST) = 0.42, P < 0.001). Thus the level of population structure increases through progressive life history stages. In contrast, a survey of biparentally inherited microsatellite DNA shows no significant population structure: R-ST < 0.001; F-ST = 0.002 (P > 0.05) across the same nesting colonies. These results indicate that loggerhead females home faithfully to their natal nesting colony, but males provide an avenue of gene flow between regional nesting colonies, probably via opportunistic mating in migratory corridors. As a result, all breeding populations in the southeastern United States have similar levels of microsatellite diversity (H-E = 0.70-0.89), whereas mtDNA haplotype diversity varies dramatically (h = 0.00-0.66). Under a conventional interpretation of the nuclear DNA data, the entire southeastern United States would be regarded as a single management unit, yet the mtDNA data indicate multiple isolated populations. This complex population structure mandates a different management strategy at each life stage. Perturbations to pelagic juveniles will have a diffuse impact on Atlantic nesting colonies, mortality of subadults will have a more focused impact on nearby breeding populations, and disturbances to adults will have pinpoint impact on corresponding breeding populations. These findings demonstrate that surveys of multiple life stages are desirable to resolve management units in migratory marine species.

AB Darwin's recognition that male-male competition and female choice could favor the evolution of exaggerated male traits detrimental to survival set the stage for more than a century of theoretical and empirical work on sexual selection. While this Darwinian paradigm represents one of the most profound insights in biology, its preoccupation with sexual selection as a directional evolutionary force acting on males has diverted attention away from the selective processes acting on females. Our understanding of female reproduction has been further confounded by discreet female mating tactics that have perpetuated the illusion of the monogamous female and masked the potential for conflict between the sexes. With advances in molecular techniques leading to the discovery that polyandry is a pervasive mating strategy, recognition of these shortcomings has brought the study of sexual selection to its current state of flux. In this paper, we suggest that progress in two key areas is critical to formulation of a more inclusive, sexual selection paradigm that adequately incorporates selection from the female perspective. First, we need to develop a better understanding of male x female and maternal x paternal genome interactions and the role that polyandry plays in providing females with non-additive genetic benefits such as incompatibility avoidance. Consideration of these interaction effects influencing natural selection on females is important because they can complicate and even undermine directional sexual selection on males. Secondly, because antagonistic coevolution maintains a balance between opposing sides that obscures the conflict itself, many more experimental evolution studies and interventionist investigations (e.g. gene knockouts) are needed to tease apart male manipulative adaptations and female counter-adaptations. It seems evident that the divisiveness and controversy that has plagued sexual selection theory since Darwin first proposed the idea has often stalled progress in this important field of evolutionary biology. What is now needed is a more pluralistic and integrative approach that considers natural as well as sexual selection acting on females, incorporates multiple sexual selection mechanisms, and exploits advances in physiology and molecular biology to understand the mechanisms through which males and females achieve reproductive success.

AB The mating frequency of females in social insects is particularly interesting, because polyandry reduces colony relatedness and increases within-colony genetic variance. It thereby affects a complex balance of benefits and costs that determine the degree of reproductive skew, sex allocation to offspring, or the opportunities for nepotism and policing strategies. Few systematic surveys of female mating frequencies exist and many are based on unreliable behavioural. observation or sperm counts. Here, we report the results of a survey of mating frequencies in eight European Bombus spp. by means of highly polymorphic microsatellite loci. Only B. hypnorum was found to be multiply mated, while the pattern found in B, terrestris, B. lucorum, B, pratorum, B. lapidarius, B. sicheli, B. hortorum, and B. pascuorum was compatible with single mating. The findings are compatible with recent claims that, with some exceptions, mating frequencies of social insect females are generally low.

AB We present a physiological model of isoprene (2-methyl-3-butadiene) Emission which considers the cost for isoprene synthesis, and the production of reductive equivalents in reactions of photosynthetic electron transport for Liquidambar styraciflua L, and for North American and European deciduous temperate Quercus species, In the model,,ve differentiate between leaf morphology (leaf dry mass per area, M-A, g m(-2)) altering the content of enzymes of isoprene synthesis pathway per unit leaf area, and biochemical potentials of average leaf cells determining their capacity for isoprene emission. Isoprene emission rate per unit leaf area (mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) is calculated as the product of MA, the fraction of total electron flow used for isoprene synthesis (epsilon, mol mol(-1)), the rate of photosynthetic electron transport (J) per unit leaf dry mass (J(m), mu mol g(-1) s(-1)), and the reciprocal of the electron cost of isoprene synthesis [mol isoprene (mol electrons(-1))], The initial estimate of electron cost of isoprene synthesis is calculated according to the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate pathway recently discovered in the chloroplasts, and is further modified to account for extra electron requirements because of photorespiration, The rate of photosynthetic electron transport is calculated by a process-based leaf photosynthesis model. A satisfactory fit to the light-dependence of isoprene emission is obtained using the light response curve of J, and a single value of epsilon, that is dependent on the isoprene synthase activity in the leaves. Temperature dependence of isoprene emission is obtained by combining the temperature response curves of photosynthetic electron transport, the shape of which is related to long-term temperature during leaf growth and development, and the specific activity of isoprene synthase, which is considered as essentially constant for all plants. The results of simulations demonstrate that the variety of temperature responses of isoprene emission observed within and among the species in previous studies mag be explained by different optimum temperatures of J and/or limited maximum fraction of electrons used for isoprene synthesis, The model provides good fits to diurnal courses of field measurements of isoprene emission, and is also able to describe the changes in isoprene emission under stress conditions, for example, the decline in isoprene emission in water-stressed leaves.

AB 1. Ecosystem functioning relies heavily on below-ground processes, which are largely regulated by plant fine-roots and their functional traits. However, our knowledge of fine-root trait distribution relies to date on local-and regional-scale studies with limited numbers of species, growth forms and environmental variation.
   2. We compiled a world-wide fine-root trait dataset, featuring 1115 species from contrasting climatic areas, phylogeny and growth forms to test a series of hypotheses pertaining to the influence of plant functional types, soil and climate variables, and the degree of manipulation of plant growing conditions on species fine-root trait variation. Most particularly, we tested the competing hypotheses that fine-root traits typical of faster return on investment would be most strongly associated with conditions of limiting versus favourable soil resource availability. We accounted for both data source and species phylogenetic relatedness.
   3. We demonstrate that: (i) Climate conditions promoting soil fertility relate negatively to fine-root traits favouring fast soil resource acquisition, with a particularly strong positive effect of temperature on fine-root diameter and negative effect on specific root length (SRL), and a negative effect of rainfall on root nitrogen concentration; (ii) Soil bulk density strongly influences species fine-root morphology, by favouring thicker, denser fine-roots; (iii) Fine-roots from herbaceous species are on average finer and have higher SRL than those of woody species, and N-2-fixing capacity positively relates to root nitrogen; and (iv) Plants growing in pots have higher SRL than those grown in the field.
   4. Synthesis. This study reveals both the large variation in fine-root traits encountered globally and the relevance of several key plant functional types and soil and climate variables for explaining a substantial part of this variation. Climate, particularly temperature, and plant functional types were the two strongest predictors of fine-root trait variation. High trait variation occurred at local scales, suggesting that wide-ranging below-ground resource economics strategies are viable within most climatic areas and soil conditions.

AB The study of landscape connectivity in conservation has increased considerably since the early part of the 21st century. While the implications of landscape connectivity are self-evident for conservation, they are also important for physical geography since a proper understanding of landscape patterns and processes allows for better landscape management practices, which are at the core of geography. This paper presents a review of the literature based on 162 publications from 2000 to 2013, in which we evaluated the current state and recent advances in the integration of landscape connectivity in the identification and planning of conservation areas. The literature review and data analysis were based on a database organized into five categories: General information, study areas, research objectives, research methods in connectivity studies, and integration of connectivity with conservation. We found a substantial increase in the number of publications relating to connectivity and conservation from 2008 to 2013. Least cost analysis was the method most commonly applied. We found no implementation of landscape connectivity proposals generated by the studies (e.g. potential corridors) into real landscape elements to ensure the permanence and functionality of ecosystems. We identified four important niches for potential future research projects: a) connectivity and climate change, b) contribution of connectivity studies to restoration planning, c) connectivity and land cover/land use change modeling and planning, d) contribution of connectivity analysis in the provision of ecosystem services across landscapes.

AB This paper conceptualizes the REDD+ policy framework as the world's largest experiment in Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES). REDD+ promotes the commodification of ecosystems' carbon storage and sequestration functions on a global scale and it is consistent with market-based conservation approaches and the 'neoliberalization of nature'. REDD+ is therefore problematized on the grounds that, first, eases a transition from an ethically informed conservation ethos to a utilitarian one that simplifies nature and undermines socio-ecological resilience; second, relies on a single valuation language that may crowd-out conservation motivations in the short and long term; and, last, is sustained on a 'multiple-win' discourse that in practice lacks procedural legitimacy in many developing countries and reproduces existing inequities and forms of social exclusion. The argument is developed drawing on PES literature and insights from critical theorists and practitioners of nature conservation.

AB Rather than simply enhancing invasion risk, climate change may also reduce invasive plant competitiveness if conditions become climatically unsuitable. Using bioclimatic envelope modeling, we show that climate change could result in both range expansion and contraction for five widespread and dominant invasive plants in the western United States. Yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis) and tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) are likely to expand with climate change. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and spotted knapweed (Centaurea biebersteinii) are likely to shift in range, leading to both expansion and contraction. Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) is likely to contract. The retreat of once-intractable invasive species could create restoration opportunities across millions of hectares. Identifying and establishing native or novel species in places where invasive species contract will pose a considerable challenge for ecologists and land managers. This challenge must be addressed before other undesirable species invade and eliminate restoration opportunities.

ID DISTURBANCE
AB This paper establishes a framework within which a rapid and pragmatic assessment of river ecosystems can be undertaken at a broad, subcontinental scale, highlighting some implications for achieving conservation of river biodiversity in water-limited countries. The status of river ecosystems associated with main rivers in South Africa was assessed based on the extent to which each ecosystem had been altered from its natural condition. This requires consistent data on river integrity for the entire country, which was only available for main rivers; tributaries were thus excluded from the analyses. The state of main river ecosystems in South Africa is dire: 84% of the ecosystems are threatened, with a disturbing 54% critically endangered, 18% endangered, and 12% vulnerable. Protection levels were measured as the proportion of conservation target achieved within protected areas, where the conservation target was set as 20% of the total length of each river ecosystem. Sixteen of the 112 main river ecosystems are moderately to well represented within protected areas; the majority of the ecosystems have very low levels of representation, or are not represented at all within protected areas. Only 50% of rivers within protected areas are intact, but this is a higher proportion compared to rivers outside (28%), providing some of the first quantitative data on the positive role protected areas can play in conserving river ecosystems. This is also the first assessment of river ecosystems in South Africa to apply a similar approach to parallel assessments of terrestrial, marine, and estuarine ecosystems, and it revealed that main river ecosystems are in a critical state, far worse than terrestrial ecosystems. Ecosystem status is likely to differ with the inclusion of tributaries, since options may well exist for conserving critically endangered ecosystems in intact tributaries, which are generally less regulated than main rivers. This study highlights the importance of healthy tributaries for achieving river conservation targets, and the need for managing main rivers as conduits across the landscape to support ecological processes that depend on connectivity. We also highlight the need for a paradigm shift in the way protected areas are designated, as well as the need for integrated river basin management plans to include explicit conservation visions, targets, and strategies to ensure the conservation of freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide.

AB The contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizas (AAA) to plant community structure and diversity is reported here in an annual herbland in southern Australia.
   Mycorrhizal colonization was reduced in field plots by applying the fungicide benomyl as a soil drench. The mycorrhiza-responsiveness of plant species was assessed in intact soil cores containing the indigenous AAA fungi and in a pot experiment using an isolate of Glomus mosseae.
   Glasshouse experiments showed that Medicago minima, Vittadinia gracilis and Velleia arguta were highly mycorrhiza-responsive, Salvia verbenaca became colonized but exhibited no growth response to AM, and Carrichtera annua remained uncolonized. There was no change in plant species richness in mycorrhiza-suppressed field plots but diversity increased owing to an increase in evenness. Treatment had no effect on community productivity and therefore there was no relationship between mycorrhizal effects on diversity and productivity.
   Mycorrhizal responsiveness was not a good predictor of species response to suppression of AM in the field. The mycorrhiza-responsive species V. gracilis and V. arguta were not affected by reduced mycorrhizal colonization in fungicide-treated plots, suggesting that competition from the mycorrhiza-responsive dominant M. minima offset the benefits of mycorrhizal association for these species.

AB For organisms with complex life histories, processes occurring during transitions between stages can strongly affect population dynamics. The major life history transition for many marine species is settlement from pelagic larvae to benthic or demersal juveniles. We examined differential mortality at settlement as a function of early life history traits (size-at-age, growth rates) in three cohorts of two common Caribbean coral reef fishes, Thalassoma bifasciatum and Halichoeres bivittatus (Labridae). We deployed light traps to collect late-stage larvae of each cohort. We also collected juveniles of each cohort at regular intervals (every second day) for two weeks following their first appearance on the nearshore reefs of Barbados, West Indies, during the spring (April-May) and fall (August-October) of 1997. Comparisons' of otolith-derived traits exhibited by younger recruits (initial group) to those exhibited by older juveniles (survivor group) revealed that there was a difference in otolith growth during metamorphosis for both species: survivors had wider metamorphic bands. In addition, surviving H. bivittatus exhibited higher larval growth rates than settlers, while surviving T. bifasciatum had higher juvenile growth during the first day following emergence onto the reef. Differences in otolith growth rates in the absence of similar changes in somatic size indicate that mortality may have acted upon a growth-based characteristic of condition. We hypothesize that larvae Settling in better physiological condition differentially survived the early juvenile period. Finally, selective mortality appeared to be greatest during a relatively brief window of time surrounding metamorphosis, indicating that this is a critical period. These results point to the demographic importance of transitional periods between stages for animals with complex life cycles. Furthermore, traits exhibited by earlier stages can significantly influence survival during these transitional periods.

AB Overharvest and habitat alteration have led to a collapse of most commercial Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) fisheries while pushing the species to rarity or extirpation in most of its historical range. A biologically sound conservation program for this species requires knowledge of its genetic diversity and of the evolutionary relationships among geographic populations. To address these research needs, six microsatellite loci were isolated from A. o. oxyrinchus. Pedigree analysis suggested that all are inherited in a codominant Mendelian pattern. The six loci were tested in ten additional sturgeon species from three genera and three apparent ploidy levels (4n, 8n, 16n). Approximately 70% of successful locus-species amplifications were polymorphic. Polysomy was observed most often in 8n and 16n species. Genetic diversity and population structure of A. o. oxyrinchus were assayed using three polymorphic Aox markers and four markers developed from lake sturgeon (A. fulvescens). A. o. oxyrinchus were sampled from the Altamaha River, Georgia, USA north to the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada. Gulf sturgeon, A. o. desotoi, were sampled from the Suwannee River, Florida, USA, to assess differentiation between the subspecies. Seventy-seven alleles were observed to segregate into unique multilocus genotypes for each of the 392 individuals assayed. Mean diversity was greatest in the Chesapeake Bay (9.7 alleles per locus) and Delaware River (7.4 alleles per locus) collections, and lowest in the St. Lawrence River (4.6 alleles per locus). Mean heterozygosity across seven loci ranged from 44.3% (St. Lawrence River) to 62.6% (Altamaha River). Significant allelic heterogeneity was observed in 82% of pairwise comparisons as well as a global test (p < 0.0001) for A. o. oxyrinchus collections. Genetic distance suggests the presence of at least six subpopulations in A. o. oxyrinchus: St. Lawrence River, St. John River, Hudson River, Delaware River, Albemarle Sound, and Altamaha River. Genetic and geographic distances were positively correlated (r = 0.57, p < 0.03) among A. o. oxyrinchus, suggesting isolation by distance and philopatry. Hierarchical gene diversity analysis indicated significant genetic population structure at every level. Maximum likelihood assignment tests correctly assigned individual fish to collection with a high rate of success (mean = 87.5%); this and other lines of evidence indicated that the Chesapeake Bay collection represents a mixed population of sub-adult sturgeon from northern and southern Atlantic coast populations. Population structure was correlated with that suggested by earlier mitochondrial (mt) DNA analyses. Significant diversity was observed between two Canadian populations from which only a single mtDNA haplotype has been reported.

AB In the 1930s, the Scandinavian brown bear was close to extinction due to vigorous extermination programmes in Norway and Sweden. Increased protection of the brown bear in Scandinavia has resulted in the recovery of four subpopulations, which currently contain close to 1000 individuals. Effective conservation and management of the Scandinavian brown bear requires knowledge of the current levels of genetic diversity and gene flow among the four subpopulations. Earlier studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity revealed extremely low levels of genetic variation, and population structure that grouped the three northern subpopulations in one genetic clade and the southernmost subpopulation in a second highly divergent clade. In this study, we extended the analysis of genetic diversity and gene flow in the Scandinavian brown bear using data from 19 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci. Results from the nuclear loci were strikingly different than the mtDNA results. Genetic diversity levels in the four subpopulations were equivalent to diversity levels in nonbottlenecked populations from North America, and significantly higher than levels in other bottlenecked and isolated brown bear populations. Gene flow levels between subpopulations ranged from low to moderate and were correlated with geographical distance. The substantial difference in results obtained using mtDNA and nuclear DNA markers stresses the importance of collecting data from both types of genetic markers before interpreting data and making recommendations for the conservation and management of natural populations. Based on the results from the mtDNA and nuclear DNA data sets, we propose one evolutionarily significant unit and four management units for the brown bear in Scandinavia.

AB 1. We examined assemblage structure of tropical fishes on small, artificial reefs to determine if differences in refuge availability could modify patterns of species richness and abundance of fishes established at recruitment.
   2. Our artificial reefs were designed to provide prey refuge of two types (permanent and transient), Permanent refugia are those that physically exclude predators, i.e. small holes provide permanent refuge from large-bodied predators. Transient refugia result when habitat complexity increases the probability that prey will elude predators. These refugia do not physically exclude predators and thus provide no permanently safe sites.
   3. We conducted this experiment at two widely separated locations on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The species pools of reef fishes, recruitment rates and predator densities all differ between these locations.
   4. At neither location were patterns of recruitment influenced by the presence of either type of refuge. By the end of the experiment, however, there were more resident fishes on reefs with additional refugia.
   5. Species richness of residents was positively related to total abundance of residents. Therefore, refuge availability indirectly affected species richness through its effect on abundance. There was no indication, however, that permanent refugia provided any greater protection to prey species than did transient refugia.
   6. Our results therefore indicate that for these communities, patterns of species richness and abundance established at settlement can be modified considerably over small spatial and temporal scales by differences in refuge availability. Furthermore, habitat complexity need not provide permanently safe sites to affect patterns of coexistence.

AB The process by which a species becomes a biological invader, at a location where it does not naturally occur, can be divided into a series of sequential stages (transport, introduction, establishment and spread). A species' success at passing through each of these stages depends, in a large part, on the number of individuals available to assist making each transition. Here, we review the evidence that numbers determine success at each stage of the invasion process and then discuss the likely mechanisms by which numbers affect success. We conclude that numbers of individuals affect transport and introduction by moderating the likelihood that abundant (and widespread) species are deliberately or accidentally translocated; affect establishment success by moderating the stochastic processes (demographic, environmental, genetic or Allee) to which small, introduced populations will be vulnerable; and affect invasive spread most likely because of persistent genetic effects determined by the numbers of individuals involved in the establishment phase. We finish by suggesting some further steps to advance our understanding of the influence of numbers on invasion success, particularly as they relate to the genetics of the process.

AB Climate change is expected to make many regions of the world much drier over coming decades(1,2). More intense drought would transform rivers(3) with potentially severe but largely unknown consequences at higher (multispecies) levels of organization(4). Here we show experimentally how the intensification of drought may alter the underlying structure and functioning (biomass flux dynamics) of freshwater food webs-networks of species and their interactions(5). Drought triggered substantial losses of species and links, especially among predators, leading to the partial collapse of the food webs. Total resource-consumer biomass flux was also strongly suppressed by disturbance, yet several network-level properties (such as connectance and interaction diversity) were conserved, driven by consumer resource fidelity and a substantial reconfiguration of fluxes within the webs as production shifted down the size spectrum from large to small species. Our research demonstrates that drier climates could have far-reaching impacts on the functioning of freshwater ecosystems.

   SELECTION
AB The status of genomics and genetics research in the Myrtaceae, a large family of dicotyledonous woody plants, is reviewed with Eucalyptus as the focal genus. The family contains over 5,650 species in 130 to 150 genera, predominantly of neo-tropical and Southern Hemisphere distribution. Several genera are well known for their economic importance worldwide. Myrtaceae are typically diploids with small to intermediate genome size. Microsatellites have been developed for several genera while higher throughput marker systems such as diversity arrays technology and single nucleotide polymorphism are available for Eucalyptus. Molecular data have been fundamental to current perspectives on the phylogeny, phylogeography and taxonomy of the Myrtaceae, while numerous studies of genetic diversity have been carried out particularly as it relates to endangered, rare, fragmented, overharvested or economically important species. Large expressed sequence tag collections for species of Eucalyptus have recently become public to support the annotation of the Eucalyptus grandis genome. Transcriptomics in Eucalyptus has advanced by microarrays and next-generation sequencing focusing on wood development. Linkage maps for Eucalyptus display high synteny across species and have been extensively used to map quantitative trait loci for a number of traits including growth, wood quality, disease and insect resistance. Candidate gene-based association genetics have successfully found marker-trait associations for wood and fiber traits. Genomic selection experiments have demonstrated clear potential to improve the efficiency of breeding programs while freeze-tolerant transgenic Eucalyptus trials have recently been initiated. The recently released E. grandis genome, sequenced to an average coverage of 8x, will open up exceptional opportunities to advance Myrtaceae genetics and genomics research.

AB Marine stock enhancement is a set of management approaches involving the release of cultured organisms to enhance or restore fisheries. Such practices, including sea ranching, stock enhancement, and restocking, are widespread, of variable success, and often controversial. A set of principles aimed at promoting responsible development of restocking, stock enhancement, and sea ranching has been proposed by Blankenship and Leber [American Fisheries Society Symposia 15: 167-175 (1995)], and has gained widespread acceptance as the 'Responsible Approach'. Fisheries science and management, in general, and many aspects of fisheries enhancement have developed rapidly since the responsible approach was first formulated. Here we provide an update to the Responsible Approach in light of these developments. The updated approach emphasizes the need for taking a broad and integrated view of the role of enhancements within fisheries management systems; using a stakeholder participatory and scientifically informed, accountable planning process; and assessing the potential contribution of enhancement and alternative or additional measures to fisheries management goals early on in the development or reform process. Progress in fisheries assessment methods applicable to enhancements and in fisheries governance provides the means for practical implementation of the updated approach.

AB Recent developments have highlighted the importance of forest amount at large spatial scales and of matrix quality for ecological processes in remnants. These developments, in turn, suggest the potential for reducing biodiversity loss through the maintenance of a high percentage of forest combined with sensitive management of anthropogenic areas. We conducted a multi-taxa survey to evaluate the potential for biodiversity maintenance in an Atlantic forest landscape that presented a favorable context from a theoretical perspective (high proportion of mature forest partly surrounded by structurally complex matrices). We sampled ferns, butterflies, frogs, lizards, bats, small mammals and birds in interiors and edges of large and small mature forest remnants and two matrices (second-growth forests and shade cacao plantations), as well as trees in interiors of small and large remnants. By considering richness, abundance and composition of forest specialists and generalists, we investigated the biodiversity value of matrix habitats (comparing them with interiors of large remnants for all groups except tree), and evaluated area (for all groups) and edge effects (for all groups except trees) in mature forest remnants. our results suggest that in landscapes comprising high amounts of mature forest and low contrasting matrices: (1) shade cacao plantations and second-growth forests harbor an appreciable number of forest specialists; (2) most forest specialist assemblages are not affected by area or edge effects, while most generalist assemblages proliferate at edges of small remnants. Nevertheless, differences in tree assemblages, especially among smaller trees, Suggest that observed patterns are unlikely to be stable over time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The observation of monophyly for a specified set of genealogical lineages is often used to place the lineages into a distinctive taxonomic entity. However, it is sometimes possible that monophyly of the lineages can occur by chance as an outcome of the random branching of lineages within a single taxon. Thus, especially for small samples, an observation of monophyly for a set of lineages-even if strongly supported statistically-does not necessarily indicate that the lineages are from a distinctive group. Here I develop a test of the null hypothesis that monophyly is a chance outcome of random branching. I also compute the sample size required so that the probability of chance occurrence of monophyly of a specified set of lineages lies below a prescribed tolerance. Under the null model of random branching, the probability that monophyly of the lineages in an index group occurs by chance is substantial if the sample is highly asymmetric, that is, if only a few of the sampled lineages are from the index group, or if only a few lineages are external to the group. If sample sizes are similar inside and outside the group of interest, however, chance occurrence of monophyly can be rejected at stringent significance levels (P < 10(-5)) even for quite small samples (approximate to 20 total lineages). For a fixed total sample size, rejection of the null hypothesis of random branching in a single taxon occurs at the most stringent level if samples of nearly equal size inside and outside the index group-with a slightly greater size within the index group-are used. Similar results apply, with smaller sample sizes needed, when reciprocal monophyly of two groups, rather than monophyly of a single group, is of interest. The results suggest minimal sample sizes required for inferences to be made about taxonomic distinctiveness from observations of monophyly.

AB Variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning are novel statistical approaches that provide deeper understanding of the importance of different explanatory variables for biodiversity patterns than traditional regression methods. Using these methods, the variation in occupancy and abundance of the clouded apollo butterfly (Parnassius mnemosyne L.) was decomposed into independent and joint effects of larval and adult food resources, microclimate and habitat quantity. The independent effect of habitat quantity variables (habitat area and connectivity) captured the largest fraction of the variation in the clouded apollo patterns, but habitat connectivity had a major contribution only for occupancy data. The independent effects of resources and microclimate were higher on butterfly abundance than on occupancy. However, a considerable amount of variation in the butterfly patterns was accounted for by the joint effects of predictors and may thus be causally related to two or all three groups of variables. Abundance of the butterfly in the surroundings of the focal grid cell had a significant effect in all analyses, independently of the effects of other predictors. Our results encourage wider applications of partitioning methods in biodiversity studies.

AB Swallowtail butterflies are recognized as model organisms in ecology, evolutionary biology, genetics, and conservation biology but present numerous unresolved phylogenetic problems. We inferred phylogenetic relationships for 51 of about 205 species of the genus Papilio ( sensu lato) from 3.3-Kilobase (kb) sequences of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (2.3 kb of cytochrome oxidases I and II and 1.0 kb of elongation factor 1alpha). Congruent phylogenetic trees were recovered within Papilio from analyses of combined data using maximum likelihood, Bayesian analysis, and maximum parsimony bootstrap consensus. Several disagreements with the traditional classification of Papilio were found. Five major previously hypothesized subdivisions within Papilio were well supported: Heraclides, Pterourus, Chilasa, Papilio ( sensu stricto), and Eleppone. Further studies are required to clarify relationships within traditional "Princeps," which was paraphyletic. Several biologically interesting characteristics of Papilio appear to have polyphyletic origins, including mimetic adults, larval host associations, and larval morphology. Early diversification within Papilio is estimated at 55 - 65 million years ago based on a combination of biogeographic time constraints rather than fossils. This divergence time suggests that Papilio has slower apparent substitution rates than do Drosophila and fig-pollinating wasps and/or divergences corrected using best-fit substitution models are still being consistently underestimated. The amount of sequence divergence between Papilio subdivisions is equivalent to divergences between genera in other tribes of the Papilionidae, and between genera of moths of the noctuid subfamily Heliothinae.

AB Several recent studies have claimed to present experimental evidence from synthesised plant communities in which diversity was varied as a treatment that diversity reduces community invasibility by other plant species. This type of result contrasts from that of many observational studies which find diversity and invasibility to be positively correlated in nature, but some recent literature has claimed that these observational studies are confounded by extrinsic covarying factors while experimental studies are not. In this article I evaluate each of eight experiments from six recent publications in which the effect of varying plant diversity on the success of invasive species was investigated. In each ca se that invasibility was identified by the authors as being adversely affected by plant species richness, the result can be explained by factors that covaried with diversity in the experiment, most notably as a consequence of "sampling effect" (in which the most competitive species or species combination in the total species pool has a greater probability of occurring as species richness is increased), or through the incorrect use of statistical techniques. It is proposed that the apparent discrepancy between the results of many observational and experimental studies at least in grasslands is because: (1) in observational studies competitive dominant species are often associated with the most productive plots, and these dominants both reduce diversity through competitive exclusion of subordinates and competitively suppress invasive species; and (2) in recent experimental studies "sampling effect" results in the most competitive species (and therefore those most likely to suppress the invader) occurring with greater frequency as diversity is increased. Both observational and experimental studies therefore point to the role of competitive dominants in reducing invasibility, and in both situations species richness of the plant community need not be invoked as an explanation for the results.

AB In the past decade much attention has focused on the role that genetics can play in the formation of management strategies in conservation. Here, we describe genetic diversity in the world's largest lizard, the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), examining the evolutionary relationships and population genetic history of the four islands in south-east Indonesia, which form the vast majority of its range. We identify distinct genetic groups for conservation. The population on the island of Komodo shows by far the largest values of genetic divergence and is proposed that it should be a separate conservation management unit. Other populations, surviving either on small islands with substantially reduced genetic variability, or in isolated patches, are identified as particularly vulnerable to stochastic threats and habitat loss. Our results provide an example of how data defining intraspecific levels of genetic divergence can provide information to help management plans, ensure the maintenance of genetic variability across populations and identify evolutionary potential within endangered species.

AB Two intervals of the Phanerozoic stand out as times of biosphere-scale revolution in the sense that biogeochemical cycles came under increased control by organisms. These are the early Paleozoic (extending from just before the Cambrian to the Middle Ordovician, a duration of about 100 m.y.), characterized by the appearance of predators, burrowers, and mineralized skeletons, and by the subsequent diversification of planktonic animals and suspension-feeders; and the later Mesozoic (latest Triassic to mid-Cretaceous, a duration of somewhat more than 100 m.y.), marked by a great diversification of predators and burrowers and by the rise of mineralized planktonic protists. This paper explores the economic conditions that make such revolutions possible.
   I argue that opportunities for innovation and diversification are enhanced when raw materials and energy are supplied at increasing rates, or when organisms gain greater access to these commodities through rising temperatures and higher metabolic rates. Greater per capita availability of resources enables populations to grow; lessens or alters ecological constraints on functional improvement; makes possible the evolution of high metabolic rates (large incomes), which in turn permit improvement in each of several otherwise incompatible functions; and favors the establishment and spread of daughter species arising through founder speciation. Reductions in productivity reinforce adaptational constraints and may bring about extinctions.
   Massive submarine volcanism, together with-its associated phenomena of warming, sea-level rise, and widening of warm-weather zones, is proposed to be the chief extrinsic trigger for the Phanerozoic revolutions. The later Mesozoic was characterized by continental rifting, which accompanied massive submarine volcanic eruptions that produced large quantities of nutrients and carbon dioxide. This activity began in the Late Triassic and peaked in the mid- to Late Cretaceous. The Early Cambrian was also a time of rifting and may likewise have been marked by large-scale submarine volcanism. Continental and explosive volcanism, weathering, and upwelling are other potential means for increasing evolutionary opportunity, but their effects are either local or linked directly or indirectly with cooling. Intense chemical weathering in the Early Cambrian, however, may have contributed to the early Paleozoic revolution.
   The extrinsic stimulus was greatly amplified through positive feedback by the evolution of higher metabolic rates and other means for acquiring, trading, retaining, and recycling resources more rapidly and from a wider range of environments. Because these novelties usually require a high and predictable supply of resources, their evolution is more likely when extrinsically controlled supplies increase rather than when per capita availability is low.
   In the view adopted here, the microevolutionary and microeconomic market forces of competition and natural selection operate against a backdrop of macroeconomic supply and demand. Resources are under both extrinsic and intrinsic control. Positive and negative feedbacks link processes at the micro- and macroeconomic levels. This view complements the genealogical and hierarchical conception of evolution by emphasizing that the pattern of descent is influenced by resources and by market forces operating at all scales of space and time.

AB Biological invasions are a leading threat to native wildlife, human health and food production worldwide. Understanding the invasion history helps identifying introduction pathways and organizing integrated management strategies especially aimed at avoiding multiple reintroductions. We coupled a recently developed spatial analysis (Geographic profiling) with trade flows quantification to identify the most likely spreading centre of a recent invader of Europe, the spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii. This polyphagous vinegar fly recently colonized western countries, where it is heavily threatening fruit production causing severe economic losses. Characterized by a rapid spread and a huge impact, the invasion of this pest has a few precedents and it is becoming a model in invasion biology and pest management. Thanks to our spatial approach based on data presence of D. suzukii in European countries in the very first years of it spread, we update the current knowledge of a first spread in Spain and Italy, suggesting on the contrary that the South of France may be the most likely spreading centre of D. suzukii in Europe. Estimates of propagule pressure (fresh host fruits importation) support this finding as imports from contaminated South East Asian countries are higher in France than in Spain or Italy. Our study provides a first step in the comprehension of invasion history of this pest species and emphasizes geographic profiling as an efficient technique to track down invaders colonization patterns.

AB Ecological fire management in Australia is often built on an assumption that meeting the needs of plant species will automatically meet the needs of animal species. However, the scarcity of ecological data on the needs of fauna in relation to fire undermines the confidence managers should place in current popular frameworks for planning ecological burning. Such frameworks are built almost entirely around the goal of maintaining plant community diversity. They provide little guidance to managers regarding the characteristics of desirable 'mosaics' (e.g. patch size, connectivity or composition of age-since-burnt classes) or the timing of fires in relation to faunal population trends linked to other cycles (e.g. El Nino events). Claims by agencies of adopting an adaptive management approach ('learning by doing') to cope with a dearth of knowledge are credible only if monitoring and evaluation are carried out and future actions are modified in light of new evidence.Much monitoring of fauna is of such a small scale and short duration that the statistical likelihood of detecting a positive or negative effect of the management regime is minute.Such shortcomings will only be overcome through broad-scale and/or long-term studies of fauna. The funding for such research is unlikely to be forthcoming if fire ecologists and land managers convey the impression that the current data are adequate for the implementation of the current planning frameworks.

AB Here we present a review of how the study of the geographic distribution of genetic lineages (phylogeography) has helped identify management units, evolutionary significant units, cryptic species, and areas of endemism, and how this information can help efforts to achieve effective conservation of coral reefs. These studies have confirmed the major biogeographic barriers that were originally identified by tropical species distributions. Ancient separations, identified primarily with mtDNA sequence comparisons, became apparent between populations on each side of the barriers. The general lack of correlation between pelagic larval duration and genetic connectivity across barriers indicates that life history and ecology can be as influential as oceanography and geography in shaping evolutionary partitions within ocean basins. Hence, conservation strategies require a recognition of ecological hotspots, those areas where habitat heterogeneity promotes speciation, in addition to more traditional approaches based on biogeography. Finally, the emerging field of genomics will add a new dimension to phylogeography, allowing the study of genes that are pertinent to recent and ongoing differentiation, and ultimately providing higher resolution to detect evolutionary significant units that have diverged in an ecological time scale.

AB Traditional views on deep evolutionary events have been seriously challenged over the last few years, following the identification of major pitfalls affecting molecular phylogeny reconstruction. Here we describe the principally encountered artifacts, notably long branch attraction, and their causes (i.e., difference in evolutionary rates, mutational saturation, compositional biases). Additional difficulties due to phenomena of biological nature (i.e., lateral gene transfer, recombination, hidden paralogy) are also discussed. Moreover, contrary to common beliefs, we show that the use of rare genomic events can also be misleading and should be treated with the same caution as standard molecular phylogeny. The universal tree of life, as described in most textbooks, is partly affected by tree reconstruction artifacts, e.g. (i) the bacterial rooting of the universal tree of life; (ii) the early emergence of amitochondriate lineages in eukaryotic phylogenies; and (iii) the position of hyperthermophilic taxa in bacterial phylogenies. We present an alternative view of this tree, based on recent evidence obtained from reanalyses of ancient data sets and from novel analyses of large combination of genes.

AB 1. Light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (A(max)), nitrogen (N), chlorophyll (Chl) content and leaf mass per unit area (LMA) were measured in leaves of trees of different heights along a natural light gradient in a French Guiana rain forest. The following four species, arranged in order from most shade-tolerant to pioneer, were studied: Duguetia surinamensis, Vouacapoua americana, Dicorynia guianensis and Goupia glabra. Light availability of trees was estimated using hemispherical photography.
   2. The pioneer species Goupia had the lowest LMA and leaf N on both an area and mass basis, whereas Duguetia had the highest values. In general, leaf variables of Vouacapoua and Dicorynia tended to be intermediates. Because A(max)/area was similar among species, Goupia showed both a much higher light-saturated photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUEmax) and A(max)/mass. Leaves of Vouacapoua demonstrated the greatest plasticity in A(max)/area, particularly in small saplings.
   3. A distinction could be made between the effect of tree height and light availability on the structural, i.e. LMA, and photosynthetic leaf characteristics of all four species. The direction and magnitude of the variation in variables were similar among species.
   4. LMA was the key variable that mainly determined variation in the other leaf variables along tree height and light availability gradients, with the exception of changes in chlorophyll concentration. A(max)/area, N/area, LMA and stomatal conductance to water vapour (g(s)) increased, whereas Chl/mass decreased, with both increasing tree height and canopy openness. A(max)/mass, PNUEmax and A(max)/Chl increased with increasing openness only. N/mass and Chl/area were independent of tree height and openness, except for small saplings of Goupia which had a much lower Chl/area.

AB 1. Many alien weeds pose significant environmental and/or economic threats across the globe, and methods to assess the potential risk of species introductions are key components in the management of plant invasions. Three broad approaches have been adopted in weed risk assessment: quantitative statistical models, semi-quantitative scoring and qualitative expert assessment. Yet, the effectiveness of these different approaches is rarely evaluated. By bringing together perspectives drawn from statistics, complexity theory, bioeconomics and cognitive psychology, this review presents the first interdisciplinary appraisal of whether weed risk assessment is a valuable tool in the management of plant invasions.
   2. Problems in obtaining an objective measure of the hazards posed by weeds, challenges of predicting complex hierarchical and nonlinear systems, difficulties in quantifying uncertainty and variability, as well as cognitive biases in expert judgement, all limit the utility of current risk assessment approaches. The accuracy of weed risk assessment protocols is usually insufficient, given inherent low base-rates even when the costs and benefits of decisions are taken into account, and implies that the predictive value of weed risk assessment is questionable.
   3. Current practices could be improved to address consistent hazard identification, encompass a hierarchy of spatio-temporal scales, incorporate uncertainty, generate realistic base-rates, and train risk assessors to limit cognitive biases. However, such refinements may still fail to predict weed risks any better than a knowledge of prior invasion history and quality of climate match.
   4. Alternative approaches include scenario planning that seeks qualitative inputs regarding hypothetical events to facilitate long-range planning using multiple alternatives each explicit in their treatment of uncertainty. This represents a change from prevention towards adaptive management where the difficulty in prediction is acknowledged and investment targets early detection, mitigation and management.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Scenario planning may be particularly suitable for weeds as they can be rapidly surveyed and have sufficiently long lag phases between naturalisation and invasion that early detection is often feasible. If integrated with assessments of ecosystem vulnerability to invasion and interventions to improve ecosystem resilience, it would deliver a robust post-border approach to invasive plant management. This approach would address threats from new introductions as well as 'sleeper weeds' already present in a region.

AB Anthropogenic global changes in biodiversity are generally portrayed in terms of massive native species losses or invasions caused by recent human disturbance. Yet these biodiversity changes and others caused directly by human populations and their use of land tend to co-occur as long-term biodiversity change processes in the Anthropocene. Here we explore contemporary anthropogenic global patterns in vascular plant species richness at regional landscape scales by combining spatially explicit models and estimates for native species loss together with gains in exotics caused by species invasions and the introduction of agricultural domesticates and ornamental exotic plants. The patterns thus derived confirm that while native losses are likely significant across at least half of Earth's ice-free land, model predictions indicate that plant species richness has increased overall in most regional landscapes, mostly because species invasions tend to exceed native losses. While global observing systems and models that integrate anthropogenic species loss, introduction and invasion at regional landscape scales remain at an early stage of development, integrating predictions from existing models within a single assessment confirms their vast global extent and significance while revealing novel patterns and their potential drivers. Effective global stewardship of plant biodiversity in the Anthropocene will require integrated frameworks for observing, modeling and forecasting the different forms of anthropogenic biodiversity change processes at regional landscape scales, towards conserving biodiversity within the novel plant communities created and sustained by human systems.

AB Behavioral ecologists generally agree that animals derive benefits from familiarity with spaces that they inhabit or visit, yet site familiarity is rudimentary or lacking in most models of habitat selection. In this review, I examine evidence for the occurrence of site familiarity and its fitness benefits, describe the difficulty of measuring site familiarity, note its omission from the influential ideal free and ideal despotic models, and use a literature search to test an assumption of the ideal models that has become widespread in habitat selection theory: that animals behave without regard for site familiarity. I find little support for such "familiarity blindness" in vertebrates. Next I discuss how the study of public information has drawn attention away from site familiarity and point out that both kinds of information are likely to be important in habitat selection. I proceed to examine current models of initial settlement (exploration and settlement of prebreeders on first territories) and optional resettlement (site fidelity or dispersal by established breeders following a period of prospecting) and find that the latter include only basic forms of site familiarity. Hence, I develop the concept that an inhabited space holds a unique "private value" to an animal based on its familiarity with the space and offer a simple model for optional resettlement based on private value that generates several novel predictions, including site fidelity based on cumulative breeding site familiarity and high site fidelity among species with complex territories.

AB Species distribution model is the term most frequently used in ecological modelling, but other authors used instead predictive habitat distribution model or species-habitat models. A consensual ecological modelling terminology that avoids misunderstandings and takes into account the ecological niche theory does not exist at present. Moreover, different studies differ in the type of niche that is represented by similar distribution models. I propose to use as standard ecological modelling terminology the terms "ecological niche", "potential niche", "realized niche" models (for modelling their respective niches), and "habitat suitability map" (for the output of the niche models). Therefore, the user can understand more easily that models always forecast species' niche and relate more closely the different types of niche models. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB The interdisciplinary fields of conservation physiology, macrophysiology, and mechanistic ecological forecasting have recently emerged as means of integrating detailed physiological responses to the broader questions of ecological and evolutionary responses to global climate change. Bridging the gap between large-scale records of weather and climate (as measured by remote sensing platforms, buoys and ground-based weather stations) and the physical world as experienced by organisms (niche-level measurements) requires a mechanistic understanding of how 'environmental signals' (parameters such as air, surface and water temperature, food availability, water flow) are translated into signals at the scale of the organism or cell (e. g. body temperature, food capture, hydrodynamic force, aerobic capacity). Predicting the impacts of how changing environments affect populations and ecosystems further mandates an understanding of how organisms 'filter' these signals via their physiological response (e. g. whether they respond to high or low frequencies, whether there is a time lag in response, etc.) and must be placed within the context of adult movement and the dispersal of larvae and gametes. Recent studies have shown that patterns of physiological stress in nature are far more complex in space and time than previously assumed and challenge the long-held paradigm that patterns of biogeographic distribution can be based on simple environmental gradients. An integrative, systems-based approach can provide an understanding of the roles of environmental and physiological variability in driving ecological responses and can offer considerable insight and predictive capacity to researchers, resource managers and policy makers involved in planning for the current and future effects of climate change.

AB Herbivores not only consume resources, but they are resources for other consumers. Consequently, they have much potential to mediate effects that cascade tip and down trophic chains in ecosystems. The way those effects are mediated depends on individual-scale properties of herbivores including constraints determining resource limitation, herbivore feeding mode, the adaptive trade-off to balance nutrient intake and predation risk avoidance, and the need to maintain homeostatic balance of elemental chemistry in the face of widely varying elemental composition of plant resources. These factors determine the rates of ecosystem functions such as production, decomposition and nutrient cycling. This review integrates those factors to build a conceptual framework for looking at herbivore-mediated effects in ecosystems. The framework systematically resolves how herbivores and carnivores directly and indirectly interact with plants to shape ecosystem functions. It can be used to motivate new field experimentation aimed at elucidating mechanisms of trophic control of ecosystem function.

AB Plant roots may be linked by shared or common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) that constitute pathways for the transfer of resources among plants. The potential for water transfer by such networks was examined by manipulating CMNs independently of plant roots in order to isolate the role(s) of ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) networks in the plant water balance during drought (soil water potential -5.9 MPa). Fluorescent tracer dyes and deuterium-enriched water were used to follow the pathways of water transfer from coastal live oak seedlings (Quercus agrifolia Nee; colonized by EM and AMF) conducting hydraulic lift (HL) into the roots of water-stressed seedlings connected only by EM (Q. agrifolia) or AMF networks (Q. agrifolia, Eriogonum fasciculatum Benth., Salvia mellifera Greene, Keckiella antirrhinoides Benth). When connected to donor plants by hyphal linkages, deuterium was detected in the transpiration flux of receiver oak plants, and dye-labelled extraradical hyphae, rhizomorphs, mantles, and Hartig nets were observed in receiver EM oak roots, and in AMF hyphae of Salvia. Hyphal labelling was scarce in Eriogonum and Keckiella since these species are less dependent on AMF. The observed patterns of dye distribution also indicated that only a small percentage of mycorrhizal roots and extraradical hyphae were involved with water transfer among plants. Our results suggest that the movement of water by CMNs is potentially important to plant survival during drought, and that the functional ecophysiological traits of individual mycorrhizal fungi may be a component of this mechanism.

   STABILITY; SYSTEM
AB The standard temporal method for estimating effective population size (N-e) assumes that generations are discrete, but it is routinely applied to species with overlapping generations. We evaluated bias in the estimates III caused by violation of this assumption, using simulated data for three model species: humans (type I survival), sparrow (type II), and barnacle (type III). We verify a previous proposal by Felsenstein that weighting individuals by reproductive value is the correct way to calculate parametric population allele frequencies, in which case the rate of change in age-structured populations conforms to that predicted by discrete-generation models. "AThen the standard temporal method is applied to agestructured species, typical sampling regimes (sampling only newborns or adults; randomly sampling the entire population) do not yield properly weighted allele frequencies and result in biased XT,. The direction and magnitude of the bias are shown to depend on the sampling method and the species' life history. Results for populations that grow (or decline) at a constant rate paralleled those for populations of constant size. If sufficient demographic data are available and certain sampling restrictions are met, the Jorde-Ryman modification of the temporal method can be applied to any species with overlapping generations. Alternatively, spacing the temporal samples many generations apart maximizes the drift signal compared to sampling biases associated with age structure.

AB Recent global warming threatens many species and has already caused population- and species-level extinctions. In particular, high risks of extinction are expected for isolated populations of species with low dispersal abilities. These predictions rely on widely used 'climatic envelope' models, while individual responses, the ultimate driver of a species response to climate change, have been most often neglected. Here, we report on some changes in life-history traits of a dispersal-limited reptile species (a poorly studied taxa) living in isolated populations. Using long-term data on common lizards collected in southern France, we show that individual body size dramatically increased in all the four populations studied over the past 18 years. This increase in body size in all age classes appeared related to a concomitant increase in temperature experienced during the first month of life (August). Daily maximum temperature in August increased by 2.2 degrees C and yearling snout-vent-length increased by about 28%. As a result, adult female body size increased markedly, and, as fecundity is strongly dependent on female body size, clutch size and total reproductive output also increased. For one population where capture-recapture data were available, adult survival was positively related to May temperature. All fitness components investigated therefore responded positively to the increase in temperature, such that it might be concluded that the common lizard has been advantaged by the shift in temperature. We contrast these short-term results with the long-term habitat-based prediction that these populations located close to mountain tops on the southern margin of the species range should be unable to cope with the alteration of their habitat. To achieve a better prediction of a species persistence, one will probably need to combine both habitat and individual-based approaches.

AB Background and Aims Monsi and Saeki (1953) published the first mathematical model of canopy photosynthesis that was based on the light attenuation within a canopy and a light response of leaf photosynthesis. This paper reviews the evolution and development of their theory.
   Scope Monsi and Saeki showed that under full light conditions, canopy photosynthesis is maximized at a high leaf area index (LAI, total leaf area per unit ground area) with vertically inclined leaves, while under low light conditions, it is at a low LAI with horizontal leaves. They suggested that actual plants develop a stand structure to maximize canopy photosynthesis. Combination of the Monsi-Saeki model with the cost-benefit hypothesis in resource use led to a new canopy photosynthesis model, where leaf nitrogen distribution and associated photosynthetic capacity were taken into account. The gradient of leaf nitrogen in a canopy was shown to be a direct response to the gradient of light. This response enables plants to use light and nitrogen efficiently, two resources whose supply is limited in the natural environment.
   Conclusion The canopy photosynthesis model stimulated studies to scale-up from chloroplast biochemistry to canopy carbon gain and to analyse the resource-use strategy of species and individuals growing at different light and nitrogen availabilities. Canopy photosynthesis models are useful to analyse the size structure of populations in plant communities and to predict the structure and function of future terrestrial ecosystems.

AB In rice plants grown under red light supplemented with blue light (red/blue-light PPFD ratio was 4/1), photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area measured under white light at 1,600 and 250 mumol m(-2) s(-1) were higher than those in the plants grown under red light alone. The higher photosynthetic rates were associated with higher total N content of leaves, which was accompanied by larger amounts of key components of photosynthesis-limiting processes, including Rubisco, Cyt f, Chl and LHCII. These results suggested that the increase in total N content of leaves induced by supplemental blue light enhanced both light-saturated and light-limited photosynthesis.

AB Phylogenetic relationships among many lineages of angiosperms have been clarified via the analysis of large molecular data sets. However, with a data set of three genes (18S rDNA, rbcL, and atpB), relationships among lineages of core eudicots (Berberidopsidales, Caryophyllales, Gunnerales, Santalales, Saxifragales, asterids, rosids) remain essentially unresolved. We added 26S rDNA sequences to a three-gene matrix for 201 eudicots (8430 base pair aligned nucleotides per taxon). Parsimony analyses provided moderate (84%) jackknife support for Gunnerales, which comprise the two enigmatic families Gunneraceae and Myrothamnaceae, as sister to all other core eudicots. This position of Gunnerales has important implications for floral evolution. A dimerous or trimerous perianth is frequently encountered, in early-diverging eudicots (e.g., Buxaceae, Proteales, Ranunculales, Trochodendraceae), whereas in core eudicots, pentamery predominates. Significantly, dimery is found in Gunneraceae and perhaps Myrothamnaceae (the merosity of the latter has also been interpreted as labile). Parsimony reconstructions of perianth merosity demonstrate lability among early-diverging eudicots and further indicate that a dimerous perianth could be the immediate precursor to the pentamerous condition characteristic of core eudicots. Thus, the developmental canalization that yielded the pentamerous condition of core eudicots occurred after the node leading to Gunnerales.

AB Air pollution studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO), a gaseous free radical, is a potent photosynthetic inhibitor that reduces CO2 uptake activity in leaves. It is now recognized that NO is not only an air pollutant hut also an endogenously produced metabolite, which may play a role in regulating plant cell functions. Although many studies have suggested the presence of mammalian-type NO synthase (NOS) in plants, the source of NO is still not clear. There has been a number of studies indicating that plant cells possess a nitrite-dependent NO production pathway which can be distinguished from the NOS-mediated reaction. Nitrate reductase (NR) has been recently found to be capable of producing NO through one-electron reduction of nitrite using NAD(P)H as an electron donor. This review focuses on current understanding of the mechanism for the nitrite-dependent NO production in plants. Impacts of NO produced by NR on photosynthesis are discussed in association with photo-oxidative stress in leaves.

AB Populations of rodents were studied for periods of 7-9 years at each of three sites in arid Australia. All species fluctuated dramatically in abundance, being absent or in low numbers during droughts but erupting after significant rainfall. Strong correlations were obtained between capture rates and cumulative monthly rainfall residuals, with time lags, that had been modified by an exponential decay function to model the post-rain depletion of resources. The introduced Mus domesticus erupted within only two months of exceptional rainfall at one site, whereas the native rodents Notomys alexis. Pseudomys hermannsburgensis and P. desertor generally responded 3-10 months after rain. The faster response of M. domesticus reflects its high reproductive potential compared with the native rodents, and perhaps greater immigration. Differences in magnitudes and delays in response to rainfall among the native species were due probably to differences in initial population sizes and times available for response and, for P. desertor, to between-site differences in the quality or quantity of food resources. Population declines in all species during dry periods probably followed resource shortages.
   Despite the usually strong linkage between rainfall and population dynamics, rain failed to trigger population responses in rodents for prolonged periods at two of the sites, and was not clearly associated with an eruption of P. hermannsburgensis at the third. The lack of a population response at one site was attributed to predation, but events at the other two remain unexplained. We conclude that long-term studies should play an important role in describing temporal changes in rodent populations in arid Australia and, with field experiments, in evaluating how rainfall and other factors combine to effect the changes.

AB 1. Plants use light as a source of both energy and information. Plant physiological responses to light, and interactions between plants and animals (such as herbivory and pollination), have evolved under a more or less stable regime of 24-h cycles of light and darkness, and, outside of the tropics, seasonal variation in day length.
   2. The rapid spread of outdoor electric lighting across the globe over the past century has caused an unprecedented disruption to these natural light cycles. Artificial light is widespread in the environment, varying in intensity by several orders of magnitude from faint skyglow reflected from distant cities to direct illumination of urban and suburban vegetation.
   3. In many cases, artificial light in the night-time environment is sufficiently bright to induce a physiological response in plants, affecting their phenology, growth form and resource allocation. The physiology, behaviour and ecology of herbivores and pollinators are also likely to be impacted by artificial light. Thus, understanding the ecological consequences of artificial light at night is critical to determine the full impact of human activity on ecosystems.
   4. Synthesis. Understanding the impacts of artificial night-time light on wild plants and natural vegetation requires linking the knowledge gained from over a century of experimental research on the impacts of light on plants in the laboratory and glasshouse with knowledge of the intensity, spatial distribution, spectral composition and timing of light in the night-time environment. To understand fully the extent of these impacts requires conceptual models that can (i) characterize the highly heterogeneous nature of the night-time light environment at a scale relevant to plant physiology; and (ii) scale physiological responses to predict impacts at the level of the whole plant, population, community and ecosystem.

AB Spatial climate models were developed for M,xico and its periphery (southern USA, Cuba, Belize and Guatemala) for monthly normals (1961-1990) of average, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation using thin plate smoothing splines of ANUSPLIN software on ca. 3,800 observations. The fit of the model was generally good: the signal was considerably less than one-half of the number of observations, and reasonable standard errors for the surfaces would be less than 1A degrees C for temperature and 10-15% for precipitation. Monthly normals were updated for three time periods according to three General Circulation Models and three emission scenarios. On average, mean annual temperature would increase 1.5A degrees C by year 2030, 2.3A degrees C by year 2060 and 3.7A degrees C by year 2090; annual precipitation would decrease -6.7% by year 2030, -9.0% by year 2060 and -18.2% by year 2090. By converting monthly means into a series of variables relevant to biology (e. g., degree-days > 5A degrees C, aridity index), the models are directly suited for inferring plant-climate relationships and, therefore, in assessing impact of and developing programs for accommodating global warming. Programs are outlined for (a) assisting migration of four commercially important species of pine distributed in altitudinal sequence in Michoacan State (b) developing conservation programs in the floristically diverse Tehuacan Valley, and (c) perpetuating Pinus chiapensis, a threatened endemic.

AB We examine the advantages and disadvantages of a methodological framework designed to analyze the poorly understood relationships between the ecosystem properties of large portions of land, and their capacities (stocks) to provide goods and services (flows). These capacities (stocks) are referred to as landscape functions. The core of our assessment is a set of expert- and literature-driven binary links, expressing whether specific land uses or other environmental properties have a supportive or neutral role for given landscape functions. The binary links were applied to the environmental properties of 581 administrative units of Europe with widely differing environmental conditions and this resulted in a spatially explicit landscape function assessment. To check under what circumstances the binary links are able to replace complex interrelations, we compared the landscape function maps with independently generated continent-wide assessments (maps of ecosystem services or environmental parameters/indicators). This rigorous testing revealed that for 9 out of 15 functions the straightforward binary links work satisfactorily and generate plausible geographical patterns. This conclusion holds primarily for production functions. The sensitivity of the nine landscape functions to changes in land use was assessed with four land use scenarios (IPCC SRES). It was found that most European regions maintain their capacity to provide the selected services under any of the four scenarios, although in some cases at other locations within the region. At the proposed continental scale, the selected input parameters are thus valid proxies which can be used to assess the mid-term potential of landscapes to provide goods and services.

AB Aim Although parameter estimates are not as affected by spatial autocorrelation as Type I errors, the change from classical null hypothesis significance testing to model selection under an information theoretic approach does not completely avoid problems caused by spatial autocorrelation. Here we briefly review the model selection approach based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and present a new routine for Spatial Analysis in Macroecology (SAM) software that helps establishing minimum adequate models in the presence of spatial autocorrelation.
   Innovation We illustrate how a model selection approach based on the AIC can be used in geographical data by modelling patterns of mammal species in South America represented in a grid system (n = 383) with 2 degrees of resolution, as a function of five environmental explanatory variables, performing an exhaustive search of minimum adequate models considering three regression methods: non-spatial ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial eigenvector mapping and the autoregressive (lagged-response) model. The models selected by spatial methods included a smaller number of explanatory variables than the one selected by OLS, and minimum adequate models contain different explanatory variables, although model averaging revealed a similar rank of explanatory variables.
   Main consclusions We stress that the AIC is sensitive to the presence of spatial autocorrelation, generating unstable and overfitted minimum adequate models to describe macroecological data based on non-spatial OLS regression. Alternative regression techniques provided different minimum adequate models and have different uncertainty levels. Despite this, the averaged model based on Akaike weights generates consistent and robust results across different methods and may be the best approach for understanding of macroecological patterns.

AB 1. We tested the generality of global leaf trait relationships among 44 tropical plant species from a broad array of growth forms (trees, lianas and understorey plants) in lowland Panama to determine how leaf trait relationships vary with whole-plant morphology within one site.
   2. We observed significant variation among growth forms for seven out of 10 leaf traits. Variation in leaf traits among growth forms was more pronounced per area than per mass. Thirteen bivariate leaf trait relationships that describe how plants allocate resources to photosynthesis were significant across all species. Growth forms showed distinct slopes, intercepts or shifts in the common slope for 12 of the 13 relationships.
   3. Trait relationships within trees and lianas showed good agreement with a global leaf trait data set. However, for understorey plants, trait relationships that included specific leaf area (SLA) deviated from the global data set, suggesting that understorey leaf-allocation patterns optimize SLA, and hence growth.
   4. Lianas showed lower values and rates of gas exchange than trees, and longer leaf life span for a given SLA, illustrating variation in leaf traits associated with growth form and canopy geometry.
   5. Functional variation in allocation to photosynthetic capacity among tropical forest species is related to microhabitat variations in light availability and whole-plant morphology among growth forms.

AB The many components of seasonal adaptations in insects are reviewed, especially from the viewpoint of aspects that must be studied in order to understand the structure and purposes of the adaptations. Component responses include dispersal, habitat selection, habitat modification, resistance to cold, dryness, and food limitation, trade-offs, diapause, modifications of developmental rate, sensitivity to environmental signals, life-cycle patterns including multiple alternatives in one species, and types of variation in phenology and development. Spatial, temporal, and resource elements of the environment are also reviewed, as are environmental signals, supporting the conclusion that further understanding of all of these seasonal responses requires detailed simultaneous study of the natural environments that drive the patterns of response.

AB Aim We explored the effects of prevalence, latitudinal range and spatial autocorrelation of species distribution patterns on the accuracy of bioclimate envelope models of butterflies.
   Location Finland, northern Europe.
   Methods The data of a national butterfly atlas survey (NAFI) carried out in 1991-2003 with a resolution of 10 x 10 km were used in the analyses. Generalized additive models (GAM) were constructed, for each of 98 species, to estimate the probability of occurrence as a function of climate variables. Model performance was measured using the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot. Observed differences in modelling accuracy among species were related to the species' geographical attributes using multivariate GAM.
   Results Accuracies of the climate-butterfly models varied from low to very high (AUC values 0.59-0.99), with a mean of 0.79. The modelling performance was related negatively to the latitudinal range and prevalence, and positively to the spatial autocorrelation of the species distribution. These three factors accounted for 75.2% of the variation in the modelling accuracy. Species at the margin of their range or with low prevalence were better predicted than widespread species, and species with clumped distributions better than scattered dispersed species.
   Main conclusions The results from this study indicate that species' geographical attributes highly influence the behaviour and uncertainty of species-climate models, which should be taken into account in biogeographical modelling studies and assessments of climate change impacts.

AB To probe the evolution and phylogeny of Listeria monocytogenes from defined host species and environments, L. monocytogenes isolates from human (n = 60) and animal (n = 30) listeriosis cases and food samples (n = 30) were randomly selected from a larger collection of isolates (n = 354) obtained in New York State between 1999 and 2001. Partial sequencing of four housekeeping genes (gap, prs, purM, and ribC), one stress response gene (sigB), and two virulence genes (actA and inl4) revealed between 11 (gap) and 33 (inlA) allelic types as well as 52 sequence types (unique combination of allelic types). actA, ribC, and purM demonstrated the highest levels of nucleotide diversity (pi > 0.05). actA and inL4 as well as prs and the hypervariable housekeeping genes ribC and purM showed evidence of horizontal gene transfer and recombination. actA and inL4 also showed evidence of positive selection at specific amino acid sites. Maximum likelihood phylogenies for all seven genes confirmed that L. monocytogenes contains two deeply separated evolutionary lineages. Lineage I was found to be highly clonal, while lineage II showed greater diversity and evidence of horizontal gene transfer. Allelic types were exclusive to lineages, except for a single gap allele, and nucleotide distance within lineages was much lower than that between lineages, suggesting that genetic exchange between lineages is rare. Our data show that (i) L. monocytogenes is a highly diverse species with at least two distinct phylogenetic lineages differing in their evolutionary history and population structure and (ii) horizontal gene transfer as well as positive selection contributed to the evolution of L. monocytogenes.

AB This paper stresses that the mechanism of coexistence is the key to understanding the relationship between species richness and community productivity. Using model plant communities, we explored two general kinds of mechanisms based on resource heterogeneity and recruitment limitation, with and without any trade-off between reproductive and competitive abilities. We generated different levels of species richness by changing model parameters, in particular the number of species in the regional pool, the degree of recruitment limitation, and the level of heterogeneity. Different diversity-productivity patterns are obtained with different coexistence mechanisms, indicating there is no reason to expect any general relationship between species richness and productivity. We discuss these results in the context of the within-site and across-site aspects of the relationship between species richness and productivity. Furthermore, we extend these results to hypothesize the relationship between species richness and productivity for other coexistence mechanisms not explicitly considered here.

AB Five hundred thirty life tables for 124 holometabolous, herbivorous insects were compiled from the literature and studied to uncover demographic patterns. Survival and sources of mortality of the preadult stages were correlated with their ecological setting, and several patterns emerged. Exophytic herbivores suffer a 5%-10% greater risk of preadult mortality than endophytics but are also nearly twice as large (pupal length, 11.8 mm vs. 6.4 mm; adult body length, 13.5 mm vs. 5.5 mm) and twice as fecund (206.1 vs. 99.3 eggs per female). Attack by natural enemies is the most frequent mortality source for immature herbivores (frequency = 48%). Plant factors are not nearly as frequent (9%) but have probably been underestimated in past life tables. The influence of plant factors is greatest in the early stages, and the influence of enemies is greatest in the later stages of development. Plant factors kill endophytic species more frequently than exophytic species (frequencies = 15% vs. 2%), whereas enemies kill exophytic species more frequently than endophytic species (frequencies = 51% vs. 44%). Most of the above patterns were consistent with conventional wisdom; the following were not. The frequency of competition and enemies did not vary with latitude or successional status of the habitat. Also, successional status, cultivation, and invasion status of the herbivore had no direct effects on herbivore survival. All of the patterns documented here should be viewed as guidelines for hypothesis testing with the understanding that much unexplained variation in survival exists among herbivorous insect species.

AB Microplastics and nanoplastics are emerging pollutants of global concern. However, the understanding of their ecological effects on terrestrial plants is still limited. We conducted the systematic research to reveal the impact of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) (0.01-10 mg/L) on seed germination and seedling growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The results showed that PSNPs had no discernible effect on seed germination rate whereas significantly (p < 0.01) increased root elongation by 88.6 %-122.6 % when compared with the control. Similarly, remarkable increases in carbon, nitrogen contents, and plant biomass were also observed after exposure to PSNPs. Moreover, PSNPs could reduce the shoot to root biomass ratio (S:R ratio) of wheat seedlings. Furthermore, the imagings of a 3D laser confocal scanning microscopy (LCSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that PSNPs were taken up and subsequently down-top transported to shoot. The absorption and accumulation of four micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) in wheat were generally reduced in varying degrees. Notably, metabolomics analysis revealed that all PSNPs treatments altered the leaf metabolic profiles mainly by regulating energy metabolisms and amino acid metabolisms. These findings are expected to provide new insights into the effects of PSNPs on crop plants.

AB Trait-based approaches have led to significant advances in plant ecology, but are currently biased toward above-ground traits. It is becoming clear that a stronger emphasis on belowground traits is needed to better predict future changes in plant biodiversity and their consequences for ecosystem functioning. Here I propose six 'below-ground frontiers' in traitbased plant ecology, with an emphasis on traits governing soil nutrient acquisition: redefining fine roots; quantifying root trait dimensionality; integrating mycorrhizas; broadening the suite of root traits; determining linkages between root traits and abiotic and biotic factors; and understanding ecosystem-level consequences of root traits. Focusing research efforts along these frontiers should help to fulfil the promise of trait-based ecology: enhanced predictive capacity across ecological scales.

AB Addition of pyrolyzed biomass ("biochar") to soils has commonly been shown to increase crop yields and alleviate plant stresses associated with drought and exposure to toxic materials. Here we investigate the ability of biochar (at two dosages: 5 and 50 t ha(-1)) to mitigate salt-induced stress, simulating road salt additions in a factorial glasshouse experiment involving the broadleaved herbaceous plants Abutilon theophrasti and Prunella vulgaris. Salt additions of 30 g m(-2) NaCl to unamended soils resulted in high mortality rates for both species. Biochar (Fagus grandifolia sawdust pyrolyzed at 378 degrees C), when applied at 50 t ha(-1) as a top dressing, completely alleviated salt-induced mortality in A. theophrasti and prolonged survival of P. vulgaris. Surviving A. theophrasti plants that received both 50 t ha(-1) biochar and salt addition treatments showed growth rates and physiological performance similar to plants without salt addition. Biochar treatments alone also substantially increased biomass of P. vulgaris, with a similar to 50% increase relative to untreated controls at both biochar dosages. Biochar did not significantly affect photosynthetic carbon gain (A(max)), water use efficiency, or chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) in either species. Our results indicate that biochar can ameliorate salt stress effects on plants through salt sorption, suggesting novel applications of biochar to mitigate effects of salinization in agricultural, urban, and contaminated soils.

AB Since the first investigation 25 years ago, the application of genetic tools to address ecological and evolutionary questions in elasmobranch studies has greatly expanded. Major developments in genetic theory as well as in the availability, cost effectiveness and resolution of genetic markers were instrumental for particularly rapid progress over the last 10 years. Genetic studies of elasmobranchs are of direct importance and have application to fisheries management and conservation issues such as the definition of management units and identification of species from fins. In the future, increased application of the most recent and emerging technologies will enable accelerated genetic data production and the development of new markers at reduced costs, paving the way for a paradigm shift from gene to genome-scale research, and more focus on adaptive rather than just neutral variation. Current literature is reviewed in six fields of elasmobranch molecular genetics relevant to fisheries and conservation management (species identification, phylogeography, philopatry, genetic effective population size, molecular evolutionary rate and emerging methods). Where possible, examples from the Indo-Pacific region, which has been underrepresented in previous reviews, are emphasized within a global perspective.

AB Aim Investigate the relative abilities of different bioclimatic models and data sets to project species ranges in novel environments utilizing the natural experiment in biogeography provided by Australian Acacia species.
   Location Australia, South Africa.
   Methods We built bioclimatic models for Acacia cyclops and Acacia pycnantha using two discriminatory correlative models (MAXENT and Boosted Regression Trees) and a mechanistic niche model (CLIM EX). We fitted models using two training data sets: native-range data only ('restricted') and all available global data excluding South Africa ('full'). We compared the ability of these techniques to project suitable climate for independent records of the species in South Africa. In addition, we assessed the global potential distributions of the species to projected climate change.
   Results All model projections assessed against their training data, the South African data and globally were statistically significant. In South Africa and globally, the additional information contained in the full data set generally improved model sensitivity, but at the expense of increased modelled prevalence, particularly in extrapolation areas for the correlative models. All models projected some climatically suitable areas in South Africa not currently occupied by the species. At the global scale, widespread and biologically unrealistic projections by the correlative models were explained by open-ended response curves, a problem which was not always addressed by broader background climate space or by the extra information in the full data set. In contrast, the global projections for CLIMEX were more conservative. Projections into 2070 indicated a polewards shift in climate suitability and a decrease in model interpolation area.
   Main conclusions Our results highlight the importance of carefully interpreting model projections in novel climates, particularly for correlative models. Much work is required to ensure bioclimatic models performed in a robust and ecologically plausible manner in novel climates. We explore reasons for variations between models and suggest methods and techniques for future improvements.

AB Assessing the potential future of current forest stands is a key to design conservation strategies and understanding potential future impacts to ecosystem service supplies. This is particularly true in the Mediterranean basin, where important future climatic changes are expected. Here, we assess and compare two commonly used modeling approaches (niche- and process-based models) to project the future of current stands of three forest species with contrasting distributions, using regionalized climate for continental Spain. Results highlight variability in model ability to estimate current distributions, and the inherent large uncertainty involved in making projections into the future. CO2 fertilization through projected increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations is shown to increase forest productivity in the mechanistic process-based model (despite increased drought stress) by up to three times that of the non-CO2 fertilization scenario by the period 2050-2080, which is in stark contrast to projections of reduced habitat suitability from the niche-based models by the same period. This highlights the importance of introducing aspects of plant biogeochemistry into current niche-based models for a realistic projection of future species distributions. We conclude that the future of current Mediterranean forest stands is highly uncertain and suggest that a new synergy between niche- and process-based models is urgently needed in order to improve our predictive ability.

AB Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been proposed by some as the new frontier for population studies, and several papers have presented theoretical and empirical evidence reporting the advantages and limitations of SNPs. As a practical matter, however, it remains unclear how many SNP markers will be required or what the optimal characteristics of those markers should be in order to obtain sufficient statistical power to detect different levels of population differentiation. We use a hypothetical case to illustrate the process of designing a population genetics project, and present results from simulations that address several issues for maximizing statistical power to detect differentiation while minimizing the amount of effort in developing SNPs. Results indicate that (i) while 30 SNPs should be sufficient to detect moderate (F-ST = 0.01) levels of differentiation, studies aimed at detecting demographic independence (e.g. F-ST < 0.005) may require 80 or more SNPs and large sample sizes; (ii) different SNP allele frequencies have little affect on power, and thus, selection of SNPs can be relatively unbiased; (iii) increasing the sample size has a strong effect on power, so that the number of loci can be minimized when sample number is known, and increasing sample size is almost always beneficial; and (iv) power is increased by including multiple SNPs within loci and inferring haplotypes, rather than trying to use only unlinked SNPs. This also has the practical benefit of reducing the SNP ascertainment effort, and may influence the decision of whether to seek SNPs in coding or noncoding regions.

AB Phytophthora cinnamomi continues to cause devastating disease in Australian native vegetation and consequently the disease is listed by the Federal Government as a process that is threatening Australia's biodiversity. Although several advances have been made in our understanding of how this soil-borne pathogen interacts with plants and of how we may tackle it in natural systems, our ability to control the disease is limited. The pathogen occurs widely across Australia but the severity of its impact is most evident within ecological communities of the south-west and south-east of the country. A regional impact summary for all states and territories shows the pathogen to be the cause of serious disease in numerous species, a significant number of which are rare and threatened. Manygenera of endemic taxa have a high proportion of susceptible species including the iconic genera Banksia, Epacris and Xanthorrhoea. Long-term studies in Victoria have shown limited but probably unsustainable recovery of susceptible vegetation, given current management practices. Management of the disease in conservation reserves is reliant on hygiene, the use of chemicals and restriction of access, and has had only limited effectiveness and not provided complete control. The deleterious impacts of the disease on faunal habitat are reasonably well documented and demonstrate loss of individual animal species and changes in population structure and species abundance. Few plant species are known to be resistant to P. cinnamomi; however, investigations over several years have discovered the mechanisms by which some plants are able to survive infection, including the activation of defence-related genes and signalling pathways, the reinforcement of cell walls and accumulation of toxic metabolites. Manipulation of resistance and resistance-related mechanisms may provide avenues for protection against disease in otherwise susceptible species. Despite the advances made in Phytophthora research in Australia during the past 40 years, there is still much to be done to give land managers the resources to combat this disease. Recent State and Federal initiatives offer the prospect of a growing and broader awareness of the disease and its associated impacts. However, awareness must be translated into action as time is running out for the large number of susceptible, and potentially susceptible, species within vulnerable Australian ecological communities.

AB As the process of marine-protected-area design and implementation evolves, the incorporation of new tools will advance our ability to create and maintain effective protected areas. We reviewed characteristics and approaches that contribute to successful global marine conservation efforts. One successful characteristic emphasized in most case studies is The importance of incorporating stakeholders at all phases of the process. Clearly defined goals; and objectives at all stages of the design process are important for improved communication and standardized expectations of stakeholder groups. The inclusion of available science to guide the size and design of marine protected areas and to guide clear monitoring strategies Mat assess success at scientific, social, and economic levels is also an important tool in the process. Common shortcoming's hi marine conservation planning strategies include government instability and resultant limitations to monitoring and enforcement, particularly in developing nations. Transferring knowledge to local community members has also presented challenges in areas where in situ training, local capacity, and existing infrastructure are sparse. Inaccessible, unavailable, or outdated science is often a limitation to conservation projects in developed and developing nations. To develop and maintain successful marine protected areas, it is necessary to acknowledge that each case is unique, to apply tools and lessons learned from other marine protected areas, and to maintain flexibility to adjust to the individual circumstances of the case at hand.

AB Separating the mechanisms that influence ecosystem functioning has been a goal of recent high profile experiments. Integrating the various experimental and analytical methods that attempt this goal across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, as well as careful definition of 'complementarity', produces novel insights and valuable lessons about new directions for research. (1) Experimental designs differ in temporal scale and whether standing stock or another ecosystem process was the response variable. (2) Mathematically identical variables in different designs have contrasting ecological interpretations. For example, different sets of ecological processes can contribute to different variables in different experimental designs. (3) The frequency of transgressive overyielding of standing stock (e.g. total above ground biomass) in polycultures implies little about the prevalence of transgressive overyielding in other ecosystem processes. (4) Measuring the contribution to ecosystem functioning of individual species, rather than just total ecosystem functioning of a polyculture, is not essential for estimating effects of complementarity. (5) Further research will profit from distinguishing standing stock from all other ecosystem functions. (6) None of the analytic methods can distinguish the effects of individual processes or mechanisms such as resource use differentiation, facilitation, or allelopathy, for which additional experimental treatments are required.

AB This paper focuses on how canopy structure, its physiological functioning and the environment interact to control and drive the exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor between a temperate forest stand and the atmosphere. First, we present an overview of how temporal and spatial variations in canopy structure (e.g., leaf area index, species, leaf inclination angles, leaf clumping) and physiological functioning (e.g., maximal stomatal conductance, photosynthetic capacity) modulate CO2 and water vapor fluxes. Then, with the biophysical model CANOAK, we quantify the effects of leaf dimension and thickness, vertical variations in leaf area and photosynthetic capacity, leaf clumping, leaf inclination angles, photosynthetic capacity, stomatal conductance and weather on the annual SUMS of CO2, water vapor and sensible heat exchange. Finally, we discuss how much detail is needed in a model to predict fluxes of Co-2 and water vapor with acceptable fidelity.

AB The jaguar (Panthera onca), the largest felid in the American Continent, is currently threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation and human persecution. We have investigated the genetic diversity, population structure and demographic history of jaguars across their geographical range by analysing 715 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and 29 microsatellite loci in approximate to 40 individuals sampled from Mexico to southern Brazil. Jaguars display low to moderate levels of mtDNA diversity and medium to high levels of microsatellite size variation, and show evidence of a recent demographic expansion. We estimate that extant jaguar mtDNA lineages arose 280 000-510 000 years ago (95% CI 137 000-830 000 years ago), a younger date than suggested by available fossil data. No strong geographical structure was observed, in contrast to previously proposed subspecific partitions. However, major geographical barriers such as the Amazon river and the Darien straits between northern South America and Central America appear to have restricted historical gene flow in this species, producing measurable genetic differentiation. Jaguars could be divided into four incompletely isolated phylogeographic groups, and further sampling may reveal a finer pattern of subdivision or isolation by distance on a regional level. Operational conservation units for this species can be defined on a biome or ecosystem scale, but should take into account the historical barriers to dispersal identified here. Conservation strategies for jaguars should aim to maintain high levels of gene flow over broad geographical areas, possibly through active management of disconnected populations on a regional scale.

AB In order to evaluate the patterns and processes of food web structure in grasslands, we compiled data from published studies on the relationship between precipitation (which is a predictor of primary productivity in grasslands), plant and herbivore standing crop biomass, and the results of large-herbivore exclosure experiments on plant abundance and composition. Three informative patterns emerged: (1) both producer and herbivore biomass increase across a natural precipitation gradient; (2) the relative effect of large herbivores on plant biomass, inferred from exclosure studies, decreases with increasing precipitation; and (3) the effect of herbivores on changes in plant species composition increases with precipitation. Simple resource-controlled and consumer-controlled food chain models can explain different subsets of these patterns. However, models of heterogeneous food webs that incorporate differences among species within trophic levels, and compositional turnover within such trophic levels, are consistent with all of the reviewed patterns. We suggest that this compositional turnover of plant species, combined with the interactive controlling effects of consumers and resources, may help to explain why studies performed in different areas, and with different methodologies, often draw different conclusions about the patterns and structuring processes in grassland ecosystems.

AB Current approaches to biodiversity conservation are largely based on geographic areas, ecosystems, ecological communities, and species, with less attention on genetic diversity and the evolutionary continuum from populations to species. Conservation management generally rests on discrete categories, such as identified species, and, for threated taxa, intraspecific units. Species, in particular, provide a common measure of biodiversity yet in both theory and nature, speciation is typically a protracted process progressing from connected populations to unambiguous species with variable rates of phenotypic, ecological and genetic divergence. Thus, most recognized species are not genetically uniform and are sometimes highly structured into historically isolated populations worthy of consideration as intraspecific units that represent unique genetic diversity for conservation. Genome screens offer unprecedented resolution of structure across taxonomic boundaries in species complexes, and have the potential to oversplit species if not interpreted conservatively. This highlights the blurred line between populations and species, and can confound simple dichotomies of "species" vs. "not species." At the same time, like plants, there is increasing evidence that even distantly related animal species can hybridize and exchange genes. A review of conservation legislation reveals that legal definitions of "species" are quite flexible and can accommodate a range of infra-specifictaxa and divergent populations, as well as taxonomically recognized species. For example, the legislative definition of a species around the world can include: species, subspecies, varieties, and geographically and/or genetically distinct populations. In principle, this flexibility allows for protection of genetic diversity and maintenance of evolutionary processes at a broad range of infra-specific levels. However, evolutionary biologists often fail to adequately justify and then translate their evidence for genetically defined units into categories suited to assessment under local legislation. We recommend that (i) genomic data should be interpreted conservatively when formally naming species, (ii) concomitantly, there should be stronger impetus and a more uniform approach to identifying clearly justified intraspecific units, (iii) guidelines be developed for recognizing and labeling intraspecific data that align with best scientific practice, and (iv) that the more nuanced view of species and speciation emerging from genomic analyses is communicated more effectively by scientists to decision makers.

AB Effective population size (N-e) is a key parameter in population genetics. It has important applications in evolutionary biology, conservation genetics and plant and animal breeding, because it measures the rates of genetic drift and inbreeding and affects the efficacy of systematic evolutionary forces, such as mutation, selection and migration. We review the developments in predictive equations and estimation methodologies of effective size. In the prediction part, we focus on the equations for populations with different modes of reproduction, for populations under selection for unlinked or linked loci and for the specific applications to conservation genetics. In the estimation part, we focus on methods developed for estimating the current or recent effective size from molecular marker or sequence data. We discuss some underdeveloped areas in predicting and estimating N-e for future research.

AB Aim Species distribution modelling is commonly used to guide future conservation policies in the light of potential climate change. However, arbitrary decisions during the model-building process can affect predictions and contribute to uncertainty about where suitable climate space will exist. For many species, the key climatic factors limiting distributions are unknown. This paper assesses the uncertainty generated by using different climate predictor variable sets for modelling the impacts of climate change.
   Location Europe, 10 degrees W to 50 degrees E and 30 degrees N to 60 degrees N.
   Methods Using 1453 presence pixels at 30 arcsec resolution for the great bustard (Otis tarda), predictions of future distribution were made based on two emissions scenarios, three general climate models and 26 sets of predictor variables. Twenty-six current models were created, and 156 for both 2050 and 2080. Map comparison techniques were used to compare predictions in terms of the quantity and the location of presences (map comparison kappa, MCK) and using a range change index (RCI). Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to partition explained deviance in MCK and RCI among sources of uncertainty.
   Results The 26 different variable sets achieved high values of AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and yet introduced substantial variation into maps of current distribution. Differences between maps were even greater when distributions were projected into the future. Some 64-78% of the variation between future maps was attributable to choice of predictor variable set alone. Choice of general climate model and emissions scenario contributed a maximum of 15% variation and their order of importance differed for MCK and RCI.
   Main conclusions Generalized variable sets produce an unmanageable level of uncertainty in species distribution models which cannot be ignored. The use of sound ecological theory and statistical methods to check predictor variables can reduce this uncertainty, but our knowledge of species may be too limited to make more than arbitrary choices. When all sources of modelling uncertainty are considered together, it is doubtful whether ensemble methods offer an adequate solution. Future studies should explicitly acknowledge uncertainty due to arbitrary choices in the model-building process and develop ways to convey the results to decision-makers.

AB The Mediterranean Sea is a hotspot of biodiversity, and climate warming is expected to have a significant influence on its endemic fish species. However, no previous studies have predicted whether fish species will experience geographic range extensions or contractions as a consequence of warming. Here, we projected the potential future climatic niches of 75 Mediterranean Sea endemic fish species based on a global warming scenario implemented with the Mediterranean model OPAMED8 and a multimodel inference, which included uncertainty. By 2070-2099, the average surface temperature of the Mediterranean Sea was projected to warm by 3.1 degrees C. Projections for 2041-2060 are that 25 species would qualify for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List, and six species would become extinct. By 2070-2099, 45 species were expected to qualify for the IUCN Red List whereas 14 were expected to become extinct. By the middle of the 21st century, the coldest areas of the Mediterranean Sea (Adriatic Sea and Gulf of Lion) would act as a refuge for cold-water species, but by the end of the century, those areas were projected to become a 'cul-de-sac' that would drive those species towards extinction. In addition, the range size of endemic species was projected to undergo extensive fragmentation, which is a potentially aggravating factor. Since a majority of endemic fishes are specialists, regarding substratum and diet, we may expect a reduced ability to track projected climatic niches. As a whole, 25% of the Mediterranean Sea continental shelf was predicted to experience a total modification of endemic species assemblages by the end of the 21st century. This expected turnover rate could be mitigated by marine protected areas or accelerated by fishing pressure or competition from exotic fishes. It remains a challenge to predict how these assemblage modifications might affect ecosystem function.

AB Platyrrhine primates and caviomorph rodents are clades of mammals that colonized South America during its period of isolation from the other continents, between 100 and 3 million years ago (Mya). Until now, no molecular study investigated the timing of the South American colonization by these two lineages with the same molecular data set. Using sequences from three nuclear genes (ADRA2B, vWF, and IRBP, both separate and combined) from 60 species, and eight fossil calibration constraints, we estimated the times of origin and diversification of platyrrhines and caviomorphs via a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach. To account for the possible effect of an accelerated rate of evolution of the IRBP gene along the branch leading to the anthropoids, we performed the datings with and without IRBP (3768 sites and 2469 sites, respectively). The time window for the colonization of South America by primates and by rodents is demarcated by the dates of origin (upper bound) and radiation (lower bound) of platyrrhines and caviomorphs. According to this approach, platyrrhine primates colonized South America between 37.0 +/- 3.0 Mya ( or 38.9 +/- 4.0 Mya without IRBP) and 16.8 +/- 2.3 (or 20.1 +/- 3.3) Mya, and caviomorph rodents between 45.4 +/- 4.1 (or 43.7 +/- 4.8) Mya and 36.7 +/- 3.7 (or 35.8 +/- 4.3) Mya. Considering both the fossil record and these molecular datings, the favored scenarios are a trans-Atlantic migration of primates from Africa at the end of the Eocene or beginning of the Oligocene, and a colonization of South America by rodents during the Middle or Late Eocene. Based on our nuclear DNA data, we cannot rule out the possibility of a concomitant arrival of primates and rodents in South America. The caviomorphs radiated soon after their arrival, before the Oligocene glaciations, and these early caviomorph lineages persisted until the present. By contrast, few platyrrhine fossils are known in the Oligocene, and the present-day taxa are the result of a quite recent, Early Miocene diversification.

AB Image analyses systems provide a quick determination of various root morphological parameters. Generally, a specific testing procedure should be conducted at the beginning of every measurement process. In this study, the performance of two image analyses programs using different measuring algorithms was compared: a commercial package WinRHIZO and a freeware ROOTEDGE. Roots of field grown cereal crops, wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), were used. Several types of tests were executed: 1. Comparison of image analyses and manually conducted measurements of root length; 2. Comparison between root length, average diameter and surface area measurements performed with ROOTEDGE and WinRHIZO; 3. Tests of root arrangement to assess the importance of random orientation of the scanned roots for accurate measurements; 4. Evaluation of the maximum acceptable scanning density (cm scanned root length per cm(2) scanning area). The results suggest that ROOTEDGE and WinRHIZO provide fairly correct measurements of root morphological parameters. There were small differences between manually and image analyses measurements of root length, in particular using a transparent light unit for scanning. Ratios of image analyses to manual estimations ranged from 0.95 to 1.03 for different root samples of winter barley. Comparisons of the programs generated almost equal root estimates. Discrepancies between diameter and surface area were slightly higher than between length measurements. The average root diameter was a little overestimated by ROOTEDGE compared to WinRHIZO. The most significant source for these discrepancies presumably was the difference between the fixed threshold for ROOTEDGE and the flexible threshold, automatically optimized for every single image by WinRHIZO. ROOTEDGE and WinRHIZO image analyses showed small sensitivity to root sample orientation. Estimations of root length, average diameter and surface area were well reproducible. For the scanning density to 3 em cm(-2) CV values for the replicated measurements varied between 0.3% and 3.4% by both programs. High scanning density of roots resulted in increasing underestimation of root length and overestimation of root average diameter. For the common scanning density range in root research between 1 and 3 cm cm(-2) discrepancies did not exceed 5%. Higher scanning densities than 3 cm cm(-2) are not recommended.

AB Based on the curvilinear relationship between leaf nitrogen content and the initial slope of the response of CO2 assimilation (A) to intercellular CO2 concentrations (C-i) in apple, it is hypothesized that Rubisco activation state decreases with increasing leaf N content and this decreased activation state accounts for the curvilinear relationship between leaf N and CO2 assimilation. A range of leaf N content (1.0-5.0 g m(-2)) was achieved by fertilizing bench-grafted Fuji/M.26 apple (Malus domestica Borkh,) trees for 45 d with different N concentrations, using a modified Hoagland's solution. Analysis of A/Ci curves under saturating light indicated that CO2 assimilation at ambient CO2 fell within the Rubisco limitation region of the A/C-i curves, regardless of leaf N status. Initial Rubisco activity showed a curvilinear response to leaf N, In contrast, total Rubisco activity increased linearly with increasing leaf N throughout the leaf N range. As a result, Rubisco activation state decreased with increasing leaf N. Both light-saturated CO2 assimilation at ambient CO2 and the initial slope of the A/C-i curves were linearly related to initial Rubisco activity, but curvilinearly related to total Rubisco activity. The curvatures in the relationships of both light-saturated CO2 assimilation at ambient CO2 and the initial slope of the A/C-i curves with total Rubisco activity were more pronounced than in their relationships with leaf N, This was because the ratio of total Rubisco activity to leaf N increased with increasing leaf N. As leaf N increased, photosynthetic N use efficiency declined with decreasing Rubisco activation state.

AB Current theory on the population dynamics of marine species with complex life history patterns posits that a suite of physical and biotic forces (e.g., habitat structure and density-dependent predation or emigration) control survival and abundance in early life history, particularly after settlement. We have conducted a long-term sampling effort accompanied by a series of field and laboratory experiments examining the joint effects of habitat type, body size, and population density upon abundance and survival of early juveniles of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. In addition, the chance occurrence of a tropical storm during one set of experiments provided an opportunity to assess the impact of a physical disturbance upon newly settled blue crab survival and abundance. In the 10-yr sampling effort, we quantified relationships between sequential life history stages (juvenile crab instars) in seagrass beds, the initial nursery habitat for blue crabs in the lower Chesapeake Bay. Inter-instar relationships were defined as the densities of larger instars as dependent on the densities of smaller instars. Inter-instar relationships for the youngest instars are described by hyperbolic functions until crabs begin to emigrate to unvegetated habitats at approximately the fifth instar. Inter-instar relationships between crabs larger than the fifth instar and smaller crabs become either parabolic or linear functions and decay as the number of instars between sequential life history stages increases. While both the hyperbolic and parabolic functions are indicative of populations regulated by density-dependent processes, either predation or emigration, the decay in the functions describing the inter-instar relationships for crabs larger than the fifth instar indicates that the suite of processes regulating this segment of the population changes qualitatively.
   In laboratory and field experiments, the effects of vegetated and unvegetated habitats and size-specific predation on newly settled juveniles were tested. Tethering was used to quantify relative rates of predation, and a laboratory study was conducted to determine if tethering induced treatment-specific bias. We found no statistically significant interactions between the tethering treatment and the factor treatments of crab size and habitat during the laboratory study, indicating that tethering did not produce treatment-specific bias. Thus, tethering provided a relative measure of predation that allowed comparisons between treatments of habitat and crab size on crab survival. In both laboratory and field experiments, survival was significantly higher in vegetated habitats and with increasing size until the ninth instar, when survival did not differ by habitat. This difference explains the dispersal from vegetated to unvegetated habitats that occurred between the fifth and seventh instars. In addition, survival of all crabs was significantly increased both during and after Tropical Storm Danielle compared to pre-storm conditions.
   A model is developed that describes juvenile survival as a function of crab size and habitat type. Survival curves in both habitats are represented by similar sigmoid functions with survival higher in vegetated habitats. Subsequently, the survival of newly settled blue crabs is likely dependent on the availability of complex habitat. Thus, a suite of biotic and physical processes, both density-dependent and density-independent, control the early life history after settlement for the blue crab.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play important functional roles in ecosystems, including the uptake and transfer of nutrients, modification of the physical soil environment and alteration of plant interactions with other biota. Several studies have demonstrated the potential for variation in AM fungal diversity to also affect ecosystem functioning, mainly via effects on primary productivity. Diversity in these studies is usually characterized in terms of the number of species, unique evolutionary lineages or complementary mycorrhizal traits, as well as the ability of plants to discriminate among AM fungi in space and time. However, the emergent outcomes of these relationships are usually indirect, and thus context dependent, and difficult to predict with certainty. Here, we advocate a fungal-centric view of AM fungal biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships that focuses on the direct and specific links between AM fungal fitness and consequences for their roles in ecosystems, especially highlighting functional diversity in hyphal resource economics. We conclude by arguing that an understanding of AM fungal functional diversity is fundamental to determine whether AM fungi have a role in the exploitation of marginal/novel environments (whether past, present or future) and highlight avenues for future research.

AB Vultures, which are the only obligate vertebrate scavengers, have experienced the most rapid decline in conservation status of any group of birds over the past decade and comprise the most threatened avian functional guild in the world. Of the 22 vulture species, nine are critically endangered, three are endangered, four are near threatened, and six are least concern. Meanwhile, the vast majority of avian facultative scavenger species, such as corvids and gulls, have stable or increasing populations. We analyze the causes of this stark contrast in status and evaluate what ecological factors contribute to extinction risk for all 106 avian scavenger species. A random forest model shows that diet breadth, proportion scavenged diet, geographic realm, body mass, clutch size and taxonomy are leading predictors of extinction risk. Meanwhile, dietary toxins - most notably poisons and the veterinary drug diclofenac - are by far the most important anthropogenic threat to avian scavengers, comprising the leading cause of decline for 59% of threatened avian scavenger species and 88% of threatened vulture species. Currently, 73% of vulture species are extinction-prone (near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered and extinct) and 77% have declining populations, while only 13% of avian facultative scavenger species are extinction-prone and 70% have stable or increasing populations. As vultures decline, populations of many facultative scavengers are growing, causing trophic cascades from increased predation, competition, and invasion. Furthermore, vultures' highly specialized digestive systems efficiently eradicate diseases when consuming carrion, whereas facultative scavengers are more susceptible to contract and transmit diseases among themselves and to humans. We urge immediate action, particularly by regulating lethal dietary toxins, to prevent the extinction of vultures and loss of respective ecosystem services. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent studies from mountainous areas of small spatial extent (<2500km2) suggest that fine-grained thermal variability over tens or hundreds of metres exceeds much of the climate warming expected for the coming decades. Such variability in temperature provides buffering to mitigate climate-change impacts. Is this local spatial buffering restricted to topographically complex terrains? To answer this, we here study fine-grained thermal variability across a 2500-km wide latitudinal gradient in Northern Europe encompassing a large array of topographic complexities. We first combined plant community data, Ellenberg temperature indicator values, locally measured temperatures (LmT) and globally interpolated temperatures (GiT) in a modelling framework to infer biologically relevant temperature conditions from plant assemblages within <1000-m2 units (community-inferred temperatures: CiT). We then assessed: (1) CiT range (thermal variability) within 1-km2 units; (2) the relationship between CiT range and topographically and geographically derived predictors at 1-km resolution; and (3) whether spatial turnover in CiT is greater than spatial turnover in GiT within 100-km2 units. Ellenberg temperature indicator values in combination with plant assemblages explained 4672% of variation in LmT and 9296% of variation in GiT during the growing season (June, July, August). Growing-season CiT range within 1-km2 units peaked at 6065 degrees N and increased with terrain roughness, averaging 1.97 degrees C (SD=0.84 degrees C) and 2.68 degrees C (SD=1.26 degrees C) within the flattest and roughest units respectively. Complex interactions between topography-related variables and latitude explained 35% of variation in growing-season CiT range when accounting for sampling effort and residual spatial autocorrelation. Spatial turnover in growing-season CiT within 100-km2 units was, on average, 1.8 times greater (0.32 degrees Ckm1) than spatial turnover in growing-season GiT (0.18 degrees Ckm1). We conclude that thermal variability within 1-km2 units strongly increases local spatial buffering of future climate warming across Northern Europe, even in the flattest terrains.

AB Phylogenomics refers to the inference of historical relationships among species using genome-scale sequence data and to the use of phylogenetic analysis to infer protein function in multigene families. With rapidly decreasing sequencing costs, phylogenomics is becoming synonymous with evolutionary analysis of genome-scale and taxonomically densely sampled data sets. In phylogenetic inference applications, this translates into very large data sets that yield evolutionary and functional inferences with extremely small variances and high statistical confidence (P value). However, reports of highly significant P values are increasing even for contrasting phylogenetic hypotheses depending on the evolutionary model and inference method used, making it difficult to establish true relationships. We argue that the assessment of the robustness of results to biological factors, that may systematically mislead (bias) the outcomes of statistical estimation, will be a key to avoiding incorrect phylogenomic inferences. In fact, there is a need for increased emphasis on the magnitude of differences (effect sizes) in addition to the P values of the statistical test of the null hypothesis. On the other hand, the amount of sequence data available will likely always remain inadequate for some phylogenomic applications, for example, those involving episodic positive selection at individual codon positions and in specific lineages. Again, a focus on effect size and biological relevance, rather than the P value, may be warranted. Here, we present a theoretical overview and discuss practical aspects of the interplay between effect sizes, bias, and P values as it relates to the statistical inference of evolutionary truth in phylogenomics.

AB An Integrated Risk Assessment for Climate Change (IRACC) is developed and applied to assess the vulnerability of sharks and rays on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to climate change. The IRACC merges a traditional climate change vulnerability framework with approaches from fisheries ecological risk assessments. This semi-quantitative assessment accommodates uncertainty and can be applied at different spatial and temporal scales to identify exposure factors, at-risk species and their key biological and ecological attributes, critical habitats a`nd ecological processes, and major knowledge gaps. Consequently, the IRACC can provide a foundation upon which to develop climate change response strategies. Here, we describe the assessment process, demonstrate its application to GBR shark and ray species, and explore the issues affecting their vulnerability to climate change. The assessment indicates that for the GBR, freshwater/estuarine and reef associated sharks and rays are most vulnerable to climate change, and that vulnerability is driven by case-specific interactions of multiple factors and species attributes. Changes in temperature, freshwater input and ocean circulation will have the most widespread effects on these species. Although relatively few GBR sharks and rays were assessed as highly vulnerable, their vulnerability increases when synergies with other factors are considered. This is especially true for freshwater/estuarine and coastal/inshore sharks and rays. Reducing the impacts of climate change on the GBR's sharks and rays requires a range of approaches including mitigating climate change and addressing habitat degradation and sustainability issues. Species-specific conservation actions may be required for higher risk species (e.g. the freshwater whipray, porcupine ray, speartooth shark and sawfishes) including reducing mortality, preserving coastal catchments and estuarine habitats, and addressing fisheries sustainability. The assessment identified many knowledge gaps concerning GBR habitats and processes, and highlights the need for improved understanding of the biology and ecology of the sharks and rays of the GBR.

AB Interactions between climate change and non-native invasive species may combine to increase invasion risk to native ecosystems. Changing climate creates risk as new terrain becomes climatically suitable for invasion. However, climate change may also create opportunities for ecosystem restoration on invaded lands that become climatically unsuitable for invasive species. Here, I develop a bioclimatic envelope model for cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), a non-native invasive grass in the western US, based on its invaded distribution. The bioclimatic envelope model is based on the Mahalanobis distance using the climate variables that best constrain the species' distribution. Of the precipitation and temperature variables measured, the best predictors of cheatgrass are summer, annual, and spring precipitation, followed by winter temperature. I perform a sensitivity analysis on potential cheatgrass distributions using the projections of 10 commonly used atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) for 2100. The AOGCM projections for precipitation vary considerably, increasing uncertainty in the assessment of invasion risk. Decreased precipitation, particularly in the summer, causes an expansion of suitable land area by up to 45%, elevating invasion risk in parts of Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado. Conversely, increased precipitation reduces habitat by as much as 70%, decreasing invasion risk. The strong influence of precipitation conditions on this species' distribution suggests that relying on temperature change alone to project future change in plant distributions may be inadequate. A sensitivity analysis provides a framework for identifying key climate variables that may limit invasion, and for assessing invasion risk and restoration opportunities with climate change.

AB Theory predicts the occurrence of threshold levels of habitat in landscapes, below which ecological processes change abruptly. Simulation models indicate that below critical thresholds, fragmentation of habitat influences patch occupancy by decreasing colonization rates and increasing rates of local extinction. Uncovering such putative relationships is important for understanding the demography of species and in developing sound conservation strategies. Using segmented logistic regression, we tested for thresholds in occurrence of 15 bird species as a function of the amount of suitable habitat at multiple scales (150-2000-m radii). Suitable habitat was defined quantitatively based on previously derived, spatially explicit distribution models for each species. The occurrence of 10 out of 15 species was influenced by the amount of habitat at a landscape scale (>= 500-m radius). Of these species all but one were best predicted by threshold models. Six out of nine species exhibited asymptotic thresholds; the effects of habitat loss intensified at low amounts of habitat in a landscape. Landscape thresholds ranged from 8.6% habitat to 28.7% (x = 18.5 +/- 2.6% [95% CI]). For two species landscape thresholds coincided with sensitivity to fragmentation; both species were more likely to occur in large patches, but only when the amount of habitat in a landscape was low. This supports the fragmentation threshold hypothesis. Nevertheless, the occurrence of most species appeared to be unaffected by fragmentation, regardless of the amount of habitat present at landscape extents. The thresholds we identified may be useful to managers in establishing conservation targets. Our results indicate that findings of landscape-scale studies conducted in regions with relatively high proportions of habitat and low fragmentation may not be applicable in regions with low habitat proportions and high fragmentation.

AB Responses of biota to climate change take a number of forms including distributional shifts, behavioural changes and life history changes. This study examined an extensive set of biological records to investigate changes in the timing of life history transitions (specifically emergence) in British Odonata between 1960 and 2004. The results show that there has been a significant, consistent advance in phenology in the taxon as a whole over the period of warming that is mediated by life history traits. British odonates significantly advanced the leading edge (first quartile date) of the flight period by a mean of 1.51 +/- 0.060 (SEM, n=17) days per decade or 3.08 +/- 1.16 (SEM, n=17) days per degree rise in temperature when phylogeny is controlled for. This study represents the first review of changes in odonate phenology in relation to climate change. The results suggest that the damped temperature oscillations experienced by aquatic organisms compared with terrestrial organisms are sufficient to evoke phenological responses similar to those of purely terrestrial taxa.

AB The effects of roads on the natural environment is of growing concern world-wide and foremost amongst these effects are the fatalities of wildlife killed in collisions with vehicles. Aside from animal welfare and human safety considerations, fatalities may have significant impacts on the population dynamics of species living adjacent to roads and thus can adversely affect the viability of local populations. As such, the need to quantify and mitigate road-based fatalities is paramount. With a vast expanse of roads it is imperative to identify where animals are most likely to be killed (i.e. hotspots) and what are the contributing factors. In order to identify hotspots, we develop a modelling approach for both presence and presence/absence data. We use data collected from the Snowy Mountain Highway in southern New South Wales, Australia, to compare the effectiveness of this approach for five species/groups of species. We observed that models of species killed in a clumped fashion were effective at identifying hotspots, while for species where fatalities were distributed evenly along the road the models were less effective. We recommend that where actual presence data exists spatial clustering is the preferred method of hotspot identification. Predictive models of presence/absence date should be constructed if the intention is to extrapolate to additional areas. The added benefit of predictive models are that they enable the identification of explanatory factors and this knowledge enables species-specific management strategies to be developed and implemented at hotspot locations.

AB Monitoring programs serve to track changes in the distribution and abundance of species. A major problem with most monitoring programs is that species detection is imperfect and some populations are inevitably missed. Therefore, in most monitoring programs the true distribution of a species will be underestimated. Here, we report a field test of the reliability and performance of a commonly used method to monitor the distribution of amphibians (anuran call surveys). We surveyed the distribution of four anuran species in western Switzerland, and estimated detection probabilities to account for imperfect species detection and used these estimates to adjust our estimate of site occupancy (i.e., distribution). Next, we assessed how detection probabilities were affected by weather and how site occupancy was affected by site specific covariates. For one species (Hyla arborea), call surveys proved efficient in determining the regional distribution with only few site visits because detection probabilities were relatively high. The call surveys apparently missed many populations of another common species (Bufo calamita) because detection probabilities were lower. Two other species (Bombina variegata and Alytes obstetricans) were uncommon and strong inference from the analysis is not possible. Thus, multispecies surveys may be inefficient for rare species. Estimates of detection probabilities were used to calculate how many site visits are necessary to infer the absence of a species with some predetermined statistical certainty. The implications of "false absences" are important in ecology as they are known to bias usual habitat suitability models and overestimate extinction/colonization events in metapopulations. Large-scale monitoring programs would benefit from the application of an estimation-based approach to monitoring the distribution of species. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB More than a century since Charles Darwin stated that diverse grasslands produce more herbage than monocultures, scientists still debate the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem function. Postulated benefits of diversity in experimental grasslands include greater and more stable primary production along with more efficient nutrient use. These benefits have been extrapolated to forage and grazing land systems with little supporting objective data. Most information on the potential benefits of increased plant diversity comes from studies of synthesized grasslands that have not included domestic grazing animals. We explore this debate relative to the management of temperate forage and grazing lands. Plant species diversity refers to the number of species (richness) and their relative abundance (evenness) within a defined area. Plant relations influence biodiversity responses through positive (e.g., facilitation, N-2 fixation, hydraulic lift) and negative interactions (e.g., competitive exclusion, allelopathy). Early 20th century research on complex mixtures of forage species (limited to grasses and legumes) for pasture indicated equivocal results regarding benefits of species-rich mixtures and typically recommended using the best adapted species in simple grass-legume mixtures. Recent research indicates potential herbage yield benefits from species-rich mixtures for pastures. Limited animal productivity research on species-rich mixtures indicates variable responses and much more research is needed. Grazing land productivity is a primary focus for biodiversity benefits because of the direct economic relevance to producers. However, taking a broader view of the multifunctionality of grazing lands to include environmental and aesthetic benefits to humans reveals a great scope for using biodiversity in grazing land management.

AB The geographical structure of mitochondrial (mt)DNA variants (mitotypes) was investigated in 38 western European populations of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of total DNA and a homologous coxl probe. Three major mitotypes (designated a, b and d) were detected. Within Spain all mitotypes were found, gene diversity was high, H-T = 0.586, and this diversity was distributed predominantly among rather than within populations (F-ST(M) = 0.813 for the seven Spanish populations). Mitotype d was present only in the most southerly population from the Sierra Nevada. Elsewhere in Europe, populations showed little or no mtDNA diversity within regions, but there were marked differences between regions. Italian populations were fixed for mitotype b; populations from northern France, Germany, Poland, Russia and southern Sweden were fixed for mitotype a; while populations in northern Fennoscandia were fixed for mitotype b. The isolated Scottish populations were predominantly of mitotype a, but mitotype b was present in three of the 20 populations scored. In Scotland, UK gene diversity (H-T = 0.120) and genetic differentiation among populations (F-ST(M) = 0.37) was much lower than in Spain. When interpreted in the light of complementary data from pollen analysis and nuclear genetic markers, the results suggest that present-day populations of P. sylvestris in western Europe have been derived from at least three different sources after glaciation.

AB Animals have diversified into a bewildering variety of morphological forms exploiting a complex configuration of trophic niches. Their morphological diversity is widely used as an index of ecosystem function, but the extent to which animal traits predict trophic niches and associated ecological processes is unclear. Here we use the measurements of nine key morphological traits for >99% bird species to show that avian trophic diversity is described by a trait space with four dimensions. The position of species within this space maps with 70-85% accuracy onto major niche axes, including trophic level, dietary resource type and finer-scale variation in foraging behaviour. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that these form-function associations reflect convergence towards predictable trait combinations, indicating that morphological variation is organized into a limited set of dimensions by evolutionary adaptation. Our results establish the minimum dimensionality required for avian functional traits to predict subtle variation in trophic niches and provide a global framework for exploring the origin, function and conservation of bird diversity.
   Predicting ecological niche space and ecosystem function from morphological traits is challenging. Here, the authors show that avian trophic diversity can be reduced to four dimensions, based on nine key morphological traits, which reflects convergence of trait combinations.

AB Analyses of functional traits have become fundamental tools for understanding patterns and processes in plant community ecology. In this context, regenerative seed traits play an important, yet overlooked, role because they largely determine the ability of plants to disperse and re-establish. A survey of recent publications in community ecology suggests that seed germination traits in particular are neglected at the expense of other relevant but overused traits based only on seed morphology. As a response to this bias, we discuss the functional significance of seed germination traits in comparison with morphological and biophysical seed traits, and advocate their use in vegetation science. We also demonstrate how research in community assembly, climate change and restoration ecology can benefit from the inclusion of germination traits, encompassing functions that cannot be explained solely by adult plant traits. Seed germination experiments conducted in the laboratory or field to quantify these traits provide ecologically meaningful and relatively easy-to-obtain information about the functional properties of plant communities. We argue that bridging the gap between seed physiologists and community ecologists will improve the prediction of plant assemblages, and propose further perspectives for including seed traits into the research agenda of functional community ecologists.

AB Modeling the distributions of species, especially of invasive species in non-native ranges, involves multiple challenges. Here, we developed some novel approaches to species distribution modeling aimed at reducing the influences of such challenges and improving the realism of projections. We estimated species-environment relationships for Parthenium hysterophorus L. (Asteraceae) with four modeling methods run with multiple scenarios of (i) sources of occurrences and geographically isolated background ranges for absences, (ii) approaches to drawing background (absence) points, and (iii) alternate sets of predictor variables. We further tested various quantitative metrics of model evaluation against biological insight. Model projections were very sensitive to the choice of training dataset. Model accuracy was much improved using a global dataset for model training, rather than restricting data input to the species' native range. AUC score was a poor metric for model evaluation and, if used alone, was not a useful criterion for assessing model performance. Projections away from the sampled space (i.e., into areas of potential future invasion) were very different depending on the modeling methods used, raising questions about the reliability of ensemble projections. Generalized linear models gave very unrealistic projections far away from the training region. Models that efficiently fit the dominant pattern, but exclude highly local patterns in the dataset and capture interactions as they appear in data (e.g., boosted regression trees), improved generalization of the models. Biological knowledge of the species and its distribution was important in refining choices about the best set of projections. A post hoc test conducted on a new Parthenium dataset from Nepal validated excellent predictive performance of our 'best' model. We showed that vast stretches of currently uninvaded geographic areas on multiple continents harbor highly suitable habitats for parthenium. However, discrepancies between model predictions and parthenium invasion in Australia indicate successful management for this globally significant weed.

AB Correlative species distribution models are becoming commonplace in the scientific literature and public out-reach products, displaying locations, abundance, or suitable environmental conditions for harmful invasive species, threatened and endangered species, or species of special concern. Accurate species distribution models are useful for efficient and adaptive management and conservation, research, and ecological forecasting. Yet, these models are often presented without fully examining or explaining the caveats for their proper use and interpretation and are often implemented without understanding the limitations and assumptions of the model being used. We describe common pitfalls, assumptions, and caveats of correlative species distribution models to help novice users and end users better interpret these models. Four primary caveats corresponding to different phases of the modeling process, each with supporting documentation and examples, include: (1) all sampling data are incomplete and potentially biased; (2) predictor variables must capture distribution constraints; (3) no single model works best for all species, in all areas, at all spatial scales, and over time; and (4) the results of species distribution models should be treated like a hypothesis to be tested and validated with additional sampling and modeling in an iterative process.

AB Considerable research efforts have focused on elucidating the systematic relationships among salmonid fishes; an understanding of these patterns of relatedness will inform conservation-and fisheries-related issues, as well as provide a framework for investigating evolutionary mechanisms in the group. However, uncertainties persist in current Salmonidae phylogenies due to biological and methodological factors, and a comprehensive phylogeny including most representatives of the family could provide insight into the causes of these difficulties. Here we increase taxon sampling by including nearly all described salmonid species (n = 63) to present a time-calibrated and more complete portrait of Salmonidae using a combination of molecular markers and analytical techniques. This strategy improved resolution by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and helped discriminate methodological and systematic errors from sources of difficulty associated with biological processes. Our results highlight novel aspects of salmonid evolution. First, we call into question the widely-accepted evolutionary relationships among sub-families and suggest that Thymallinae, rather than Coregoninae, is the sister group to the remainder of Salmonidae. Second, we find that some groups in Salmonidae are older than previously thought and that the mitochondrial rate of molecular divergence varies markedly among genes and clades. We estimate the age of the family to be 59.1 MY (CI: 63.2-58.1 MY) old, which likely corresponds to the timing of whole genome duplication in salmonids. The average, albeit highly variable, mitochondrial rate of molecular divergence was estimated as,0.31%/MY (CI: 0.27-0.36%/MY). Finally, we suggest that some species require taxonomic revision, including two monotypic genera, Stenodus and Salvethymus. In addition, we resolve some relationships that have been notoriously difficult to discern and present a clearer picture of the evolution of the group. Our findings represent an important contribution to the systematics of Salmonidae, and provide a useful tool for addressing questions related to fundamental and applied evolutionary issues.

AB Anthropogenic modifications to aquatic ecosystems have altered connecting pathways within, and in some cases, between watersheds. Human structures, such as hydroelectric facilities, often impede fish migrations and may inflict heavy mortality on fish that become impinged or entrained. Conversely, an increase in connectivity between two waterways (e. g., through the construction of shipping canals, increased boat traffic) often results in an elevated risk of invasive species introductions. Non-physical barriers, which obstruct fish from an undesirable location without influencing the waterway, are one management approach to protecting valuable fish stocks and deterring biological invasions. Because many methods of behavioral deterrence have been employed against fish, there is a need to summarize and compare existing and developing technologies. This review details the use and application of electrical, visual, acoustic, chemical, and hydrological deterrence techniques that may be used to prevent fish movements. Site requirements are discussed, and a critical assessment of benefits and limitations to each technique are given. Because no single method of fish deterrence is "one size fits all", this review to non-physical fish barrier technology will benefit managers and researchers attempting to develop a best-fit strategy on a case-by-case basis.

AB Based on an extensive sampling regime from both nesting populations and bycatch, frequency analyses of mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region haplotypes in the Mediterranean were used to assess the genetic structure and stock composition of the loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta, in different marine fisheries. The analyses show the following. (i) In drifting longline fisheries working in Mediterranean pelagic habitats 53-55% of turtles caught originated from the Mediterranean stock; (ii) In bottom-trawl fisheries all turtle bycatch is derived from this regional stock; (iii) This regional stock contribution to fishery bycatch suggests that the population size of the Mediterranean loggerhead nesting population is significantly larger than previously thought. This is consistent with a recent holistic estimate based on the discovery of a large rookery in Libya. (iv) Present impact of fishery-related mortality on the Mediterranean nesting population is probably incompatible with its long-term conservation. Sea turtle conservation regulations are urgently needed for the Mediterranean fisheries. (v) The significant divergence of mtDNA haplotype frequencies of the Turkish loggerhead colonies define this nesting population as a particularly important management unit. Large immature and adult stages from this management unit seem to be harvested predominantly by Egyptian fisheries. (vi) Combined with other data, our findings suggest that all the nesting populations in the Mediterranean should be considered as management units sharing immature pelagic habitats throughout the Mediterranean (and possibly the eastern Atlantic), with distinct and more localized benthic feeding habitats in the eastern basin used by large immatures and adults. (vii) Between the strict oceanic pelagic and the benthic stages, immature turtles appear to live through an intermediate neritic stage, in which they switch between pelagic and benthic foods.

AB Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) was grown in an irradiated soil:sand mixture in PVC tubes containing a root compartment, a hyphal compartment and a hyphal P-32-labelling compartment. The soil was inoculated with either Scutellospora calospora (Nicol. & Gerd.) Walker & Sanders, Glomus sp. or Glomus caledonium (Nicol. & Gerd.) Trappe & Gerdemann or left uninoculated.
   At 23 d from sowing 20 muCi of an aqueous solution of carrier-free P-32 was pipetted into the hyphal labelling compartment. Just 24 h later the plants were labelled with (CO2)-C-14 for 16 h. At harvest the plants were analysed for mycorrhizal colonization and distribution of C-14 and P-32.
   Hyphae of G. caledonium proved to have the most rapid P-32 uptake and transfer system of the three fungi studied. The host was provided with an order of magnitude more P-32 than supplied by either Glomus sp. or S. calospora. The S. calospora-colonized plants contained the least P-32 counts of the three mycorrhizal treatments. 75% of the total P-32 in the plant was present in the shoots of the plants colonized by G. caledonium; the corresponding figures for the shoots of S. calospora and Glomus sp. were 45 and 25%, respectively.
   The proportion of assimilated C-14 allocated to below-ground events was 35, 32 and 25 with S. calospora, Glomus sp. and G. caledonium, respectively. The specific incorporation of C-14 into roots colonized by Glomus sp. was 1.8 and 3.1 times as high as into roots colonized by G. caledonium and S. calospora, respectively.
   In contrast, the specific root respiration (Bq mg-1 d. wt) was similar in the mycorrhizal treatments. The C-14 flow into external hyphae was approximately 0.8% of the total assimilated C-14 for all three fungi.
   Based on these results, mycorrhizal efficiency was calculated as hyphal C-14 use per unit P-32 transported, below-ground C-14 use per unit P-32 transported, P-32 transported per metre of hyphae and hyphal C-14 use per metre of hyphae.

AB Forest ecosystem models based on heuristic water stress functions poorly predict tropical forest response to drought partly because they do not capture the diversity of hydraulic traits (including variation in tree size) observed in tropical forests. We developed a continuous porous media approach to modeling plant hydraulics in which all parameters of the constitutive equations are biologically interpretable and measurable plant hydraulic traits (e.g., turgor loss point pi(tlp), bulk elastic modulus epsilon, hydraulic capacitance C-ft, xylem hydraulic conductivity k(s,max), water potential at 50% loss of conductivity for both xylem (P-50,P-x) and stomata (P-50,P-gs), and the leaf : sapwood area ratio Lambda(l) : Lambda(s)). We embedded this plant hydraulics model within a trait forest simulator (TFS) that models light environments of individual trees and their upper boundary conditions (transpiration), as well as providing a means for parameterizing variation in hydraulic traits among individuals. We synthesized literature and existing databases to parameterize all hydraulic traits as a function of stem and leaf traits, including wood density (WD), leaf mass per area (LMA), and photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), and evaluated the coupled model (called TFS v.1-Hydro) predictions, against observed diurnal and seasonal variability in stem and leaf water potential as well as stand-scaled sap flux.
   Our hydraulic trait synthesis revealed coordination among leaf and xylem hydraulic traits and statistically significant relationships of most hydraulic traits with more easily measured plant traits. Using the most informative empirical trait-trait relationships derived from this synthesis, TFS v.1-Hydro successfully captured individual variation in leaf and stem water potential due to increasing tree size and light environment, with model representation of hydraulic architecture and plant traits exerting primary and secondary controls, respectively, on the fidelity of model predictions. The plant hydraulics model made substantial improvements to simulations of total ecosystem transpiration. Remaining uncertainties and limitations of the trait paradigm for plant hydraulics modeling are highlighted.

AB Rivers and streams that do not flow permanently (herein intermittent rivers; IRs) make up a large proportion of the world's inland waters and are gaining widespread attention. We review the research on IRs from its early focus on natural history through to current application in management and policy. The few early studies of the ecology of IRs were largely descriptive. Nevertheless, in the 1970s, synthesis of this sparse research complemented work on temporary standing waters to found a powerful framework for much of the subsequent research on IRs. Research on the ecology and biogeochemistry of IRs continues to fuel our understanding of resistance and resilience to drying and flooding as disturbances. Syntheses of the growing literature, including cross-continental and cross-climate comparisons, are revealing the generality and individuality of ecological and ecosystem responses to flow cessation and surface water loss. Meanwhile, increasing numbers of experiments test the causality of these responses. Much of the increased consideration of IRs in research, management and policy is driven by the observed and projected shifts in flow regimes from perennial to intermittent associated with changes in land and water use and climate, superimposed on the high incidence of natural intermittency. The need to protect and better manage IRs is prompting researchers to develop new or modified methods to monitor flow status and assess the ecological condition of these systems. Intermittent river research and management will benefit from greater exploration of aquatic-terrestrial linkages, wet-dry cycling and temporal dynamics, more-detailed mapping and predictive modelling of flow intermittency and the application of metapopulation and metacommunity concepts alongside multiple-stressors and novel-ecosystems research. By building on existing knowledge, continuing to develop quantitative models and distribution maps and using experiments to test hypotheses and concepts, we can further ecological understanding and wise management of these ubiquitous ecosystems.

AB The timely and effective assessment of the impacts of urban expansion on regional carbon storage is an important issue in the fields of urban ecology and sustainability science. This study used a new model to assess the impacts of urban expansion on regional carbon storage by linking the LUSD-urban and InVEST models. First, the LUSD-urban model was used to simulate urban expansion. Then, the InVEST model was adopted to assess the impacts on regional carbon storage. The linked model combines the strengths of these two models. Not only can it simulate and project the process of urban expansion but it can also assess the impacts of urban expansion on regional carbon storage. A case study in Beijing showed that the relative error between the simulated carbon storage loss and the actual loss was less than 12%. We argue that the linked model can be applied to assess the ecological effects of future urban expansion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Assisted migration (AM) is often presented as a strategy to save species that are imminently threatened by rapid climate change. This conception of AM, which has generated considerable controversy; typically proposes the movement of narrowly distributed, threatened species to suitable sites beyond their current range limits. However, existing North American forestry operations present an opportunity to practice AM on a larger scale, across millions of hectares, with a focus on moving populations of widely distributed, nonthreatened tree species within their current range limits. Despite these differences (and many others detailed herein), these two conceptions of AM have not been clearly distinguished in the literature, which has added confusion to recent dialogue and debate. Here, we aim to facilitate clearer-communication on this topic by detailing this distinction and encouraging a more nuanced view of AM.

AB Aim
   We used a landscape-scale study of birch invasion onto heather moorland to determine the consistency of changes in vegetation type and soil properties and in the community composition of five soil organism groups. Our aim was to determine whether the degree to which soil organisms respond to natural changes and/or induced changes (e.g. changes in land-use type and climate) in habitat is consistent across trophic and taxonomic groups in the context of conservation policies for birch woodland and heather moorland.
   Location
   Mainland Scotland.
   Methods
   We sampled mesostigmatid mites, oribatid mites, fungi, bacteria and archaea in adjacent patches of birch woodland (dominated by Betula pubescens) and heather moorland (dominated by Calluna vulgaris) at 12 sites for which annual rainfall ranged between 713 and 2251 mm. Differences in community composition were visualized using non-metric multidimensional scaling based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities. The factors contributing to differences between habitats within sites were explored using general linear models and those among sites using redundancy analysis.
   Results
   The communities of all groups differed between habitats within sites, but only the oribatid mites and fungi differed consistently between habitats across sites. Within sites, dissimilarity in fungal communities was positively related to the difference in C. vulgaris cover between habitats, whereas dissimilarities in bacteria and archaea were positively related to differences in soil pH and C:N ratio between habitats, respectively.
   Main conclusions
   The influence of vegetation type and soil properties differed between groups of soil organisms, albeit in a predictable manner, across the 12 sites. Organisms directly associated with plants (fungi), and organisms with microhabitat and resource preferences (Oribatida) were strongly responsive to changes in habitat type. The response of organisms not directly associated with plants (bacteria, archaea) depended on differences in soil properties, while organisms with less clear microhabitat and resource preferences (Mesostigmata) were not strongly responsive to either vegetation type or soil properties. These results show that it is possible to predict the impact of habitat change on specific soil organisms depending on their ecology. Moreover, the community composition of all groups was related to variation in precipitation within the study area, which shows that external factors, such as those caused by climate change, can have a direct effect on belowground communities.

AB Aim
   To examine the impacts of climate change on endemic birds, which are of global significance for conservation, on a continent with few such assessments. We specifically assess projected range changes in relation to the Important Bird Areas (IBAs) network and assess the possible consequences for conservation.
   Location
   South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland.
   Methods
   The newly emerging ensemble modelling approach is used with 50 species, four climate change models for the period 2070-2100 and eight bioclimatic niche models in the statistical package biomod. Model evaluation is done using the receiver operating characteristic and the recently introduced true skill statistic. Future projections are made considering two extreme assumptions: species have full dispersal ability and species have no dispersal ability. A consensus forecast is identified using principal components analysis. This forecast is interpreted in terms of the IBA network. An irreplaceability analysis is used to highlight priority IBAs for conservation attention in terms of climate change.
   Results
   The majority of species (62%) are predicted to lose climatically suitable space. Five species lose at least 85% of their climatically suitable space. Many IBAs lose species (41%; 47 IBAs) and show high rates of species turnover of more than 50% (77%; 95 IBAs). Highly irreplaceable regions for endemic species become highly localized under climate change, meaning that the endemic species analysed here experience similar range contractions to maintain climate niches.
   Main conclusions
   The South African IBAs network is likely to become less effective for conserving endemic birds under climate change. The irreplaceability analysis identified key refugia for endemic species under climate change, but many of these areas are not currently IBAs. In addition, many of these high-priority areas that are IBAs fall outside the current formal protected areas network.

AB Benthic soft-sediment organisms generally show strong relationships with the grain-size characteristics of the sediments they inhabit. These relationships, when characterised from field data, tend to be asymmetrical, non-linear and heteroscedastic, due to the existence of multiple other potentially important and interacting factors, some of which are inevitably unmeasured. For multivariate data, canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) can be used to isolate particular gradients of interest, despite the presence of other potentially important factors. For univariate abundance data, models focusing on upper quantiles of species' distributions can ameliorate the problem of heterogeneity induced by other variables. Here, a multivariate model of the relationship between benthic inter-tidal estuarine soft-sediment assemblages (sampled over a period of 3 years from 70 sites across the Auckland region) and the percentage of mud in the sediments was generated using CAP. To characterise changes in assemblage structure, quantile regression splines (of the 0.95 quantile) were used to model each of the twenty most abundant individual taxa along the gradient in percentage mud. This approach provided an effective instrumental quantitative predictive model of species' turnover, while allowing for the asymmetric, non-linear animal-sediment relationships and heterogeneous scatter observed in species' abundances along the mud gradient.

AB In this study, the effects of exogenous mercury (HgCl2) on time-dependent changes in the activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase and ascorbate peroxidase), lipid peroxidation, chlorophyll content and protein oxidation in cucumber seedlings (Cucumis sativus L.) were investigated. Cucumber seedlings were exposed to from 0 to 500 AM of HgCl2 during 10 and 15 days. Hg was readily absorbed by growing seedlings, and its content was greater in the roots than the in shoot. Time and concentration-dependent reduction in root and shoot length was observed at all concentrations tested, equally in the roots and shoot, at both 10 and 15 days. At 50 AM HgCl2, root fresh weight of 15-day-old seedlings increased, and at other concentrations, it reduced. For 10-day-old seedlings, reduction in root and shoot fresh biomass was observed. At 15 days, only at 50 AM HgCl2 was there no observed reduction in shoot fresh biomass. Dry weight of roots increased at 500 AM both at 10 and 15 days, though at 250 AM HgCl2 there was only an increase at 15 days. There was a significant effect on shoot dry weight at all concentrations tested. Hg-treated seedlings showed elevated levels of lipid peroxides with a concomitant increase in protein oxidation levels, and decreased chlorophyll content when exposed to between 250 and 500 AM of HgCl2. At 10 days, catalase activity increased in seedlings at a moderately toxic level of Hg, whereas at the higher concentration (500 AM), there was a marked inhibition. Taken together, our results suggest that Hg induces oxidative stress in cucumber, resulting in plant injury. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While several recent studies have described changes in microbial communities associated with exotic plant invasion, how arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities respond to exotic plant invasion is not well known, despite the salient role of this group in plant interactions. Here, we use molecular methods (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses based on the large subunit of the rRNA gene) to examine AMF community structure in sites dominated by the invasive mycorrhizal forb, Centaurea maculosa Lam. (spotted knapweed), and in adjacent native grassland sites. Our results indicate that significant AMF community alteration occurs following C maculosa invasion. Moreover, a significant reduction in the number of restriction fragment sizes was found for samples collected in C maculosa-dominated areas, suggesting reduced AMF diversity. Extraradical hyphal lengths exhibited a significant, on average 24%. reduction in C maculosa-versus native grass-dominated sites. As both AMF community composition and abundance were altered by C maculosa invasion, these data are strongly suggestive of potential impacts on AMF-mediated ecosystem processes. Given that the composition of AMF communities has the potential to differentially influence different plant species, our results may have important implications for site restoration after weed invasion.

AB Functional diversity has been identified as a key to understanding ecosystem and community functioning. However, due to the lack of a sound definition its nature and measurement are still poorly understood. In the same way that species diversity can be split into species richness and species evenness, so functional diversity can be split into functional richness (i.e. the amount of functional trait/character/attribute space filled) and functional evenness (i.e. the evenness of abundance distribution in functional trait space). We propose a functional regularity index (FRO) as a measure of functional evenness for situations where species are represented only by a single functional trait value (e.g. mean, median or mode), and species abundances are known. This new index is based on the Bulla O index of species evenness. When dealing with functional types or categorical functional traits, the Bulla O or any other accepted species evenness index may be used directly to measure functional evenness. The advantage of FRO is that it supplies a measure of functional evenness for continuous trait data. The FRO index presented in this paper fulfils all the a priori criteria required. We demonstrate with two example datasets that a range of FRO values may be obtained for both plant and animal communities. Moreover, FRO was strongly related to ecosystem function as seen in photosynthetic biomass in plant communities, and was able to differentiate sampling stations in a lagoon based on the functional traits of fish. Thus, the FRO index is potentially a highly useful tool for measuring functional diversity in a variety of ecological situations.

   FIELD; PROLIFERATION; MINIRHIZOTRON; RECOVERY; ABILITY; CEREALS
AB Catch crops can reduce NO3 losses from leaching, but little is known about the importance of deep rooting for the efficiency of NO3 depletion. In a field experiment, we investigated the N uptake and root growth of three types of catch crops using minirhizotrons (glass tubes of 70-mm o.d.) reaching 2.4 m. Our purpose was to evaluate minirhizotron methodology and the importance of deep rooting in the ability of catch crops to take up NO3 from deep soil layers. Nitrogen uptake was studied over a 6-d period at the end of October by injection of (NO3)-N-15 at four depths in the ranges: 0.4 to 1, 0.5 to 1.4, and 1 to 2.5 m under Italian ryegrass (Lolium multifloram Lam.), winter rye (Secale cereale L.), and fodder radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiformis Pers.), respectively. The root depth of the three species were 0.6, 1.1, and more than 2.4 m, respectively. No (IN)-I-15 was taken up from placements below root depth, and linear relationships were found between root density and (IN)-I-15 uptake from different depths. Residual soil NO3 of 18, 59, and 87 kg N ha(-1) was left under fodder radish, winter rye, and ryegrass, respectively. The measurements obtained with the minirhizotron method were highly relevant for evaluating N uptake from different soil layers, and root depths of the catch crops were important for N depletion. Knowledge about root growth and N uptake in deep soil layers may he utilized when designing crop rotations with improved N use efficiency. Where N has been left by a preceding crop and leached to deeper soil layers, it may be recycled by deep-rooted catch crops.

AB Ostariophysi is the second largest superorder within Teleostei. It contains five orders: Gonorynchiformes, Cypriniformes, Characiformes, Siluriformes, and Gymnotiformes. Resolving the higher-level relationships among ostariophysan and related fishes will aid in resolving basal teleostean divergence and provide basis to historical biogeographic analysis of major freshwater fish groups. In this study, we report the complete mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequences for eleven ostariophysan fishes and the results of phylogenetic analyses including these species plus four other ostariophysan and nine nonostariophysan teleostean fishes. Maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses reconfirmed clupeiforms as the closest relatives of ostariophysans. However, gonorynchiforms were closer to clupeiforms than to otophysans (ostariophysan groups excluding gonorynchiforms), thus raising a question over the current definition of Ostariophysi. The lack of clarity in otocephalan (ostariophysans, + clupeiforms) basal relationships implies that such divergence took place over a short period of time. The monophyly of cypriniforms, characiphysans (characiforms, siluriforms, and gymnotiforms), and orders or superorders outside the ostariophysans examined here were conceivably reconstructed. The phylogenetic hypothesis suggests a Pangean origin of otophysans. Within characiphysans, gymnotiforms and siluriforms have independent evolutionary origins and evolutionary histories comparable to or older than that of characiforms. This helps to explain the present geographic distribution of characiphysans.

AB In Northern Europe and Canada, the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer), seriously affects the marine phase of salmon production. Although the problem is long-standing, the development of sustainable methods of pest management has been unable to keep pace with the intensification of production, leading to large-scale reliance on very few chemotherapeutants. This runs the risk of selecting for genetically determined resistance in target organisms. There are many examples of similar evolutionary adaptations in arthropod pests of arable crops, livestock and human health. Several hundred pest species are now documented as being resistant to one or more chemical classes of insecticides and acaricides. Many of these compounds are identical or closely related to ones currently employed against salmon lice. It is, therefore, opportune to consider what lessons have been learnt from contending with resistance in terrestrial organisms, the implications for sustainable use of chemotherapeutants in aquaculture, and the potential for developing effective resistance management strategies. An EU-funded project named SEARCH (QLK2-CT-2000-00809) has been initiated to explore in more detail the diagnosis, incidence, dynamics and management of resistance to chemotherapeutants in L salmonis.

AB In a 2-year field study conducted on a high fertilized Gleyic Luvisol in Stuttgart-Hohenheim significant differences among 10 maize cultivars were observed in soil nitrate depletion. The different capability of the cultivars to utilize nitrate particularly from the subsoil was positively correlated with (a) shoot N uptake at maturity, and (b) root length density (L(V)) in the subsoil layers at silking. ''Critical root length densities'' for nitrate uptake were estimated by (a) calculating uptake rates per unit root length (U), (b) subsequent calculation of needed nitrate concentration in soil solution (($) over bar C-1) to sustain calculated U according to the Baldwin formula, and (c) reducing measured L(V) and proportionate increase of U until needed concentration equaled measured concentration. Uptake rate generally increased with soil depth. ''Critical root length densities'' for cultivar Brummi (high measured root length densities and soil nitrate depletion) at 60-90 cm depth ranged from 7 % (generative growth) to 28 % (vegetative growth) of measured L(V) Measured root length density of each other cultivar was higher than ''critical root length density'' for Brummi indicating that the root system of each cultivar examined would have been able to ensure N uptake of Brummi. Positive relationships between root length density and nitrate utilization as indicated by correlation analysis therefore could not be explained by model calculations. This might be due to simplifying assumptions made in the model, which are in contrast to non-ideal uptake conditions in the field, namely irregular distribution of roots and nitrate in the soil, limited root/soil contact, and differences between root zones in uptake activity. It is concluded from the field experiment that growing of cultivars selected for high N uptake-capacity of the shoots combined with ''high'' root length densities in the subsoil may improve the utilization of a high soil nitrate supply.

AB To test the ability of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) hyphae to take up water, phosphorus, and potassium, mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal couchgrass (Agropyron repens) or white clover (Trifolium repens) plants were grown in pots with separated compartments for roots and hyphae growth. Soil solution transfer between compartments was blocked by a 2-mm air gap. Total shoot contents of phosphate and nitrogen, but not of potassium, were higher in mycorrhizal plants with access to the hyphal compartment. Hyphal uptake from the outer compartment accounted for 49 % of the total phosphate and 35 % of the total nitrogen taken up by mycorrhizal plants. This was associated with depletion of extractable phosphate, NH4+-nitrogen, and also NO3--nitrogen in the soil of the hyphal compartments. In contrast, no difference in water loss from the hyphal compartments was measured by tensiometers under well-watered and water-stress conditions whether hyphae were present or not. Severance of the external hyphae did not affect water loss from the outer compartments. The results show the ability of VAM hyphae to transport considerable quantities of phosphate and nitrogen to the plant from soil zones several centimetres from the root. However, there was no evidence for a significant direct water transport by VAM hyphae to plants.

AB Plant-soil feedback (PSF), plant trait and functional group concepts advanced our understanding of plant community dynamics, but how they are interlinked is poorly known. To test how plant functional groups (FGs: graminoids, small herbs, tall herbs, legumes) and plant traits relate to PSF, we grew 48 grassland species in sterilized soil, sterilized soil with own species soil inoculum and sterilized soil with soil inoculum from all species, and quantified relative growth rate (RGR), specific leaf area (SLA), specific root length (SRL) and per cent arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization (%AMF). Plant growth response to the plant species' own soil biota relative to sterilized soil (PSFsterilized) reflects net effects of all (generalist+specialized) soil biota. Growth response to the plant species' own soil biota relative to soil biota of all plant species (PSFaway) reveals effects of more specialized soil organisms. PSFsterilized showed that graminoids and small herbs have a negative and tall herbs a positive response to their own soil biota, whereas legumes responded neutrally. However, PSFaway showed that on average, all plant FGs benefitted from growing with other species' soil biota, suggesting that pathogens are more specialized than plant growth-promoting soil biota. Feedback to plant growth from all soil biota (PSFsterilized) was stronger than from more specialized soil biota (PSFaway) and could be predicted by SRL and especially by %AMF colonization. Species with high SRL and low %AMF colonization when grown in away soil experienced most negative soil feedback.Synthesis. Plant species from all plant FGs grow better in soil from other species because of less net negative effects of soil biota (in graminoids), or because of more net positive soil biota effects (in tall herbs). Explorative plant species (high SRL, low %AMF colonization) suffer most from negative feedback of all soil biota, whereas more resource conservative species (low SRL, high %AMF colonization) benefit from soil feedback of all soil biota. These findings help to understand replacement of explorative species during succession. Moreover, we suggest a potentially larger role for species with positive feedback than for species with negative feedback to contribute to maintain plant community productivity of diverse communities over time.

AB Plant species diversity increases as soil phosphorus availability declines during long-term ecosystem development(1,2). The increase in plant species diversity is associated with a decline in above-ground functional diversity, because leaf traits converge on a high phosphorus-use efficiency strategy on old and infertile soils(3,4). In contrast, the response of below-ground traits that directly influence nutrient acquisition remains poorly understood(3,5); yet it might be key to understanding how soil fertility drives patterns of plant species diversity(1). Here we show a marked increase in the richness and diversity of plant nutrient-acquisition strategies with declining soil phosphorus availability during long-term ecosystem development in a global biodiversity hotspot. Almost all nutrient-acquisition strategies currently known were found in plants from the most infertile soils, despite these being some of the most phosphorus-impoverished soils on Earth. Mycorrhizal plants declined in relative abundance by >30%, although the decline was compensated by an increase in non-mycorrhizal, carboxylate-exuding species that 'mine' phosphorus from the soil using different strategies. Plant species richness within individual nutrient-acquisition strategies also increased dramatically, with the species richness of many strategies more than doubling between the youngest and oldest soils. These results reveal increasing functional diversity of below-ground traits related to nutrient acquisition during ecosystem development, suggesting that no single combination of traits, including those related to nutrient-acquisition strategies, is superior to all others at extremely low soil fertility. Furthermore, the increasing diversity of nutrient-acquisition strategies with declining soil fertility, despite functional convergence of above-ground traits(4,6), suggests that fundamentally different plant community assembly processes operate above-and below-ground.

AB Predicting species geographic distributions in the future is an important yet exceptionally challenging endeavor. Overall, it requires a two-step process: (1) a niche model characterizing suitability, applied to projections of future conditions and linked to (2) a dispersal/demographic simulation estimating the species' future occupied distribution. Despite limitations, for the vast majority of species, correlative approaches are the most feasible avenue for building niche models. In addition to myriad technical issues regarding model building, researchers should follow critical principles for selecting predictor variables and occurrence data, demonstrating effective performance in prediction across space, and extrapolating into nonanalog conditions. Many of these principles relate directly to the niche space, dispersal/demographic noise, biotic noise, and human noise assumptions defined here. Issues requiring progress include modeling interactions between abiotic variables, integrating biotic variables, considering genetic heterogeneity, and quantifying uncertainty. Once built, the niche model identifying currently suitable conditions must be processed to approximate the areas that the species occupies. That estimate serves as a seed for the simulation of persistence, dispersal, and establishment in future suitable areas. The dispersal/demographic simulation also requires data regarding the species' dispersal ability and demography, scenarios for future land use, and the capability of considering multiple interacting species simultaneously.

AB Colonisation of plant roots by some arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is reduced in the presence of sodium chloride (NaCl), probably due to a direct effect of NaCl on the fungi. However, there appear to be differences between the fungi in their ability to colonise plants in the presence of NaCl. This experiment tested the hypothesis that propagules of different isolates and species of AM fungi from saline and nonsaline soils would differ in their ability to germinate and grow in the presence of NaCl in the soil solution. Spores or pieces of root colonised by a range of AM fungi were incubated between filters buried in soil to which NaCl had been added at concentrations of 0, 150 or 300 mM in the soil solution. At regular intervals, filters were removed from the soil and both the percentage of propagules which had germinated and the length of proliferating hyphae were determined. Germination of spores of AM fungi studied was delayed in the presence of NaCl, but the fungi differed in the extent to which germination was inhibited. Two isolates of Scutellospora calospora reached maximum germination in 300 mM NaCl, but neither of two isolates of Acaulospora laevis germinated in the presence of NaCl. Germination of spores of the other fungi, including some isolated from saline soil, fell between these extremes. For some fungi, the specific rate of hyphal extension was reduced by NaCl. For others, the specific rate of growth was similar in the presence of NaCl to that in the control treatment, but overall production of hyphae was reduced in the NaCl treatments because germination was reduced.

AB We examined the population dynamics of two Antarctic seabirds and the influence of environmental variability over a 40-year period by coupling the estimation of demographic parameters, based on capture-recapture data, and modeling, using Leslie matrix population models. We demonstrated that the demographic parameters showing the greatest contribution to the variance of population growth rate were adult survival for both species. Breeding success showed the same contribution as adult survival for Emperor Penguins, whereas the proportion of breeders had the next stronger contribution for Snow Petrels.
   The sensitivity of population growth rate to adult survival was very high and the adult survival variability was weak for both species. Snow Petrel males survived better than females, whereas Emperor Penguin males had lower survival than females. These differences may be explained by the different investment in breeding. Emperor Penguin adult survival was negatively affected by air temperature during summer and winter for both sexes; male survival was negatively affected by sea ice concentration during summer, autumn, and winter. On the other hand, there was no effect of environmental covariates on Snow Petrel adult survival. The Emperor Penguin population has declined by 50% because of a decrease in adult survival related to a warming event during a regime shift in the late 1970s, whereas Snow Petrels showed their lowest numbers in 1976, but were able to skip reproduction.
   Indeed, the retrospective analysis of projection population matrix entries indicated that breeding abstention played a critical role in the population dynamics of Snow Petrels but not Emperor Penguins. Snow Petrels did not breed either when air temperature decreased during spring (probably reducing nest attendance and laying) or when sea ice decreased during autumn (reducing food availability).
   Emperor Penguin and Snow Petrel breeding population sizes were positively influenced by sea ice through its effect on adult survival for Emperor Penguins and on the proportion of breeders for Snow Petrels. Therefore, we hypothesize that the population sizes of the two species could be negatively affected by reduced sea ice in the context of global warming.

AB Aim To explore the respective power of climate and topography to predict the distribution of reptiles in Switzerland, hence at a mesoscale level. A more detailed knowledge of these relationships, in combination with maps of the potential distribution derived from the models, is a valuable contribution to the design of conservation strategies.
   Location All of Switzerland.
   Methods Generalized linear models are used to derive predictive habitat distribution models from eco-geographical predictors in a geographical information system, using species data from a field survey conducted between 1980 and 1999.
   Results The maximum amount of deviance explained by climatic models is 65%, and 50% by topographical models. Low values were obtained with both sets of predictors for three species that are widely distributed in all parts of the country (Anguis fragilis , Coronella austriaca , and Natrix natrix), a result that suggests that including other important predictors, such as resources, should improve the models in further studies. With respect to topographical predictors, low values were also obtained for two species where we anticipated a strong response to aspect and slope, Podarcis muralis and Vipera aspis .
   Main conclusions Overall, both models and maps derived from climatic predictors more closely match the actual reptile distributions than those based on topography. These results suggest that the distributional limits of reptile species with a restricted range in Switzerland are largely set by climatic, predominantly temperature-related, factors.

AB Coral reefs have been used by humans as recreation areas and as a source of food and other products for thousands of years. The effects of humans on coral reefs are not well understood, especially on a regional or global scale, A special survey protocol called "Reef Check" was designed to be used by volunteer recreational divers, trained and led by marine scientists, and based on the use of high value, easily identified indicator organisms. During a period of 2.5 months, a global survey of over 300 reefs in 31 countries and territories indicates that few reefs remain unaffected by man, even very remote sites, Overfishing has reduced fish and invertebrate indicator organisms to low levels at most reefs, including those within marine protected areas. The ratio of live to dead coral cover was higher in the Red Sea than in other regions, indicating that reef corals are in the best condition there. In future years, by increasing the number of reefs and the frequency of surveys, the Reef Check program could provide a valuable method to detect broad-brush changes on a local, regional and global scale, as well as increasing public support for coral reef conservation.

AB Body size is often assumed to represent the outcome of conflicting selection pressures of natural and sexual selection. Marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) populations in the Galapagos exhibit 10-fold differences in body mass between island populations. There is also strong sexual size dimorphism, with males being about twice as heavy as females. To understand the evolutionary processes shaping body size in marine iguanas, we analyzed the selection differentials on body size in two island populations (max. male mass 900 g in Genovesa, 3500 g in Santa Fe). Factors that usually confound any evolutionary analysis of body sizes-predation, interspecific food competition, reproductive role division-are ruled out for marine iguanas. We show that, above hatchlings, mortality rates increased with body size in both sexes to the same extent. This effect was independent of individual age. The largest animals (males) of each island were the first to die once environmental conditions deteriorated (e.g., during El Ninos). This sex-biased mortality was the result of sexual size dimorphism, but at the same time caused sexual size dimorphism to fluctuate. Mortality differed between seasons (selection differentials as low as -1.4) and acted on different absolute body sizes between islands. Both males and females did not cease growth when an optimal body size for survival was reached, as demonstrated by the fact that individual adult body size phenotypically increased in each population under favorable environmental conditions beyond naturally selected limits. But why did marine iguanas grow ''too large'' for survival Due to lek mating, sexual selection constantly favored large body size in males (selection differentials up to +0.77). Females only need to reach a body size sufficient to produce surviving offspring. Thereafter, large body size of females was less favored by fertility selection than large size in males. Resulting from these different selection pressures on male and female size, sexual size dimorphism was mechanistically caused by the fact that females matured at an earlier age and size than males, whereafter they constantly allocated resources into eggs, which slowed growth. The observed allometric increase in sexual size dimorphism is explained by the fact that the difference between these selective processes becomes larger as energy abundance in the environment increases. Because body size is generally highly heritable, these selective processes are expected to lead to genetic differences in body size between islands. We propose a common-garden experiment to determine the influence of genetic factors and phenotypic reaction norms of final body size.

AB 1. Chenopodium album (a sun species) and Alocasia macrorrhiza (a shade species) plants were grown under various photon flux densities (PFDs) to investigate whether nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components was optimized under any light conditions. The amounts of several photosynthetic components of the leaves were determined to examine nitrogen partitioning.
   2. For the same PFD, nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components was similar in both species, except for leaves of C. album grown at 5% PFD, which showed a markedly smaller fraction of nitrogen in photosystem I.
   3. Optimal nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components was estimated for various PFDs using a simulation model of leaf photosynthesis. At any PFD, the actual nitrogen partitioning was very similar to the estimated optimal partitioning. However, partitioning in C. album grown at 5% PFD deviated from the optimum.
   4. For both species grown under any light conditions, estimated daily photosynthesis of actual leaves was very close to that of leaves with optimal partitioning. It is concluded that both species achieve nitrogen partitioning leading to nearly maximum carbon gain under any light condition.

ID EXTINCTION
AB The Anthropocene is witnessing a loss of biodiversity, with well-documented declines in the diversity of ecosystems and species. For intraspecific genetic diversity, however, we lack even basic knowledge on its global distribution. We georeferenced 92,801 mitochondrial sequences for >4500 species of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and found that genetic diversity is 27% higher in the tropics than in nontropical regions. Overall, habitats that are more affected by humans hold less genetic diversity than wilder regions, although results for mammals are sensitive to choice of genetic locus. Our study associates geographic coordinates with publicly available genetic sequences at a massive scale, yielding an opportunity to investigate both the drivers of this component of biodiversity and the genetic consequences of the anthropogenic modification of nature.

AB Hyperdiverse forests occur in the lowland tropics, whereas the most species-rich shrublands are found in regions such as south-western Australia (kwongan) and South Africa (fynbos). Despite large differences, these ecosystems share an important characteristic: their soils are strongly weathered and phosphorus (P) is a key growth-limiting nutrient. Soil-borne pathogens are increasingly being recognized as drivers of plant diversity in lowland tropical rainforests, but have received little attention in species-rich shrublands. We suggest a trade-off in which the species most proficient at acquiring P have ephemeral roots that are particularly susceptible to soil-borne pathogens. This could equalize out the differences in competitive ability among co-occurring species in these ecosystems, thus contributing to coexistence. Moreover, effective protection against soil-borne pathogens by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi might explain the occurrence of monodominant stands of ECM trees and shrubs amongst otherwise species-rich communities. We identify gaps in our knowledge which need to be filled in order to evaluate a possible link between P limitation, fine root traits, soil-borne pathogens and local plant species diversity. Such a link may help to explain how numerous plant species can coexist in hyperdiverse rainforests and shrublands, and, conversely, how monodominant stands can develop in these ecosystems.

AB 1. Although fine roots (< 2 mm in diameter) account for a major share of the production of terrestrial ecosystems, diversity effects on fine root productivity and their mechanisms remain unclear.
   2. We hypothesized that: (i) fine root productivity increases with tree species diversity, (ii) higher fine root productivity is a result of greater soil volume filling due to species-specific patterns of root placement and proliferation, and (iii) differences in fine root productivity and soil volume filling associated with tree species diversity are more pronounced in summer when plants are physiologically active and demand for water and nutrients is at its greatest.
   3. We investigated the effects of tree species diversity on fine root productivity and soil volume filling of boreal forest stands that have grown naturally for 85 years on similar sites.
   4. Annual fine root production was 19-83% higher in evenly mixed-than single-species-dominated stands, and increased with tree species evenness, but not tree species richness. Fine root biomass was higher in evenly mixed-than single-species-dominated stands in summer months, but not in spring or fall. Higher fine root productivity in evenly mixed-than single-species-dominated stands was realized by filling more soil volume horizontally and vertically in the forest floor in the mixtures of deep-and shallow-rooted species vs. the deeper mineral soil in the mixtures of deep-rooted species.
   5. Synthesis. Our results provide some of the first direct evidence for below-ground species complementarity in heterogeneous natural forests, by demonstrating that tree species evenness increases fine root productivity by filling/exploiting the soil environment more completely in space and time, driven by differences in the inherent rooting traits of the component species and variations of root growth within species.

AB Many non-native plants in the US have become problematic invaders of native and managed ecosystems, but a new generation of invasive species may be at our doorstep. Here, we review trends in the horticultural trade and invasion patterns of previously introduced species and show that novel species introductions from emerging horticultural trade partners are likely to rapidly increase invasion risk. At the same time, climate change and water restrictions are increasing demand for new types of species adapted to warm and dry environments. This confluence of forces could expose the US to a range of new invasive species, including many from tropical and semiarid Africa as well as the Middle East. Risk assessment strategies have proven successful elsewhere at identifying and preventing invasions, although some modifications are needed to address emerging threats. Now is the time to implement horticulture import screening measures to prevent this new wave of plant invasions.

AB Soils are extremely rich in biodiversity, and soil organisms play pivotal roles in supporting terrestrial life, but the role that individual plants and plant communities play in influencing the diversity and functioning of soil food webs remains highly debated. Plants, as primary producers and providers of resources to the soil food web, are of vital importance for the composition, structure, and functioning of soil communities. However, whether natural soil food webs that are completely open to immigration and emigration differ underneath individual plants remains unknown. In a biodiversity restoration experiment we first compared the soil nematode communities of 228 individual plants belonging to eight herbaceous species. We included grass, leguminous, and non-leguminous species. Each individual plant grew intermingled with other species, but all plant species had a different nematode community. Moreover, nematode communities were more similar when plant individuals were growing in the same as compared to different plant communities, and these effects were most apparent for the groups of bacterivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous nematodes. Subsequently, we analyzed the composition, structure, and functioning of the complete soil food webs of 58 individual plants, belonging to two of the plant species, Lotus corniculatus (Fabaceae) and Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae). We isolated and identified more than 150 taxa/groups of soil organisms. The soil community composition and structure of the entire food webs were influenced both by the species identity of the plant individual and the surrounding plant community. Unexpectedly, plant identity had the strongest effects on decomposing soil organisms, widely believed to be generalist feeders. In contrast, quantitative food web modeling showed that the composition of the plant community influenced nitrogen mineralization under individual plants, but that plant species identity did not affect nitrogen or carbon mineralization or food web stability. Hence, the composition and structure of entire soil food webs vary at the scale of individual plants and are strongly influenced by the species identity of the plant. However, the ecosystem functions these food webs provide are determined by the identity of the entire plant community.

AB Ecological niche modeling (ENM) has become an important tool in conservation biology. Despite its recent success, several basic issues related to algorithm performance are still being debated. We assess the ability of two of the most popular algorithms, GARP and Maxent, to predict distributions when sampling is geographically biased. We use an extensive data set collected in the Brazilian Cerrado, a biodiversity hotspot in South America. We found that both algorithms give richness predictions that are very similar to other traditionally used richness estimators. Also, both algorithms correctly predicted the presence of most species collected during fieldwork, and failed to predict species collected only in very few cases (usually species with very few known localities, i.e., < 5). We also found that Maxent tends to be more sensitive to sampling bias than GARP. However, Maxent performs better when sampling is poor (e.g., low number of data points). Our results indicates that ENM, even when provided with limited and geographically biased localities, is a very useful technique to estimate richness and composition of unsampled areas. We conclude that data generated by ENM maximize the utility of existing biodiversity data, providing a very useful first evaluation. However, for reliable conservation decisions ENM data must be followed by well-designed field inventories, especially for the detection of restricted range, rare species.

AB Degradation of soil properties following deforestation and long-term soil cultivation may lead to decreases in soil microbial diversity and functional stability. In this study, we investigated the differences in the stability (resistance and resilience) of microbial community composition and enzyme activities in adjacent soils under either native tropical forest (FST) or in agricultural cropping use for 14 years (AGR). Mineral soil samples (0 to 5 cm) from both areas were incubated at 40A degrees C, 50A degrees C, 60A degrees C, or 70A degrees C for 15 min in order to successively reduce the microbial biomass. Three and 30 days after the heat shocks, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis, cellulase and laccase activities, and phospholipid-derived fatty acids-based microbial community composition were measured. Microbial biomass was reduced up to 25% in both soils 3 days after the heat shocks. The higher initial values of microbial biomass, enzyme activity, total and particulate soil organic carbon, and aggregate stability in the FST soil coincided with higher enzymatic stability after heat shocks. FDA hydrolysis activity was less affected (more resistance) and cellulase and laccase activities recovered more rapidly (more resilience) in the FST soil relative to the AGR counterpart. In the AGR soil, laccase activity did not show resilience to any heat shock level up to 30 days after the disturbance. Within each soil type, the microbial community composition did not differ between heat shock and control samples at day 3. However, at day 30, FST soil samples treated at 60A degrees C and 70A degrees C contained a microbial community significantly different from the control and with lower biomass regardless of high enzyme resilience. Results of this study show that deforestation followed by long-term cultivation changed microbial community composition and had differential effects on microbial functional stability. Both soils displayed similar resilience to FDA hydrolysis, a composite measure of a broad range of hydrolases, supporting the concept of high functional redundancy in soil microbial communities. In contrast, the resilience of the substrate-specific activities of laccase and cellulase were lower in AGR soils, indicating a less diverse community of microorganisms capable of producing these enzymes and confirming that specific microbial functions are more sensitive measurements for evaluating change in the ecological stability of soils.

AB Sophisticated statistical analyses are common in ecological research, particularly in species distribution modeling. The effects of sometimes arbitrary decisions during the modeling procedure on the final outcome are difficult to assess, and to date are largely unexplored. We conducted an analysis quantifying the contribution of uncertainty in each step during the model-building sequence to variation in model validity and climate change projection uncertainty. Our study system was the distribution of the Great Grey Shrike in the German federal state of Saxony. For each of four steps (data quality, collinearity method, model type, and variable selection), we ran three different options in a factorial experiment, leading to 81 different model approaches. Each was subjected to a fivefold cross-validation, measuring area under curve (AUC) to assess model quality. Next, we used three climate change scenarios times three precipitation realizations to project future distributions from each model, yielding 729 projections. Again, we analyzed which step introduced most variability (the four model-building steps plus the two scenario steps) into predicted species prevalences by the year 2050. Predicted prevalences ranged from a factor of 0.2 to a factor of 10 of present prevalence, with the majority of predictions between 1.1 and 4.2 (inter-quartile range). We found that model type and data quality dominated this analysis. In particular, artificial neural networks yielded low cross-validation robustness and gave very conservative climate change predictions. Generalized linear and additive models were very similar in quality and predictions, and superior to neural networks. Variations in scenarios and realizations had very little effect, due to the small spatial extent of the study region and its relatively small range of climatic conditions. We conclude that, for climate projections, model type and data quality were the most influential factors. Since comparison of model types has received good coverage in the ecological literature, effects of data quality should now come under more scrutiny.

AB 1. To develop a conservation management plan for a species, knowledge of its distribution and spatial arrangement of preferred habitat is essential. This is a difficult task, especially when the species of concern is in low abundance. In south-western Victoria, Australia, populations of the rare rufous bristlebird Dasyornis broadbenti are threatened by fragmentation of suitable habitat. In order to improve the conservation status of this species, critical habitat requirements must be identified and a system of corridors must be established to link known populations. A predictive spatial model of rufous bristlebird habitat was developed in order to identify critical areas requiring preservation, such as corridors for dispersal.
   2. Habitat models generated using generalized linear modelling techniques can assist in delineating the specific habitat requirements of a species. Coupled with geographic information system (GIS) technology, these models can be extrapolated to produce maps displaying the spatial configuration of suitable habitat.
   3. Models were generated using logistic regression, with bristlebird presence or absence as the dependent variable and landscape variables, extracted from both GIS data layers and multispectral digital imagery, as the predictors. A multimodel inference approach based on Akaike's information criterion was used and the resulting model was applied in a GIS to extrapolate predicted likelihood of occurrence across the entire area of concern. The predictive performance of the selected model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) technique. A hierarchical partitioning protocol was used to identify the predictor variables most likely to influence variation in the dependent variable. Probability of species presence was used as an index of habitat suitability.
   4. Negative associations between rufous bristlebird presence and increasing elevation, 'distance to creek', 'distance to coast' and sun index were evident, suggesting a preference for areas relatively low in altitude, in close proximity to the coastal fringe and drainage lines, and receiving less direct sunlight. A positive association with increasing habitat complexity also suggested that this species prefers areas containing high vertical density of vegetation.
   5. The predictive performance of the selected model was shown to be high (area under the curve 0.97), indicating a good fit of the model to the data. Hierarchical partitioning analysis showed that all the variables considered had significant independent contributions towards explaining the variation in the dependent variable. The proportion of the total study area that was predicted as suitable habitat for the rufous bristlebird (using probability of occurrence at a greater than or equal to 0.5 level) was 16%.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The spatial model clearly delineated areas predicted as highly suitable rufous bristlebird habitat, with evidence of potential corridors linking coastal and inland populations via gullies. Conservation of this species will depend on management actions that protect the critical habitats identified in the model. A multiscale approach to the modelling process is recommended whereby a spatially explicit model is first generated using landscape variables extracted from a GIS, and a second model at site level is developed using fine-scale habitat variables measured on the ground. Where there are constraints on the time and cost involved in measuring finer scale variables, the first step alone can be used for conservation planning.

AB We investigated the effects of interspecific competition on abundance, habitat partitioning, and coexistence of six closely related species of gobies (genus Gobiodon) that inhabit a range of coral species at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. After documenting the extent of overlap in habitat use among pairs of species in the field, we used a combination of field and laboratory experiments to investigate the relationship between these patterns and the occurrence of interspecific competition. Experiments in aquaria tested the ability of five of the species to compete against Gobiodon histrio, the apparent competitive dominant, including the effects of body size and prior residency. A manipulative field experiment, in which abundance of G. histrio was reduced, tested whether competition with this species limits the abundance of the other five species.
   Two species competed for space with G. histrio in the field, yet overlap in habitat use with G. histrio was high for one of these species (G. axillaris) and low for the other (G. brochus). In aquaria, G. axillaris and G. histrio preferred the same species of coral and had equivalent, size-based, competitive abilities. The coexistence of G. axillaris and G. histrio at the scale of tens of meters on the reef can thus be explained by a competitive lottery model. However, differential distributions of these two species across the reef flat and reef crest suggest that resource partitioning or habitat selection at larger spatial scales may also be important to their coexistence. In aquaria, G. brochus was an inferior competitor to G. histrio and could only gain access to the preferred species of coral through an advantage in body size or prior residency. Low overlap in habitat use between G. brochus and G. histrio in the field appears to result from niche shifts by the subordinate competitor only.
   The field experiment indicated that the other three species did not compete for space with G. histrio. Experiments in aquaria demonstrated that G. rivulatus and G. histrio exhibited low overlap in habitat use and did not compete, because they preferred different species of coral. In contrast. G. unicolor and G. histrio exhibited high overlap in habitat use but did not compete, because they were able to cohabit the same coral colonies without affecting each other. In aquaria, G. quinquestrigatus and G. histrio preferred the same coral species' however, in a field recolonization experiment, coral colonies previously occupied by G. quinquestrigatus were rarely recolonized by G. histrio, indicating that these species coexist because they use different types of coral colonies in the field. The study demonstrates that there is no single relationship between overlap in resource use and the occurrence of interspecific competition and that species within a guild can coexist by a diversity of mechanisms.

AB We review experimental studies to evaluate how the nitrogen cycle influences the response of forest net primary production (NPP) to elevated CO2. The studies in our survey report that at the tissue level, elevated CO2 reduces leaf nitrogen concentration an average 21%, but that it has a smaller effect on nitrogen concentrations in stems and fine roots. In contrast, higher soil nitrogen availability generally increases leaf nitrogen concentration. Among studies that manipulate both soil nitrogen availability and atmospheric CO2, photosynthetic response depends on a linear relationship with the response of leaf nitrogen concentration and the amount of change in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Although elevated CO2 often results in reduced tissue respiration rate per unit biomass, the link to changes in tissue nitrogen concentration is not well studied.

AB Growth is a major component of fitness in all organisms, an important mediator of competitive interactions in plant communities, and a central determinant of yield in crops. Understanding what limits plant growth is therefore of fundamental importance to plant evolution, ecology, and crop science, but each discipline views the process from a different perspective. This review highlights the importance of source-sink interactions as determinants of growth. The evidence for source-and sink-limitation of growth, and the ways in which regulatory molecular feedback systems act to maintain an appropriate source: sink balance, are first discussed. Evidence clearly shows that future increases in crop productivity depend crucially on a quantitative understanding of the extent to which sources or sinks limit growth, and how this changes during development. To identify bottlenecks limiting growth and yield, a holistic view of growth is required at the whole-plant scale, incorporating mechanistic interactions between physiology, resource allocation, and plant development. Such a holistic perspective on source-sink interactions will allow the development of a more integrated, whole-system level understanding of growth, with benefits across multiple disciplines.

AB Environmental disturbance underpins the dynamics and diversity of many of the ecosystems of the world, yet its influence on the patterns and distribution of genetic diversity is poorly appreciated. We argue here that disturbance history may be the major driver that shapes patterns of genetic diversity in many natural populations. We outline how disturbance influences genetic diversity through changes in both selective processes and demographically driven, selectively neutral processes. Our review highlights the opportunities and challenges presented by genetic approaches, such as landscape genomics, for better understanding and predicting the demographic and evolutionary responses of natural populations to disturbance. Developing this understanding is now critical because disturbance regimes are changing rapidly in a human-modified world.

AB Refugia have been suggested as priority sites for conservation under climate change because of their ability to facilitate survival of biota under adverse conditions. Here, we review the likely role of refugial habitats in conserving freshwater biota in arid Australian aquatic systems where the major long-term climatic influence has been aridification. We introduce a conceptual model that characterizes evolutionary refugia and ecological refuges based on our review of the attributes of aquatic habitats and freshwater taxa (fishes and aquatic invertebrates) in arid Australia. We also identify methods of recognizing likely future refugia and approaches to assessing the vulnerability of arid-adapted freshwater biota to a warming and drying climate. Evolutionary refugia in arid areas are characterized as permanent, groundwater-dependent habitats (subterranean aquifers and springs) supporting vicariant relicts and short-range endemics. Ecological refuges can vary across space and time, depending on the dispersal abilities of aquatic taxa and the geographical proximity and hydrological connectivity of aquatic habitats. The most important are the perennial waterbodies (both groundwater and surface water fed) that support obligate aquatic organisms. These species will persist where suitable habitats are available and dispersal pathways are maintained. For very mobile species (invertebrates with an aerial dispersal phase) evolutionary refugia may also act as ecological refuges. Evolutionary refugia are likely future refugia because their water source (groundwater) is decoupled from local precipitation. However, their biota is extremely vulnerable to changes in local conditions because population extinction risks cannot be abated by the dispersal of individuals from other sites. Conservation planning must incorporate a high level of protection for aquifers that support refugial sites. Ecological refuges are vulnerable to changes in regional climate because they have little thermal or hydrological buffering. Accordingly, conservation planning must focus on maintaining meta-population processes, especially through dynamic connectivity between aquatic habitats at a landscape scale.

AB The relative influence of Neogene geomorphological events and Quaternary climatic changes as causal mechanisms on Neotropical diversification remains largely speculative, as most divergence timing inferences are based on a single locus and have limited taxonomic or geographic sampling. To investigate these influences, we use a multilocus (two mitochondrial and 11 nuclear genes) range-wide sampling of Phyllopezus pollicaris, a gecko complex widely distributed across the poorly studied South American dry diagonal biomes. Our approach couples traditional and model-based phylogeography with geospatial methods, and demonstrates Miocene diversification and limited influence of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations on P. pollicaris. Phylogeographic structure and distribution models highlight that persistence across multiple isolated regions shaped the diversification of this species complex. Approximate Bayesian computation supports hypotheses of allopatric and ecological/sympatric speciation between lineages that largely coincide with genetic clusters associated with Chaco, Cerrado, and Caatinga, standing for complex diversification between the dry diagonal biomes. We recover extremely high genetic diversity and suggest that eight well-supported clades may be valid species, with direct implications for taxonomy and conservation assessments. These patterns exemplify how low-vagility species complexes, characterized by strong genetic structure and pre-Pleistocene divergence histories, represent ideal radiations to investigate broad biogeographic histories of associated biomes.

TI Estimating Contemporary Effective Population Size on the Basis of
   Linkage Disequilibrium in the Face of Migration
SO GENETICS
LA English

AB Effective population size (N-e) is an important genetic parameter because of its relationship to loss of genetic variation, increases in inbreeding, accumulation of mutations, and effectiveness of selection. Like most other genetic approaches that estimate contemporary N-e, the method based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) assumes a closed population and (in the most common applications) randomly recombining loci. We used analytical and numerical methods to evaluate the absolute and relative consequences of two potential violations of the closed-population assumption: (1) mixture LD caused by occurrence of more than one gene pool, which would downwardly bias (N) over cap (e), and (2) reductions in drift LD (and hence upward bias in (N) over cap (e)) caused by an increase in the number of parents responsible for local samples. The LD method is surprisingly robust to equilibrium migration. Effects of mixture LD are small for all values of migration rate (m), and effects of additional parents are also small unless m is high in genetic terms. LD estimates of N-e therefore accurately reflect local (subpopulation) N-e unless m > similar to 5-10%. With higher m, (N) over cap (e) converges on the global (metapopulation) N-e. Two general exceptions were observed. First, equilibrium migration that is rare and hence episodic can occasionally lead to substantial mixture LD, especially when sample size is small. Second, nonequilibrium, pulse migration of strongly divergent individuals can also create strong mixture LD and depress estimates of local N-e. In both cases, assignment tests, Bayesian clustering, and other methods often will allow identification of recent immigrants that strongly influence results. In simulations involving equilibrium migration, the standard LD method performed better than a method designed to jointly estimate N-e and m. The above results assume loci are not physically linked; for tightly linked loci, the LD signal from past migration events can persist for many generations, with consequences for N-e estimates that remain to be evaluated.

AB Few species are distributed uniformly in space, and populations of mobile organisms are rarely closed with respect to movement, yet many models of density rely upon these assumptions. We present a hierarchical model allowing inference about the density of unmarked populations subject to temporary emigration and imperfect detection. The model can be fit to data collected using a variety of standard survey methods such as repeated point counts in which removal sampling, double-observer sampling, or distance sampling is used during each count. Simulation studies demonstrated that parameter estimators are unbiased when temporary emigration is either "completely random" or is determined by the size and location of home ranges relative to survey points. We also applied the model to repeated removal sampling data collected on Chestnut-sided Warblers (Dendroica pensylvancia) in the White Mountain National Forest, USA. The density estimate from our model, 1.09 birds/ha, was similar to an estimate of 1.11 birds/ha produced by an intensive spot-mapping effort. Our model is also applicable when processes other than temporary emigration affect the probability of being available for detection, such as in studies using cue counts. Functions to implement the model have been added to the R package unmarked.

AB The degree to which variation in plant community composition (beta-diversity) is predictable from environmental variation, relative to other spatial processes, is of considerable current interest. We addressed this question in Costa Rican rain forest pteridophytes (1,045 plots, 127 species). We also tested the effect of data quality on the results, which has largely been overlooked in earlier studies. To do so, we compared two alternative spatial models [polynomial vs. principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM)] and ten alternative environmental models (all available environmental variables vs. four subsets, and including their polynomials vs. not). Of the environmental data types, soil chemistry contributed most to explaining pteridophyte community variation, followed in decreasing order of contribution by topography, soil type and forest structure. Environmentally explained variation increased moderately when polynomials of the environmental variables were included. Spatially explained variation increased substantially when the multi-scale PCNM spatial model was used instead of the traditional, broad-scale polynomial spatial model. The best model combination (PCNM spatial model and full environmental model including polynomials) explained 32% of pteridophyte community variation, after correcting for the number of sampling sites and explanatory variables. Overall evidence for environmental control of beta-diversity was strong, and the main floristic gradients detected were correlated with environmental variation at all scales encompassed by the study (c. 100-2,000 m). Depending on model choice, however, total explained variation differed more than fourfold, and the apparent relative importance of space and environment could be reversed. Therefore, we advocate a broader recognition of the impacts that data quality has on analysis results. A general understanding of the relative contributions of spatial and environmental processes to species distributions and beta-diversity requires that methodological artefacts are separated from real ecological differences.

AB 1. The concept of threshold has become important in ecology, but the nature of potential threshold responses of vegetation to grazing in rangeland ecosystems remains poorly understood. We aimed to identify ecological thresholds in vegetation changes along a grazing gradient and to examine whether threshold changes were expressed similarly. at a variety of ecological sites.
   2. To accomplish this, we surveyed the vegetation along grazing gradients at 10 ecological sites, each located at different landscape positions in Mongolia's central and southern rangelands. Evidence for a threshold in changes in floristic composition along the grazing gradient was examined by comparing linear models of the data with nonlinear models fitted using an exponential curve, an inverse curve, a piecewise regression and a sigmoid logistic curve.
   3. Three nonlinear models (piecewise, exponential and sigmoid) provided a much better fit to the data than the linear models, highlighting the presence of a discontinuity in vegetation changes along the grazing gradient. The shapes of the best-fit models and their fit to the data were generally similar across sites, indicating that the changes in floristic composition were relatively constant below a threshold level of grazing, after which the curve changed sharply.
   4. Except for two sites, the best-fit models had relatively narrow bootstrap confidence intervals (95% CI), especially around threshold points or zones where the rate of change accelerated, emphasizing that our results were robust and conclusive.
   5. Synthesis. Our study provided strong evidence for the existence of ecological thresholds in vegetation change along a grazing gradient across all ecological sites. This suggests that vegetation responses to grazing in the study areas are essentially nonlinear. The recognition that real threshold changes exist in real grazing gradients will help land managers to prevent the occurrence of undesirable states and promote the occurrence of desirable states, and will therefore permit a major step forward in the sustainable management of rangeland ecosystems.

AB This study documented temporal variation in the abundance of butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae) at Trunk Reef, on the central Great Barrier Reef, Australia, from May 2000 to March 2005. During this period, live coral cover declined by > 90%, mostly due to severe coral bleaching. There were no short-term changes (within 4 months) in the abundance of butterflyfishes following initial declines in live coral cover. Surveys conducted in 2005, however, revealed significant declines in the abundance of Chaetodon baronessa, Chaetodon lunulatus, Chaetodon trifascialis, Chaetodon plebeius and Chaetodon rainfordi, all of which are obligate hard-coral feeders. In contrast, there was no significant change in the abundance of Chaetodon auriga, Chaetodon aureofasciatus, Chaetodon citrinellus, Chaetodon melannotus or Chaetodon vagabundus, which are much less reliant on scleractinian coral for food. Clearly, extensive coral depletion, such as that caused by severe coral bleaching, can have a major effect on the abundance of butterflyfishes. Specific responses of butterflyfishes varied according to their reliance on hard corals for food and their ability to utilize alternate prey types.

AB Many phylogeographic studies have revealed strongly diverged lineages within species that are masked by a lack of congruent morphological differentiation. To assess the extent to which the genetic component of diversity affects conservation assessments, we compared spatial patterns of endemism and conservation value for 22 species of Californian amphibians and reptiles with the 75 phylogeographic lineages that they contain. We used bioclimatic distribution modeling with environmental layers to generate 5-km spatial-resolution maps of predicted distribution for each species and lineage. We found concentrations of lineage breaks across the Central Valley, San Francisco Bay, the Sierra Nevada, and the Tehachapi and Trinity ranges. Subdivision of the ranges of species into phylogeographic units revealed novel areas of endemism. Several areas of very high conservation value for lineages were not evident in the species-level analysis. These observations illustrate the importance of considering multiple levels of biodiversity in conservation assessments.

AB Climate warming is predicted to reduce the extent of ice cover in the Arctic and, within the Hudson Bay region, the annual ice may be significantly decreased or entirely lost in the foreseeable future. The ringed seal (Phoca hispida), a key species that depends on sea ice, will likely be among the first marine mammals to show the negative effects of climatic warming. We used 639 ringed seals killed by Inuit hunters from western Hudson Bay (1991-1992, 1999-2001) to assess trends in recruitment relative to snow depth, snowfall, rainfall, temperature in April and May, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) from the previous winter, and timing of spring break-up. Snowfall and ringed seal recruitment varied from lower than average in the 1970s, to higher in 1980s and lower in 1990s. Prior to 1990, seal recruitment appeared to be related to timing of spring ice break-up which was correlated with the NAO. However, recent 1990-2001 environmental data indicate less snowfall, lower snow depth, and warmer temperatures in April and May when pups are born and nursed. Decreased snow depth, particularly below 32 cm, corresponded with a significant decrease in ringed seal recruitment as indicated by pups born and surviving to adults that were later harvested. Earlier spring break-up of sea ice together with snow trends suggest continued low pup survival in western Hudson Bay.

AB 1. Focal species (i.e. indicators, keystones, umbrellas, and flagships) have been advocated for the management and conservation of natural environments.
   2. The assumption has been that the presence or abundance of a focal species is a means to understanding the composition and/or state of the more complex community.
   3. We review the characteristics of focal species, and evaluate their appropriateness and utility judged against conservation objectives.
   4. It appears that indicator species (of both composition and condition) may be of greatest general utility, and that several types of focal species may exhibit useful indicator properties. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Trade-offs between acquisition capacities for aboveground and belowground resources were investigated by studying the phenotypic plasticity of Leaf and root traits in response to different irradiance levels at low nutrient supply. Two congeneric grasses with contrasting Light requirements, Dactylis glomerata and D. polygama. were used. The aim was to analyze phenotypic covariation in components of Leaf area and root length in response to above- and belowground resource limitation and the consequences of this variation for resource acquisition and plant growth. At intermediate shading (30 and 20% of full sunlight) the plants were able to maintain their total root length, despite a strongly increased total leaf area and a reduced biomass allocation to roots. This was associated with an unaltered or slightly increased nutrient uptake and growth. At 5.5% relative irradiance, growth was severely reduced, especially in the shade-tolerant D. polygama. The results show that constraints on acquisition capacities for aboveground and belowground resources. caused by biomass allocation, may be alleviated by plasticity in other traits such as tissue-mass density and thickness of roots and leaves. The results also suggest different adaptive constraints for phenotypic plasticity and for genetically determined interspecific variation. Phenotypic plasticity tends to maximize resource acquisition and growth rate in the short term, whereas the higher tissue-mass density and the longer leaf life-span of shade-tolerant species indicate reduced loss rates as a more advantageous species-specific adaptation to shade in the long term.

AB This study was carried out: (i) to estimate from soil water depletion curves the apparent rooting depth (RD) for several crops; (ii) to calculate the soil water extraction parameters; and (iii) to compare inter- and intraspecific differences in the water extraction parameters. Experiments were conducted at the Manfredi Experimental Station (WTA), Argentina (31 degrees 49' S, 63 degrees 48'W), and at the Institute of Phytopathology and Vegetal Physiology (IFFIVE), Cordoba, Argentina (31 degrees 24' S, 64 degrees 11' W). The soil was a silty loam Entic Haplustoll (USDA Soil Taxonomy) with A, AC and C horizons. The crops studied were: maize (Zea mays L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Differences in apparent rooting depths among species and cultivars, ranging from 130 to 290 cm, were found. The comparison of the extraction front velocity (EFV) revealed differences among species but not among cultivars of the same species. EFV ranged from 44 mm day(-1) for sunflower to 23 mm day(-1) for peanut. In all the crops, the downward progress of the extraction front stopped at the beginning of the grain filling. Comparisons among the pooled rates of water extraction (kl) for depths from 10 to 110 cm, revealed significant differences among crops and cultivars within crops. The kl values ranged from 0.110 day(-1) for Contiflor 3 sunflower to 0.029 day(-1) for alfalfa. No significant correlation between kl values and root length density over 40 to 120 cm depths was found for soybean, indicating that the specific water uptake rate varies considerably in the soil profile.

AB Dark respiration in light as well as in dark was estimated for attached leaves of an evergreen (Heteromeles arbutifolia Ait.) and a deciduous (Lepechinia fragans Greene) shrub species using an open gas-exchange system. Dark respiration in light was estimated by the Laisk method. Respiration rates in the dark were always higher than in the light, indicating that light inhibited respiration in both species. The rates of respiration in the dark were higher in the leaves of the deciduous species than in the evergreen species. However, there were no significant differences in respiration rates in light between the species. Thus, the degree of inhibition of respiration by light was greater in the deciduous species (62%) than in the evergreen species (51%). Respiration in both the light and darkness decreased with increasing leaf age. However, because respiration in the light decreased faster with leaf age than respiration in darkness, the degree of inhibition of respiration by light increased with leaf age (from 36% in the youngest leaves to 81% in the mature leaves). This suggests that the rate of dark respiration in the light is related to the rate of biosynthetic processes. Dark respiration in the light decreased with increasing light intensity. Respiration both in the light and in the dark was dependent on leaf temperature. We concluded that respiration in light and respiration in darkness are tightly coupled, with variation in respiration in darkness accounting for more than 60% of the variation in respiration in light. Care must be taken when the relation between respiration in light and respiration in darkness is studied, because the relation varies with species, leaf age, and light intensity.

AB We analyze the effects of changing patterns of thermal availability, in space and time, on the performance of small ectotherms. We approach this problem by breaking it into a series of smaller steps, focusing on: (1) how macroclimates interact with living and nonliving objects in the environment to produce a mosaic of thermal microclimates and (2) how mobile ectotherms filter those microclimates into realized body temperatures by moving around in them. Although the first step (generation of mosaics) is conceptually straightforward, there still exists no general framework for predicting spatial and temporal patterns of microclimatic variation. We organize potential variation along three axes the nature of the objects producing the microclimates (abiotic versus biotic), how microclimates translate macroclimatic variation (amplify versus buffer), and the temporal and spatial scales over which microclimatic conditions vary (long versus short). From this organization, we propose several general rules about patterns of microclimatic diversity To examine the second step (behavioral sampling of locally available microclimates), we construct a set of models that simulate ectotherms moving on a thermal landscape according to simple sets of diffusion-based rules. The models explore the effects of both changes in body size (which affect the time scale over which organisms integrate operative body temperatures) and increases in the mean and variance of temperature on the thermal landscape. Collectively, the models indicate that both simple behavioral rules and interactions between body size and spatial patterns of thermal variation can profoundly affect the distribution of realized body temperatures experienced by ectotherms. These analyses emphasize the rich set of problems still to solve before arriving at a general, predictive theory of the biological consequences of climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The sustainability of urban areas is essential to the sustainability of regions, nations, and the world as a whole. Urban sustainability indicators (USIs) can play an important role in advancing the science and practice of sustaining urban systems.
   We review the key concepts of urban sustainability and commonly used indicators for gauging the state and progress of urban sustainability, and discuss how USIs can be further improved from a landscape ecology perspective.
   This review is based primarily on peer-reviewed journal papers, as well as books, and documents published by international organizations, governmental agencies, and research institutions. We systematically examine what USIs actually measure and whether they are adequate for gauging urban sustainability, and then discuss major problems and challenges as well as ways forward in developing and applying USIs.
   Numerous USIs have been developed, including single composite indices and indicator sets. This paper focuses on three indicator sets and ten composite indices. Eight of them cover all the three dimensions of sustainability (environment, economy, and society), and five cover two of the three. Five of them measure strong sustainability, and eight only indicate weak sustainability.
   Urban sustainability indicators abound, and so do problems with them. These include technical issues of normalization, weighting, and aggregation (upscaling), as well as conceptual issues of indicator selection, boundary delineation, heterogeneity, scale, and strong versus weak sustainability. To overcome these problems, principles and methods in landscape ecology-particularly those of landscape metrics, spatial scaling, and landscape sustainability-have much to offer, and this represents a challenging and fruitful research direction for both landscape and urban scientists in the coming decades.

AB Climate models predict a dramatic increase in the annual frequency and severity of extreme weather events during the next century. Here we show that increases in the annual frequency of severe storms lead to a decrease in the diversity and complexity of food webs of giant kelp forests, one of the most productive habitats on Earth. We demonstrate this by linking natural variation in storms with measured changes in kelp forest food web structure in the Santa Barbara Channel using structural equation modeling (SEM). We then match predictions from statistical models to results from a multiyear kelp removal experiment designed to simulate frequent large storms. Both SEM models and experiments agree: if large storms remain at their current annual frequency (roughly one major kelp-removing storm every 3.5 years), periodic storms help maintain the complexity of kelp forest food webs. However, if large storms increase in annual frequency and begin to occur year after year, kelp forest food webs become less diverse and complex as species go locally extinct. The loss of complexity occurs primarily due to decreases in the diversity and complexity of higher trophic levels. Our findings demonstrate that shifts in climate-driven disturbances that affect foundation species are likely to have impacts that cascade through entire ecosystems.

AB Determining the genetic basis of environmental adaptation is a central problem of evolutionary biology. This issue has been fruitfully addressed by examining genetic differentiation between populations that are recently separated and/or experience high rates of gene flow. A good example of this approach is the decades-long investigation of selection acting along latitudinal clines in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we use next-generation genome sequencing to reexamine the well-studied Australian D. melanogaster cline. We find evidence for extensive differentiation between temperate and tropical populations, with regulatory regions and unannotated regions showing particularly high levels of differentiation. Although the physical genomic scale of geographic differentiation is small-on the order of gene sized-we observed several larger highly differentiated regions. The region spanned by the cosmopolitan inversion polymorphism In(3R)P shows higher levels of differentiation, consistent with the major difference in allele frequencies of Standard and In(3R)P karyotypes in temperate vs. tropical Australian populations. Our analysis reveals evidence for spatially varying selection on a number of key biological processes, suggesting fundamental biological differences between flies from these two geographic regions.

AB In conservation biology genetic diversity is recognized as an important criterion to consider when prioritizing populations for protection. Today, population genomics offers the opportunity to evaluate both neutral and adaptive components of genetic diversity directly at the genome level with molecular tools. By screening the genome with many genetic markers, it is possible to detect loci supposedly under natural selection and thus of adaptive significance. We devised a new diversity index, the population adaptive index (PAI), which accounts for the adaptive value of the population it refers to. To estimate this index, we performed a genome scan with amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to identify neutral and selected loci in several populations of a widespread amphibian (common frog, Rana temporaria) and a threatened plant (Austrian dragonhead, Dracocephalum austriacum L.). We then investigated four different conservation strategies aimed at protecting the maximum amount of genetic diversity (neutral or selected). In particular we explored the relevance of the principle of complementarity, usually applied to the protection of species, in the management of intraspecific diversity. This principle advocates the conservation of sets of units that together maximize the species' orgenetic diversity, which is in opposition to the traditional approach of targeting populations that are the most diverse individually. Four major conclusions emerged from these results. First, the PAI seemed to be a valuable index to evaluate the adaptive diversities within populations. Second, in the two species, the neutral and adaptive diversities within and among populations were not correlated, so conservation strategies based on the neutral and adaptive indexes would not select the same populations for protection. Third, because of its efficiency in conserving genetic diversity, the principle of complementarity deserves to be used more often for this purpose. Fourth, when neutral and adaptive results conflict, additional arguments (e.g., demography, ecology, and geographic proximity) should be considered together with levels of genetic diversity to determine a conservation strategy.

AB The interactions between plants and herbivores are key determinants of community structure world wide. Their role is particularly important in lowland tropical rain forests where rates of herbivory are higher, plants are better defended chemically and physically, and herbivores have specialized diets. In contrast to the temperate zone, most of the herbivory in the tropics occurs on ephemeral young leaves (>70%), which requires herbivores to have finely tuned host-finding abilities. As a consequence of these tight ecological and evolutionary linkages, the interplay between plants and herbivores in the tropics may be more susceptible to perturbations of climate change.
   Increases in global temperature, atmospheric CO2, and the length of the dry season are all likely to have ramifications for plant/herbivore interactions in the tropics. Here I extrapolate from our current and incomplete understanding of the mechanisms regulating plant/herbivore interactions and present a scenario for possible trends under a changing climate. Although elevated CO2 tends to enhance plant growth rates, the larger effects of increased drought stress will probably result in lower growth. In atmospheres experimentally enriched in CO2, the nutritional quality of leaves declines substantially due to a dilution of nitrogen by 10-30%. This response is buffered in plant species associated with nitrogen fixers. Elevated CO2 should also cause a slight decrease in nitrogen-based defenses(e.g., alkaloids) and a slight increase in carbon-based defenses (e.g., tannins). The most dramatic and robust predicted effect of climate change is on rates of herbivory. Lower foliar nitrogen due to CO2 fertilization of plants causes an increase in consumption per herbivore by as much as 40% and unusually severe drought appears to cause herbivore populations to explode. In areas where elevated CO2 is combined with drying, rates of herbivory may rise 2-4 fold. The frequency of insect outbreaks is also expected to increase. Higher herbivory should further reduce plant growth rates, perhaps favoring plant species that are well-defended or fix nitrogen. The predicted increase in the number of herbivores is primarily due to relaxed pressure from predators and parasitoids. Elevated temperatures may increase herbivore developmental times, affording them partial escape from discovery by natural enemies, and drought appears to decimate parasitoid populations. The expected decline in parasitoid numbers may be due to direct effects of dry season drought or to the relative scarcity of herbivores during that period. As a consequence, the relative abundance of species will change, and overall biodiversity should decline.

AB The 2019/20 Black Summer bushfire disaster in southeast Australia was unprecedented: the extensive area of forest burnt, the radiative power of the fires, and the extraordinary number of fires that developed into extreme pyroconvective events were all unmatched in the historical record. Australia's hottest and driest year on record, 2019, was characterised by exceptionally dry fuel loads that primed the landscape to burn when exposed to dangerous fire weather and ignition. The combination of climate variability and long-term climate trends generated the climate extremes experienced in 2019, and the compounding effects of two or more modes of climate variability in their fire-promoting phases (as occurred in 2019) has historically increased the chances of large forest fires occurring in southeast Australia. Palaeoclimate evidence also demonstrates that fire-promoting phases of tropical Pacific and Indian ocean variability are now unusually frequent compared with natural variability in pre-industrial times. Indicators of forest fire danger in southeast Australia have already emerged outside of the range of historical experience, suggesting that projections made more than a decade ago that increases in climate-driven fire risk would be detectable by 2020, have indeed eventuated. The multiple climate change contributors to fire risk in southeast Australia, as well as the observed non-linear escalation of fire extent and intensity, raise the likelihood that fire events may continue to rapidly intensify in the future. Improving local and national adaptation measures while also pursuing ambitious global climate change mitigation efforts would provide the best strategy for limiting further increases in fire risk in southeast Australia. Multiple climate contributors to fire risk in southeast Australia have led to an increase in fire extent and intensity over the past decades that will likely continue into the future, suggests a synthesis of climate variability, long-term trends and palaeoclimatic evidence.

AB Biological invasions have steadily increased over recent centuries. However, we still lack a clear expectation about future trends in alien species numbers. In particular, we do not know whether alien species will continue to accumulate in regional floras and faunas, or whether the pace of accumulation will decrease due to the depletion of native source pools. Here, we apply a new model to simulate future numbers of alien species based on estimated sizes of source pools and dynamics of historical invasions, assuming a continuation of processes in the future as observed in the past (a business-as-usual scenario). We first validated performance of different model versions by conducting a back-casting approach, therefore fitting the model to alien species numbers until 1950 and validating predictions on trends from 1950 to 2005. In a second step, we selected the best performing model that provided the most robust predictions to project trajectories of alien species numbers until 2050. Altogether, this resulted in 3,790 stochastic simulation runs for 38 taxon-continent combinations. We provide the first quantitative projections of future trajectories of alien species numbers for seven major taxonomic groups in eight continents, accounting for variation in sampling intensity and uncertainty in projections. Overall, established alien species numbers per continent were predicted to increase from 2005 to 2050 by 36%. Particularly, strong increases were projected for Europe in absolute (+2,543 +/- 237 alien species) and relative terms, followed by Temperate Asia (+1,597 +/- 197), Northern America (1,484 +/- 74) and Southern America (1,391 +/- 258). Among individual taxonomic groups, especially strong increases were projected for invertebrates globally. Declining (but still positive) rates were projected only for Australasia. Our projections provide a first baseline for the assessment of future developments of biological invasions, which will help to inform policies to contain the spread of alien species.

TI The ecology and biodiversity of urban ponds
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER
LA English
DT Review
AB Recent research has demonstrated that ponds contribute a great deal to biodiversity at a regional level as networks of habitat patches that also act as 'stepping stones' to facilitate the movement of species through the landscape. Similarly, a great deal of biodiversity persists in urban environments where synanthropic communities are supplemented by species that thrive in disturbed environments. Aquatic urban biodiversity appears to persist despite anthropogenic stressors: an array of anthropogenic pollutants (road salt and heavy metals), invasive species, and active mismanagement-particularly the removal of riparian vegetation. Optimizing urban ponds for different ecosystem services results in conflicting priorities over hydrological, geochemical, ecological, aesthetic, and cultural functions. The socio-ecosystem approach to environmental management opens a path to greater incorporation of biodiversity into town planning and sustainability, while accounting for cultural attitudes to urban ecosystems. I identify a range of research needs: (1) the roles of design and location of urban ponds in influencing biodiversity, (2) the function of urban wetlands for stormwater and pollution management, and (3) public perceptions of urban ecosystems and how those perceptions are influenced by interactions with natural systems. Urban wetlands offer an important opportunity to educate the general public on natural systems and science in general using a resource that is located on their doorstep. In the face of increasing pressures on natural systems and increasing extent and intensity of urbanization, a more comprehensive appreciation of the challenges and opportunities provided by urban ponds could play a substantial role in driving sustainable urban development.

AB The Permian-Triassic mass extinction was the most severe biotic crisis in the past 500 million years. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the crisis, but few account for the spectrum of extinction selectivity and subsequent recovery. Here we show that selective losses are best accounted for by a combination of lethally warm, shallow waters and anoxic deep waters that acted to severely restrict the habitable area to a narrow mid-water refuge zone. The relative tolerance of groups to this double whammy provides the first clear explanation for the selective extinction losses during this double-pulsed crisis and also the fitful recovery. Thus, high temperature intolerant shallow-water dwellers, such as corals, large foraminifers and radiolarians were eliminated first whilst high temperature tolerant ostracods thrived except in anoxic deeper-waters. In contrast, hypoxia tolerant but temperature intolerant small foraminifers were driven from shallow-waters but thrived on dysoxic slopes margins. Only those mollusc groups, which are tolerant of both hypoxia and high temperatures, were able to thrive in the immediate aftermath of the extinction. Limited Early Triassic benthic recovery was restricted to mid-water depths and coincided with intervals of cooling and deepening of water column anoxia that expanded the habitable mid-water refuge zone.

AB 1. We have little idea how landscape-scale factors influence the success of wild bumblebee nests over time. Here for the first time we use molecular markers to estimate within-season changes in the numbers of nests.
   2. Workers of two bumblebee species were sampled in an arable landscape in late May-June and late July-August, and the numbers of nests represented in each sample were estimated. We compare the methods available to estimate nest number from such samples and conclude that methods which allow for heterogeneity in the probability of capture of nests provide the best fit to our data. Changes in numbers of nests at the two time points were used to infer nest survival.
   3. The two bee species appeared to differ markedly in survival over time, with estimates of 45% of nests surviving for Bombus lapidarius and 91% for B. pascuorum. However, our data suggest that the foraging range of B. pascuorum may be greater in late season, which would lead us to overestimate nest survival in this species. Differential survival may also reflect differences in phenology between the two species.
   4. The land use class which had the most consistent effects on nest number and survival was gardens; for B. lapidarius, the area of gardens within a 750 and 1000 mradius positively influenced nest survival, while for B. pascuorum, the number of nests in late samples was higher at sites with more gardens within a 500 and 750-m radius. For B. pascuorum, the area of grassland within a 250 and 500-mradius also positively influenced nest number in late samples, probably because this is the preferred nesting habitat for this species.
   5. The importance of gardens is in accordance with previous studies which suggest that they now provide a stronghold for bumblebees in an otherwise impoverished agricultural environment; furthermore, our data suggest that the positive influence of gardens on bumblebee populations can spill over at least 1 km into surrounding farmland.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The substantial effects that even small areas of local resources such as rough grassland or clover leys can have on bumblebee nest numbers and survival is of clear relevance for the design of pollinator management strategies.

AB P>1. Many animal species are detected primarily by sound. Although songs, calls and other sounds are often used for population assessment, as in bird point counts and hydrophone surveys of cetaceans, there are few rigorous methods for estimating population density from acoustic data.
   2. The problem has several parts - distinguishing individuals, adjusting for individuals that are missed, and adjusting for the area sampled. Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) is a statistical methodology that addresses jointly the second and third parts of the problem. We have extended SECR to use uncalibrated information from acoustic signals on the distance to each source.
   3. We applied this extension of SECR to data from an acoustic survey of ovenbird Seiurus aurocapilla density in an eastern US deciduous forest with multiple four-microphone arrays. We modelled average power from spectrograms of ovenbird songs measured within a window of 0 center dot 7 s duration and frequencies between 4200 and 5200 Hz.
   4. The resulting estimates of the density of singing males (0 center dot 19 ha-1 SE 0 center dot 03 ha-1) were consistent with estimates of the adult male population density from mist-netting (0 center dot 36 ha-1 SE 0 center dot 12 ha-1). The fitted model predicts sound attenuation of 0 center dot 11 dB m-1 (SE 0 center dot 01 dB m-1) in excess of losses from spherical spreading.
   5.Synthesis and applications. Our method for estimating animal population density from acoustic signals fills a gap in the census methods available for visually cryptic but vocal taxa, including many species of bird and cetacean. The necessary equipment is simple and readily available; as few as two microphones may provide adequate estimates, given spatial replication. The method requires that individuals detected at the same place are acoustically distinguishable and all individuals vocalize during the recording interval, or that the per capita rate of vocalization is known. We believe these requirements can be met, with suitable field methods, for a significant number of songbird species.

AB Estimating animal density using capture-recapture data from arrays of detection devices such as camera traps has been problematic due to the movement of individuals and heterogeneity in capture probability among them induced by differential exposure to trapping.
   We develop a spatial capture-recapture model for estimating density from camera-trapping data which contains explicit models for the spatial point process governing the distribution of individuals and their exposure to and detection by traps.
   We adopt a Bayesian approach to analysis of the hierarchical model using the technique of data augmentation.
   The model is applied to photographic capture-recapture data on tigers Panthera tigris in Nagarahole reserve, India. Using this model, we estimate the density of tigers to be 14.3 animals per 100 km(2) during 2004.
   Synthesis and applications. Our modelling framework largely overcomes several weaknesses in conventional approaches to the estimation of animal density from trap arrays. It effectively deals with key problems such as individual heterogeneity in capture probabilities, movement of traps, presence of potential 'holes' in the array and ad hoc estimation of sample area. The formulation, thus, greatly enhances flexibility in the conduct of field surveys as well as in the analysis of data, from studies that may involve physical, photographic or DNA-based 'captures' of individual animals.

AB Soil microbes are among the most abundant and diverse organisms on Earth. Although microbial decomposers, particularly fungi, are important mediators of global carbon and nutrient cycling, the functional roles of specific taxa within natural environments remain unclear. We used a nucleotide-analog technique in soils from the Harvard Forest to characterize the fungal taxa that responded to the addition of five different carbon substrates-glycine, sucrose, cellulose, lignin, and tannin-protein. We show that fungal community structure and richness shift in response to different carbon sources, and we demonstrate that particular fungal taxa target different organic compounds within soil microcosms. Specifically, we identified eleven taxa that exhibited changes in relative abundances across substrate treatments. These results imply that niche partitioning through specialized resource use may be an important mechanism by which soil microbial diversity is maintained in ecosystems. Consequently, high microbial diversity may be necessary to sustain ecosystem processes and stability under global change.

AB 1. In February 2002, France, Italy and Monaco agreed to establish an international sanctuary for Mediterranean marine mammals. The resulting Pelagos Sanctuary encompasses over 87 500 km 2 of the north-western Mediterranean Sea, extending between south-eastern France, Monaco, northwestern Italy and northern Sardinia, and surrounding Corsica and the Tuscan Archipelago.
   2. The Pelagos Sanctuary illustrates how the tenets of Marine Protected Area (MPA) design can be reconciled with the dynamic nature of oceanic systems, because its spatial scale was defined by oceanographic and ecological considerations, specifically the location of the Ligurian permanent frontal system.
   3. By expanding protective measures beyond national waters, the Pelagos Sanctuary also sets a precedent for the implementation of pelagic protected areas in the high seas. The Pelagos Sanctuary will contribute to the conservation of the Mediterranean Sea at two scales: (i) locally, by protecting important cetacean foraging and breeding grounds in the Ligurian Sea, and by providing 'umbrella' protection to other marine predators in this area; and (ii) regionally, by empowering other conservation measures, such as the Specially Protected Areas Protocol of the Barcelona Convention and the wider goals of the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black and Mediterranean Seas (ACCOBAMS).
   4. However, because few cetacean species are resident within the Sanctuary, their effective long-term conservation will require large-scale management and coordinated monitoring throughout the Mediterranean basin. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The ability of bottom-dwelling marine epifauna to regenerate injured or lost body parts is critical to the survival of individuals from disturbances that inflict wounds. Numerous studies on marine sponges (Phlyum Porifera) and corals (of the orders Scleractinia and Alcyonacea) suggest that regeneration is limited by many intrinsic (individual-dependent) and extrinsic (environment-dependent) factors, and that other fife history processes may compete with regeneration for energetic and cellular resources. We review how intrinsic (size, age, morphology, genotype) and extrinsic (wound characteristics, water temperature, food availability, sedimentation, disturbance history, selection) factors limit regeneration in sponges and corals. We then review the evidence for impaired somatic growth and sexual reproduction, and altered outcomes of interactions (anti-predator defenses, competitive abilities, self- and non-self recognition abilities) with other organisms in regenerating sponges and corals. We demonstrate that smaller, older sponges and corals of decreasing morphological complexities tend to regenerate less well than others, and that regeneration can be modulated by genotype. Large wounds with small perimeters inflicted away from areas where resources are located tend to be regenerated less well than others, as are injuries inflicted when food is limited and when the animal has been previously or recently injured. We also demonstrate that regeneration strongly impairs somatic growth, reduces aspects of sexual reproduction, and decreases the ability for sponges and corals to defend themselves against predators, to compete, and to recognize conspecifics. Effects of limited regeneration and impaired life histories may manifest themselves in higher levels of biological assembly e.g., reduced accretion of epifaunal biomass, reduced recruitment and altered biotic associations, and thus affect marine community and ecosystem recovery from disturbances.

AB Conservation genetics focuses on the effects of contemporary genetic structuring on long-term survival of a species. It helps wildlife managers protect biodiversity by identifying a series of conservation units, which include species, evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) management units (MUs) action units (AUs) and family nets (FNs). Although mito-chondrial DNA (mtDNA) chondrial DNA (mtDNA) evolves 5-10 times faster than single-copy nuclear DNA (scnDNA), it records few traces of contemporary events. Thus, mtDNA can be used to resolve taxonomic uncertainties and ESUs. Variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) evolve 100-1000 times faster than scnDNA and provide a powerful tool for analyzing recent and contemporary events. VNTR analysis techniques include polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based microsatellite assays and oligonucleotide probing. Size homoplasy problems in PCR-based microsatellite assays can strongly affect the inference of recent population history. The high homozygosity in endangered species is reflected in a relatively low number and level of variability in microsatellite loci. This combined with "allelic dropout" and "misprinting" errors contributes to the generation of highly biased genetic data following analyses of natural populations. Thus, in conservation genetics, microsatellites are of limited use for identifying ESUs, MUs, and AUs. In contrast to PCR-based microsatellite analysis, oligonucleotide probing avoids errors resulting from PCR amplification. It is particularly suitable for inferring recent population history and contemporary gene flow between fragmented subpopulations. Oligonucleotide fingerprinting generates individual-specific DNA banding patterns and thus provides a highly precise tool for monitoring demography of natural populations. Hence, DNA fingerprinting is powerful for distinguishing ESUs, MUs, AUs, and FNs. The use of oligonucleotide fingerprinting and fecal DNA is opening new areas for conservation genetics.

AB Despite the importance of arbuscular mycorrhizae to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems (e.g. nutrient uptake, soil aggregation), and the increasing evidence of global warming, responses of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to climate warming are poorly understood. In a field experiment using infrared heaters, we found effects of warming on AMF after one growing season in an annual grassland, in the absence of any effects on measured root parameters (weight, length, average diameter). AMF soil hyphal length was increased by over 40% in the warmed plots, accompanied by a strong trend for AMF root colonization increase. In the following year, root weight was again not significantly changed, and AMF root colonization increased significantly in the warmed plots. Concentration of the soil protein glomalin, a glycoprotein produced by AMF hyphae with importance in soil aggregation, was decreased in the warmed plots. Soil aggregate water stability, measured for five diameter size classes, was also decreased significantly. In the following year, soil aggregate weight in two size classes was decreased significantly, but the effect size was very small. These results indicate that ecosystem warming may have stimulated carbon allocation to AMF. Other factors either influenced glomalin decomposition or production, hence influencing the role of these symbionts in soil aggregation. The observed small changes in soil aggregation, if widespread among terrestrial ecosystems, could have important consequences for soil carbon storage and erosion in a warmed climate, especially if there are cumulative effects of warming.

AB By contrast with a multitude of laboratory studies on the social organization of fish, relatively little is known about the size, composition and dynamics of free-ranging fish shoals. We give an overview of the available information on fish shoals and assess to what degree the predictions made from laboratory studies are consistent with field data. The section on shoal choice behaviour in the laboratory is structured so that the evidence fur different shoaling preferences is discussed in the context of their mechanisms and functions. Predictions based on experiments in captivity regarding preferences for conspecifics, individuals of similar body length and unparasitized fish were highly consistent with field observations on free-ranging shoals whereas preferences for familiar conspecifics and kin remain to be conclusively demonstrated in the field. In general, there is a shortage of studies in which shoaling preferences have been investigated both in the laboratory) and the field, and field studies have so far been largely descriptive revealing little about the underlying mechanisms of observed patterns. Given their great importance of fish shoals both in fundamental and applied research, an advancement of our knowledge of their social organization should significantly contribute to a better understanding of a whole range of topics including reciprocal altruism, group-living and self-organization.

AB 18S ribosomal RNA genes are the most widely used nuclear sequences for phylogeny reconstruction at higher taxonomic levels in plants. However, due to a conservative rate of evolution, 18S rDNA alone sometimes provides too few phylogenetically informative characters to resolve relationships adequately. Previous studies using partial sequences have suggested the potential of 26S or large-subunit (LSU) rDNA for phylogeny retrieval at taxonomic levels comparable to those investigated with 18S rDNA. Here we explore the patterns of molecular evolution of entire 26S rDNA sequences and their impact on phylogeny retrieval. We present a protocol for PCR amplification and sequencing of entire (similar to 3.4 kb) 26S rDNA sequences as single amplicons, as well as primers that can be used for amplification and sequencing. These primers proved useful in angiosperms and Gnetales and likely have broader applicability. With these protocols and primers, entire 26S rDNA sequences were generated for a diverse array of 15 seed plants, including basal eudicots, monocots, and higher eudicots, plus two representatives of Gnetales. Comparisons of sequence dissimilarity indicate that expansion segments (or divergence domains) evolve 6.4 to 10.2 times as fast as conserved core regions of 26S rDNA sequences in plants. Additional comparisons indicate that 26S rDNA evolves 1.6 to 2.2 times as fast as and provides 3.3 times as many phylogenetically informative characters as 18S rDNA; compared to the chloroplast gene rbcL, 26S rDNA evolves at 0.44 to 1.0 times its rate and provides 2.0 times as many phylogenetically informative characters. Expansion segment sequences analyzed here evolve 1.2 to 3.0 times faster than rbcL, providing 1.5 times the number of informative characters. Plant expansion segments have a pattern of evolution distinct from that found in animals, exhibiting less cryptic sequence simplicity, a lower frequency of insertion and deletion, and greater phylogenetic potential.

AB Spatial and temporal variation in the distribution and abundance of site-attached fish species inhabiting small, isolated patches of coral reef has been attributed to variability in larval recruitment. However, the relative importance of settlement and postsettlement processes species inhabiting large sections of contiguous reef, remains to be determined. Here, we examine the degree of spatial and temporal variation in community structure and population density of fish inhabiting sections of coral reef varying in size and connectivity.
   To investigate spatial variability in fish community structure and population density, we surveyed 36 sites on contiguous reef and 39 patch-reef sites varying in size and isolation from neighboring patches. Ordination and regression analyses indicated that the structure of fish assemblages inhabiting contiguous reef varied predictably along habitat gradients. In contrast, intrinsic habitat characteristics, such as the shelter availability and the composition of the substratum, were apparently unrelated to the structure of fish assemblages on patch reefs. For sites on contiguous reef, multiple regression models explained a significant proportion of spatial variation in the population density of 10 site-attached and vagile species (including 90% of variation in the density of Pomacentrus moluccensis, a site-attached damselfish). For patch-reef sites, models of spatial variation in population density were significant for six species, five of which were not site attached. The overall pattern across most species was that patch-reef models were characterized by a reduced r(2) relative to corresponding models of contiguous-reef populations, but the reduction was substantially less for vagile species than for site-attached species.
   Ordination analysis of temporal variability in community structure over two years suggested that none of the fish communities at the sites examined was in a consistent state of community succession. For most sites, community structure varied randomly over time, although at some sites, the structure of resident fish communities tended towards a stable position in multivariate community space. Across all sites, temporal change in community structure was significantly higher during periods of recruitment than at other times of the year, although there was little evidence to suggest that recruitment was the sole source of temporal variation. At most sites, the structure of fish assemblages fluctuated considerably during nonrecruitment periods. Patterns of temporal variation in the population density of four site-attached species indicated that population increases corresponding with pulses of recruitment were modified by postsettlement processes. For site-attached and moderately vagile species, overall temporal variability in assemblage structure increased significantly as sites became smaller and more isolated. Temporal variability in assemblages of highly vagile species was unrelated to survey area and connectivity.
   Overall, the results of the analyses of spatial and temporal variability in fish community structure suggest that species' vagility and reef connectivity strongly influence the relative importance of recruitment and postrecruitment processes in determining local population density. Individuals of highly vagile species are able to move among isolated patches in response to habitat preferences or resource availability. Conversely, the continuous shelter provided by contiguous reef may allow sedentary species to migrate to more favorable areas. We suggest that for many fish species, including vagile species on patchy reef and site-attached species on contiguous reef, patterns in distribution and abundance established at recruitment are modified by postsettlement migration, which enhances the relationship between population density and habitat structure. Thus, while recruitment patterns may explain much of the spatial and temporal variation in populations of site-attached fish on small, isolated patch reefs, this result cannot necessarily be extrapolated to fish communities inhabiting large sections of contiguous reef.

AB The effects of three intensities of shading in combination with drought on the growth and morphology of pedunculate oak and beech seedlings were studied in a pot experiment. The two species responded similarly to shading, but had different reactions to drought. Shading reduced growth, increased partitioning to stem and branches, increased leaf area and reduced partitioning to fine roots. Drought reduced growth, decreased partitioning to leaves and increased partitioning to fine root biomass. In beech, drought increased the diameter of fine roots; the increased partitioning to these roots did not increase fine root length. In oak, drought combined with high light resulted in less partitioning to stem and branches and increased partitioning to coarse roots.

AB Spatial planning has to deal with trade-offs between various stakeholders' wishes and needs as part of planning and management of landscapes, natural resources and/or biodiversity. To make ecosystem services (ES) trade-off research more relevant for spatial planning, we propose an analytical framework, which puts stakeholders, their land-use/management choices, their impact on ES and responses at the centre. Based on 24 cases from around the world, we used this framing to analyse the appearance and diversity of real-world ES trade-offs. They cover a wide range of trade-offs related to ecosystem use, including: land-use change, management regimes, technical versus nature-based solutions, natural resource use, and management of species. The ES trade-offs studied featured a complexity that was far greater than what is often described in the ES literature. Influential users and context setters are at the core of the trade-off decision-making, but most of the impact is felt by non-influential users. Provisioning and cultural ES were the most targeted in the studied trade-offs, but regulating ES were the most impacted. Stakeholders' characteristics, such as influence, impact faced, and concerns can partially explain their position and response in relation to trade-offs. Based on the research findings, we formulate recommendations for spatial planning. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fine-root traits play key roles in ecosystem processes, but the drivers of fine-root trait diversity remain poorly understood. The plant economic spectrum ( PES) hypothesis predicts that leaf and root traits evolved in coordination. Mycorrhizal association type, plant growth form and climate may also affect root traits. However, the extent to which these controls are confounded with phylogenetic structuring remains unclear.
   Here we compiled information about root and leaf traits for >600 species. Using phylogenetic relatedness, climatic ranges, growth form and mycorrhizal associations, we quantified the importance of these factors in the global distribution of fine-root traits.
   Phylogenetic structuring accounts for most of the variation for all traits excepting root tissue density, with root diameter and nitrogen concentration showing the strongest phylogenetic signal and specific root length showing intermediate values. Climate was the second most important factor, whereas mycorrhizal type had little effect. Substantial trait coordination occurred between leaves and roots, but the strength varied between growth forms and clades.
   Our analyses provide evidence that the integration of roots and leaves in the PES requires better accounting of the variation in traits across phylogenetic clades. Inclusion of phylogenetic information provides a powerful framework for predictions of belowground functional traits at global scales.

AB There is a multitude of ecosystem service classifications available within the literature, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. Elements of them have been used to tailor a generic ecosystem service classification for the marine environment and then for a case study site within the North Sea: the Dogger Bank. Indicators for each of the ecosystem services, deemed relevant to the case study site, were identified. Each indicator was then assessed against a set of agreed criteria to ensure its relevance and applicability to environmental management. This paper identifies the need to distinguish between indicators of ecosystem services that are entirely ecological in nature (and largely reveal the potential of an ecosystem to provide ecosystem services), indicators for the ecological processes contributing to the delivery of these services, and indicators of benefits that reveal the realized human use or enjoyment of an ecosystem service. It highlights some of the difficulties faced in selecting meaningful indicators, such as problems of specificity, spatial disconnect and the considerable uncertainty about marine species, habitats and the processes, functions and services they contribute to.

AB Because soil is expected to be a major sink for engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) released to the environment, the effects of ENPs on soil processes and the organisms that carry them out should be understood. DNA-based fingerprinting analyses have shown that ENPs alter soil bacterial communities, but specific taxon changes remain unknown. We used bar-coded pyrosequencing to explore the responses of diverse bacterial taxa to two widely used ENPs, nano-TiO2 and nano-ZnO, at various doses (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg g(-1) soil for TiO2; 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mg g(-1) soil for ZnO) in incubated soil microcosms. These ENPs significantly altered the bacterial communities in a dose-dependent manner, with some taxa increasing as a proportion of the community, but more taxa decreasing, indicating that effects mostly reduced diversity. Some of the declining taxa are known to be associated with nitrogen fixation (Rhizobiales, Bradyrhizobiaceae, and Bradyrhizobium) and methane oxidation (Methylobacteriaceae), while some positively impacted taxa are known to be associated with the decomposition of recalcitrant organic pollutants (Sphingomonadaceae) and biopolymers including protein (Streptomycetaceae and Streptomyces), indicating potential consequences to ecosystem-scale processes. The latter was suggested by a positive correlation between protease activity and the relative abundance of Streptomycetaceae (R = 0.49, P = 0.000) and Streptomyces (R = 0.47, P = 0.000). Our results demonstrate that some metal oxide nanoparticles could affect soil bacterial communities and associated processes through effects on susceptible, narrow-function bacterial taxa.

AB Captive breeding has become an important tool in species conservation programmes. Current management strategies for ex situ populations are based on theoretical models, which have mainly been tested in model species or assessed using studbook data. During recent years an increasing number of molecular genetic studies have been published on captive populations of several endangered species. However, a comprehensive analysis of these studies is still outstanding. Here, we present a review of the published literature on ex situ conservation genetics with a focus on molecular studies. We analysed 188 publications which either presented empirical studies using molecular markers (105), studbook analyses (26), theoretical work (38), or tested the genetic effects of management strategies using model species (19). The results show that inbreeding can be minimized by a thorough management of captive populations. There seems to be a minimum number of founders (15) and a minimum size of a captive population (100) necessary in order to minimize a loss of genetic diversity. Optimally, the founders should be unrelated and new founders should be integrated into the captive population successively. We recommend that genetic analyses should generally precede and accompany ex situ conservation projects in order to avoid inbreeding and outbreeding depression. Furthermore, many of the published studies do not provide all the relevant parameters (founder size, captive population size, H-o, H-e, inbreeding coefficients). We, therefore, propose that a general standard for the presentation of genetic studies should be established, which would allow integration of the data into a global database.

AB Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have gained wide use in humans and model species and are becoming the marker of choice for applications in other species. Technology that was developed for work in model species may provide useful tools for SNP discovery and genotyping in non-model organisms. However, SNP discovery can be expensive, labour intensive, and introduce ascertainment bias. In addition, the most efficient approaches to SNP discovery will depend on the research questions that the markers are to resolve as well as the focal species. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of several past and recent technologies for SNP discovery and genotyping and summarize a variety of SNP discovery and genotyping studies in ecology and evolution.

AB 1. Compared to bioclimatic variables, remote sensing predictors are rarely used for predictive species modelling. When used, the predictors represent typically habitat classifications or filters rather than gradual spectral, surface or biophysical properties. Consequently, the full potential of remotely sensed predictors for modelling the spatial distribution of species remains unexplored. Here we analysed the partial contributions of remotely sensed and climatic predictor sets to explain and predict the distribution of 19 tree species in Utah. We also tested how these partial contributions were related to characteristics such as successional types or species traits.
   2. We developed two spatial predictor sets of remotely sensed and topo-climatic variables to explain the distribution of tree species. We used variation partitioning techniques applied to generalized linear models to explore the combined and partial predictive powers of the two predictor sets. Non-parametric tests were used to explore the relationships between the partial model contributions of both predictor sets and species characteristics.
   3. More than 60% of the variation explained by the models represented contributions by one of the two partial predictor sets alone, with topo-climatic variables outperforming the remotely sensed predictors. However, the partial models derived from only remotely sensed predictors still provided high model accuracies, indicating a significant correlation between climate and remote sensing variables. The overall accuracy of the models was high, but small sample sizes had a strong effect on cross-validated accuracies for rare species.
   4. Models of early successional and broadleaf species benefited significantly more from adding remotely sensed predictors than did late seral and needleleaf species. The core-satellite species types differed significantly with respect to overall model accuracies. Models of satellite and urban species, both with low prevalence, benefited more from use of remotely sensed predictors than did the more frequent core species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. If carefully prepared, remotely sensed variables are useful additional predictors for the spatial distribution of trees. Major improvements resulted for deciduous, early successional, satellite and rare species. The ability to improve model accuracy for species having markedly different life history strategies is a crucial step for assessing effects of global change.

AB Drawing on our experience in establishing marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Roviana and Vonavona Lagoons, New Georgia, Solomon Islands, this paper shows how a geographical information system (GIS) database can be used to incorporate socio-spatial information, such as indigenous knowledge and artisanal fishing data, along with biophysical and other information to assist in MPA design. We argue that converting peoples' knowledge and socioecological behavior into geo-spatial data allows researchers to formulate hypotheses regarding human responses to inter- and intra-habitat variability, along with other marine ecological processes, and help in the designing and implementation of resource management strategies in a cost-effective and participatory way, bridging the gap between indigenous and Western cognitions of seascapes. More generally, we show the significance of combining spatial tools, anthropological fieldwork, and social and natural science methods for studying artisanal fisheries with the goal of aiding the design of marine protected areas.

AB The effects of land-use history on plant species richness were studied in mesic semi-natural grasslands in SW Finland. Using generalized additive models, we studied the total number of species, number of species of dry and mesic grasslands and number of rare species of dry and mesic grasslands of 162 grazed or abandoned grassland patches. We studied only grasslands that had remained totally or mostly treeless despite of abandonment. Increase of solar radiation was positively correlated with all three richness variables. Increasing cover of trees had a negative effect on the total species richness and that of rare grassland species. Total species richness and richness of grassland species declined with increasing time after abandonment, but richness of rare species did not show a similar response. The results emphasize the importance of high solar radiation, grazing and tow cover of trees for plant species richness in mesic semi-natural grasslands in northern Europe. According to our results the increase in the cover of trees after the end of grazing may be more detrimental to grassland plants than the lack of grazing per se. (c) 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Despite recent advances in the identification of genetic population structure through molecular-marker technology, the definition of intraspecific units for conservation remains problematic, particularly when genetic or phenotypic variation is continuously distributed in geographic space. We show that spatial autocorrelation analysis, applied to phenotypic or molecular data, can be used to describe the geographic structure and therefore can help define optimum strategies for conserving genetic variability within species. We propose that the intercept of a spatial correlogram can be an indication of the minimum distance between samples that can conserve and assess genetic diversity with maximum efficiency at lower costs. This parameter can be used both to define units and to establish sampling strategies for conservation programs. We illustrate the utility of this approach by autocorrelation analyses applied to three data sets: isozyme variability among Eugenia dysenterica populations in Brazilian Cerrado and within populations of Adenophora glandiflora in Korea, and microsatellite variation among Ursus arctos populations in North America. Our results suggest that the intercept of spatial correlograms is a useful parameter for establishing operational units for intraspecific conservation in continuous populations, based on overall genetic or phenotypic variability, by defining the minimum geographic distance at which samples are independent.

AB While the mutualistic interaction between plants and AM fungi is of obvious importance to ecosystem processes, the factors influencing the ecological and evolutionary dynamics within this interaction are poorly understood. The mutual interdependence of plant and AM fungal relative growth rates could generate complex dynamics in which the composition of the AM fungal community changes due to association with host and this change in fungal composition then differentially feeds back on plant growth. I first review evidence for feedback dynamics and then present an approach to evaluating such complex dynamics. I specifically present evidence of host-specific differences in the population growth rates of AM fungi. Pure cultures of AM fungi were mixed to produce the initial fungal community. This community was then distributed into replicate pots and grown with one of four co-occurring plant species. Distinct compositions of AM fungal spores were produced on different host species. The AM fungal communities were then inoculated back onto their own host species and grown for a second growing season. The differentiation observed in the first generation was enhanced during this second generation, verifying that the measure of spore composition reflects host-specific differences in AM fungal population growth rates. In further work on this system, I have found evidence of negative feedback through two pairs of plant species. The dynamic within the AM fungal community can thereby contribute to the coexistence of plant species.

AB Gas exchange experiments were performed with 13 plant species that differ from each other in growth-form and natural habitat. These comprised three herbaceous species, two ferns, two temperate deciduous trees, five rainforest trees and one liana from wet tropical forest, The aims were to investigate whether plants of similar growth-form and from similar habitats tended to respond similarly to a change in leaf-to-air vapour pressure difference (VPD), and to compare their ratio of intercellular to ambient partial pressures of CO2 for given conditions. Leaves were subjected to a step change in VPD and the initial and final steady rates of transpiration were used to calculate an index of sensitivity, phi, which enabled comparison of species. The results suggest that species of similar growth-form and habitat respond similarly to increasing VPD, with the temperate deciduous trees undergoing a greater reduction in stomatal conductance than the herbaceous plants in well-watered soil, Also, for these experimental conditions, the ratio of leaf internal to ambient CO2 partial pressure (p(i)/p(a)), was positively correlated with both CO2 assimilation rate and stomatal insensitivity to VPD, across the 13 species. The results are discussed in terms of growth strategies and possible advantages and limitations of hydraulic systems in different plants.

AB We ran the terrestrial ecosystem model (TEM) for the globe at 0.5 degrees resolution for atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 340 and 680 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to evaluate global and regional responses of net primary production (NPP) and carbon storage to elevated CO2 for their sensitivity to changes in vegetation nitrogen concentration. At 340 ppmv, TEM estimated global NPP of 49.0 10(15) g (Pg) C yr(-1) and global total carbon storage of 1701.8 Pg C; the estimate of total carbon storage does not include the carbon content of inert soil organic matter. For the reference simulation in which doubled atmospheric CO2 was accompanied with no change in vegetation nitrogen concentration, global NPP increased 4.1 Pg C yr(-1) (8.3%), and global total carbon storage increased 114.2 Pg C. To examine sensitivity in the global responses of NPP and carbon storage to decreases in the nitrogen concentration of vegetation, we compared doubled CO2 responses of the reference TEM to simulations in which the vegetation nitrogen concentration was reduced without influencing decomposition dynamics (''lower N'' simulations) and to simulations in which reductions in vegetation nitrogen concentration influence decomposition dynamics (''lower N+D'' simulations). We conducted three lower N simulations and three lower N+D simulations in which we reduced the nitrogen concentration of vegetation by 7.5, 15.0, and 22.5%. In the lower N simulations, the response of global NPP to doubled atmospheric CO2 increased approximately 2 Pg C yr(-1) for each incremental 7.5% reduction in vegetation nitrogen concentration, and vegetation carbon increased approximately an additional 40 Pg C, and soil carbon increased an additional 30 Pg C, for a total carbon storage increase of approximately 70 Pg C. In the lower N+D simulations, the responses of NPP and vegetation carbon storage were relatively insensitive to differences in the reduction of nitrogen concentration, but soil carbon storage showed a large change. The insensitivity of NPP in the N+D simulations occurred because potential enhancements in NPP associated with reduced vegetation nitrogen concentration were approximately offset by lower nitrogen availability associated with the decomposition dynamics of reduced litter nitrogen concentration. For each 7.5% reduction in vegetation nitrogen concentration, soil carbon increased approximately an additional 60 Pg C, while vegetation carbon storage increased by only approximately 5 Pg C. As the reduction in vegetation nitrogen concentration gets greater in the lower N+D simulations, more of the additional carbon storage tends to become concentrated in the north temperate-boreal region in comparison to the tropics. Other studies with TEM show that elevated CO2 more than offsets the effects of climate change to cause increased carbon storage. The results of this study indicate that carbon storage would be enhanced by the influence of changes in plant nitrogen concentration on carbon assimilation and decomposition rates. Thus changes in vegetation nitrogen concentration may have important implications for the ability of the terrestrial biosphere to mitigate increases in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 and climate changes associated with the increases.

AB Responses of individual leaves to short-term changes in CO2 partial pressure have been relatively well studied. Whole-plant and plant community responses to elevated CO2 are less well understood and scaling up from leaves to canopies will be complicated if feedbacks at the small scale differ from feedbacks at the large scale. Mathematical models of leaf, canopy, and ecosystem processes are important tools in the study of effects on plants and ecosystems of global environmental change, and in particular increasing atmospheric CO2, and might be used to scale from leaves to canopies. Models are also important in assessing effects of the biosphere on the atmosphere. Presently, multilayer and big leaf models of canopy photosynthesis and energy exchange exist. Big leaf models - which are advocated here as being applicable to the evaluation of impacts of 'global change' on the biosphere - simplify much of the underlying leaf-level physics, physiology, and biochemistry, yet can retain the important features of plant-environment interactions with respect to leaf CO2 exchange processes and are able to make useful, quantitative predictions of canopy and community responses to environmental change. The basis of some big leaf models of photosynthesis, including a new model described herein, is that photosynthetic capacity and activity are scaled vertically within a canopy (by plants themselves) to match approximately the vertical profile of PPFD. The new big leaf model combines physically based models of leaf and canopy level transport processes with a biochemically based model of CO2 assimilation. Predictions made by the model are consistent with canopy CO2 exchange measurements, although a need exists for further testing of this and other canopy physiology models with independent measurements of canopy mass and energy exchange at the time scale of 1 h or less.

AB Spatial and temporal patterns of recruitment are described for young-of-year of nine species of rockfish (Scorpaenidae, genus Sebastes) in a giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C.Ag. forest off central California, USA. Through all nine species recruited during or soon after the months of maximum coastal upwelling, variation in timing of peak recruitment among species corresponded to the sequential parturition of pelagic larvae. Recruits of each rockfish species exhibited strong and significantly distinct habitat selection based on substratum type and relief, algal type, and vertical position in the water column. To determine the effect of habitat structure on the distribution and abundance of recruits, observations of habitat selection were made within an unmanipulated M. pyrifera forest and compared to sites where the presence of M. pyrifera was altered. Whereas variation in substratum type can contribute to spatial patterns of rockfish recruitment, the temporal dynamics of algal abundance, especially M. pyrifera, may strongly influence temporal, as well as spatial variability of rockfish recruitment. These results indicate that the structural composition of a reef, particularly the occurrence of M. pyrifera, strongly influences the magnitude and species composition of local recruitment of this rockfish assemblage.

AB The South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is a devastating pest currently threatening the global tomato industry worldwide. In the last 10 years, it has spread and expanded to most of Europe, Africa and Asia, causing extensive damage to the crop itself and to the international tomato trade. With the aim of providing an overview of the current knowledge on this pest, we have briefly reviewed the available literature relying on its spread, quarantine, modeling and management. Finally, we have underlined the gaps in knowledge and provided several recommendations on how to achieve sustainable control as well as how to prevent further spread into unaffected areas.

AB It has long been recognized that certain sites within a protein, such as sites in the protein core or catalytic residues in enzymes, are evolutionarily more conserved than other sites. However, our understanding of rate variation among sites remains surprisingly limited. Recent progress to address this includes the development of a wide array of reliable methods to estimate site-specific substitution rates from sequence alignments. In addition, several molecular traits have been identified that correlate with site-specific mutation rates, and novel mechanistic biophysical models have been proposed to explain the observed correlations. Nonetheless, current models explain, at best, approximately 60% of the observed variance, highlighting the limitations of current methods and models and the need for new research directions.

AB Although tropical forests account for only a fraction of the planet's terrestrial surface, they exchange more carbon dioxide with the atmosphere than any other biome on Earth, and thus play a disproportionate role in the global climate. In the next 20 years, the tropics will experience unprecedented warming, yet there is exceedingly high uncertainty about their potential responses to this imminent climatic change. Here, we prioritize research approaches given both funding and logistical constraints in order to resolve major uncertainties about how tropical forests function and also to improve predictive capacity of earth system models. We investigate overall model uncertainty of tropical latitudes and explore the scientific benefits and inevitable trade-offs inherent in large-scale manipulative field experiments. With a Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 analysis, we found that model variability in projected net ecosystem production was nearly 3 times greater in the tropics than for any other latitude. Through a review of the most current literature, we concluded that manipulative warming experiments are vital to accurately predict future tropical forest carbon balance, and we further recommend the establishment of a network of comparable studies spanning gradients of precipitation, edaphic qualities, plant types, and/or land use change. We provide arguments for long-term, single-factor warming experiments that incorporate warming of the most biogeochemically active ecosystem components (i.e. leaves, roots, soil microbes). Hypothesis testing of underlying mechanisms should be a priority, along with improving model parameterization and constraints. No single tropical forest is representative of all tropical forests; therefore logistical feasibility should be the most important consideration for locating large-scale manipulative experiments. Above all, we advocate for multi-faceted research programs, and we offer arguments for what we consider the most powerful and urgent way forward in order to improve our understanding of tropical forest responses to climate change.

AB Over half of the world's forests are disturbed, and the rate at which ecosystem processes recover after disturbance is important for the services these forests can provide. We analyze the drivers' underlying changes in rates of key ecosystem processes (biomass productivity, litter productivity, actual litter decomposition, and potential litter decomposition) during secondary succession after shifting cultivation in wet tropical forest of Mexico.
   We test the importance of three alternative drivers of ecosystem processes: vegetation biomass (vegetation quantity hypothesis), community-weighted trait mean (mass ratio hypothesis), and functional diversity (niche complementarity hypothesis) using structural equation modeling. This allows us to infer the relative importance of different mechanisms underlying ecosystem process recovery.
   Ecosystem process rates changed during succession, and the strongest driver was aboveground biomass for each of the processes. Productivity of aboveground stem biomass and leaf litter as well as actual litter decomposition increased with initial standing vegetation biomass, whereas potential litter decomposition decreased with standing biomass. Additionally, biomass productivity was positively affected by community-weighted mean of specific leaf area, and potential decomposition was positively affected by functional divergence, and negatively by community-weighted mean of leaf dry matter content.
   Our empirical results show that functional diversity and community-weighted means are of secondary importance for explaining changes in ecosystem process rates during tropical forest succession. Instead, simply, the amount of vegetation in a site is the major driver of changes, perhaps because there is a steep biomass buildup during succession that overrides more subtle effects of community functional properties on ecosystem processes. We recommend future studies in the field of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning to separate the effects of vegetation quality (community-weighted mean trait values and functional diversity) from those of vegetation quantity (biomass) on ecosystem processes and services.

AB Tropical tree communities are shaped by local-scale habitat heterogeneity in the form of topographic and edaphic variation, but the life-history stage at which habitat associations develop remains poorly understood. This is due, in part, to the fact that previous studies have not accounted for the widely disparate sample sizes (number of stems) that result when trees are divided into size classes. We demonstrate that the observed habitat structuring of a community is directly related to the number of individuals in the community. We then compare the relative importance of habitat heterogeneity to tree community structure for saplings, juveniles and adult trees within seven large (24-50 ha) tropical forest dynamics plots while controlling for sample size. Changes in habitat structuring through tree life stages were small and inconsistent among life stages and study sites. Where found, these differences were an order of magnitude smaller than the findings of previous studies that did not control for sample size. Moreover, community structure and composition were very similar among tree sub-communities of different life stages. We conclude that the structure of these tropical tree communities is established by the time trees are large enough to be included in the census (1 cm diameter at breast height), which indicates that habitat filtering occurs during earlier life stages.

AB Spatial scaling and determinism of the wide-scale distribution of macroorganism diversity has been largely demonstrated over a century. For microorganisms, and especially for soil bacteria, this fundamental question requires more thorough investigation, as little information has been reported to date. Here by applying the taxa-area relationship to the largest spatially explicit soil sampling available in France (2,085 soils, area covered similar to 5.3 x 10(5) km(2)) and developing an innovative evaluation of the habitat-area relationship, we show that the turnover rate of bacterial diversity in soils on a wide scale is highly significant and strongly correlated with the turnover rate of soil habitat. As the diversity of micro-and macroorganisms appears to be driven by similar processes (dispersal and selection), maintaining diverse and spatially structured habitats is essential for soil biological patrimony and the resulting ecosystem services.

AB Drought- and insect-associated tree mortality at low-elevation ecotones is a widespread phenomenon but the underlying mechanisms are uncertain. Enhanced growth sensitivity to climate is widely observed among trees that die, indicating that a predisposing physiological mechanism(s) underlies tree mortality. We tested three, linked hypotheses regarding mortality using a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) elevation transect that experienced low-elevation mortality following prolonged drought. The hypotheses were: (1) mortality was associated with greater growth sensitivity to climate, (2) mortality was associated with greater sensitivity of gas exchange to climate, and (3) growth and gas exchange were correlated. Support for all three hypotheses would indicate that mortality results at least in part from gas exchange constraints. We assessed growth using basal area increment normalized by tree basal area [basal area increment (BAI)/basal area (BA)] to account for differences in tree size. Whole-crown gas exchange was indexed via estimates of the CO2 partial pressure difference between leaf and atmosphere (p(a)-p(c)) derived from tree ring carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13), corrected for temporal trends in atmospheric CO2 and delta C-13 and elevation trends in pressure. Trees that survived the drought exhibited strong correlations among and between BAI, BAI/BA, p(a)-p(c), and climate. In contrast, trees that died exhibited greater growth sensitivity to climate than trees that survived, no sensitivity of p(a)-p(c) to climate, and a steep relationship between p(a)-p(c) and BAI/BA. The p(a)-p(c) results are consistent with predictions from a theoretical hydraulic model, suggesting trees that died had a limited buffer between mean water availability during their lifespan and water availability during drought - i.e., chronic water stress. It appears that chronic water stress predisposed low-elevation trees to mortality during drought via constrained gas exchange. Continued intensification of drought in mid-latitude regions may drive increased mortality and ecotone shifts in temperate forests and woodlands.

AB Coral reef ecosystems are topographically complex environments and this structural heterogeneity influences the distribution, abundance and behavior of marine organisms. Airborne hydrographic lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) provides high resolution digital bathymetry from which topographic complexity can be quantified at multiple spatial scales. To assess the utility of lidar data as a predictor of fish and coral diversity and abundance, seven different morphometrics were applied to a 4 in resolution bathymetry grid and then quantified at multiple spatial scales (i.e., 15, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 300 in radii) using a circular moving window analysis. Predictive models for nineteen fish metrics and two coral metrics were developed using the new statistical learning technique of stochastic gradient boosting applied to regression trees. Predictive models explained 72% of the variance in herbivore biomass, 68% of parrotfish biomass, 65% of coral species richness and 64% of fish species richness. Slope of the slope (a measure of the magnitude of slope change) at relatively local spatial scales (15-100 in radii) emerged as the single best predictor. Herbivorous fish responded to topographic complexity at spatial scales of 15 and 25 in radii, whereas broader spatial scales of between 25 and 300 in radii were relevant for piscivorous fish. This study demonstrates great utility for lidar-derived bathymetry in the future development of benthic habitat maps and faunal distribution maps to Support ecosystem-based management and marine spatial planning.

AB Bottom trawling has widespread impacts on benthic communities and habitats. While the direct impacts of trawl disturbances on benthic communities have been extensively studied, the consequences from long-term chronic disturbances are less well understood. The response of benthic macrofauna to chronic otter-trawl disturbance from a Nephrops norvegicus (Norway lobster) fishery was investigated along a gradient of fishing intensity over a muddy fishing ground in the northeastern Irish Sea. Chronic otter trawling had a significant, negative effect on benthic infauna abundance, biomass, and species richness. Benthic epifauna abundance and species richness also showed a significant, negative response, while no such effect was evident for epibenthic biomass. Furthermore, chronic trawl disturbance led to clear changes in community composition of benthic infauna and epifauna. The results presented indicate that otter-trawl impacts are cumulative and can lead to profound changes in benthic communities, which may have far-reaching implications for the integrity of marine food webs. Studies investigating the short-term effects of fishing manipulations previously concluded that otter trawling on muddy substrates had only modest effects on the benthic biota. Hence, the results presented by this study highlight that data from experimental studies can not be readily extrapolated to an ecosystem level and that subtle cumulative effects may only become apparent when fishing disturbances are examined over larger spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, this study shows that data on chronic effects of bottom trawling on the benthos will be vital in informing the recently advocated move toward an ecosystem approach in fisheries management. As bottom-trawl fisheries are expanding into ever deeper muddy habitats, the results presented here are an important step toward understanding the global ecosystem effects of bottom trawling.

AB Four distinct phylogeographical patterns across Southeast Asia were observed for four species of seahorse (genus Hippocampus) with differing ecologies. For all species, genetic differentiation (based on cytochrome b sequence comparisons) was significantly associated with sample site (Phi(ST) = 0.190-0.810, P < 0.0001) and with geographical distance (Mantel's r = 0.37-0.59, P < 0.019). Geographic locations of genetic breaks were inconsistent across species in 7/10 comparisons, although some similarities across species were also observed. The two shallow-water species (Hippocampus barbouri and Hippocampus kuda) have colonized the Sunda Shelf to a lesser degree than the two deeper-water species (Hippocampus spinosissimus and Hippocampus trimaculatus). In all species the presence of geographically restricted haplotypes in the Philippines could indicate past population fragmentation and/or long-distance colonization. A nested clade analysis (NCA) revealed that long-distance colonization and/or fragmentation were likely the dominant forces that structure populations of the two shallow-water species, whereas range expansion and restricted dispersal with isolation by distance were proportionally more important in the history of the two deeper-water species. H. trimaculatus has the most widespread haplotypes [average clade distance (D-c) of nonsingleton haplotypes = 1169 km], indicating potentially high dispersal capabilities, whereas H. barbouri has the least widespread haplotypes (average D-c = 67 km) indicating potentially lower dispersal capabilities. Pleistocene separation of marine basins and postglacial flooding of the Sunda Shelf are extrinsic factors likely to have contributed to the phylogeographical structure observed, whereas differences among the species appear to reflect their individual ecologies.

AB In soybean and common bean, enhanced topsoil foraging permitted by shallow root architectures is advantageous for phosphorus acquisition from stratified soils. The importance of this phenomenon in graminaceous crops, which have different root architecture and morphology from legumes, is unclear. In this study we evaluated the importance of shallow roots for phosphorus acquisition in maize (Zea mays L.). In a field study, maize genotypes with shallower roots had greater growth in low phosphorus soil than deep-rooted genotypes. For physiological analysis, four maize genotypes differing in root shallowness in the field were grown in solid media with stratified phosphorus availability in a controlled environment. Of the four genotypes, one shallow and one deep genotype were also inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM). Shallower genotypes had significantly greater growth and phosphorus accumulation compared with deeper genotypes at low phosphorus availability. Mycorrhizal colonisation altered root shallowness under low phosphorus conditions, increasing shallowness substantially in a deep-rooted genotype but slightly decreasing shallowness in a shallow-rooted genotype. Mycorrhizal colonisation increased phosphorus acquisition under low phosphorus availability. Respiration costs of roots and shoots of phosphorus-efficient genotypes were significantly lower under low phosphorus conditions compared with inefficient genotypes. The physiological efficiency of phosphorus acquisition, expressed as root respiration per unit of phosphorus acquisition, was greater in shallow rooted genotypes. Our results demonstrate that genetic variation for root shallowness exists in maize, that phosphorus and AM can modulate root shallowness independently, and that a shallower root system is beneficial for plant performance in maize at low phosphorus availability. We propose that root architectural traits that enhance topsoil foraging are important traits for improved phosphorus acquisition efficiency of annual grain crops such as maize in addition to legumes.

AB The maintenance of female polyandry has traditionally been attributed to the material (direct) benefits derived from male mating resources (e.g. nuptial gifts) accrued by multiple mating. However, genetic (indirect) benefits offer a more robust explanation since only polyandrous, not monandrous, females may gain both material benefits from multiple mating and genetic benefits from multiple sires. Discriminating between material and genetic benefits is essential when addressing the mechanism by which polyandry is adaptively maintained, but are difficult to disentangle because they affect fitness in similar ways. To test the hypothesis that genetic benefits maintain polyandry, we compared four components of fitness (longevity, fecundity, hatching success and survivorship) between monandrous and polyandrous females in the ground cricket, Allonemobius socius. We discovered that females derived nongenetic benefits from mating multiply, in that the magnitude of the nuptial gift was positively, associated with the number of eggs produced. However, polyandrous females had over a two-fold greater hatching success and a 43% greater offspring survivorship, leading to a significantly higher relative fitness than the monandrous strategy. These results were independent of the confounding effects of material benefits, implying that genetic contributions play a large role in the maintenance of polyandry and potentially in the antagonistic coevolutionary relationship between polyandry and male nuptial gifts.

AB I consider how the study of genetic variation has influenced efforts to conserve natural populations over the last 50years. Studies with allozymes in the 1970s provided the first estimates of the amount of genetic variation within and between natural populations at multiple loci. These early studies played an important role in developing plans to conserve species. The description of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA in the early 1980s laid the foundation for the field of phylogeography, which provided a deeper look in time of the relationships and connectivity among populations. The development of microsatellites in the 1990s provided much more powerful means to describe genetic variation at nuclear loci, including the ability to detect past bottlenecks and estimate current effective population size with a single temporal sample. In the 2000s, single nucleotide polymorphisms presented a cornucopia of loci that has greatly improved power to estimate genetic and population demographic parameters important for conservation. Today, population genomics presents the ability to detect regions of the genome that are affected by natural selection (e.g. local adaptation or inbreeding depression). In addition, the ability to genotype historical samples has provided power to understand how climate change and other anthropogenic phenomena have affected populations. Modern molecular techniques provide unprecedented power to understand genetic variation in natural populations. Nevertheless, application of this information requires sound understanding of population genetics theory. I believe that current training in conservation genetics focuses too much on the latest techniques and too little on understanding the conceptual basis which is needed to interpret these data and ask good questions.

AB 1. Plant leaf litter comprises the major common source of energy and nutrients in forested soil and freshwater ecosystems world-wide. However, despite the similarity of physical and biochemical processes, generalizations across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems regarding litter decomposition drivers remain elusive.
   2. We re-analysed data from a published field decomposition experiment conducted in two ecosystems (forest floors and streams) across five biomes (from the tropics to subarctic) with increasing decomposer community complexity (microbes, microbes and mesofauna, microbes and meso- and macrofauna).
   3. Using a wide litter quality gradient (15 litter combinations), we aimed to disentangle the roles of decomposer community complexity from that of leaf litter traits (18 traits encompassing four broad trait categories: nutrients, C quality, physical structure and stoichiometry) on litter C and N loss. Comparisons of decomposition drivers between ecosystems were evaluated across and within biomes.
   4. Differences in environmental conditions (e.g. climate, soil/water fertility) and litter nutrients - with a particular focus on Mg and Ca - across biomes were the major drivers of litter C loss in both ecosystems, but decomposer complexity also played a prominent role in streams. Within biomes, we observed consistent effects of litter nutrients and stoichiometry on litter C and N loss between ecosystems, but the effects of decomposer complexity differed between streams and forest floors in the temperate, Mediterranean and tropical biomes.
   5. Our results highlight that, beyond the litter traits commonly identified as controlling decomposition (e.g. C, N and lignin), micronutrients (e.g. Mg and Ca) can also play an important, and globally consistent, role in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In addition, in forest streams the complexity of decomposer communities had similar importance as litter traits for predicting litter C and N turnover across all five biomes.
   6. The identification of common drivers in our large-scale ecosystem comparison suggests a basis to develop common models across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems for C and N dynamics during decomposition. Future modelling efforts should account for the global similarities (litter micronutrient effects) and biome-level differences (contingent decomposer effects) found between ecosystems.

AB The dominance of "ecosystem services" as a guiding concept for environmental management - where it appears as a neutral, obvious, taken-for-granted concept - hides the fact that there are choices implicit in its framing and in its application. In other words, it is a highly political concept, and its utility depends on the arena in which it is used and what it is used for. Following a political ecology framework, and based on a literature review, bibliometric analyses, and brief examples from two tropical rainforest countries, this review investigates four moments in the construction and application of the ecosystem services idea: socio-historical (the emergence of the discourse), ontological (what knowledge does the concept allow?), scientific (difficulties in its practical application), and political (who wins, who loses?). We show how the concept is a boundary object with widespread appeal, trace the discursive and institutional context within which it gained traction, and argue that choices of scale, definition, and method in measuring ecosystem services frustrate its straightforward application. As a result, it is used in diverse ways by different interests to justify different kinds of interventions that at times might be totally opposed. In Madagascar, the ecosystem services ideals mainly used to justify forest conservation in ways open to critique for its neoliberalization of nature or disempowerment of communities. In contrast, in the Brazilian Amazon, the discourse of ecosystem services has served the agendas of traditional populations and family farm lobbies. Ecosystem services, as an idea and tool, are mobilized by diverse actors in real-life situations that lead to complex, regionally particular and fundamentally political outcomes.

AB China has the largest population and the longest urban development history in the world, with primitive cities first occurring along the Yellow River in northern China more than 4000 years ago. After a long period of stagnation during recent centuries, urbanization has revived again in China since the economic reform in 1978. Strongly influenced by national land use policy and the history of urbanization after 1949, China's urban ecology has gone through three development periods: the emergent period (1983-1989), the early growth period (1990-1999), and the rapid development period (2000-present). In this paper, we first provide a historical review of urbanization and urban ecology in China; based on this retrospective analysis, we further identify the main characteristics of, and missing links in, China's urban ecological research; and finally we suggest future research directions. The amount and scope of research in urban ecology and environment conducted in China since the 1980s are impressive. Not only did Chinese scholars import Western ideas to develop urban ecological science, but also they have promoted a holistic, use-inspired, transdisciplinary philosophy for studying and managing urban systems which has unique Chinese characteristics. After more than 5000 years of being predominantly agrarian, China is now urban, and will become only more urban in the future. This continued fast urbanization makes China a living laboratory for studying urbanization, and China's urban ecology seems poised to make strides in the coming decades. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Natural genetic variation in plant photosynthesis is a largely unexplored and as a result an underused genetic resource for crop improvement. Numerous studies show genetic variation in photosynthetic traits in both crop and wild species, and there is an increasingly detailed knowledge base concerning the interaction of photosynthetic phenotypes with their environment. The genetic factors that cause this variation remain largely unknown. Investigations into natural genetic variation in photosynthesis will provide insights into the genetic regulation of this complex trait. Such insights can be used to understand evolutionary processes that affect primary production, allow greater understanding of the genetic regulation of photosynthesis and ultimately increase the productivity of our crops.

AB Warming-induced release of CO2 from the large carbon (C) stores in arctic soils could accelerate climate change. However, declines in the response of soil respiration to warming in long-term experiments suggest that microbial activity acclimates to temperature, greatly reducing the potential for enhanced C losses. As reduced respiration rates with time could be equally caused by substrate depletion, evidence for thermal acclimation remains controversial. To overcome this problem, we carried out a cooling experiment with soils from arctic Sweden. If acclimation causes the reduction in soil respiration observed after experimental warming, then it should subsequently lead to an increase in respiration rates after cooling. We demonstrate that thermal acclimation did not occur following cooling. Rather, during the 90 days after cooling, a further reduction in the soil respiration rate was observed, which was only reversed by extended re-exposure to warmer temperatures. We conclude that over the time scale of a few weeks to months, warming-induced changes in the microbial community in arctic soils will amplify the instantaneous increase in the rates of CO2 production and thus enhance C losses potentially accelerating the rate of 21st century climate change.

AB An increased susceptibility to disease is one hypothesis explaining how inbreeding hastens extinction in island endemics and threatened species. Experimental studies show that disease resistance declines as inbreeding increases, but data from in situ wildlife systems are scarce. Genetic diversity increases with island size across the entire range of an extremely inbred Galapagos endemic bird, providing the context for a natural experiment examining the effects of inbreeding on disease susceptibility. Extremely inbred populations of Galapagos hawks had higher parasite abundances than relatively outbred populations. We found a significant island effect on constitutively produced natural antibody (NAb) levels and inbred populations generally harboured lower average and less variable NAb levels than relatively outbred populations. Furthermore, NAb levels explained abundance of amblyceran lice, which encounter the host immune system. This is the first study linking inbreeding, innate immunity and parasite load in an endemic, in situ wildlife population and provides a clear framework for assessment of disease risk in a Galapagos endemic.

AB Microevolution may determine both the safety and efficacy of classical biological control. Despite a growing body of literature, there are several key unanswered questions regarding the role of evolution in biological control: (1) How common is local adaptation of natural enemies to their hosts or the environment in the native range? How critical is it for success of biological control to find locally adapted agents for importation? (2) Does adaptive evolution following introductions play an important role in biological control? (3) Do introductions of biological control agents impose bottlenecks in population size that reduce genetic variation, and is reduced genetic variation associated with low fitness and poor performance? (4) How great is the risk of evolution of host range of biological control agents? (5) What is the risk of target pests evolving resistance to biological control agents? If pests evolve increased resistance, will biological control agents evolve mechanisms to overcome that resistance? Here, we review the four fundamental processes of microevolution, and discuss how they interact in the context of biological control. We discuss our current state of knowledge regarding the outstanding questions, highlight the types of experiments that can address them, and suggest ways to use microevolution to define risks, and enhance efficacy and safety of biological control.

AB A genetic study of the European tree frog, Hyla arborea, in Denmark was undertaken to examine the population structure on mainland Jutland and the island of Lolland after a period of reduction in suitable habitat and population sizes. The two regions have experienced the same rate of habitat loss but fragmentation has been more severe on Lolland. Genetic variation based on 12 polymorphic DNA microsatellites was analysed in 494 tree frogs sampled from two ponds in Jutland and 10 ponds on Lolland. A significant overall deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectations could be attributed to three ponds, all on Lolland. This was most probably caused by an inbreeding effect reducing fitness, which was supported by the observed significant negative correlation between larva survival and mean F-IS value and mean individual inbreeding coefficient. A significant reduction in genetic variation (bottleneck) was detected in most of the ponds on Lolland. Population-structure analysis suggested the existence of at least 11 genetically different populations, corresponding to most of the sampled population units. The results indicated that the populations were unique genetic units and could be used to illustrate the migration pattern between newly established ponds arisen either by natural colonization of tree frogs or by artificial introduction. A high degree of pond fidelity in the tree frogs was suggested. A severe fragmentation process reducing population size and fitness within some of the populations probably caused the significant reduction in genetic variation of tree frog populations on Lolland.

AB A paper recently published by Phillips et al. (1996) reported a molecular genetic study of all recognized subspecies of the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) and concluded from patterns of geographic variation in isozyme and mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment pattern data that three evolutionary species should be recognized in this group. We suggest that this paper is fundamentally flawed because it fails to present any species concept as a testable hypothesis. Data are collected in the absence of any conceptual framework for diagnosing species boundaries, so no criteria for acceptance or rejection of a preferred hypothesis are formulated, and species boundaries are determined in a nonrigorous, Post hoc manner. Further, the absence of specific criteria for species diagnosis in this case leads to flaws in sampling design, data collection, and data analysis. Because these design flaws are typical of many studies, ute briefly outline three different lineage-based operational species concepts (phylogenetic, concordance, and cohesion) and present an alternative interpretation of the Chelydra data, insofar as this is possible given the design limitations We conclude the following: (1) species status may not be warranted for the Central and South American taxa, (2) more-detailed analysis is warranted in the US population because distinct lineage may be obscured by poor lab technique or introgression of mtDNA, and (3) the Ecuadorean population may deserve species status based on fixed nuclear isozyme loci. We recommend the following procedures for implementation of lineage-based species concepts within a rigorous hypothesis testing framework. First, if an animal is to be sacrificed, proper care should be taken to utilize different tissues for multiple pass electrophoresis. This will unmask hidden heterogeneity and maximize the number of resolved loci. Second, when phylogenetic relationships are reconstructed with restriction fragment length polymorphism data, fragment data should be converted to site data to avoid uncertainties in homology. Finally, a proper sampling scheme should be designed to address the question of species status in terms of numbers of individuals, genetic loci, populations, and geographic regions.

AB Risk of larval mortality is a critical component of models and debates concerning the ecology and evolution of the differing reproductive characteristics exhibited by marine invertebrates. In these discussions, predation often is assumed to be a major source of larval mortality. Despite limited empirical support, most marine larvae are thought to be palatable and broadly susceptible to generalist predators. Previous studies of larval-planktivore interactions have focused primarily on larvae that typically feed, grow, and develop for weeks to months in the plankton. Such planktotrophic species commonly produce large numbers of small larvae that disperse over vast distances. In contrast, the nonfeeding lecithotrophic larvae from sessile invertebrates that brood are often large and conspicuous, lack morphological defenses, and have limited dispersal distances because they typically are competent to settle minutes to hours after spawning. Interactions between lecithotrophic larvae and consumers are not well studied. This has limited the ability of previous authors to test broad generalities about marine larvae.
   We show that brooded larvae of Caribbean sponges (11 species) and gorgonians (three species) as well as brooded larvae of temperate hydroids (two species) and a bryozoan are unpalatable to co-occurring fishes. In contrast, brooded larvae of temperate ascidians (three species), a temperate sponge, and Caribbean hard corals (three species) are readily consumed by fishes, as are larvae from four of six species of synchronous broadcast-spawning gorgonians from the Florida Keys. Frequencies of survivorship for larvae attacked and rejected by fishes were high and statistically indistinguishable from frequencies for unattacked control larvae. Frequency of metamorphosis (when it occurred) of rejected larvae never differed significantly from that of unattacked control larvae. Assays testing for larval vs. adult chemical defenses for five species with distasteful larvae showed that larvae of all five species were chemically distasteful to fishes whereas only three of five adult extracts deterred fish feeding. A comparison of larval palatability among chemically rich taxa showed that brooded larvae were significantly more likely to be unpalatable (86% of the species tested) than larvae of broadcasters (33%), and that palatable larvae were rarely released during the day (23%) while unpalatable larvae usually were (89%). Additionally, the frequency of bright coloration was high (60%) for unpalatable larvae and low (0%) for palatable larvae, suggesting that unpalatable larvae often may be aposematically colored. Results of this broad survey cast doubt on the widely accepted notion that virtually all marine larvae are suitable prey for most generalized planktivores.
   Among species that do not chemically or physically protect larvae against fishes, selection appears to favor the release of larvae at night, or the production of smaller more numerous offspring that grow and develop at sea as a way of escaping consumer-rich benthic habitats. Because distasteful larvae are not similarly constrained, distasteful species should exhibit reproductive and larval characteristics selected more by the fitness-related consequences of larval development mode and dispersal distance than by the necessity of avoiding benthic predators. Production of large larvae and retention of offspring in parental habitats that have proved to be suitable for growth and reproduction have both been proposed as advantageous, but these advantages often were assumed to be offset by losses due to increased larval apparency to fishes. This assumed trade-off is not mandatory because larvae can be defended chemically. Distasteful larvae tend to be conspicuous, localized dispersers that can co-occur with benthic fishes, and yet not be consumed.

AB Root production and turnover were studied using sequential core sampling and observations in permanent minirhizotrons in the field in three dry heathland stands dominated by the evergreen dwarfshrub Calluna vulgaris and the grasses Deschampsia flexuosa and Molinia caerulea, respectively. Root biomass production, estimated by core sampling, amounted to 160 (Calluna), 180 (Deschampsia) and 1380 (Molinia) g m-2 yr-1, respectively. Root biomass turnover rate in Calluna (0.64 yr-1) was lower compared with the grasses (Deschampsia: 0.96 yr-1: Molinia 1.68 yr-1).  Root length turnover rate was 0.75-0.77 yr-1 (Deschampsia) and 1.17-1.49 yr-1 (Molinia), respectively. No resorption of N and P from senescing roots was observed in either species. Input of organic N into the soil due to root turnover, estimated using the core sampling data, amounted to 1.8 g N m-2 yr-1 (Calluna). 1.7 g N m-2 yr-1 (Deschampsia) and 19.7 g N m-2 yr-1 (Molinia), respectively. The organic P input was 0.05, 0.07 and 0.55 g P m-2 yr-1, respectively. Using the minirhizotron turnover estimates these values were 20-22% (Deschampsia) and 11-30% (Molinia) lower.
   When the biomass turnover data were used, it appeared that in the Molinia stand root turnover contributed 67% to total litter production, 87% to total litter nitrogen loss and 84% to total litter phosphorus loss. For Calluna and Deschampsia these percentages were about three and two times lower, respectively.
   This study shows that (1) Root turnover is a key factor in ecosystem C, N, and P cycling: and that (2) The relative importance of root turnover differs between species.

AB Temporary rivers are increasingly common freshwater ecosystems, but there have been no global syntheses of their community patterns. In this study, we examined the responses of aquatic invertebrate communities to flow intermittence in 14 rivers from multiple biogeographic regions covering a wide range of flow intermittence and spatial arrangements of perennial and temporary reaches. Hydrological data were used to describe flow intermittence (FI, the proportion of the year without surface water) gradients. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the relationships between FI and community structure and composition. We also tested if communities at the most temporary sites were nested subsets of communities at the least temporary and perennial sites. Taxon richness decreased as FI increased and invertebrate communities became dominated by ubiquitous taxa. The number of resilient taxa (with high dispersal capacities) decreased with increased FI, whereas the number of resistant taxa (with adaptations to desiccation) was not related to FI. River-specific and river-averaged model comparisons indicated most FI-community relationships did not differ statistically among rivers. Community nestedness along FI gradients was detected in most rivers and there was little or no influence of the spatial arrangement of perennial and temporary reaches. These results indicate that FI is a primary driver of aquatic communities in temporary rivers, regardless of the biogeographic species pool. Community responses are largely due to resilience rather than resistance mechanisms. However, contrary to our expectations, resilience was not strongly influenced by spatial fragmentation patterns, suggesting that colonist sources other than adjacent perennial reaches were important.

AB A growing number of investigations have shown that remote sensing of foliar nitrogen (N) concentration in plant canopies can be achieved with imaging spectroscopy, or hyperspectral remote sensing, from satellite or airborne sensors. Development of this approach has been fueled by recognition that foliar N is related to a variety of ecological and biogeochemical processes, ranging from the spread of invasive species to the ecosystem effects of insect defoliation events to patterns of N cycling in forest soils. To date, most studies have focused on building site-specific foliar N detection algorithms applied to individual scenes or small landscapes that have been intensively characterized with local field Measurements. However, tire growing number of well-measured sites, combined with improvements in image data quality and processing methods provide all opportunity to begin seeking more general N detection methods that can be applied to a broader range of sites or to locations that lack intensive field measurements.
   Here, we combine data from several independent efforts in North America, Central America and Australia, to examine whether development of calibration methods to determine canopy nitrogen concentration across a wide range of forest ecosystems is possible. The analysis included data from 137 individual field plots within eight study sites for which imagery has been acquired from NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and/or Hyperion instruments. The combined dataset was used to evaluate site-specific calibration results as well as results obtained with data pooled across all sites. We evaluated the accuracy of results using plot- and site-level cross-validation wherein individual plots or entire sites were withheld and used as air independent validation of the resulting algorithms. In instances where all sites were represented in the calibration, canopy-level foliar N concentration was predicted to within 7-15% of the mean field-measured values indicating a strong potential for broadly applied foliar N detection. When whole sites were iteratively dropped from the calibration and predicted by remaining data, predictions were still significant, but less accurate (7-47% of mean canopy-level N concentration). This suggests that further development to include a wider range of ecosystems will be necessary before cross-site prediction accuracy approaches that seen in site-specific calibrations. Nevertheless, we view these results as promising, particularly given the potential value of foliar N estimates, even at a reduced level of confidence, at sites for which there is no possibility of conducting field data collections.

AB We address the impact of the ice age cycles on intraspecific cpDNA diversity, for the first time on the full circumboreal-circumarctic scale. The bird-dispersed bog bilberry (or arctic blueberry, Vaccinium uliginosum) is a key component of northern ecosystems and is here used to assess diversity in previously glaciated vs. unglaciated areas and the importance of Beringia as a refugium and source for interglacial expansion. Eighteen chloroplast DNA haplotypes were observed in and among 122 populations, grouping into three main lineages which probably diverged before, and thus were affected more or less independently by, all major glaciations. The boreal 'Amphi-Atlantic lineage' included one haplotype occurring throughout northern Europe and one occurring in eastern North America, suggesting expansion from at least two bottlenecked, glacial refugium populations. The boreal 'Beringian lineage' included seven haplotypes restricted to Beringia and the Pacific coast of USA. The 'Arctic-Alpine lineage' included nine haplotypes, one of them fully circumpolar. This lineage was unexpectedly diverse, also in previously glaciated areas, suggesting that it thrived on the vast tundras during the ice ages and recolonized deglaciated terrain over long distances. Its largest area of persistence during glaciations was probably situated in the north, stretching from Beringia and far into Eurasia, and it probably also survived the last glaciation in southern mountain ranges. Although Beringia apparently was important for the initial divergence and expansion of V. uliginosum as well as for continuous survival of both the Beringian and Arctic-Alpine lineages during all ice ages, this region played a minor role as a source for later interglacial expansions.

AB The olive fly, Bactrocera oleae, is the major pest of olives in most commercial olive-growing regions worldwide. The species is abundant in the Mediterranean basin and has been introduced recently into California and Mexico, creating problems for quarantine protection and international trade. Here, we use nuclear microsatellite markers and mitochondrial sequences to examine the history of olive fly range expansion and colonization. Sampled populations span the current distribution of the olive fly worldwide, including South and Central Africa, Pakistan, Mediterranean Europe and Middle East, California, and Mexico. The Pakistani populations appear to be genetically well differentiated from the remaining populations, though rooting the origins of the species is problematic. Genetic similarity and assignment tests cluster the remaining populations into two genetic groups - Africa and a group including the Mediterranean basin and the American region. That Africa, and not the Mediterranean, is the origin of flies infesting cultivated olive is supported by the significantly greater genetic diversity at microsatellite loci in Africa relative to the Mediterranean area. The results also indicate that the recent invasion of olive flies in the American region most likely originated from the Mediterranean area.

   COMPETITION; ECOLOGY; COMMUNITY; COMPLEMENTARITY; CONSEQUENCES
AB The number of studies examining how species diversity influences the productivity of ecosystems has increased dramatically in the past decade as concern about global loss of biodiversity has intensified. Research to date has greatly improved our understanding of how, when, and why species loss alters primary production in ecosystems. However, because experiments have been performed at rather small spatial and short temporal scales, it is unclear whether conclusions can be readily extrapolated to the broader scales at which natural communities are most likely to influence ecosystem functioning. Here we develop a simple patch-dynamics model to examine some of the scale-dependent and independent qualities of the diversity-productivity relationship. We first simulate a typical diversity-productivity experiment and show that the influence of species richness on productivity is temporally dynamic, growing stronger through successional time. This holds true irrespective of whether resource partitioning or a sampling effect is the underlying mechanism. We then increase the spatial scale of the simulation from individual patches to a region consisting of many patch types. Results suggest that the diversity-productivity relationship is not influenced by spatial scale per se, but that the mechanism producing the relationship can change from sampling effects within individual patches to resource partitioning across patch types composing the region. This change occurs even though model dynamics are the same at both scales, suggesting that sampling effects and resource partitioning can represent different descriptions of the same biological processes operating concurrently at differing scales of observation. Lastly, we incorporate regional processes of dispersal and disturbance into the model and show that these processes can amplify the effect of species richness on productivity, resulting in patterns not easily anticipated from experiments. We conclude that the relative control of community structure by local versus regional processes may be a primary determinant of the diversity-productivity relationship in natural ecosystems. Therefore, past experiments having focused only on local processes might not reflect patterns and processes underlying diversity-productivity relationships in communities where disturbance and dispersal regulate species biomasses.

AB Although it is often assumed that root dynamics are similar to leaf dynamics in relation to nutrient availability, this hypothesis is rarely tested. Using sequential soil coring and a decomposition experiment, patterns of fine-root (<2 mm diameter) biomass, belowground net primary productivity, and root turnover rates were examined over a l-yr period in three sites along a forest chronosequence in the Hawaiian Islands. These sites form a natural fertility gradient but have similar species composition, climate, and geology. The youngest site (300 yr old) was low in N availability, the oldest site (4.1 X 10(6) yr old) was low in P availability, and the intermediate-aged site (20 000 yr old) was higher in both N and P. The youngest and oldest sites also contained long-term fertilization plots that were fertilized with N or P, or were unfertilized (control).
   Along the natural fertility gradient, the oldest site generally differed from the other two sites; this site had the greatest standing stock of live root mass, the greatest root length density, the lowest belowground net primary productivity (BNPP), and the slowest root turnover rate. The 300-yr-old and 20 000-yr-old sites were similar in all of these variables, except that root turnover was slightly faster at the 300-yr-old site. The response of fine roots to fertilization was consistent with the response along the natural fertility gradient. Despite N limitation to aboveground growth at the 300-yr-old site, fertilization had small effects on root variables, with the only significant effects being a small increase in the standing stock of live root biomass in N-fertilized plots and an increase in root tissue P concentrations in P-fertilized plots. In contrast, fertilization at the 4.1 x 10(6) yr-old site altered root dynamics more than fertilization at the 300-yr-old site. In the P-fertilized plots, P concentrations increased, BNPP tended to be greater, and root turnover rates increased. These results suggest that root dynamics differ dramatically between ecosystems low in N and ecosystems low in P, even though each system is regarded as "infertile." N availability had a smaller effect on root dynamics than did P availability, suggesting that the simple dichotomy between fertile and infertile sites that is often evoked to explain plant characteristics may be unjustified.

AB Complete chloroplast 23S rRNA and psbA genes from five peridinin-containing dinoflagellates (Heterocapsa pygmaea, Heterocapsa niei, Heterocapsa rotundata, Amphidinium carterae, and Protocertium reticulatum) were amplified by PCR and sequenced; partial sequences were obtained from Thoracosphaera heimii and Scrippsiella trochoidea. Comparison with chloroplast 23S rRNA and psbA genes of other organisms shows that dinoflagellate chloroplast genes are the most divergent and rapidly evolving of all. Quartet puzzling, maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, neighbor joining, and LogDet trees were constructed. Intersite rate variation and invariant sites were allowed fur with quartet puzzling and neighbor joining. All psbA and 23S rRNA trees showed peridinin-containing dinoflagellate chloroplasts as monophyletic. In psbA trees they are related to those of chromists and red algae, In 23S rRNA trees, dinoflagellates are always the sisters of Sporozoa (apicomplexans); maximum likelihood analysis of Heterocapsa triqutera 16S rRNA also groups the dinoflagellate and sporozoan sequences, but the other methods were inconsistent. Thus, dinoflagellate chloroplasts may actually be related to sporozoan plastids, but the possibility of reproducible long-branch artifacts cannot be strongly ruled out. The results for all three genes lit the idea that dinoflagellate chloroplasts originated from red algae by a secondary endosymbiosis, possibly the same one as for chromists and Sporozoa. The marked disagreement between 16S rRNA trees using different phylogenetic algorithms indicates that this is a rather poor molecule fur elucidating overall chloroplast phylogeny. We discuss possible reasons why both plastid and mitochondrial genomes of alveolates (Dinozoa, Sporozoa and Ciliophora) have ultra-rapid substitution rates and a proneness to unique genomic rearrangements.

AB Incorporation of cover crops into cropping systems may contribute to a more efficient utilization of soil and fertilizer P by less P-efficient crops through exudation of P-mobilizing compounds by the roots of P-efficient plant species. The main objective of the present work was to test this hypothesis. First a method has been developed which allows the quantification of organic anion exudation from individual cluster roots formed by P-deficient white lupin (Lupinus albus L.). Lupin plants were grown in nutrient solution at 1 mu M P and in a low P loess in small rhizotrons. Organic anions exuded from intact plants grown in nutrient solution were collected from individual cluster roots and root tips sealed in small compartments by an anion-exchange resin placed in nylon bags (resin-bags). Succinate was the dominant organic anion exuded followed by citrate and malate. The mean of citrate exudation-rate was 0.06 pmol mm(-1) s(-1) with exudation highly dependent on the citrate concentration and on the age of the cluster roots. Exudates from cluster roots and root tips grown at the soil surface (rhizotron-grown plants) were collected using overlayered resin-agar (resin mixed with agar). Citrate exudation from cluster roots was 10 times higher than that from root tips. Fractionation of P in the cluster root rhizosphere-soil indicates that white lupin can mobilize P not only from the available and acid-soluble P, but also from the stable residual soil P fractions. In pot experiments with an acid luvisol derived from loess low in available P, growth of wheat was significantly improved when mixed-cropped with white lupin due to improved P uptake. Both in mixed culture and in rotation wheat could benefit from the P mobilization capacity of white lupin, supporting the hypothesis above. Nine tropical leguminous cover crops and maize were grown in a pot experiment using a luvisol from Northern Nigeria low in available P. All plant species derived most of their P from the resin and bicarbonate-extractable inorganic P. Organic P (P-o) accumulated particularly in the rhizosphere of all plant species. There was a significant negative correlation between the species-specific rhizosphere acid phosphatase activity and P-o accumulation. Growth and P uptake of maize grown in rotation after legumes were enhanced indicating that improved P nutrition was a contributing factor.

AB Patterns of habitat use established at settlement may be a primary determinant of the distribution of coral-reef fishes within and among habitats. However, due to the difficulty of observing fish larvae in the wild, the behaviour of individuals at settlement has rarely been observed. Here, we examined the behaviour at settlement of five species of damselfishes (family Pomacentridae) by conducting multi-choice experiments in large outdoor aquaria at Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Late-stage larvae that were competent to settle were collected using light traps and placed in large circular aquaria at night where they could choose to settle among live coral, dead branching coral, coral rubble and bare sand habitats. We examined patterns of habitat choice at settlement by larvae with no prior experience of the reef (naive larvae). The effect of experience in the reef environment on habitat preferences was then determined by studying the behaviour of juveniles collected soon after settlement and exposed to the same experimental protocol. We also examined the importance of interspecific interactions among late-stage larvae and interactions between newly settled juveniles and adults in determining patterns of habitat choice exhibited by larvae and newly settled juveniles. Late-stage larvae and newly settled juveniles made distinct habitat choices but the choices made varied widely among species. Chromis viridis (Cuvier) late-stage larvae selected live coral and always settled as a group. Post-settlement C. viridis also selected live coral but exhibited stronger schooling behaviour and moved around the aquaria more frequently than late-stage larvae. Pomacentrus moluccensis (Bleeker) consistently selected live coral and also preferentially selected habitats where conspecifics, either settlers or adults, were present. P. amboinensis (Bleeker) late-stage larvae preferentially selected both Live and dead standing coral habitats but avoided coral rubble. Post-settlement P. amboinensis selected live coral more frequently than late-stage larvae. P, coelestis (Jordan and Starks) late-stage larvae initially settled with equal frequency among the habitats presented but exhibited an increasing use of coral rubble and dead coral throughout the day. In contrast, early post-settlers always selected the coral rubble habitat with significantly greater frequency than other habitats. Therefore, experience on the reef may be associated with habitat preferences in P. coelestis. P. chrysurus settlers were distributed evenly among habitats due to agonistic interactions among individuals observed within hours of settling. Also, early post-settlement P. chrysurus avoided habitats containing adults. For the pomacentrids we tested, the patterns of habitat selection observed in our experiments were similar to the distribution of adults among habitats on the reef at Lizard Island. Also, interactions among individuals at settlement could explain the spacing of individuals within habitats. Therefore, precise selection of habitats at settlement and behaviour among conspecifics within hours of settling may have a major influence on the distribution of coral-reef fishes within and among habitats.

AB We investigated spatial and temporal variability in recruitment of coral reef fishes to St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, with the goal of assessing the importance of habitat and physical oceanographic processes in determining patterns of distribution at two spatial scales. Recruitment was monitored visually each month, using SCUBA, at sites spaced equally around the island and on transects within each site.
   Spatial patterns of distribution were consistent within seasons and between years at both spatial scales. Although recruitment showed a seasonal pattern, there were few interannual differences at any spatial scale. At the largest scale, recruitment varied significantly among sites around the island, and a unique pattern of distribution was observed. On the windward shore, recruitment ranged from high on the eastern (upcurrent) end to low on western end of the island. Recruitment showed the opposite pattern on the leeward shore, ranging from low on the eastern end to high on the western end.
   At the transect scale, certain features of the habitat significantly predicted recruitment density. None of the microhabitat features that predicted recruitment at the small scale could explain patterns of recruitment observed at the large scale. In contrast, physical processes affecting larval availability or transport were more important than habitat in determining the spatial patterns of recruitment at this scale.
   Thus, physical oceanographic processes: appeared to be responsible fur patterns of recruitment to the two shores of Sr. Croix, and to sites along those shores. Despite consistent patterns of recruitment to sites, habitat selection did nor appear to be important at the site scale. Once delivered to a site, however, settlers or new recruits distributed themselves based on habitat preferences.

AB AimTo synthesize the species distribution modelling (SDM) literature to inform which variables have been used in MaxEnt models for different taxa and to quantify how frequently they have been important for species' distributions.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe conducted a quantitative synthesis analysing the contribution of over 400 distinct environmental variables to 2040 MaxEnt SDMs for nearly 1900 species representing over 300 families. Environmental variables were grouped into 24 related factors and results were analysed by examining the frequency with which variables were found to be most important, the mean contribution of each variable (at various taxonomic levels), and using TrueSkill, a Bayesian skill rating system.
   ResultsPrecipitation, temperature, bathymetry, distance to water and habitat patch characteristics were the most important variables overall. Precipitation and temperature were analysed most frequently and one of these variables was often the most important predictor in the model (nearly 80% of models, when tested). Notably, distance to water was the most important variable in the highest proportion of models in which it was tested (42% of 225 models). For terrestrial species, precipitation, temperature and distance to water had the highest overall contributions, whereas for aquatic species, bathymetry, precipitation and temperature were most important.
   Main conclusionsOver all MaxEnt models published, the ability to discriminate occurrence from reference sites was high (average AUC=0.92). Much of this discriminatory ability was due to temperature and precipitation variables. Further, variability (temperature) and extremes (minimum precipitation) were the most predictive. More generally, the most commonly tested variables were not always the most predictive, with, for instance, distance to water' infrequently tested, but found to be very important when it was. Thus, the results from this study summarize the MaxEnt SDM literature, and can aid in variable selection by identifying underutilized, but potentially important variables, which could be incorporated in future modelling efforts.

AB While invasive plant species primarily occur in disturbed, high-resource environments, many species have invaded ecosystems characterized by low nutrient, water, and light availability. Species adapted to low-resource systems often display traits associated with resource conservation, such as slow growth, high tissue longevity, and resource-use efficiency. This contrasts with our general understanding of invasive species physiology derived primarily from studies in high-resource environments. These studies suggest that invasive species succeed through high resource acquisition. This review examines physiological and morphological traits of native and invasive species in low-resource environments. Existing data support the idea that species invading low-resource environments possess traits associated with resource acquisition, resource conservation or both. Disturbance and climate change are affecting resource availability in many ecosystems, and understanding physiological differences between native and invasive species may suggest ways to restore invaded ecosystems.

AB Under drought conditions, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi alter water relationships of plants and improve their resistance to drought. In a factorial greenhouse experiment, we tested the effects of the AM symbiosis and precipitation regime on the performance (growth, gas exchange, nutrient status and mycorrhizal responsiveness) of Boswellia papyrifera seedlings. A continuous precipitation regime was imitated by continuous watering of plants to field capacity every other day during 4 months, and irregular precipitation by pulsed watering of plants where watering was switched every 15 days during these 4 months, with 15 days of watering followed by 15 days without watering. There were significantly higher levels of AM colonization under irregular precipitation regime than under continuous precipitation. Mycorrhizal seedlings had higher biomass than control seedlings. Stomatal conductance and phosphorus mass fraction in shoot and root were also significantly higher for mycorrhizal seedlings. Mycorrhizal seedlings under irregular watering had the highest biomass. Both a larger leaf area and higher assimilation rates contributed to higher biomass. Under irregular watering, the water use efficiency increased in non-mycorrhizal seedlings through a reduction in transpiration, while in mycorrhizal seedlings irregular watering increased transpiration. Because assimilation rates increased even more, mycorrhizal seedlings achieved an even higher water use efficiency. Boswellia seedlings allocated almost all carbon to the storage root. Boswellia seedlings had higher mass fractions of N, P, and K in roots than in shoots. Irregular precipitation conditions apparently benefit Boswellia seedlings when they are mycorrhizal.

AB The phenotypic responses of functional traits in natural populations are driven by genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity. These two mechanisms enable trees to cope with rapid climate change. We studied two European temperate tree species (sessile oak and European beech), focusing on (i) in situ variations of leaf functional traits (morphological and physiological) along two altitudinal gradients and (ii) the extent to which these variations were under environmental and/or genetic control using a common garden experiment. For all traits, altitudinal trends tended to be highly consistent between species and transects. For both species, leaf mass per area displayed a positive linear correlation with altitude, whereas leaf size was negatively correlated with altitude. We also observed a significant increase in leaf physiological performance with increasing altitude: populations at high altitudes had higher maximum rates of assimilation, stomatal conductance and leaf nitrogen content than those at low altitudes. In the common garden experiment, genetic differentiation between populations accounted for 0-28% of total phenotypic variation. However, only two traits (leaf mass per area and nitrogen content) exhibited a significant cline. The combination of in situ and common garden experiments used here made it possible to demonstrate, for both species, a weaker effect of genetic variation than of variations in natural conditions, suggesting a strong effect of the environment on leaf functional traits. Finally, we demonstrated that intrapopulation variability was systematically higher than interpopulation variability, whatever the functional trait considered, indicating a high potential capacity to adapt to climate change.

AB P>1. Managing fire to achieve hazard reduction while providing for biodiversity conservation is complex in fire-prone regions. This challenge is exacerbated by limited understanding of post-fire changes in habitat and fuel attributes over time-scales commensurate with their development, and a paucity of empirical research integrating the effects of fire on these attributes.
   2. We used a 110-year post-fire chronosequence to investigate temporal development in habitat resources used by fauna, and fuels for fire in semi-arid Mallee vegetation, south-eastern Australia. Fire-history mapping previously limited investigation to 35 years post-fire. The patterns of temporal change over 110 years for 13 variables, representing key attributes of habitat and fuel, were explored using nonlinear mixed models and data from 549 sites.
   3. Most habitat and fuel attributes exhibited changes in abundance and rate of development over extended periods, emphasizing the importance of documenting post-fire dynamics over long time-frames. Further, developmental patterns were mostly nonlinear, indicating that a shorter temporal perspective (e.g. 20-30 years post-fire) may obscure, or provide an inaccurate understanding of, long-term changes.
   4. There were striking differences in the post-fire dynamics of some habitat and fuel attributes. Leaf litter and spinifex grass Triodia scariosa, which function as both habitat and fuel, increased rapidly after fire followed by a plateau or slow decline after 20-30 years. In contrast, live tree stems were not predicted to develop hollows until 40 years, after which time the density of live hollow-bearing stems, an important habitat feature, increased steadily.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Fire affects the development and abundance of resources over substantially longer periods than can be examined using fire-mapping based on satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that post-fire changes in mallee vegetation influence fire hazard and faunal habitat in different ways. Critically, the cover/abundance of most primary fuel sources did not increase substantially beyond around 30 years post-fire; whereas important habitat attributes changed in ways that affect faunal occurrence for over a century. Fire management must explicitly acknowledge the potential for fire to affect fauna and fuel differently, and for these effects to operate over time-frames that may extend well beyond current understanding.

AB The distributions of animal populations change and evolve through time. Migratory species exploit different habitats at different times of the year. Biotic and abiotic features that determine where a species lives vary due to natural and anthropogenic factors. This spatiotemporal variation needs to be accounted for in any modeling of species' distributions. In this paper we introduce a semiparametric model that provides a flexible framework for analyzing dynamic patterns of species occurrence and abundance from broad-scale survey data. The spatiotemporal exploratory model (STEM) adds essential spatiotemporal structure to existing techniques for developing species distribution models through a simple parametric structure without requiring a detailed understanding of the underlying dynamic processes. STEMs use a multi-scale strategy to differentiate between local and global-scale spatiotemporal structure. A user-specified species distribution model accounts for spatial and temporal patterning at the local level. These local patterns are then allowed to "scale up'' via ensemble averaging to larger scales. This makes STEMs especially well suited for exploring distributional dynamics arising from a variety of processes. Using data from eBird, an online citizen science bird-monitoring project, we demonstrate that monthly changes in distribution of a migratory species, the Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), can be more accurately described with a STEM than a conventional bagged decision tree model in which spatiotemporal structure has not been imposed. We also demonstrate that there is no loss of model predictive power when a STEM is used to describe a spatiotemporal distribution with very little spatiotemporal variation; the distribution of a nonmigratory species, the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis).

AB Photosynthetic leaf traits were determined for savanna and forest ecosystems in West Africa, spanning a large range in precipitation. Standardized major axis fits revealed important differences between our data and reported global relationships. Especially for sites in the drier areas, plants showed higher photosynthetic rates for a given N or P when compared with relationships from the global data set. The best multiple regression for the pooled data set estimated V-cmax and J(max) from N-DW and S. However, the best regression for different vegetation types varied, suggesting that the scaling of photosynthesis with leaf traits changed with vegetation types. A new model is presented representing independent constraints by N and P on photosynthesis, which can be evaluated with or without interactions with S. It assumes that limitation of photosynthesis will result from the least abundant nutrient, thereby being less sensitive to the allocation of the non-limiting nutrient to non-photosynthetic pools. The model predicts an optimum proportionality for N and P, which is distinct for V-cmax and J(max) and inversely proportional to S. Initial tests showed the model to predict V-cmax and J(max) successfully for other tropical forests characterized by a range of different foliar N and P concentrations.

AB Over the past 50 years, human beings have influenced ecosystems more rapidly than at any similar time in human history, drastically altering ecosystem functioning. Along with ecosystem transformation and degradation, a number of studies have addressed the functioning, assessment and management of ecosystems. The concept of ecosystem services has been developed in the scientific literature since the end of the 1970s. However, ecosystem service research has focused on certain service categories, ecosystem types, and geographical areas, while substantial knowledge gaps remain concerning several aspects. We assess the development and current status of ecosystem service research on the basis of publications collected from the Web of Science. The material consists of (1) articles (n = 353) from all the years included in the Web of Science down to the completion of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and (2) more recent articles (n = 687) published between 2006 and 2008. We also assess the importance of international processes, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Kyoto Protocol and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, as drivers of ecosystem service research. Finally, we identify future prospects and research needs concerning the assessment and management of ecosystem services.

AB Ecosystems can undergo large-scale changes in their states, known as catastrophic regime shifts, leading to substantial losses to services they provide to humans. These shifts occur rapidly and are difficult to predict. Several early warning signals of such transitions have recently been developed using simple models. These studies typically ignore spatial interactions, and the signal provided by these indicators may be ambiguous. We employ a simple model of collapse of vegetation in one and two spatial dimensions and show, using analytic and numerical studies, that increases in spatial variance and changes in spatial skewness occur as one approaches the threshold of vegetation collapse. We identify a novel feature, an increasing spatial variance in conjunction with a peaking of spatial skewness, as an unambiguous indicator of an impending regime shift. Once a signal has been detected, we show that a quick management action reducing the grazing activity is needed to prevent the collapse of vegetated state. Our results show that the difficulties in obtaining the accurate estimates of indicators arising due to lack of long temporal data can be alleviated when high-resolution spatially extended data are available. These results are shown to hold true independent of various details of model or different spatial dispersal kernels such as Gaussian or heavily fat tailed. This study suggests that spatial data and monitoring multiple indicators of regime shifts can play a key role in making reliable predictions on ecosystem stability and resilience.

AB Recent surveys of groundwater invertebrates (stygofauna) worldwide are yielding rich troves of biodiversity, with significant implications for invertebrate systematists and phylogeneticists as well as ecologists and groundwater managers. What is the ecological significance of this high biodiversity of invertebrates in some aquifers? How might it influence groundwater ecosystem services such as water purification or bioremediation? In terrestrial ecosystems, biodiversity is typically positively correlated with rates of ecosystem functions beneficial to humans (e. g. crop pollination). However, the links between biodiversity, ecosystem function, and ecosystem services in groundwater are unknown. In some aquifers, feeding, movement and excretion by diverse assemblages of stygofauna potentially enhance groundwater ecosystem services such as water purification, bioremediation and water infiltration. Further, as specific taxa apparently play 'keystone' roles in facilitating ecosystem services, declines in abundance or even their extinction have serious repercussions. One way to assess the functional significance of biodiversity is to identify 'ecosystem service providers', characterise their functional relationships, determine how service provision is affected by community structure and environmental variables, and measure the spatio-temporal scales over which these operate. Examples from Australian and New Zealand alluvial aquifers reveal knowledge gaps in understanding the functional importance of most stygofauna, hampering effective protection of currently undervalued groundwater ecosystem services.

AB Statistical methods for modelling plant species distributions are difficult to evaluate using field data because "truth" is unknown. Artificial data based on explicit theory can be used as "truth". Statistical models should be capable of recovering "truth" if they are to be useful when applied to field data. Use of artificial data in plant community ecology to evaluate statistical methods is reviewed. Two plant community theoretical models based on the continuum concept are identified for describing species responses, the Swan/ter Braak model (Gaussian symmetric unimodal responses) and the Ellenberg/Minchin model (skewed unimodal responses). Theory regarding both indirect and direct environmental gradients is used to simulate a realistic species/environment data set. The software package COMPAS with a restricted set of options is used to generate two types of data set: (1) direct, where species show typical responses to variables such as radiation and (2) indirect, where variables like aspect and slope which are related to radiation by complex environmental processes. An example of generalised linear models (GLM) and generalised additive models (GAM) applied to the artificial data sets by analysts unaware of truth is presented. The results are evaluated on the following criteria: correct selection of predictors; accurate description of response curves; prediction of abundance; and ecologically rational relationships. The potential impacts of differences in the skills of the analysts are discussed. Both GLM and GAM performed well with Gaussian responses and direct gradient predictors. GAM performed marginally better with the skewed response model and direct predictors. GAM performed consistently better than GLM with the indirect predictors. The main conclusion was that the ecological knowledge and statistical skills of the analysts were more important than the method used.

AB 1. The relative importance of regional species pools and local ecological processes in governing landscape variation in plant species diversity and productivity was evaluated in a Kansas grassland.
   2. We examined the impact of multispecies sowing treatments and experimental canopy disturbances on plant species diversity and ecosystem processes along a complex natural gradient of plant standing crop.
   3. Data collected 4 years after sowing showed that plant invasion and diversity were seed limited in unproductive sites, but microsite limited in productive sites. Effects of sowing on plant diversity along the natural landscape gradient were paralleled by significant effects of sowing on measures of local plant production and community resilience to disturbance.
   4. These results support the shifting limitations hypothesis (SLH) that landscape gradients in local plant diversity should reflect shifts in the major regulating factor, from species pools to local ecological processes, as one moves from sites of inherently low to inherently high productivity.
   5. Our findings also indicate that diversity at the level of the available propagule pool acts to constrain ecosystem productivity and stability by mediating local community assembly, by determining the availability of key species, and by governing opportunities for functional compensation within the community.
   6. In total, our results support an emerging view that community processes and ecosystem functions are dynamically linked and act reciprocally to constrain each other.

AB We synthesize the results of empirical studies of marine reserves to assess the potential benefits of protection for fish populations. Our meta-analyses demonstrate that the overall abundance of fishes inside reserves is, on average, 3.7 times higher than outside reserve boundaries. This enhancement is mainly a result of a significant increase in abundance of species that are the target of fisheries. Non-target species are equally abundant inside and outside reserves. Large-bodied species also respond more to protection, irrespective of their fishery status. Species within genera show great heterogeneity in their response to protection despite similarities in their life histories. Our study confirms that marine reserves benefit fish populations and highlights the need for monitoring prior to reserve establishment to provide more accurate, habitat-controlled studies of the effects of marine reserves on fish populations.

AB The cooling effect of blue-green space has been recognized as a promising approach to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI), while the quantitative role (threshold-size for cooling) is still uncertain. This paper aims to present the latest progress and controversies on the studies of the cooling effects of waterbodies, greenspaces, and parks. In order to do this research, international search engines were employed to systematically search peer-reviewed articles, including the cooling effect of blue-green space and threshold-size-based UHI mitigation studies. After that, the inductive analysis is used to analyze the relevant literature. We found that previous studies concentrated on the correlations between different landscape types, temperature variations and the quantification of cooling intensity, etc. However, threshold-size-based research has received less attention, which limits the ability to make specific recommendations for actionable planning and management - usingthe smallest blue-green space for the best cooling effect. The review also revealed the controversies over the effects of blue-green space size, shape, landscape composition and configuration on cooling effect. Besides, we pointed out that the uncertainties (i.e., the optimal proportion of blue-green space in a park) and the reasons of controversial results of the cooling effect need to be further investigated. We also suggested that more attention should be paid to quantify the contributions of local background climate and landscape characteristics to the cooling effect (threshold-size) of blue-green space. This review would give us a deeper understanding of the field and provide insights into actionable climate adaption planning.

AB Ecosystem services are substantial elements for human society. The central challenge to meet the human needs from ecosystems while sustain the Earth's life support systems makes it urgent to enhance efficient natural resource management for sustainable ecological and socioeconomic development. Trade-off analysis of ecosystem services can help to identify optimal decision points to balance the costs and benefits of the diverse human uses of ecosystems. In this sense, the aim of this paper is to provide key insights into ecosystem services trade-off analysis at different scales from a land use perspective, by comprehensively reviewing the trade-offs analysis tools and approaches that addressed in ecology, economics and other fields. The review will significantly contribute to future research on trade-off analysis to avoid inferior management options and offer a win-win solution based on comprehensive and efficient planning for interacting multiple ecosystem services.

AB The deep ocean is the largest and least-explored ecosystem on Earth, and a uniquely energy-poor environment. The distribution, drivers and origins of deep-sea biodiversity remain unknown at global scales(1-3). Here we analyse a database of more than 165,000 distribution records of Ophiuroidea (brittle stars), a dominant component of sea-floor fauna, and find patterns of biodiversity unlike known terrestrial or coastal marine realms. Both patterns and environmental predictors of deep-sea (2,000-6,500m) species richness fundamentally differ from those found in coastal (0-20 m), continental shelf (20-200 m), and upper-slope (200-2,000 m) waters. Continental shelf to upper-slope richness consistently peaks in tropical Indo-west Pacific and Caribbean (0-30 degrees) latitudes, and is well explained by variations in water temperature. In contrast, deep-sea species show maximum richness at higher latitudes (30-50 degrees), concentrated in areas of high carbon export flux and regions close to continental margins. We reconcile this structuring of oceanic biodiversity using a species-energy framework, with kinetic energy predicting shallow-water richness, while chemical energy (export productivity) and proximity to slope habitats drive deep-sea diversity. Our findings provide a global baseline for conservation efforts across the sea floor, and demonstrate that deep-sea ecosystems show a biodiversity pattern consistent with ecological theory, despite being different from other planetary-scale habitats.

AB We reviewed 219 papers and built an inventory of 532 items of ecological evidence on multiple stressor impacts in rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters, as well as groundwaters. Our review revealed that, despite the existence of a huge conceptual knowledge base in aquatic ecology, few studies actually provide quantitative evidence on multi-stress effects. Nutrient stress was involved in 71% to 98% of multi-stress situations in the three types of surface water environments, and in 42% of those in groundwaters. However, their impact manifested differently along the groundwater-river-lake-transitional-coastal continuum, mainly determined by the different hydro-morphological features of these ecosystems. The reviewed papers addressed two-stressor combinations most frequently (42%), corresponding with the actual status-quo of pressures acting on European surface waters as reported by the Member States in the WISE WFD Database (EEA, 2015). Across all biological groups analysed, higher explanatory power of the stress-effect models was discernible for lakes under multi-stressor compared to single stressor conditions, but generally lower for coastal and transitional waters. Across all aquatic environments, the explanatory power of stress-effect models for fish increased when multi-stressor conditions were taken into account in the analysis, qualifying this organism group as a useful indicator of multi-stress effects. In contrast, the explanatory power of models using benthic flora decreased under conditions of multiple stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Unlike most other biological species, humans can use cultural innovations to occupy a range of environments, raising the intriguing question of whether human migrations move relatively independently of habitat or show preferences for familiar ones. The Bantu expansion that swept out of West Central Africa beginning similar to 5,000 y ago is one of the most influential cultural events of its kind, eventually spreading over a vast geographical area a new way of life in which farming played an increasingly important role. We use a new dated phylogeny of similar to 400 Bantu languages to show that migrating Bantu-speaking populations did not expand from their ancestral homeland in a "random walk" but, rather, followed emerging savannah corridors, with rainforest habitats repeatedly imposing temporal barriers to movement. When populations did move from savannah into rainforest, rates of migration were slowed, delaying the occupation of the rainforest by on average 300 y, compared with similar migratory movements exclusively within savannah or within rainforest by established rainforest populations. Despite unmatched abilities to produce innovations culturally, unfamiliar habitats significantly alter the route and pace of human dispersals.

AB Biochar application to soils has potential to simultaneously improve soil fertility and store carbon to aid climate change mitigation. While many studies have shown positive effects on plant yields, much less is known about the synergies between biochar and plant growth promoting microbes, such as mycorrhizal fungi. We present the first evidence that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can use biochar as a physical growth matrix and nutrient source. We used monoxenic cultures of the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis in symbiosis with carrot roots. Using scanning electron microscopy we observed that AM fungal hyphae grow on and into two contrasting types of biochar particles, strongly attaching to inner and outer surfaces. Loading a nutrient-poor biochar surface with nutrients stimulated hyphal colonization. We labeled biochar surfaces with P-33 radiotracer and found that hyphal contact to the biochar surfaces permitted uptake of P-33 and its subsequent translocation to the associated host roots. Direct access of fungal hyphae to biochar surfaces resulted in six times more P-33 translocation to the host roots than in systems where a mesh prevented hyphal contact with the biochar.
   We conclude that AM fungal hyphae access microsites within biochar, that are too small for most plant roots to enter (<10 mu m), and can hence mediate plant phosphorus uptake from the biochar. Thus, combined management of biochar and AM fungi could contribute to sustainable soil and climate management by providing both a carbon-stable nutrient reservoir and a symbiont that facilitates nutrient uptake from it.

AB P>1. Central questions of behavioural and evolutionary ecology are what factors influence the reproductive success of dominant breeders and subordinate nonbreeders within animal societies? A complete understanding of any society requires that these questions be answered for all individuals.
   2. The clown anemonefish, Amphiprion percula, forms simple societies that live in close association with sea anemones, Heteractis magnifica. Here, we use data from a well-studied population of A. percula to determine the major predictors of reproductive success of dominant pairs in this species.
   3. We analyse the effect of multiple predictors on four components of reproductive success, using a relatively new technique from the field of statistical learning: boosted regression trees (BRTs). BRTs have the potential to model complex relationships in ways that give powerful insight.
   4. We show that the reproductive success of dominant pairs is unrelated to the presence, number or phenotype of nonbreeders. This is consistent with the observation that nonbreeders do not help or hinder breeders in any way, confirming and extending the results of a previous study.
   5. Primarily, reproductive success is negatively related to male growth and positively related to breeding experience. It is likely that these effects are interrelated because males that grow a lot have little breeding experience. These effects are indicative of a trade-off between male growth and parental investment.
   6. Secondarily, reproductive success is positively related to female growth and size. In this population, female size is positively related to group size and anemone size, also. These positive correlations among traits likely are caused by variation in site quality and are suggestive of a silver-spoon effect.
   7. Noteworthily, whereas reproductive success is positively related to female size, it is unrelated to male size. This observation provides support for the size advantage hypothesis for sex change: both individuals maximize their reproductive success when the larger individual adopts the female tactic.
   8. This study provides the most complete picture to date of the factors that predict the reproductive success of dominant pairs of clown anemonefish and illustrates the utility of BRTs for analysis of complex behavioural and evolutionary ecology data.

AB It is important to understand the relative effects of landscape habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and matrix quality on biodiversity, so that potential management options can be appropriately ranked. However, their effects and relative importance may change with the size of the landscape considered because the multiple (and potentially conflicting) ecological processes that are influenced by landscape structure occur at different spatial scales (e.g. dispersal, predation, foraging). We estimated the relative effects of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and matrix quality (measured as the amount of forest, the proportion of forest area contained in large core forests, and the density of roads respectively) on fragmentation-sensitive forest birds in southern Ontario, Canada using a range of landscape sizes (0.8-310 km2). We used three complementary statistical approaches to estimate relative effects of these correlated landscape factors - 1) multiple regression, 2) information theoretic (AIC) estimates of the most parsimonious model, and 3) multi-model inference to average effects across all supported models. We controlled for spatial autocorrelation, local habitat, roadside sampling bias, time of day, season, habitat heterogeneity, and the interaction between the effects of habitat amount and fragmentation. We found that relative effects of habitat amount and fragmentation were scale dependent; habitat amount had a consistently positive effect that was consistent over more than two orders of magnitude in landscape area (similar to 1-300 km2). In contrast, the effects of habitat fragmentation depended on the size of the landscape considered. Indeed, for veery Catharus fuscescens, habitat fragmentation had positive effects at one scale and negative effects at another. The effects of matrix quality were generally weak and changed little with scale. For the number of fragmentation sensitive species and the presence of veery, habitat amount was most important in large landscapes and habitat fragmentation in small landscapes but for the presence of ovenbird Seiurus aurocapilla, habitat amount was most important at all scales.

AB Understanding and predicting the distribution of organisms in heterogeneous environments lies at the heart of ecology. The spatial distribution of fish populations observed in the wild results from the complex interactions of multiple controls both external or internal to the fish populations. Whilst species distribution models (SDMs) have been mostly concerned with static description of species distribution as a function of environmental constraints, models of animal movements (MAMs) have focussed on the dynamic nature of spatial distribution of groups of individuals under a number of constraints external and internal to the population. Besides SDMs and MAMs, modelling the spatial distribution of fish populations can be achieved by models that are fundamentally static (like SDMs) but can also incorporate many hypotheses on the control of fish spatial distribution (like MAMs). The hypotheses underlying these models need to make sense at the population level - rather than at the individual or species level -we term these 'population distribution models' (PDMs). PDMs are statistical models that rely on several hypotheses, which include: (i) control through geographical attachment, (ii) environmental conditions, (iii) density-dependent habitat selection, (iv) spatial dependency, (v) population demographic structure, (vi) species interactions and (vii) population memory. We review the basis behind each of these conceptual models and we examine corresponding numerical applications. We argue that the conceptual models are complementary rather than competing, that existing numerical applications are still rarely compared and combined, and that PDMs can offer a statistical framework to achieve this. We recommend that the numerical models associated with different hypotheses be constructed within such a common general framework. This will permit evaluation, comparison and combination of the multiple hypotheses on fish spatial distribution. It will ultimately lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling the spatial distribution of fish populations and to more accurate predictions in which model uncertainty is accounted for.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied to predict the distribution of benthic species in the North Sea. An understanding of species distribution patterns is essential to gain insight into ecological processes in marine ecosystems and to guide ecosystem management strategies. Therefore, we compared 9 different SDM methods, including GLM, GBM, FDA, SVM, RF, MAXENT, BIOCLIM, GARP and MARS, by using 10 environmental variables to model the distribution of 20 marine benthic species. Most of the models showed good or very good performance in terms of predictive power and accuracy, with highest mean area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.845 and 0.840, obtained for the MAXENT and GBM models, respectively. The poorest performance was shown by the BIOCLIM model, which had a mean AUC of 0.708. Nevertheless, the mapped distribution patterns varied remarkably depending on the model used, with up to 32.5% differences in predictions between models. For species with a narrow distribution range, the models showed a better performance based on the AUC than for species with a broad distribution range, which can most likely be attributed to the restricted spatial scale and the model evaluation procedure. Of the environmental variables, bottom water temperature and depth had the greatest effect on the distribution of 14 benthic species, based on MAXENT results. We examine the potential utility of this strategy for predicting future distribution of benthic species in response to climate change.

AB Increasing numbers and speeds of vessels in areas with populations of cetaceans may have the cumulative effect of reducing habitat quality by increasing the underwater noise level. Here, we first use digital acoustic tags to demonstrate that free-ranging delphinids in a coastal deep-water habitat are subjected to varying and occasionally intense levels of vessel noise. Vessel noise and sound propagation measurements from. a shallow-water habitat are then used to model the potential impact of high sound levels from small vessels on delphinid communication in both shallow and deep habitats, with bottlenose dolphins Tursiops sp. and short-finned pilot whales Globicephala macrorhynchus as model organisms. We find that small vessels travelling at 5 knots in shallow water can reduce the communication range of bottlenose dolphins within 50 m by 26%. Pilot whales in a quieter deep-water habitat could suffer a reduction in their communication range of 58% caused by a vessel at similar range and speed. Increased cavitation noise at higher speeds drastically increases the impact on the communication range. Gear shifts generate high-level transient sounds (peak-peak source levels of up to 200 dB re 1 mu Pa) that may be audible over many kilometres and may disturb close-range animals. We conclude that noise from small vessels can significantly mask acoustically mediated communication in delphinids and contribute to the documented negative impacts on animal fitness.

AB Maximally selected statistics for the estimation of simple cutpoint models are embedded into a generalized conceptual framework based on conditional inference procedures. This powerful framework contains most of the published procedures in this area as special cases, such as maximally selected chi(2) and rank statistics, but also allows for direct construction of new test procedures for less standard test problems. As an application, a novel maximally selected rank statistic is derived from this framework for a censored response partitioned with respect to two ordered categorical covariates and potential interactions. This new test is employed to search for a high-risk group of rectal cancer patients treated with a neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Moreover, a new efficient algorithm for the evaluation of the asymptotic distribution for a large class of maximally selected statistics is given enabling the fast evaluation of a large number of cutpoints.

AB Phylogenies of major groups of insects based on both morphological and molecular data have sometimes been contentious, often lacking the data to distinguish between alternative views of relationships. This paucity of data is often due to real biological and historical causes, such as shortness of time spans between divergences for evolution to occur and long time spans after divergences for subsequent evolutionary changes to obscure the earlier ones. Another reason for difficulty in resolving some of the relationships using molecular data is the limited spectrum of genes so far developed for phylogeny estimation. For this latter issue, there is cause for current optimism owing to rapid increases in our knowledge of comparative genomics. At least some historical patterns of divergence may, however, continue to defy our attempts to completely reconstruct them with confidence, at least using current strategies.

AB Thirteen nursery colonies of Myotis myotis were sampled in central Europe to investigate the dispersal behaviour of this bat species. Mitochondrial DNA sequences of 260 bats reveal the occurrence of three evolutionary lineages that have probably originated in distinct glacial refugia and meet in a contact zone near the Alps. Moreover, the strong haplotypic segregation (Phi (ST) = 0.540) suggests that breeding females are philopatric. Contrastingly, the low population structure at 15 microsatellite loci (F-ST = 0.022), suggests the homogenizing effect of nuclear gene flow. The different perspectives given by these two markers are consistent with strong male-biased dispersal. As a result of female philopatry, the local haplotypic variability seems to be largely influenced by historical processes of colonization. Conversely, the homogeneity of nuclear variability within roosts that are located north of the Alps seems to mainly reflect contemporary gene flow. Finally, despite the fact that females are faithful to their natal colony, movements of both males and females occur outside the breeding period. Mitochondrial survey of individuals sampled exclusively in nurseries may thus poorly reflect the metapopulation dynamics of this species.

ID 3 TROPHIC LEVELS; PLANT NITROGEN; INSECT; FOOD; SURVIVAL; ACID
AB It is well known that secondary chemicals produced at one trophic level may affect organisms at subsequent levels of the food chain. Effects of nutrient supplements may also propagate through trophic levels, but the mechanisms here are less clear. We tested the hypothesis that predators can be affected by the nutrient composition of the prey's food. Wolf spider (Pardosa amentata) hatchlings were raised ad libitum on fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) that were cultured in poor basic medium with additions of different nutrients. These additions strongly affected the performance of the spiders. Growth rates increased when additions consisted of 19 different amino acids or fatty acids+cholesterol or commercial dogfood. Survival increased in spiders reared on fruit flies from cultures containing 19 amino acids or methionine or dogfood. The addition of dogfood increased spider growth and survival more significantly than the addition of any single nutrient group alone. Adult female flies from the dogfood culture were significantly heavier than females from the basic culture. The nutrients added to the fruit fly media were thus able to create biological effects at both the second and the third trophic levels. To test whether nutrients passed to the predators through the gut content of the prey, we included a treatment where the spiders were fed flies that had been starved for 48 h in order to empty their guts. Gut emptying of the flies did not reduce the positive effects of the enriched fruit fly media, i.e. the nutritional benefits were not due to nutrients that passed directly through the guts of the flies. Since the nutrients added to the fruit fly media were separated from the spiders that benefited from them by two trophic transformations, this phenomenon was a true tritrophic interaction.

AB Spatial variability in availability of resources that limit photosynthesis (water and N) leads to variation in rates of atmosphere-biosphere exchange.  N content and allocation are canopy properties that link ecosystem, physiological, and biophysical processes and that vary in space at scales relevant to atmosphere-biosphere interaction.  We studied landscape-scale variation in these and related canopy properties in Kansas Tallgrass Prairie (USA).  The tallgrass ecosystem was suited to this investigation because primary production in the prairie is constrained by N availability.  This work was designed to aid in interpretation and spatial extrapolation of gas exchange measurements made using aerodynamic techniques as part of FIFE (First ISLSCP Field Experiment), a NASA-supported study.  We collected data on spatial distribution of biomass, leaf area index (LAI), canopy N mass, N concentration ([N]), and gas exchange along topographic and management gradients.  We also measured height distribution of N, light interception, and gas exchange within canopies as a function of position in the landscape.  Substantial variation in biomass, LAI, N accumulation, and N allocation occurred over time, with topography, and as a result of previous burning.  The vertical gradient of [N] and photosynthetic capacity within canopies were correlated, in space and time, with biomass and canopy light interception.  The gradients were steeper in high biomass sites than in low biomass sites.  In addition, proportional N allocation to the upper layer increased with time (12% in June, 32% in August) as biomass increased.  As nutrient uptake increased within the tallgrass landscape, biomass increased and light limitation in the lower canopy was induced.  As this light limitation increased with increasing biomass, or with accumulation of dead vegetation, allocation of N to the upper canopy increased.  Height distribution of photosynthetic capacity paralleled within-canopy N allocation and light interception.  As resource ratios (light, water, and nitrogen) varied in the landscape, so did rates of gas exchange.  This work suggests that interactions between light extinction, N allocation, and photosynthesis that have been proposed for monospecific stands apply to the multispecies, but structurally simple, canopy of the tallgrass prairie.  Models of plant performance based on evolutionary arguments may provide a powerful basis for spatial extrapolation of atmosphere-ecosystem exchange rates from sites to landscapes and larger regions.

AB A large array of species distribution model (SDM) approaches has been developed for explaining and predicting the occurrences of individual species or species assemblages. Given the wealth of existing models, it is unclear which models perform best for interpolation or extrapolation of existing data sets, particularly when one is concerned with species assemblages. We compared the predictive performance of 33 variants of 15 widely applied and recently emerged SDMs in the context of multispecies data, including both joint SDMs that model multiple species together, and stacked SDMs that model each species individually combining the predictions afterward. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of these SDM approaches by examining their performance in predicting withheld empirical validation data of different sizes representing five different taxonomic groups, and for prediction tasks related to both interpolation and extrapolation. We measure predictive performance by 12 measures of accuracy, discrimination power, calibration, and precision of predictions, for the biological levels of species occurrence, species richness, and community composition. Our results show large variation among the models in their predictive performance, especially for communities comprising many species that are rare. The results do not reveal any major trade-offs among measures of model performance; the same models performed generally well in terms of accuracy, discrimination, and calibration, and for the biological levels of individual species, species richness, and community composition. In contrast, the models that gave the most precise predictions were not well calibrated, suggesting that poorly performing models can make overconfident predictions. However, none of the models performed well for all prediction tasks. As a general strategy, we therefore propose that researchers fit a small set of models showing complementary performance, and then apply a cross-validation procedure involving separate data to establish which of these models performs best for the goal of the study.

AB Heavy metal contamination is a serious problem worldwide threatening soil environment and human health. In the present study, concentrations of 6 heavy metals at an electronic waste (e-waste) site in Nigeria were correlated to their mobility, showing distinct distribution pattern between surface soils and subsoils. Proteobacteria, Finnicutes, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes dominated the indigenous soil microbial communities, and there was significant discrimination of bacterial taxonomic composition between the heavy metal contaminated and uncontaminated areas. The abundance of most bacterial taxa changed with heavy metal contamination level to different extent. The multivariate regression tree (MRT) analyses illustrated that main environmental variables influencing bacterial taxonomic composition included soil texture (31%) and organic carbon (14%), whereas microbial diversity was affected by soil pH (32%) and soil texture (14%). Our results surprisingly indicated that soil properties were more influential in determining soil bacterial composition and diversity than heavy metals even at the e-waste site which was seriously contaminated by heavy metals. The present study contributes to a deeper insight into the key environmental variables shaping the diversity and composition of soil microbes at heavy metal contaminated e-waste sites.

AB Dynamic ocean management, or management that uses near real-time data to guide the spatial distribution of commercial activities, is an emerging approach to balance ocean resource use and conservation. Employing a wide range of data types, dynamic ocean management can be used to meet multiple objectives for example, managing target quota, bycatch reduction, and reducing interactions with species of conservation concern. Here, we present several prominent examples of dynamic ocean management that highlight the utility, achievements, challenges, and potential of this approach. Regulatory frameworks and incentive structures, stakeholder participation, and technological applications that align with user capabilities are identified as key ingredients to support successful implementation. By addressing the variability inherent in ocean systems, dynamic ocean management represents a new approach to tackle the pressing challenges of managing a fluid and complex environment.

AB The factors that promote invasive behavior in introduced plant species occur across many scales of biological and ecological organization. Factors that act at relatively small scales, for example, the evolution of biological traits associated with invasiveness, scale up to shape species distributions among different climates and habitats, as well as other characteristics linked to invasion, such as attractiveness for cultivation (and by extension propagule pressure). To identify drivers of invasion it is therefore necessary to disentangle the contribution of multiple factors that are interdependent. To this end, we formulated a conceptual model describing the process of invasion of central European species into North America based on a sequence of drivers. We then used confirmatory path analysis to test whether the conceptual model is supported by a statistical model inferred from a comprehensive database containing 466 species. The path analysis revealed that naturalization of central European plants in North America, in terms of the number of North American regions invaded, most strongly depends on residence time in the invaded range and the number of habitats occupied by species in their native range. In addition to the confirmatory path analysis, we identified the effects of various biological traits on several important drivers of the conceptualized invasion process. The data supported a model that included indirect effects of biological traits on invasion via their effect on the number of native range habitats occupied and cultivation in the native range. For example, persistent seed banks and longer flowering periods are positively correlated with number of native habitats, while a stress-tolerant life strategy is negatively correlated with native range cultivation. However, the importance of the biological traits is nearly an order of magnitude less than that of the larger scale drivers and highly dependent on the invasion stage (traits were associated only with native range drivers). This suggests that future research should explicitly link biological traits to the different stages of invasion, and that a failure to consider residence time or characteristics of the native range may seriously overestimate the role of biological traits, which, in turn, may result in spurious predictions of plant invasiveness.

AB The rate of biological invasions is expected to increase as the effects of climate change on biological communities become widespread. Climate change enhances habitat disturbance which facilitates the establishment of invasive species, which in turn provides opportunities for hybridization and introgression. These effects influence local biodiversity that can be tracked through genetic and genomic approaches. Metabarcoding and metagenomic approaches provide a way of monitoring some types of communities under climate change for the appearance of invasives. Introgression and hybridization can be followed by the analysis of entire genomes so that rapidly changing areas of the genome are identified and instances of genetic pollution monitored. Genomic markers enable accurate tracking of invasive species' geographic origin well beyond what was previously possible. New genomic tools are promoting fresh insights into classic questions about invading organisms under climate change, such as the role of genetic variation, local adaptation and climate pre-adaptation in successful invasions. These tools are providing managers with often more effective means to identify potential threats, improve surveillance and assess impacts on communities. We provide a framework for the application of genomic techniques within a management context and also indicate some important limitations in what can be achieved.

AB Recent advances in population genomics have made it possible to detect previously unidentified structure, obtain more accurate estimates of demographic parameters, and explore adaptive divergence, potentially revolutionizing the way genetic data are used to manage wild populations. Here, we identified 10944 single-nucleotide polymorphisms using restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to explore population structure, demography, and adaptive divergence in five populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from western Alaska. Patterns of population structure were similar to those of past studies, but our ability to assign individuals back to their region of origin was greatly improved (>90% accuracy for all populations). We also calculated effective size with and without removing physically linked loci identified from a linkage map, a novel method for nonmodel organisms. Estimates of effective size were generally above 1000 and were biased downward when physically linked loci were not removed. Outlier tests based on genetic differentiation identified 733 loci and three genomic regions under putative selection. These markers and genomic regions are excellent candidates for future research and can be used to create high-resolution panels for genetic monitoring and population assignment. This work demonstrates the utility of genomic data to inform conservation in highly exploited species with shallow population structure.

AB Effective population size (N-e) controls both the rate of random genetic drift and the effectiveness of selection and migration, but it is difficult to estimate in nature. In particular, for species with overlapping generations, it is easier to estimate the effective number of breeders in one reproductive cycle (N-b) than N-e per generation. We empirically evaluated the relationship between life history and ratios of N-e, N-b and adult census size (N) using a recently developed model (AGENE) and published vital rates for 63 iteroparous animals and plants. N-b/N-e varied a surprising sixfold across species and, contrary to expectations, N-b was larger than N-e in over half the species. Up to two-thirds of the variance in N-b/N-e and up to half the variance in N-e/N was explained by just two life-history traits (age at maturity and adult lifespan) that have long interested both ecologists and evolutionary biologists. These results provide novel insights into, and demonstrate a close general linkage between, demographic and evolutionary processes across diverse taxa. For the first time, our results also make it possible to interpret rapidly accumulating estimates of N-b in the context of the rich body of evolutionary theory based on N-e per generation.

   ECOLOGICAL THEORY; RANDOM FORESTS; NICHE; POPULATION; GENERALITY;
   ABUNDANCE; TRANSFERABILITY
AB Distribution models are used to predict the likelihood of occurrence or abundance of a species at locations where census data are not available. An integral part of modelling is the testing of model performance. We compared different schemes and measures for testing model performance using 79 species from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The four testing schemes we compared featured increasing independence between test and training data: resubstitution, random data hold-out and two spatially segregated data hold-out designs. The different testing measures also addressed different levels of information content in the dependent variable: regression R2 for absolute abundance, squared correlation coefficient r2 for relative abundance and AUC/Somer's D for presence/absence. We found that higher levels of independence between test and training data lead to lower assessments of prediction accuracy. Even for data collected independently, spatial autocorrelation leads to dependence between random hold-out test data and training data, and thus to inflated measures of model performance. While there is a general awareness of the importance of autocorrelation to model building and hypothesis testing, its consequences via violation of independence between training and testing data have not been addressed systematically and comprehensively before. Furthermore, increasing information content (from correctly classifying presence/absence, to predicting relative abundance, to predicting absolute abundance) leads to decreasing predictive performance. The current tests for presence/absence distribution models are typically overly optimistic because a) the test and training data are not independent and b) the correct classification of presence/absence has a relatively low information content and thus capability to address ecological and conservation questions compared to a prediction of abundance. Meaningful evaluation of model performance requires testing on spatially independent data, if the intended application of the model is to predict into new geographic or climatic space, which arguably is the case for most applications of distribution models.

AB Recently, many new (extant) mammal species have been named, mostly by raising subspecies to species rank. This is primarily a consequence of the phylogenetic species concept (PSC) that has become very popular over the last few decades. We highlight several cases of splitting and argue that much of this taxonomic inflation is artificial due to shortcomings of the PSC and unjustified reliance on insufficient morphological and/or genetic data. We particularly discourage species splitting based on gene trees inferred from mitochondrial DNA only and phenetic analyses aimed at diagnosability. Uncritical acceptance of new species creates an unnecessary burden on the conservation of biodiversity. (C) 2012 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB The southern African marine realm is located at the transition zone between the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific biomes. Its biodiversity is particularly rich and comprises faunal and floral elements from the two major oceanic regions, as well as a large number of endemics. Within this realm, strikingly different biota occur in close geographic proximity to each other, and many; of the species with distributions spanning two or more of the region's marine biogeographic provinces are divided into evolutionary units that can often only be distinguished on the basis of genetic data. In this review, we describe the state of marine phylogeography in southern Africa, that is, the study of evolutionary relationships at the species level, or amongst closely related species, in relation to the region's marine environment. We focus particularly on coastal phylogeography, where much progress has recently been made in identifying phylogeographic breaks and explaining how they originated and are maintained. We also highlight numerous shortcomings that should be addressed in the near future. These include: the limited data available for commercially important organisms, particularly offshore species; the paucity of oceanographic data for nearshore areas; a dearth of studies based on multilocus data; and the fact that studying the role of diversifying selection in speciation has been limited to physiological approaches to the exclusion of genetics. It is becoming apparent that the southern African marine realm is one of the world's most interesting environments in which to study the evolutionary processes that shape not only regional, but also global patterns of marine biodiversity.

AB Although frequently referred to in the literature, the concept of cultural ecosystem services (CES) has so far been limited in its application. Difficulties arise when specifying the nature of intangible values, but more significantly when it comes to relating intangible values to ecosystem functions. After setting out some conceptual issues, this paper uses a case study on the German North Sea coast to illustrate ways of operationalising the concept in a marine context. Based on a survey of local residents, we first identify current CES in the sea and the intangible values associated with them. Seascape and place emerge as useful conceptual bridges linking ecosystem functioning outcomes to key CES values. We then relate this to offshore wind farming, which some residents perceive as a significant threat to certain CES. Although the approach presented increases the visibility of intangible ecosystem values, the problem remains that such assessments are temporal, in need of added calibration and do not automatically put intangibles on a par with market ecosystem value.

AB Unsupervised clustering algorithms, like the program Structure, are increasingly used to infer the presence of population structure from a sample of genotyped individuals. We evaluate the extent to which the presence of related individuals can lead such algorithms to the false inference that there is population structure. First, we demonstrate this problem using a real data set from a rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) population. Then we perform an extensive series of simulations involving the program Structure. Our simulations encompass both a simple scenario with fixed numbers of full- and half-siblings in the sample, and a more complicated scenario in which we investigate 360 combinations of population divergence, fraction of population sampled, variance in family size, mating system and number of loci. We find that the inclusion of family members in a sample may produce very strong evidence of population structure, even when population structure is absent. This problem becomes more pronounced when more loci are genotyped, and it is particularly likely in studies of monogamous species, especially if variance in family size is high and a large fraction of a small population has been sampled. Researchers working in such situations should test observed clusters for the presence of family members to distinguish family-induced structure from real population structure. Additionally, this work shows that Structure's ability to estimate the number of subpopulations may be influenced by a number of factors, and therefore should be interpreted guardedly.

AB Background: A central question in the evolutionary diversification of large, widespread, mobile mammals is how substantial differentiation can arise, particularly in the absence of topographic or habitat barriers to dispersal. All extant giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) are currently considered to represent a single species classified into multiple subspecies. However, geographic variation in traits such as pelage pattern is clearly evident across the range in sub-Saharan Africa and abrupt transition zones between different pelage types are typically not associated with extrinsic barriers to gene flow, suggesting reproductive isolation.
   Results: By analyzing mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear microsatellite loci, we show that there are at least six genealogically distinct lineages of giraffe in Africa, with little evidence of interbreeding between them. Some of these lineages appear to be maintained in the absence of contemporary barriers to gene flow, possibly by differences in reproductive timing or pelage-based assortative mating, suggesting that populations usually recognized as subspecies have a long history of reproductive isolation. Further, five of the six putative lineages also contain genetically discrete populations, yielding at least II genetically distinct populations.
   Conclusion: Such extreme genetic subdivision within a large vertebrate with high dispersal capabilities is unprecedented and exceeds that of any other large African mammal. Our results have significant implications for giraffe conservation, and imply separate in situ and ex situ management, not only of pelage morphs, but also of local populations.

AB Bioclimatic models are the primary tools for simulating the impact of climate change on species distributions. Part of the uncertainty in the output of these models results from uncertainty in projections of future climates. To account for this, studies often simulate species responses to climates predicted by more than one climate model and/or emission scenario. One area of uncertainty, however, has remained unexplored: internal climate model variability. By running a single climate model multiple times, but each time perturbing the initial state of the model slightly, different but equally valid realizations of climate will be produced. In this paper, we identify how ongoing improvements in climate models can be used to provide guidance for impacts studies. In doing so we provide the first assessment of the extent to which this internal climate model variability generates uncertainty in projections of future species distributions, compared with variability between climate models. We obtained data on 13 realizations from three climate models (three from CSIRO Mark2 v3.0, four from GISS AOM, and six from MIROC v3.2) for two time periods: current (1985-1995) and future (2025-2035). Initially, we compared the simulated values for each climate variable (P, T-max, T-min, and T-mean) for the current period to observed climate data. This showed that climates simulated by realizations from the same climate model were more similar to each other than to realizations from other models. However, when projected into the future, these realizations followed different trajectories and the values of climate variables differed considerably within and among climate models. These had pronounced effects on the projected distributions of nine Australian butterfly species when modelled using the BIOCLIM component of DIVA-GIS. Our results show that internal climate model variability can lead to substantial differences in the extent to which the future distributions of species are projected to change. These can be greater than differences resulting from between-climate model variability. Further, different conclusions regarding the vulnerability of species to climate change can be reached due to internal model variability. Clearly, several climate models, each represented by multiple realizations, are required if we are to adequately capture the range of uncertainty associated with projecting species distributions in the future.

AB The utilization of polychaetes in descriptive ecology is reviewed in the light of recent research especially concerning the biota hard bottom environments.
   Polychaetes, often linked in the past to the concept of opportunistic species able to proliferate after an increase in organic matter, have played an important role especially with regard to impacted soft-bottom habitats. Increased knowledge of the group, suggests that not only opportunistic species can be utilised as indicators. so that these organisms can be disengaged from the old concept of opportunistic taxa. Moreover, recent researches conducted on this group allowed demonstrating as surrogacy is not always applicable.
   Among polychaetes inhabiting hard bottom environment, the analysis of family Syllidae appears particularly promising. Studied conducted in our laboratory demonstrated as syllid species decrease in abundance or completely disappear under varying Sources of negative impact. The distribution of species also appeared indicative in underlying effects of marine protected areas (MPA) functioning, or in describing different climatic areas within biogeographical sectors.
   It is obvious that good results can only be obtained on the basis of good taxonomic resolution. We Suggested that, in monitoring studies, operational time Could be optimized not only by working at it higher-level on the whole invertebrate data set, but by also selecting a particularly indicative group and working at fine level.

AB A well-resolved rhizobial species phylogeny with 51 haplotypes was inferred from a combined atpD + recA data set using Bayesian inference with best-fit, gene-specific substitution models. Relatively dense taxon sampling for the genera Rhizobium and Mesorhizobium was achieved by generating atpD and recA sequences for six type and 24 reference strains not previously available in GenBank. This phylogeny was used to classify nine nodule isolates from Sesbania exasperata, S. punicea and S. sericea plants native to seasonally flooded areas of Venezuela, and compared with a PCR-RFLP analysis of rrs plus rrl genes and large maximum likelihood rrs and nifH phylogenies. We show that rrs phylogenies are particularly sensitive to strain choice due to the high levels of sequence mosaicism found at this locus. All analyses consistently identified the Sesbania isolates as Mesorhizobium plurifarium or Rhizobium huautlense. Host range experiments on ten legume species coupled with plasmid profiling uncovered potential novel biovarieties of both species. This study demonstrates the wide geographic and environmental distribution of M. plurifarium, that R. galegae and R. huautlense are sister lineages, and the synonymy of R. gallicum, R. mongolense and R. yanglingense. Complex and diverse phylogeographic, inheritance and host-association patterns were found for the symbiotic nifH locus. The results and the analytical approaches used herein are discussed in the context of rhizobial taxonomy and molecular systematics. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB In the Simpson Desert, central Australia, heavy rainfalls associated with the La Nina phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during 1999-2000 stimulated a pulse of primary productivity that prompted a rodent irruption during 2001, and subsequently an extensive wildfire in 2001-2002. More than 10,000 km 2 of spinifex habitat were burned. In this study we examine a time series of climatic variables, and small mammal and predator dynamics in the desert in 1999-2002; and a before-after-control- impact study investigating the effects of the wildfire on small mammals. Rodents showed a delayed numerical increase in response to rainfall, whereas terrestrial predators showed a delayed numerical increase in response to rodent density. These delayed responses suggest the existence of bottom-up trophic pathways. However, a reduction in primary productivity and increase in predators appeared to suppress rodent numbers in 2001-2002, indicating that bottom-up effects can be temporarily reversed in this system. Wildfire had negative impacts on the abundance of the desert mouse (Pseudomys desertor) and the overall richness of small mammal species. Several other species of small mammals also appeared to show brief negative responses to wildfire. The impacts of wildfire on small mammals appear attributable to a loss of habitat for spinifex-dependent species and increased exposure to predation in burned habitats. Because extensive wildfires can be predicted from patterns of rainfall and fuel accumulation, we recommend that land managers be proactive in recognizing and reducing conditions of fire hazard. We recommend that small-scale prescribed bums should be carried out to reduce the extent of wildfires and also increase the chance of maintaining potential refuges from predators. In addition, control of introduced predators during and after irruptions of rodents will be crucial to prevent predator-driven crashes of their populations and those of secondary prey species. ENSO-related climatic forecasts appear to be useful cues that can be incorporated into fire and predator management strategies in and Australia.

AB We sequenced 965 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b from 102 woodmice (Apodemus sylvaticus ) collected from 40 European localities. The aims of the study were to answer the following questions. (i) Did the Mediterranean peninsulas play a role as refuge for woodmice? (ii) Is genetic variability of A. sylvaticus higher in the Mediterranean region compared with northern Europe? (iii) Are the patterns of the postglacial colonization of Europe by woodmice similar to those presently recognized for other European species? The results provide a clear picture of the impact of the Quaternary glaciations on the genetic and geographical structure of the woodmouse. Our analyses indicate a higher genetic variability of woodmice in the Mediterranean peninsulas compared to northern Europe, suggesting a role of the former as refuge regions for this small mammal. An original pattern of postglacial colonization is proposed where the Iberian and southern France refuge populations colonized almost all European regions. The Sicilian population appears to be very differentiated and highly variable. This emphasizes the importance of this island as a 'hot spot' for the intraspecific genetic diversity of the woodmouse. Finally, woodmice in North Africa originated from southwestern Europe, most probably as a result of a recent anthropogenic introduction.

AB Despite that soils may be the greatest repository of biodiversity on Earth, and that most terrestrial ecosystem functions occur in the soil, research on the role of soil biodiversity in ecosystem function has lagged behind corresponding research on aboveground organisms. Soil organisms pose special problems to biodiversity-function research, including the fact that we usually do not know their identity nor what they do in soil ecosystems, cannot easily estimate their biodiversity, and cannot culture the majority of the organisms for use in manipulative experiments. We propose here that biological soil crusts (BSCs) of deserts and many other ecosystems may serve as a useful model system for diversity-function research because the species concept is relatively well-defined within BSC organisms, their functional attributes are relatively well-known, and estimation and manipulation of biodiversity in experiments are feasible, at least within some groups of BSC biota. In spite of these features, there is a pronounced lack of research on biodiversity-function using these organisms. At least two complementary approaches are possible: experiments using artificially-constructed BSCs, and observational studies which statistically control for the effects of other factors which are likely to covary with biodiversity. We applied the latter to four observational datasets collected at multiple spatial scales in Spain and the United States using structural equation models or path analysis using ecosystem function indicators relating to hydrology, trapping and retention of soil resources, and nutrient cycling. We found that, even when total BSC abundance and key environmental gradients are controlled for, direct and approximately linear relationships between species richness and/or evenness and indicators of ecosystem functioning were common. Such relationships appear to vary independently of region or spatial scale, but their strength seems to differ in every dataset. Functional group richness did not seem to adequately capture biodiversity-function relationships, suggesting that bryophyte and lichen components of BSC may exhibit low redundancy. More research employing the multi-trophic, multi-functional, and manipulable BSC system may enable more rapid understanding of the consequences of biodiversity loss in soils, and help enable a biodiversity-function theory that is pertinent to the numerous ecosystem services provided by soil organisms.

AB The increasing use of molecular tools to study populations of clonal organisms leads us to question whether the low polymorphism found in many studies reflects limited genetic diversity in populations or the limitations of the markers used. Here we used microsatellite datasets for two sea grass species to provide a combinatory statistic, combined with a likelihood approach to estimate the probability of identical multilocus genotypes (MLGs) to be shared by distinct individuals, in order to ascertain the efficiency of the markers used and to optimize cost-efficiently the choice of markers to use for deriving unbiased estimates of genetic diversity. These results strongly indicate that conclusions from studies on clonal organisms derived using markers showing low polymorphism, including microsatellites, should be reassessed using appropriate polymorphic markers.

AB 1. Dwarf stands of the mangrove Rhizophora mangle L. are extensive in the Caribbean. We fertilized dwarf trees in Almirante Bay, Bocas del Toro Province, north-eastern Panama with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to determine (1) if growth limitations are due to nutrient deficiency; and (2) what morphological and/or physiological factors underlie nutrient limitations to growth.
   2. Shoot growth was 10-fold when fertilized with P and twofold with N fertilization, indicating that stunted growth of these mangroves is partially due to nutrient deficiency.
   3. Growth enhancements caused by N or P enrichment could not be attributed to increases in photosynthesis on a leaf area basis, although photosynthetic nutrient-use efficiency was improved. The most dramatic effect was on stem hydraulic conductance, which was increased sixfold by P and 2.5-fold with N enrichment. Fertilization with P enhanced leaf and stem P concentrations and reduced C : N ratio, but did not alter leaf damage by herbivores.
   4. Our findings indicate that addition of N and P significantly alter tree growth and internal nutrient dynamics of mangroves at Bocas del Toro, but also that the magnitude, pattern and mechanisms of change will be differentially affected by each nutrient.

AB Phylogenetic relationships among 17 extant species of Murinae, with special reference to the genus Apodemus, were investigated using sequence data from the nuclear protein-coding gene IRBP (15 species) and the two mitochondrial genes cytochrome b and 12S rRNA (17 species). The analysis of the three genes does not resolve the relationships between Mus, Apodemus, and Rattus but separates Micromys from these three genera. The analysis of the two mitochondrial regions supported an association between Apodemus and Tokudaia and indicated that these two genera are more closely related to Mus than to Rattus or Micromys. Within Apodemus, the mitochondrial data sets indicated that 8 of the 9 species analyzed can be sorted into two main groups: an Apodemus group, with A. agrarius, semotus, and peninsulae, and a Sylvaemus group, with uralensis, flavicollis, alpicola, sylvaticus, and hermonensis. The position of Apodemus mystacinus is ambiguous and might be either included in Sylvaemus or considered a distinct subgenus, Karstomys, more closely related to Sylvaemus than to Apodemus. Estimation of the divergence time for these taxa suggests a separation between 7 and 8 My ago for the three groups (mystacinus and the two subgenera Apodemus and Sylvaemus). Within each subgenus, divergence times are between 5.4 and 6 My for Apodemus and between 2.2 and 3.5 My for Sylvaemus and mystacinus. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB Fishing has led to local extirpations of reef fishes. For conservation and management purpose, it is important to identify all those species that are vulnerable to fishing, but this cannot be done using a priori assessments or by describing trends in abundance because the necessary scientific resources are not available. Thus the predictions of vulnerability that provide the basis for conservation action will have to be made with existing data or data that can be acquired rapidly before further extirpations occur. The life histories of species may determine their responses to exploitation, and we describe how an easily measured parameter, maximum observed size, is related to population trends of exploited fishes on coral reefs. Using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we demonstrated that species of grouper (Epinephelinae), snapper (Lujanidae), and parrotfish (Scaridae) that decreased in abundance more than their nearest phylogenetic relative had greater maximum size. Our results suggest that one can predict the vulnerability of reef fishes to exploitation based on responses of their relatives. The quality of the prediction was good for the intensively fished groupers and snappers but poor for the lightly fished parrotfishes. Our approach may help proactive conservationists and fishery managers identify and conserve vulnerable species in new, developing, or lightly exploited fisheries, thereby reducing their reliance on reactive management methods.

AB Despite the proliferation of increasingly sophisticated models of DNA sequence evolution, choosing among models remains a major problem in phylogenetic reconstruction. The choice of appropriate models is thought to be especially important when there is large variation among branch lengths. We evaluated the ability of nested models to reconstruct experimentally generated, known phylogenies of bacteriophage T7 as we varied the terminal branch lengths. Then, for each phylogeny we determined the best-fit model by progressively adding parameters to simpler models. We found that in several cases the choice of best-fit model was affected by the parameter addition sequence. In terms of phylogenetic performance, there was little difference between models when the ratio of short:long terminal branches was 1:3 or less. However, under conditions of extreme terminal branch-length variation, there were not only dramatic differences among models, but best-fit models were always among the best at overcoming long-branch attraction. The performance of minimum-evolution-distance methods was generally lower than that of discrete maximum-likelihood methods, even if maximum-likelihood methods were used to generate distance matrices. Correcting for among-site rate variation was especially important for overcoming long-branch attraction. The generality of our conclusions is supported by earlier simulation studies and by a preliminary analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear sequences from a well-supported four-taxon amniote phylogeny.

AB A literal reading of the fossil record indicates that the early Cambrian (c. 545 million years ago) and early Tertiary (c. 65 million years ago) were characterized by enormously accelerated periods of morphological evolution marking the appearance of the animal phyla, and modern bird and placental mammal orders, respectively. Recently, the evidence for these evolutionary 'explosions' has been questioned by cladistic and biogeographic studies which reveal that periods of diversification before these events are missing from the fossil record. Furthermore, molecular evidence indicates that prolonged periods of evolutionary innovation and cladogenesis lit the fuse long before the 'explosions' apparent in the fossil record.

AB Traditional evolutionary theory depicts survival of the fittest as a difficult existence based on danger, conflict and strife. But, another view is emerging of a more synergistic organization in which ecosystems on the whole provide hospitable conditions for life. This world is populated by organisms mutually adapted and beneficial by virtue of their direct and indirect interactions. Many examples of mutualism have been explicitly observed (Bronstein, J.L., 1991. Bull. Ecol. Sec. Am. 72, 6-8; Cushman, J.H., Beattie, A.J., 1991. Trends Ecol. Evol. 6, 193-195; Casti, J.L.; Karlqvist, A. (Eds.), 1995. Cooperation and Conflict in General Evolutionary Processes, Wiley, New York: 435 pp.), and we view mutualism as an implicit consequence of indirect interactions and ecosystem organization. This paper extends a methodology based on input-output analysis that models these synergistic relationships (Patten, B.C., 1991. Theoretical Studies of Ecosystems: The Network Perspective, pp. 288-351; Fatten, B.C., 1992. Ecol. Modell. 62, 29-69). We show for simple storage-flow models that direct zero-sum resource transactions between organisms, when considered in context of the whole-system organization, produce integral (direct plus indirect) relationships more positive than the direct ones. This phenomenon, 'network synergism', is demonstrated for two simple networks and a complete three component model. We also show, by looking at a limiting case, that system-wide synergism is ubiquitous, occurring in all models of any size or complexity. Network synergism emerges in these models because of three network properties: symmetry, indirectness and openness. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of tillage practices on native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was studied in two, consecutive years in eastern Canada, in two 11 year-old long-term tillage-fertilizer experimental field soils, a sandy loam and a clay, growing corn in monoculture. The three tillage practices were: 1)conventional tillage (CT; fall plowing plus spring disking), reduced tillage (RT; spring disking) and no-till (NT). The corn crop received either inorganic (N and K) or organic (liquid dairy manure) fertilizers. Mycorrhizal hyphal density was estimated from soil samples obtained in early spring (before disking), at the 12-14 leaf stage, at silking, and at harvest. The percentage of corn root colonization by AMF at the 12-14 leaf stage, at silking and at harvest was also determined. The sandy loam was sampled over two consecutive seasons and the clay soil over one season.
   Densities of total and metabolically active soil hyphae, and mycorrhizal root colonization were significantly lower in CT soil than in RT and NT soil. Lowest soil hyphal densities were observed in early spring. The levels of intra-and extraradical fungal colonization always increased from spring to silking and decreased thereafter. Spring disking had only a small and transient negative effect on hyphal abundance in soil. Fertilization did not influence mycorrhizal colonization of corn or abundance of soil hyphae in the sandy loam soil, but in the clay soil metabolically active hyphae were more abundant with manure application than with mineral fertilization. In 1992, in both soils different tillage systems had same grain yield, however, in 1993, corn yield was higher in NT compared to CT system.

AB This study investigated the hypothesis that recruitment variations of coral reef fish directly reflect variations in larval supply. At Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef, larval supply and recruitment of 3 species of damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis, P. nagasakiensis and Dischistodus perspicillatus) were estimated from light trap and patch reef collections respectively, over 2 consecutive recruitment seasons, in each of 3 habitats. Comparison of these patterns pooled over species and seasons revealed a good overall correlation between larval supply and early recruitment levels, suggesting that pre-settlement distributions may be the major determinant of early recruitment patterns despite mediating influences from factors such as habitat selection and post-settlement mortality. This result also supports the use of broad recruitment surveys to estimate year-class strength and to hindcast patterns in larval supply. When analysed at the individual species/season level, the abundance of recruits on patch reefs and the abundance of larvae in light trap collections were also significantly correlated, with the exception of one species (P. amboinensis) during one season (1989/90). When the level of comparison was further narrowed to analyse correlations between pre- and post-settlement fish of individual species in each season, within each habitat, only 7 significant relationships were detected out of a possible 18 habitat/species combinations. The power of these tests was relatively high (mean = 0.846; SE = 0.03). These relationships provide some evidence for habitat selection suggesting that P. amboinensis preferred the leeward habitat, while D. perspicillatus preferred the windward habitat.

AB The ratio of plant transpiration to total terrestrial evapotranspiration (T/ET) captures the role of vegetation in surface-atmosphere interactions. However, its magnitude remains highly uncertain at the global scale. Here we apply an emergent constraint approach that integrates CMIP5 Earth system models (ESMs) with 33 field T/ET measurements to re-estimate the global T/ET value. Our observational constraint strongly increases the original ESM estimates (0.41 +/- 0.11) and greatly alleviates intermodel discrepancy, which leads to a new global T/ET estimate of 0.62 +/- 0.06. For all the ESMs, the leaf area index is identified as the primary driver of spatial variations of T/ET, but to correct its bias generates a larger T/ET underestimation than the original ESM output. We present evidence that the ESM underestimation of T/ET is, instead, attributable to inaccurate representation of canopy light use, interception loss and root water uptake processes in the ESMs. These processes should be prioritized to reduce model uncertainties in the global hydrological cycle.

AB Fungi play an important regulating role in terrestrial ecosystem functioning. However, their biogeographic distribution patterns along combined gradients of plant communities and environmental variables across regional spatial scales remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap is particularly pronounced in arid and semi-arid grassland ecosystems, which occupy one third of the terrestrial surface of China. Here, a regional-scale field investigation was conducted to collect soil samples from 290 plots at 52 sites along a 4000 km transect in temperate grasslands of northern China to assess the distribution patterns of fungal communities. The high-throughput Illumina sequencing revealed that soil fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota across the temperate grasslands. Fungal richness increased with plant species richness and mean annual precipitation (MAP). Bray-Cutis dissimilarities in soil fungal community composition between sites were significantly correlated with plant community composition, geographical distance, and abiotic factors including MAP, mean annual temperature, soil pH, and soil organic carbon. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that variation in fungal community composition was mainly explained by plant community composition, followed by geographical distance and abiotic factors. Structural equation models further highlighted the significant role of plant species richness in determining soil fungal richness. Taken together, these results suggest that the regional-scale distribution pattern of soil fungal communities is predominantly mediated by plant community composition, and also by abiotic factors and geographical distance in arid and semi-arid temperate grasslands.

AB The majority of vulnerability and adaptation scholarship, policies and programs focus exclusively on climate change or global environmental change. Yet, individuals, communities and sectors experience a broad array of multi-scalar and multi-temporal, social, political, economic and environmental changes to which they are vulnerable and must adapt. While extensive theoretical-and increasingly empirical-work suggests the need to explore multiple exposures, a clear conceptual framework which would facilitate analysis of vulnerability and adaptation to multiple interacting socioeconomic and biophysical changes is lacking. This review and synthesis paper aims to fill this gap through presenting a conceptual framework for integrating multiple exposures into vulnerability analysis and adaptation planning. To support applications of the framework and facilitate assessments and comparative analyses of community vulnerability, we develop a comprehensive typology of drivers and exposures experienced by coastal communities. Our results reveal essential elements of a pragmatic approach for local-scale vulnerability analysis and for planning appropriate adaptations within the context of multiple interacting exposures. We also identify methodologies for characterizing exposures and impacts, exploring interactions and identifying and prioritizing responses. This review focuses on coastal communities; however, we believe the framework, typology and approach will be useful for understanding vulnerability and planning adaptation to multiple exposures in various social-ecological contexts.

AB Although there is increasing interest in the effects of habitat disturbance on community attributes and the potential consequences for ecosystem functioning, objective approaches linking biodiversity loss to functional loss are uncommon. The objectives of this study were to implement simultaneous assessment of community attributes (richness, abundance and biomass, each calculated for total-beetle assemblages as well as small-and large-beetle assemblages) and three ecological functions of dung beetles (dung removal, soil perturbation and secondary seed dispersal), to compare the effects of habitat disturbance on both sets of response variables, and their relations. We studied dung beetle community attributes and functions in five land-use systems representing a disturbance gradient in the Brazilian Amazon: primary forest, secondary forest, agroforestry, agriculture and pasture. All response variables were affected negatively by the intensification of habitat disturbance regimes, but community attributes and ecological functions did not follow the same pattern of decline. A hierarchical partitioning analysis showed that, although all community attributes had a significant effect on the three ecological functions (except the abundance of small beetles on all three ecological functions and the biomass of small beetles on secondary dispersal of large seed mimics), species richness and abundance of large beetles were the community attributes with the highest explanatory value. Our results show the importance of measuring ecological function empirically instead of deducing it from community metrics.

AB Inbreeding is common in plants and can have considerable effects on population viability, because of inbreeding depression. Understanding what determines the magnitude of inbreeding depression is of fundamental importance for conservation biology. We used meta-analysis of 116 studies and 107 plant species to investigate the effects of population size, test environment, life history characteristics and stage on the magnitude of inbreeding depression in 13 different fitness traits. We found that inbreeding depression levels significantly increase with population size. This may be a consequence of either, or both, a higher baseline of the level of inbreeding or increased impact of purging in small populations; unfortunately the available data did not allow distinguishing between these potential explanations. In general, inbreeding depression was found to be common across species and environments, and was significant in all traits examined. Yet, the magnitude of inbreeding depression was significantly influenced by plant longevity and life-history stage, and varied depending on how plant fitness was measured. Our findings highlight the fundamental role of population size in influencing the magnitude of inbreeding depression in plants. This clearly has important implications for conservation biology. Moreover, our findings on the overall generality of inbreeding depression confirm that inbreeding depression is one of the key factors reducing plant population fitness and viability. Hence, we need a better understanding on the architecture of inbreeding depression, how different ecological and historical conditions influence the levels of inbreeding depression in natural plant populations, and its impacts on community dynamics.

AB Conservation biology can benefit greatly from models that relate species' distributions to their environments. The foundation of successful modeling is a high-quality set of field data, and distribution models have specialized data requirements. The role of a distribution model may be primarily predictive or, alternatively, may emphasize relationships between an organism and its habitat. For the latter application, the environmental variables recorded should have direct, biological relationships with the organism. Interacting species may be valuable predictors and can improve understanding of distribution patterns. Sampling should cover the full range of environmental conditions within the study region, with samples stratified across major environmental gradients to ensure thorough coverage. Failure to sample correctly can lead to erroneous organism-environment relationships, affecting predictive ability and interpretation. Sampling ideally should examine a series of spatial scales, increasing the understanding of organism-environment relationships, identifying the most effective scales for predictive modeling and complementing the spatial hierarchies often used in conservation planning. Consideration of statistical issues could benefit most studies. The ratio of sample sites to environmental variables considered should ideally exceed a ratio of 10: 1 to improve the analytical power and reliability of subsequent modeling. Presence and/or absence models may suffer bias if training data detect the study organism at an atypical proportion of sites. We considered different strategies for spatial autocorrelation and recommend it be included wherever possible for the benefits in biological realism, predictive accuracy, and model versatility. Finally, we stress the importance of collecting independent evaluation data and suggest that, as with the training data, a systematic approach be used to ensure broad environmental coverage, rather than relying on a random selection of test sites.

AB Since the 1940s, the distributions of several butterfly species have been expanding in northern Europe, probably in response to climate warming. We focus on the speckled wood butterfly Pararge aegeria in order to determine impacts of habitat availability on expansion rates. We analyse observed expansion rates since 1940 and also use a spatially explicit mechanistic model (MIGRATE) to simulate range expansion in two areas of the UK which differ in their distribution of breeding habitat (woodland). Observed and simulated expansion rates were in very close agreement but were 42%-45% slower in an area that had 24% less woodland. Unlike P. aegeria, the majority of butterfly species are not currently expanding, almost certainly because of lack of suitable habitat. Incorporating the spatial distribution of habitat into investigations of range changes is likely to be important in determining those species that can and cannot expand, and for predicting potential future range changes.

AB We investigated genetic population structure in wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) from a series of Prairie Pothole wetlands in the northern Great Plains. Amphibians are often thought to exist in demographic metapopulations, which require some movement between populations, yet genetic studies have revealed strong subdivision among populations, even at relatively fine scales (several km). Wood frogs are highly philopatric and studies of dispersal suggest that they may exhibit subdivision on a scale of approximate to 1-2 km. We used microsatellites to examine population structure among 11 breeding assemblages separated by as little as 50 m up to approximate to 5.5 km, plus one population separated from the others by 20 km. We found evidence for differentiation at the largest distances we examined and among a few neighbouring ponds, but most populations were strikingly similar in allele frequencies, suggesting high gene now among all but the most distant populations. We hypothesize that the few significant differences among neighbouring populations at the finest scale may be a transient effect of extinction-recolonization founder events, driven by periodic drying of wetlands in this hydrologically dynamic landscape.

AB Root, arbuscular-mycorrhizal (AM), soil faunal (protozoa and microarthropods), and microbial responses to field exposure to CO2 for six growing seasons were measured in spring 1997 in two adjacent grassland communities. The grasslands showed contrasting root responses to CO2, enrichment: whereas root length was not affected in the sandstone grassland, it was greater in the serpentine grassland, as was specific root length. AM fungal hyphal lengths were greater in the sandstone, but were unaffected in the serpentine community. This lent support to the hypothesis that there may be a tradeoff in resource allocation to more fine roots or greater mycorrhizal extraradical hyphal length. AM root infection was greater in both communities at elevated CO2, as was the proportion of roots containing arbuscules. Our data on total hyphal lengths, culturable and active fungi, bacteria, and protozoa supported the hypothesis that the fungal food chain was more strongly stimulated than the bacterial chain. This study is one of the first to test these hypotheses in natural multi-species communities in the field.

AB This paper reports the successful isolation and preliminary characterisation of a mutant of Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. with highly reduced vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal colonization. The mutation is recessive and has been designated rmc. Colonization by G. mosseae is characterised by poor development of external mycelium and a few abnormal appressoria. Vesicles were never formed by this fungus in association with the mutant. Gi. margarita formed large amounts of external mycelium, complex branched structures and occasional auxiliary cells. Small amounts of internal colonization also occurred. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) gave a clear picture of the differences in development of G. intraradices and Gi. margarita in mutant and wild-type roots and confirmed that the fungus is restricted to the root surface of the mutants. The amenability of tomato for molecular genetic characterisation should enable us to map and clone the mutated gene, and thus identify one of the biochemical bases for inability to establish a normal mycorrhizal symbiosis. The mutant represents a key advance in molecular research on VA mycorrhizal symbiosis.

AB The functional compatibility of symbioses between host plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was measured as hyphal P transport to plants. Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) were inoculated with Glomus caledonium (Nicol. & Gerd.) Trappe & Gerdemann (isolate RIS42, BEG15) and Glomus invermaium Hall (isolate WUM10) or left uninoculated and grown for 28 days in soil divided into three compartments. One side compartment was separated from the main compartment by a 20 mu m nylon mesh, and radioactive labelling with P-32 was used to determine hyphal P uptake. The other side compartment was separated from the main compartment by a 700 mu m nylon mesh and P-33 was used to determine the combined P uptake by roots and hyphae.
   All plant-fungus combinations were compatible with respect to mycorrhiza formation, measured both as root colonization and growth of external hyphae. In contrast, the symbioses differed markedly with respect to functional compatibility as phosphorus uptake by each fungus depended on the species of host plant. The hyphal transport of P-32 was high in G. caledonium in symbioses with all three plant species, whereas G. invermaium transported significant amounts of P-32 only when associated with flax. Consequently, to determine the P-transport effectiveness of a mycorrhizal fungus is meaningful only in the context of its associated host plant species.

AB A changing climate may directly or indirectly influence biological invasions by altering the likelihood of introduction or establishment, as well as modifying the geographic range, environmental impacts, economic costs or management of alien species. A comprehensive assessment of empirical and theoretical evidence identified how each of these processes is likely to be shaped by climate change for alien plants, animals and pathogens in terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments of Great Britain. The strongest contemporary evidence for the potential role of climate change in the establishment of new alien species is for terrestrial arthropods, as a result of their ectothermic physiology, often high dispersal rate and their strong association with trade as well as commensal relationships with human environments. By contrast, there is little empirical support for higher temperatures increasing the rate of alien plant establishment due to the stronger effects of residence time and propagule pressure. The magnitude of any direct climate effect on the number of new alien species will be small relative to human-assisted introductions driven by socioeconomic factors. Casual alien species (sleepers) whose population persistence is limited by climate are expected to exhibit greater rates of establishment under climate change assuming that propagule pressure remains at least at current levels. Surveillance and management targeting sleeper pests and diseases may be the most cost-effective option to reduce future impacts under climate change. Most established alien species will increase their distribution range in Great Britain over the next century. However, such range increases are very likely be the result of natural expansion of populations that have yet to reach equilibrium with their environment, rather than a direct consequence of climate change. To assess the potential realised range of alien species will require a spatially explicit approach that not only integrates bioclimatic suitability and population-level demographic rates but also simulation of landscape-level processes (e.g. dispersal, land-use change, host/habitat distribution, non-climatic edaphic constraints). In terms of invasive alien species that have known economic or biodiversity impacts, the taxa that are likely to be the most responsive are plant pathogens and insect pests of agricultural crops. However, the extent to which climate adaptation strategies lead to new crops, altered rotations, and different farming practices (e.g. irrigation, fertilization) will all shape the potential agricultural impacts of alien species. The greatest uncertainty in the effects of climate change on biological invasions exists with identifying the future character of new species introductions and predicting ecosystem impacts. Two complementary strategies may work under these conditions of high uncertainty: (i) prioritise ecosystems in terms of their perceived vulnerability to climate change and prevent ingress or expansion of alien species therein that may exacerbate problems; (ii) target those ecosystem already threatened by alien species and implement management to prevent the situation deteriorating under climate change.

AB Almost 30 y ago, the field of intraspecific phylogeography laid the foundation for spatially explicit and genealogically informed studies of population divergence. With new methods and markers, the focus in phylogeography shifted to previously unrecognized geographic genetic variation, thus reducing the attention paid to phenotypic variation in those same diverging lineages. Although phenotypic differences among lineages once provided the main data for studies of evolutionary change, the mechanisms shaping phenotypic differentiation and their integration with intraspecific genetic structure have been underexplored in phylogeographic studies. However, phenotypes are targets of selection and play important roles in species performance, recognition, and diversification. Here, we focus on three questions. First, how can phenotypes elucidate mechanisms underlying concordant or idiosyncratic responses of vertebrate species evolving in shared landscapes? Second, what mechanisms underlie the concordance or discordance of phenotypic and phylogeographic differentiation? Third, how can phylogeography contribute to our understanding of functional phenotypic evolution? We demonstrate that the integration of phenotypic data extends the reach of phylogeography to explain the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Finally, we stress the importance of natural history collections as sources of high-quality phenotypic data that span temporal and spatial axes.

AB Most conservation planning to date has focused on protecting today's biodiversity with the assumption that it will be tomorrow's biodiversity. However, modern climate change has already resulted in distributional shifts of some species and is projected to result in many more shifts in the coming decades. As species redistribute and biotic communities reorganize, conservation plans based on current patterns of biodiversity may fail to adequately protect species in the future. One approach for addressing this issue is to focus on conserving a range of abiotic conditions in the conservation-planning process. By doing so, it may be possible to conserve an abiotically diverse stage upon which evolution will play out and support many actors (biodiversity). We reviewed the fundamental underpinnings of the concept of conserving the abiotic stage, starting with the early observations of von Humboldt, who mapped the concordance of abiotic conditions and vegetation, and progressing to the concept of the ecological niche. We discuss challenges posed by issues of spatial and temporal scale, the role of biotic drivers of species distributions, and latitudinal and topographic variation in relationships between climate and landform. For example, abiotic conditions are not static, but change through timealbeit at different and often relatively slow rates. In some places, biotic interactions play a substantial role in structuring patterns of biodiversity, meaning that patterns of biodiversity may be less tightly linked to the abiotic stage. Furthermore, abiotic drivers of biodiversity can change with latitude and topographic position, meaning that the abiotic stage may need to be defined differently in different places. We conclude that protecting a diversity of abiotic conditions will likely best conserve biodiversity into the future in places where abiotic drivers of species distributions are strong relative to biotic drivers, where the diversity of abiotic settings will be conserved through time, and where connectivity allows for movement among areas providing different abiotic conditions.
   Los Obstaculos y la Teoria detras de la Conservacion del Estado de la Naturaleza en Tiempos de Cambios RapidosLa mayoria de los planes de conservacion a la fecha se han enfocado en proteger a la biodiversidad de hoy bajo la suposicion de que sera la biodiversidad de manana. Sin embargo, el cambio climatico contemporaneo ya ha resultado en cambios de distribucion de algunas especies y se tiene proyectado que resulte en muchos cambios mas en las siguientes decadas. Conforme las especies se redistribuyen y las comunidades bioticas se reorganizan, los planes de conservacion con base en los patrones actuales de biodiversidad pueden fallar en proteger adecuadamente a las especies en el futuro. Una estrategia para dirigirse a este tema consiste en enfocarse en la conservacion de una gama de condiciones abioticas durante el proceso de planeacion de la conservacion. Al hacer esto, puede ser posible conservar una etapa de diversidad abiotica sobre la cual actuara la evolucion y sustentara a muchos actores (biodiversidad). Revisamos los apuntalamientos fundamentales del concepto de conservacion de la etapa abiotica, comenzando con las observaciones iniciales de von Humboldt, quien mapeo la concordancia de las condiciones abioticas y la vegetacion; y progresando hasta el concepto de nicho ecologico. Discutimos los obstaculos impuestos por los temas de escala espacial y temporal, el papel de los conductores bioticos de la distribucion de las especies, y la variacion latitudinal y topografica en las relaciones entre el clima y los accidentes geograficos. Por ejemplo, las condiciones abioticas no son estaticas, sino que cambian con el tiempono obstante a tasas diferentes y frecuentemente lentas. En algunos lugares, las interacciones bioticas juegan un papel sustancial en los patrones de estructuracion de la biodiversidad, lo que significa que los patrones de la biodiversidad pueden estar menos relacionados con la etapa abiotica. Mas alla, los conductores abioticos pueden cambiar con la posicion topografica y la latitud, lo que significa que la etapa abiotica necesitara definirse diferentemente en lugares distintos. Concluimos que proteger una diversidad de condiciones abioticas probablemente conserve de mejor manera a la biodiversidad hacia el futuro en lugares donde los conductores abioticos de la distribucion de especies son fuertes en relacion con los conductores bioticos, donde la diversidad de configuraciones abioticas se mantendran a lo largo del tiempo, y donde la conectividad permita movimiento entre areas que proporcionan diferentes condiciones abioticas.

AB AimTo determine if differences in climate envelopes for six coniferous tree species and two life stages (trees and seedlings) suggest a potential for species range contractions, expansions or shifts in response to climate change and if these patterns differ between subalpine (i.e. cool-climate) and montane (i.e. warm-climate) species.
   LocationThe dry domain of the western United States.
   MethodsUsing data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis National Program, we quantified the relationship between probability of occurrence and climate for adults and seedlings of each species with a Bayesian logistic regression. Assuming that distributional differences between life stages highlight shifting regeneration patterns relative to adult trees, we assessed differences between seedlings and adult trees based on predicted probabilities of occurrence and climate envelope boundaries.
   ResultsDifferences between occurrence probabilities for seedlings and adults were greatest for montane, as opposed to subalpine, species and along range margins, especially in the southern and western portions of the study area. Climate envelope boundaries of seedlings differed from adult trees most frequently in montane species and often suggested range contractions or range shifts, as opposed to range expansion.
   Main conclusionsOur results indicated that climate-induced contractions and shifts in seedling distribution in response to recent change are already under way and are particularly severe in montane tree species. While adult trees may persist for hundreds of years without significant regeneration, tree species ranges will eventually contract where tree regeneration fails.

AB The spread of the ecosystem services framework has been accompanied by the promotion of market-based policy instruments for environmental governance. In this paper we clarify the rationale, policy goals and governance challenges of the ecosystem services framework. After systematizing the limitations of market-based policy tools for enhancing the provision of ecosystem services, we argue that hybrid regimes are more suitable (compared to pure markets or hierarchies) to deal with the governance challenges derived from the characteristics of ecosystem services, particularly their common good character and their intrinsic complexity. The paper pleads for an alternative conceptual underpinning of market-based instruments, in order to make them more compatible with hybrid forms of governance. We discuss the major implications of such analytical shift. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We identify the 10 major terrestrial and marine ecosystems in Australia most vulnerable to tipping points, in which modest environmental changes can cause disproportionately large changes in ecosystem properties. To accomplish this we independently surveyed the coauthors of this paper to produce a list of candidate ecosystems, and then refined this list during a 2-day workshop. The list includes (1) elevationally restricted mountain ecosystems, (2) tropical savannas, (3) coastal floodplains and wetlands, (4) coral reefs, (5) drier rainforests, (6) wetlands and floodplains in the Murray-Darling Basin, (7) the Mediterranean ecosystems of southwestern Australia, (8) offshore islands, (9) temperate eucalypt forests, and (10) salt marshes and mangroves. Some of these ecosystems are vulnerable to widespread phase-changes that could fundamentally alter ecosystem properties such as habitat structure, species composition, fire regimes, or carbon storage. Others appear susceptible to major changes across only part of their geographic range, whereas yet others are susceptible to a large-scale decline of key biotic components, such as small mammals or stream-dwelling amphibians. For each ecosystem we consider the intrinsic features and external drivers that render it susceptible to tipping points, and identify subtypes of the ecosystem that we deem to be especially vulnerable.

AB In a field experiment in the Yellow River Basin conducted in 2007 and 2008 it was found that under full irrigation the roots of maize not only penetrated deeper than those of soybean but also extended into soybean stands underneath the space between inner rows of soybean The roots of soybean however were confined mainly to the zone near the plants Horizontal growth of the roots of both the crops was confined mainly to the soil layer 16-22 cm below the surface a layer that lay above an existing plough pan Root length density (RLD) was much higher in the top layer (0-30 cm deep) and in the zone closer to the plants The exponential model proved suitable to describe the RLD vertically and horizontally in both sole cropping and in intercropping (c) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

ID HIERARCHICAL MODEL
AB The density of a closed population of animals occupying stable home ranges may be estimated from detections of individuals on an array of detectors, using newly developed methods for spatially explicit capture-recapture. Likelihood-based methods provide estimates for data from multi-catch traps or from devices that record presence without restricting animal movement ("proximity" detectors such as camera traps and hair snags). As originally proposed, these methods require multiple sampling intervals. We show that equally precise and unbiased estimates may be obtained from a single sampling interval, using only the spatial pattern of detections. This considerably extends the range of possible applications, and we illustrate the potential by estimating density from simulated detections of bird vocalizations on a microphone array. Acoustic detection can be defined as occurring when received signal strength exceeds a threshold. We suggest detection models for binary acoustic data, and for continuous data comprising measurements of all signals above the threshold. While binary data are often sufficient for density estimation, modeling signal strength improves precision when the microphone array is small.

AB Ontogenetic shifts in habitat use, aggregation and dispersion were studied from the onset of settlement to recruitment to the adult population for juvenile littoral fishes of the genus Diplodus. These processes were examined for three species (D. puntazzo (Gmelin), D. sargus (L.) and D. vulgaris (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire)) in the north-west Mediterranean Sea between May 1993 and June 1996. On settlement, juveniles (1.0-1.5 cm in length) of the three species showed non-random use of the habitat: D. puntazzo and D. sargus showed a clear preference for crannies in the rocks between 0 and 2 m, whereas settlers of D. vulgaris preferred more open areas, generally somewhat deeper. For all species, preference for a given habitat type decreased as the juveniles grew, with distributions more consistent with habitat availability. These ontogenetic changes in habitat use were associated with differences in shoaling behaviour. During settlement, juveniles of the three species formed small monospecific shoals and exhibited a markedly clumped distribution. As the individuals grew, the shoals gradually fragmented. This was reflected in an increase in the number of shoals, lower densities within shoals and a more contagious distribution of shoals. The habitat use and shoaling behaviour was the same during the day and at night and in clear or partially turbid water conditions. However, under conditions of heavy turbulence, the level of aggregation of individuals clearly increased, independently of fish size. Juveniles of the three species showed a high degree of fidelity to the nursery area, where they remained for a number of months. Dispersal outside this area occurred when the individuals reached 4.5-5.5 cm in length. This process took place concurrently with the integration of individuals into shoals of adult conspecifics.

AB Soil microorganisms control carbon losses from soils to the atmosphere(1-3), yet their responses to climate warming are often short-lived and unpredictable (4-7). Two mechanisms, microbial acclimation and substrate depletion, have been proposed to explain temporary warming effects on soil microbial activity(8-10). However, empirical support for either mechanism is unconvincing. Here we used geothermal temperature gradients (>50 years of field warming)(11) and a short-term experiment to show that microbial activity (gross rates of growth, turnover, respiration and carbon uptake) is intrinsically temperature sensitive and does not acclimate to warming (+6 degrees C) over weeks or decades. Permanently accelerated microbial activity caused carbon loss from soil. However, soil carbon loss was temporary because substrate depletion reduced microbial biomass and constrained the influence of microbes over the ecosystem. A microbial biogeochemical model(12-14) showed that these observations are reproducible through a modest, but permanent, acceleration in microbial physiology. These findings reveal a mechanism by which intrinsic microbial temperature sensitivity and substrate depletion together dictate warming effects on soil carbon loss via their control over microbial biomass. We thus provide a framework for interpreting the links between temperature, microbial activity and soil carbon loss on timescales relevant to Earth's climate system.

AB Soil erosion is a critical environmental problem of the Loess Plateau, China. As an important project for soil and water conservation in the semi-arid environment, the Grain-for-Green extensively transformed a wide range of farmland into vegetated land after the 1980s. Yet, the effects of vegetation restoration on soil erosion reduction are not well understood. In this study, we monitored runoff and sediment yield at sites restored with six typical restoration vegetation types including shrubs (Armeniaca sibirica, Spiraea pubescens and Artemisia coparia), grasses (Andropogon), and shrub-grass-compounds (Andropogon and A. coparia) in the Loess Plateau. We employed structural equation modelling (SEM) to systematically analyze the relative effects of precipitation and vegetation on soil erosion. The results showed that the runoff and sediment yield at the grasslands were significantly higher than other cover types. The shrub cover had the strongest soil conservation capacity of all restoration vegetation. SEM results showed varying impacts of precipitation (i.e., total amount and erosive rainfall intensity) on runoff and soil erosion under different vegetation types owing to differences in canopy structure and surface litter layer. Our study quantitatively revealed the interactive effects of precipitation and vegetation on runoff and sediment, which may be beneficial to conserving available water and soil resources in the semiarid environment.

AB Wastewater reuse has been recognized as an encouraging solution to cope with the problem of water scarcity around the globe. Adopting Integrated Water Resources Management principles will ensure that the implementation of wastewater reuse projects will take into account all the various types of affected stakeholders, accounting in addition for the external costs and benefits derived from the reuse decision. The objective of this paper is to analyze the economic, social and environmental aspects surrounding the concept of wastewater reuse in order to assist policy-makers and managers on the implementation of economic instruments for decision-making. This study proposes a methodological framework for conducting cost-benefit analysis, which is later exemplified by the Yarqon Recycling Project case study in Israel. In this case study application, 3 different scenarios ("pessimistic", "base-case" and "optimistic") with a range of parameters values, were used to estimate the most relevant internal and external costs and benefits. Additionally, the most influential parameters were identified using a sensitivity analysis that included both Monte Carlo simulations and the standardized regression coefficients method. For the "base-case" scenario, the net present value obtained was approximately $4.83 million. Although the feasibility of the project is demonstrated, the sensitivity analysis results were less favorable (likelihood of obtaining a positive result was only 64.28%), being the external recreational costs derived from irrigating with reclaimed wastewater the most influential parameter. The results of this analysis led to the conclusion that including the relevant externalities might have a strong impact on the economic feasibility of the wastewater reuse projects. The proposed methodological framework aims to guide decision-makers in evaluating their success with respect to Integrated Water Resources Management in economic terms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Many ecological phenomena combine to direct vegetation trends over time, with climate and disturbance playing prominent roles. To help decipher their relative importance during Euro-American times, we employed a unique approach whereby tree species/genera were partitioned into temperature, shade tolerance, and pyrogenicity classes and applied to comparative tree-census data. Our megadata analysis of 190 datasets determined the relative impacts of climate vs. altered disturbance regimes for various biomes across the eastern United States. As the Euro-American period (ca. 1500 to today) spans two major climatic periods, from Little Ice Age to the Anthropocene, vegetation changes consistent with warming were expected. In most cases, however, European disturbance overrode regional climate, but in a manner that varied across the Tension Zone Line. To the north, intensive and expansive early European disturbance resulted in the ubiquitous loss of conifers and large increases of Acer, Populus, and Quercus in northern hardwoods, whereas to the south, these disturbances perpetuated the dominance of Quercus in central hardwoods. Acer increases and associated mesophication in Quercus-Pinus systems were delayed until mid 20th century fire suppression. This led to significant warm to cool shifts in temperature class where cool-adapted Acer saccharum increased and temperature neutral changes where warm-adapted Acer rubrum increased. In both cases, these shifts were attributed to fire suppression rather than climate change. Because mesophication is ongoing, eastern US forests formed during the catastrophic disturbance era followed by fire suppression will remain in climate disequilibrium into the foreseeable future. Overall, the results of our study suggest that altered disturbance regimes rather than climate had the greatest influence on vegetation composition and dynamics in the eastern United States over multiple centuries. Land-use change often trumped or negated the impacts of warming climate, and needs greater recognition in climate change discussions, scenarios, and model interpretations.

AB Delimiting and describing species is fundamental to numerous biological disciplines such as evolution, macroecology, and conservation. Delimiting species as independent evolutionary lineages may and often does yield different outcomes depending on the species criteria applied, but methods should be chosen that minimize the inference of objectively erroneous species limits. Several protocols exploit single-gene or multi-gene coalescence statistics, assignment tests or other rationales related to nuclear DNA (nDNA) allele sharing to automatically delimit species. We apply seven different species delimitation protocols to a taxonomically confusing group of Malagasy lizards (Madascincus), and compare the resulting taxonomies with two newly developed metrics: the Taxonomic index of congruence C-tax which quantifies the congruence between two taxonomies, and the Relative taxonomic resolving power index R-tax which quantifies the potential of an approach to capture a high number of species boundaries. The protocols differed in the total number of species proposed, between 9 and 34, and were also highly incongruent in placing species boundaries. The Generalized Mixed Yule-Coalescent approach captured the highest number of potential species boundaries but many of these were clearly contradicted by extensive nDNA admixture between sympatric mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype lineages. Delimiting species as phenotypically diagnosable mtDNA clades failed to detect two cryptic species that are unambiguous due to a lack of nDNA gene flow despite sympatry. We also consider the high number of species boundaries and their placement by multi-gene Bayesian species delimitation as poorly reliable whereas the Bayesian assignment test approach provided a species delimitation highly congruent with integrative taxonomic practice. The present study illustrates the trade-off in taxonomy between reliability (favored by conservative approaches) and resolving power (favored by inflationist approaches). Quantifying excessive splitting is more difficult than quantifying excessive lumping, suggesting a priority for conservative taxonomies in which errors are more liable to be detected and corrected by subsequent studies.

AB Tipping points - where systems shift radically and potentially irreversibly into a different state - have received considerable attention in ecology. Although there is convincing evidence that human drivers can cause regime shifts at local and regional scales, the increasingly invoked concept of planetary scale tipping points in the terrestrial biosphere remains unconfirmed. By evaluating potential mechanisms and drivers, we conclude that spatial heterogeneity in drivers and responses, and lack of strong continental interconnectivity, probably induce relatively smooth changes at the global scale, without an expectation of marked tipping patterns. This implies that identifying critical points along global continua of drivers might be unfeasible and that characterizing global biotic change with single aggregates is inapt.

AB 1. The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts an increasing importance of facilitative mechanisms relative to competition along gradients of increasing environmental stress. Although developed across a variety of ecosystems, the SGH's relevance to the dynamic tree-grass systems of global savannas remains unclear. Here, we present a meta-analysis of empirical studies to explore emergent patterns of tree-grass relationships in global savannas in the context of the SGH.
   2. We quantified the net effect of trees on understorey grass production relative to production away from tree canopies along a rainfall gradient in tropical and temperate savannas and compared these findings to the predictions of the SGH. We also analysed soil and plant nutrient concentrations in subcanopy and open-grassland areas to investigate the potential role of nutrients in determining grass production in the presence and absence of trees.
   3. Our meta-analysis revealed a shift from net competitive to net facilitative effects of trees on subcanopy grass production with decreasing annual precipitation, consistent with the SGH. We also found a significant difference between sites from Africa and North America, suggesting differences in tree-grass interactions in the savannas of tropical and temperate regions.
   4. Nutrient analyses indicate no change in nutrient ratios along the rainfall gradient, but consistent nutrient enrichment under tree canopies.
   5. Synthesis. Our results help to resolve questions about the SGH in semi-arid systems, demonstrating that in mixed tree-grass systems, trees facilitate grass growth in drier regions and suppress grass growth in wetter regions. Relationships differ, however, between African and North American sites representing tropical and temperate bioclimates, respectively. The results of this meta-analysis advance our understanding of tree-grass interactions in savannas and contribute a valuable data set to the developing theory behind the SGH.

AB 1. Ecological communities can be relatively stable for long periods of time, and then, often as a result of disturbance, transition rapidly to a novel state. When communities fail to recover to pre-disturbance configurations, they are said to have experienced a regime shift or to be in an alternative stable state.
   2. In this 8-year study, we quantified the effects of complete water loss and subsequent altered disturbance regime on aquatic insect communities inhabiting a formerly perennial desert stream. We monitored two study pools seasonally for 4 years before and 4 years after the transition from perennial to intermittent flow to evaluate pre-drying community dynamics and post-drying recovery trajectories.
   3. Mean species richness was not affected by the transition to intermittent flow, though seasonal patterns of richness did change. Sample densities were much higher in post-drying samples.
   4. The stream pool communities underwent a catastrophic regime shift after transition to intermittent flow, moving to an alternative stable state with novel seasonal trajectories, and did not recover to pre-drying configurations after 4 years. Six invertebrate species were extirpated by the initial drying event, while other species were as much as 40 times more abundant in post-drying samples. In general, large-bodied top predators were extirpated from the system and replaced with high abundances of smaller-bodied mesopredators.
   5. Our results suggest that the loss of perennial flow caused by intensified droughts and water withdrawals could lead to significant changes in community structure and species composition at local and regional scales.

AB Community ecologists and conservation biologists often work with data that are too sparse for achieving reliable inference with species-specific approaches. Here we explore the idea of combining species-specific models into a single hierarchical model. The community component of the model seeks for shared patterns in how the species respond to environmental covariates. We illustrate the modeling framework in the context of logistic regression and presence-absence data, but a similar hierarchical structure could also be used in many other types of applications. We first use simulated data to illustrate that the community component can improve parameterization of species-specific models especially for rare species, for which the data would be too sparse to be informative alone. We then apply the community model to real data on 500 diatom species to show that it has much greater predictive power than a collection of independent species-specific models. We use the modeling approach to show that roughly one-third of distance decay in community similarity can be explained by two variables characterizing water quality, rare species typically preferring nutrient-poor waters with high pH, and common species showing a more general pattern of resource use.

AB Detecting coherent signals of climate change is best achieved by conducting expansive, long-term studies. Here, using counts of waders (Charadrii) collected from ca. 3500 sites over 30 years and covering a major portion of western Europe, we present the largest-scale study to show that faunal abundance is influenced by climate in winter. We demonstrate that the 'weighted centroids' of populations of seven species of wader occurring in internationally important numbers have undergone substantial shifts of up to 115 km, generally in a northeasterly direction. To our knowledge, this shift is greater than that recorded in any other study, but closer to what would be expected as a result of the spatial distribution of ecological zones. We establish that year-to-year changes in site abundance have been positively correlated with concurrent changes in temperature, but that this relationship is most marked towards the colder extremities of the birds' range, suggesting that shifts have occurred as a result of range expansion and that responses to climate change are temperature dependent. Many attempts to model the future impacts of climate change on the distribution of organisms, assume uniform responses or shifts throughout a species' range or with temperature, but our results suggest that this may not be a valid approach. We propose that, with warming temperatures, hitherto unsuitable sites in northeastern Europe will host increasingly important wader numbers, but that this may not be matched by declines elsewhere within the study area. The need to establish that such changes are occurring is accentuated by the statutory importance of this taxon in the designation of protected areas.

AB Cophyline narrow-mouthed frogs (Anura: Microhylidae) are a diverse endemic radiation of Madagascar. Cophylines contain a high proportion of range restricted species and constitute a good model system to understand patterns of evolutionary diversification in tropical ecosystems. We combine spatial and phylogenetic analyses for a near-complete taxon sample to test competing explanations for patterns of species richness (SR) and endemism. Our reconstruction of the phylogeny of cophylines indicates the presence of 22 new species and several instances of nonmonophyly. We found a strong historical signal in current cophyline ranges indicating a high degree of spatial niche conservatism in clade diversification, with clades occurring in the North of Madagascar constituting the most derived in the phylogeny. We identified six positively correlated centers of SIR and endemism that can neither be explained by stochastic models such as elevational or latitudinal mid-domain effect, nor by low-elevation river catchments. Instead, the locations of these centers in areas spanning a high altitudinal range in combination with specific climatic parameters support a key role of mountainous areas for speciation of these anurans, although we cannot exclude an influence of habitat loss due to human impact. High conservation priority is ascribed to these areas.

AB Ecological thresholds describe abrupt changes in ecological properties in time or space. In rangeland management, thresholds reflect changes in vegetation and soils that are expensive or impossible to reverse. The threshold concept has catalyzed important advances in rangeland management thinking, but it has also introduced two classes of drawbacks. First, the ambiguity of the term "threshold'' and the desire for simplicity in its application has led to an overemphasis on classification thresholds, such as vegetation cover values. Uncritical use of classification thresholds may lead to the abandonment of management efforts in land areas that would otherwise benefit from intervention. Second, it is possible that the invocation of thresholds and irreversible degradation may eventually result in the wholesale conversion of land areas that would have been recoverable or served important societal functions, such as biodiversity maintenance, that are not reflected in threshold definitions. I conclude with a recommendation to clarify the nature of thresholds by defining the relationships among pattern, process, and degradation and distinguishing preventive thresholds from restoration thresholds. We must also broaden the attributes used to define states and thresholds.

ID SPATIAL PREDICTION; REGRESSION; PERFORMANCE; ANIMALS
AB Increasing use is being made in conservation management of statistical models that couple extensive collections of species and environmental data to make predictions of the geographic distributions of species. While the relationships fitted between a species and its environment are relatively transparent for many of these modeling techniques, others are more 'black box' in character, only producing geographic predictions and providing minimal or untraditional summaries of the fitted relationships on which these predictions are based. This in turn prevents robust evaluation of the ecological sensibility of such models, a necessary process if model predictions are to be treated with confidence. Here we propose a new but simple method for visualizing modeled responses that can be implemented with any modeling method, and demonstrate its application using five common methods applied to the prediction of an Australian tree species. This is achieved by insetting an "evaluation strip" into the spatial data layers, which, after predictions have been made, can be clipped out and used for creating plots of the modelled responses. We present findings of the application strip for algorithms GLMs, GAMs, CLIM, DOMAIN and MARS. Evaluation strips can be constructed to investigate either uni-variate responses, or the simultaneous variation in predicted values in relation to two variables. The latter option is particularly useful for evaluating responses in models that allow the fitting of complex interaction terms. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recruitment is an important process in regulating many marine benthic communities and many studies have examined factors controlling the dispersal and distribution of larval immigrants. However, benthic species also have early post-settlement life-stages that are dramatically different from adult and larval stages. Predation on these stages potentially impacts measured recruitment and the benthic populations and communities that ultimately develop.
   We examined the consequences of post-settlement predation on 1-day-old to 1-month-old recruits of sessile invertebrates at two field sites in southern New England. One site (Breakwater) was in a protected area with few predators and the other (Pine Island) was < 1 km away in an open coast area with three different predator guilds: small and large invertebrates and fish. The Breakwater site had been dominated for > 10 years by colonial and solitary ascidians. These species were absent from the Pine Island site which was dominated by bryozoans. Our goal was to examine whether post-settlement predation influenced the development and subsequent structure of the epifaunal community.
   Here we examine long-term changes in community development resulting from post-settlement predation, and contrast these results to those of earlier experiments examining the reductions in observed recruitment by post-settlement predation. Our first long-term experiment examined natural community development at the two sites and whether transplanted communities changed when exposed to the different levels of predation at these sites. The communities that developed at both sites were consistently different from each other and similar to resident communities at their respective sites. On panels transplanted from the Breakwater to Pine Island, solitary ascidians and the colonial ascidian, Botryllus schlosseri, suffered high mortalities on both caged and uncaged treatments, indicative of predation by small predators that could enter cages. Some solitary ascidians did survive inside cages and the colonial ascidian, Botrylloides violaceus, became dominant on all transplanted treatments. On panels transplanted from Pine Island to the Breakwater, ascidians invaded and dominated all treatments except those that were originally caged at Pine Island.
   In the second long-term experiment, natural communities were allowed to develop on panels exposed at the Breakwater for 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks. Each set was transplanted to three treatments at Pine Island: open uncaged pilings, caged pilings to exclude fish and large invertebrates, and racks suspended above the bottom to exclude all predators. When 1-week-old communities were transplanted, after 2-3 weeks only bryozoans were found on the open and caged pilings, while colonial ascidians dominated the suspended rack treatment. When older 2-week-old communities were transplanted, colonial ascidians also became dominant in the caged piling treatment and when 3- and 4-week-old communities were transplanted colonial ascidians dominated all three treatments. Solitary ascidians were never abundant on open pilings exposed to fish and large benthic invertebrate predators.
   Post-settlement predator-prey interactions involved newly settled and juvenile life-stages of a variety of prey species and many invertebrate and vertebrate predator species. The effects of these interactions on recruitment did result in differences in the development and eventual species composition of the communities, even though predators had little if any effect on the adults of the prey species.

AB 1. Long-lived species play a paramount role in the structure and functioning of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The dramatic increase of human-induced disturbances may be irremediably affecting populations of long-lived species. Data on life-history traits on these species taking into account relevant temporal and spatial scales are very scarce for marine ecosystems, though these data are key to guarantee the conservation of these species and the communities that they shape.
   2. This study examined long-term data on life-history traits of the precious red coral (Corallium rubrum L., 1758) in the NW Mediterranean. This was performed by surveying the fate of 67 red coral colonies during 21 years in a shallow-water habitat (27 m depth).
   3. Photographic monitoring provided data on survivorship, whole and partial mortality, recruitment and growth of colonies allowing about 1000 observations on life-history traits.
   4. Red coral showed a high survivorship, 60% of colonies reaching 22 years of age. Whole mortality was significantly higher in juvenile colonies while partial mortality displayed the inverse pattern. Recruitment showed a pulse mode with a single peak at the beginning of the study and low rates thereafter. Average growth rates over the study period were extremely low: 0.24 +/- 0.05 mm year(-1) for the basal diameter, 1.78 +/- 0+/-7 mm year(-1) for colony height and 3.40 +/- 0+/-31 branches in 22 years.
   5. This study also examined size-related effects of harvesting on red coral populations since shallow-water populations (between 10 and 40 m depth) have long been submitted to intensive harvesting.
   6. Measurements (basal diameter and height) of 400 colonies corresponding to the largest ones dwelling in 10 currently harvested and two non-harvested populations were compared to analyse the effects on the population's recovery and potential colonies' maximum sizes. Harvested populations showed values that were about twice as low on average and up to four times lower for maximum values in colony size than in the non-harvested populations.
   7. Our study provides indisputable data on the longevity of colonies and the parsimonious population dynamics of C. rubrum. Current populations have shown a dramatic shift in their size structures characterized by the absence of large colonies. Taking into account results obtained in this study full recovery time of shallow-water harvested populations may be measured by several decades or even centuries.

AB There is an apparent paradox in our understanding of molecular evolution. Current biochemically based models predict that evolutionary trees should not be recoverable for divergences beyond a few hundred million years. In practice, however, trees often appear to be recovered from much older times. Mathematical models, such as those assuming that sites evolve at different rates [including a Gamma distribution of rates across sites (RAS)] may in theory allow the recovery of some ancient divergences. However, such models require that each site maintain its characteristic rate over the whole evolutionary period. This assumption, however, contradicts the knowledge that tertiary structures diverge with time, invalidating the rate-constancy assumption of purely mathematical models. We report here that a hidden Markov version of the covarion model can meet both biochemical and statistical requirements for the analysis of sequence data. The model was proposed on biochemical grounds and can be implemented with only two additional parameters. The two hidden parts of this model are the proportion of sites free to vary (covarions) and the rate of interchange between fixed sites and these variable sites. Simulation results are consistent with this approach, providing a better framework for understanding anciently diverged sequences than the standard RAS models. However, a Gamma distribution of rates may approximate a covarion model and may possibly be justified on these grounds. The accurate reconstruction of older divergences from sequence data is still a major problem, and molecular evolution still requires mathematical models that also have a sound biochemical basis.

A combined analysis of all the data equally weighted produced a single most-parsimonious cladogram with relatively strong support at the majority of nodes. The phylogenetic utility of different classes of molecular data was also examined. In particular, using a number of different measures of utility in both a combined and separate analysis framework, we focused on the distinction between mitochondrial and nuclear genes and between faster-evolving characters and slower-evolving characters. For the first comparison, by nearly any measure of utility, the nuclear genes are substantially more informative for resolving diopsid relationships than are the mitochondrial genes. The nuclear genes exhibit less homoplasy, are less incongruent with one another and with the combined data, ana contribute more support to the combined analysis topology than do the mitochondrial genes. Results from the second comparison however, provide little evidence of a clear difference in utility. Despite indications of rapid divergence and saturation, faster-evolving characters in both the nuclear and mitochondrial data sets still provide substantial phylogenetic signal. In general, inclusion of the more rapidly evolving data consistently improves the congruence among partitions.

AB A process-based, general ecosystem model (BIOME-BGC) was used to simulate daily gross primary production, maintenance and heterotrophic respiration, net primary production and net ecosystem carbon exchange of boreal aspen, jack pine and black spruce stands. Model simulations of daily net carbon exchange of the ecosystem (NEE) explained 51.7% (SE = 1.32 g C m(-2) day(-1)) of the variance in daily NEE derived from stand eddy flux measurements of CO2 during 1994. Differences between measured and simulated results were attributed to several factors including difficulties associated with measuring nighttime CO2 fluxes and model assumptions of site homogeneity. However, comparisons between simulations and field data improved markedly at coarser timescales. Model simulations explained 66.1% (SE = 0.97 g C m(-2) day(-1)) of the variance in measured NEE when 5-day means of daily results were compared. Annual simulations of aboveground net primary production ranged from 0.6-2.4 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and were concurrent with results derived from tree increment core measurements and allometric equations.
   Model simulations showed that all of the sites were net sinks (0.1-4.1 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) of atmospheric carbon for 1994. Older conifer stands showed narrow margins between uptake of carbon by net photosynthesis and carbon release through respiration. Younger stands were more productive than older stands, primarily because of lower maintenance respiration costs. However, all sites appeared to be less productive than temperate forests. Productivity simulations were strongly linked to stand morphology and site conditions. Old jack pine and aspen stands showed decreased productivity in response to simulated low soil water contents near the end of the 1994 growing season. Compared with the aspen stand, the jack pine stand appeared better adapted to conserve soil water through lower daily evapotranspiration losses but also exhibited a narrower margin between daily net photosynthesis and respiration. Stands subjected to water stress during the growing season may exist on the edge between being annual sources or sinks for atmospheric carbon.

AB Although cannibalism can act as a density-dependent regulator of population size in terrestrial systems, little is known of its effects in the marine environment. Herein we investigate the influence of cannibalism upon the early life history stages of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus Rathbun, emphasizing cannibalism between juveniles and postlarvae (i.e. megalopae) of the same year class. In laboratory mesocosms we examined various factors modulating cannibal-prey dynamics, specifically: (1) the effects of habitat and presence of conspecifics on postlarval metamorphosis rate; (2) the effect of metamorphosis rate on the mortality of postlarvae from both intra- and inter-cohort cannibalism; (3) the effects of habitat and predator density on the functional response of young juvenile blue crab predators to varying densities of postlarval prey, and (4) the effects of prey size and habitat on predation mortality.
   Inter-cohort cannibalism caused significant mortality in every crab size and habitat type combination, and was lower in grass than sand for all prey smaller than fifth instar. Cannibalism between postlarvae was associated with metamorphosis and was density-dependent in sand, but not present in grass. Metamorphosis rates of postlarvae were inversely density-dependent in sand, but density-independent and higher in grass, indicating that habitat and intra-cohort agonism likely affects postlarval metamorphosis rates. Inter-cohort cannibalism was negatively correlated with metamorphosis rates of postlarvae. The functional response of young juvenile cannibalistic blue crabs differed significantly between sand and grass habitats, and between medium and high predator densities. Juvenile crabs displayed a type II, inversely density-dependent functional response in sand, resulting in very high mortality at low densities of postlarval prey. In grass, the crabs displayed a weak type III, density dependent response, yielding significantly lower mortality at low prey densities. Thus, habitat complexity changes the form of the functional response in cannibal-prey interactions and grass provides a relative habitat refuge from cannibalism. Doubling the number of predators in grass decreased the consumption rates per predator significantly and eliminated the density-dependence, indicating that intraspecific density can qualitatively change the form of the functional response. In the crab size experiment, only prey smaller than fifth instars received a habitat refuge from cannibalism in grass, whereas fifth instars received a relative size refuge in sand.
   Our results demonstrate that intra-year class cannibalism can cause mortality upon settling megalopae and first juvenile instars that is dependent on prey density. We expect inter-cohort cannibalism to cause local extinction of cohorts settling in sand, especially at low settlement densities, and high mortality at moderate settlement densities in grass. Satiation of predators at high settlement densities in grass suggests that episodic settlement can overwhelm predators locally. Furthermore, density-dependent mutual interference within large cohorts in the grass beds likely reduces their predation efficiency? indicating that aggregation of conspecific predators in grass habitats does not necessary lead to an increase in predation pressure. Finally, a relative size-refuge from inter-cohort cannibalism for fifth instar crabs supports an ontogenetic habitat shift around this crab size, which may be influenced by density-dependent agonistic behavior within cohorts. We suggest that intra-year class cannibalism is a major process regulating both survival and dispersal in megalopae and juvenile blue crabs. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Genotyping of koalas at CA-repeat microsatellite loci has revealed significant differences in the levels of allelic diversity (A) and expected heterozygosity ((H) over bar(E)) between populations from north-eastern and south-eastern Australia. In the 10 populations studied, allelic diversity ranged from 8.0 in the Nowendoc population to 1.7 in the Kangaroo Is. population, and values of (H) over bar(E) ranged from 0.831 in the Nowendoc population to 0.331 in the Kangaroo Is. population. Data from pooled populations revealed koalas from the northeastern region had significantly higher levels of allelic diversity (A = 11.5+/-1.4) than those from south-eastern Australia (A = 5.3+/-1.0). Furthermore significantly higher heterozygosity levels were found in the north-eastern ((H) over bar(E) = 0.851) vs. the south-eastern ((H) over bar(E) = 0.436) regions of Australia. Following a near-extinction bottleneck in the 1920s, mainland Victorian and Kangaroo Is. koalas have been involved in an extensive program of relocations. The source populations of the relocated animals were islands in Westernport Bay, which were founded by very few individuals in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The significantly lower levels of variation between south-eastern Australian populations suggests that human intervention has had a severe effect on levels of genetic diversity in this region, and this may have long-term genetic consequences.

AB The genetic underpinnings associated with the earliest stages of plant and animal domestication have remained elusive. Because a genome-wide response to selection can take many generations, the earliest detectable changes associated with domestication may first manifest as heritable changes to global patterns of gene expression. Here, to test this hypothesis, we measured differential gene expression in the offspring of wild and first-generation hatchery steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) reared in a common environment. Remarkably, we find that there were 723 genes differentially expressed between the two groups of offspring. Reciprocal crosses reveal that the differentially expressed genes could not be explained by maternal effects or by chance differences in the background levels of gene expression among unrelated families. Gene-enrichment analyses reveal that adaptation to the novel hatchery environment involved responses in wound healing, immunity and metabolism. These findings suggest that the earliest stages of domestication may involve adaptation to highly crowded conditions.

AB In most cases, both roots and mycorrhizal fungi are needed for plant nutrient foraging. Frequently, the colonization of roots by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi seems to be greater in species with thick and sparsely branched roots than in species with thin and densely branched roots. Yet, whether a complementarity exists between roots and mycorrhizal fungi across these two types of root system remains unclear. We measured traits related to nutrient foraging (root morphology, architecture and proliferation, AM colonization and extramatrical hyphal length) across 14 coexisting AM subtropical tree species following root pruning and nutrient addition treatments. After root pruning, species with thinner roots showed more root growth, but lower mycorrhizal colonization, than species with thicker roots. Under multi-nutrient (NPK) addition, root growth increased, but mycorrhizal colonization decreased significantly, whereas no significant changes were found under nitrogen or phosphate additions. Moreover, root length proliferation was mainly achieved by altering root architecture, but not root morphology. Thin-root species seem to forage nutrients mainly via roots, whereas thick-root species rely more on mycorrhizal fungi. In addition, the reliance on mycorrhizal fungi was reduced by nutrient additions across all species. These findings highlight complementary strategies for nutrient foraging across coexisting species with contrasting root traits.

AB Input Variable Selection (IVS) is an essential step in the development of data-driven models and is particularly relevant in environmental modelling. While new methods for identifying important model inputs continue to emerge, each has its own advantages and limitations and no single method is best suited to all datasets and modelling purposes. Rigorous evaluation of new and existing input variable selection methods would allow the effectiveness of these algorithms to be properly identified in various circumstances. However, such evaluations are largely neglected due to the lack of guidelines or precedent to facilitate consistent and standardised assessment. In this paper, a new framework is proposed for the evaluation and inter-comparison of IVS methods which takes into account: (1) a wide range of dataset properties that are relevant to real world environmental data, (2) assessment criteria selected to highlight algorithm suitability in different situations of interest, and (3) a website for sharing data, algorithms and results (http://ivs4em.deib.polimi.it/). The framework is demonstrated on four IVS algorithms commonly used in environmental modelling studies and twenty-six datasets exhibiting different typical properties of environmental data. The main aim at this stage is to demonstrate the application of the proposed evaluation framework, rather than provide a definitive answer as to which of these algorithms has the best overall performance. Nevertheless, the results indicate interesting differences in the algorithms' performance that have not been identified previously. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Live corals are the key habitat forming organisms on coral reefs, contributing to both biological and physical structure. Understanding the importance of corals for reef fishes is, however, restricted to a few key families of fishes, whereas it is likely that a vast number of fish species will be adversely affected by the loss of live corals. This study used data from published literature together with independent field based surveys to quantify the range of reef fish species that use live coral habitats. A total of 320 species from 39 families use live coral habitats, accounting for approximately 8 % of all reef fishes. Many of the fishes reported to use live corals are from the families Pomacentridae (68 spp.) and Gobiidae (44 spp.) and most (66 %) are either planktivores or omnivores. 126 species of fish associate with corals as juveniles, although many of these fishes have no apparent affiliation with coral as adults, suggesting an ontogenetic shift in coral reliance. Collectively, reef fishes have been reported to use at least 93 species of coral, mainly from the genus Acropora and Porities and associate predominantly with branching growth forms. Some fish associate with a single coral species, whilst others can be found on more than 20 different species of coral indicating there is considerable variation in habitat specialisation among coral associated fish species. The large number of fishes that rely on coral highlights that habitat degradation and coral loss will have significant consequences for biodiversity and productivity of reef fish assemblages.

AB The effect of temperature and the influence of fresh substrate addition on soil organic matter decomposition are two key factors we need to understand to forecast soil carbon dynamics under climate change and rising CO2 levels. Here we perform a laboratory incubation experiment to address the following questions: 1) Does the temperature sensitivity differ between freshly added organic matter and bulk soil carbon? 2) Does the addition of fresh organic matter stimulate the decomposition of soil organic matter ("priming effect")? 3) If so, does this priming effect depend on temperature? In our study, we incubated sieved soil samples without and with two labelled plant litters with different C-13 signals for 199 days. The incubations were performed with two diurnal temperature treatments (5-15 degrees C, 15-25 degrees C) in a flow-through soil incubation system. Soil CO2 production was continuously monitored with an infrared gas analyser, while the C-13 signal was determined from gas samples. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were used to quantify microbial biomass. We observed that the instantaneous temperature sensitivity initially did not differ between the original and the amended soil. However in the amended treatment the temperature sensitivity slightly but significantly increased during the incubation time, as did the PLFA amount from microbial biomass. Further, we found that addition of fresh plant material increased the rate of decomposition of the original soil organic matter. On a relative basis, this stimulation was similar in the warm and cold treatments (46% and 52%, respectively). Overall our study contrasts the view of a simple physico-chemically derived substrate-temperature sensitivity relationship of decomposition. Our results rather request an explicit consideration of microbial processes such as growth and priming effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As urbanisation is set to continue, understanding the impact on wildlife becomes increasingly important if we are to be able to conserve biodiversity. As an excellent group of bioindicators, invertebrates can allow us to understand some of the forces in urban areas which impact upon biodiversity and wildlife populations. This paper discusses some of the trends in the abundance, diversity and richness of invertebrates related to urbanisation and the specific urban environmental and traffic factors which may be at play.

AB Integrating stakeholder knowledge into natural resource governance is considered to add flexibility to social-ecological systems (SES) because knowledge diversity reduces rigidity, represents multiple perspectives, and promotes adaptability in decision-making. Characterizing the differences between knowledge systems, however, is not easily accomplished. There are few metrics readily available to compare one knowledge system to another. This paper characterizes knowledge about a model SES, the summer flounder fishery in the mid-Atlantic, to evaluate differences and similarities in the structural and functional characteristics of stakeholder mental models. To measure these differences, we collected Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Maps (FCM) from several stakeholder groups (managers, scientists, harvesters, pre and post harvest sectors, and environmental NGOs) which comprise social agents within the SES. We then compared stakeholder groups' maps using graph theory indices to characterize the structure and function of the model system. We then combined stakeholder FCM to generate a community map which represents a theoretical model of the combination of stakeholder knowledge. Our study indicates that while there may be benefits to integrating knowledge in resource decision-making, it also has costs associated with it. Although integrating knowledge may increase structural knowledge, it may also decrease precision in understanding of how a system functions and be overly focused on driving components which would reduce the ability of decision-makers to predict system reaction to a decision or policy plan.

AB 1. A large proportion of the total river length on Earth comprises rivers that are temporary in nature. However, the effects of periodical dry events have received far less attention from ecologists than those of floods and low flows.
   2. This study concomitantly examined the effects of flow intermittence on invertebrates from the streambed surface and from a depth of 30 cm in the hyporheic zone. Invertebrates were collected during 3 years in the Albarine River, France, before and after summer dry events from 18 sites (seven were perennial) distributed along a longitudinal flow intermittence gradient.
   3. I predicted benthic and hyporheic density and taxonomic richness to decrease, and assemblage composition to shift from desiccation-sensitive to desiccation-resistant taxa with increased dry event duration. Second, I predicted benthic and hyporheic assemblages from sites that dried for longer periods to be nested subsets of assemblages from sites that dried for shorter periods. Last, I predicted a convergence in benthic and hyporheic assemblage composition with increasing duration of dry events, resulting from increased vertical migration of benthic taxa into the hyporheic sediments to cope with dry events.
   4. Increased dry event duration in the Albarine River led to a decrease in both benthic and hyporheic density and taxonomic richness. Invertebrate assemblage composition shifted along the gradient of increasing flow intermittence, but broad taxonomic overlap between perennial and temporary reaches and nestedness patterns indicated that these shifts were because of the loss of taxa susceptible to drying rather than selection for desiccation-resistant specialists.
   5. Assemblage composition between benthic and hyporheic invertebrates diverged with increasing dry event duration, suggesting that the hyporheic zone did not act as a refuge during dry events in this river.
   6. Quantitative studies on the relationships between ecology and intermittence are still rare but are needed to predict the consequences of future changes in flow intermittence. The relationships found in this study should be tested across a wide range of temporary rivers to better evaluate the generality of these findings.

AB Whether species that have persisted throughout historic climatic upheavals will survive contemporary climate change will depend on their ecological and physiological traits, their evolutionary potential, and potentially upon the resources that humans commit to prevent their extinction. For those species where temperatures influence sex determination, rapid global warming poses a unique risk of skewed sex ratios and demographic collapse. Here we review the specific mechanisms by which reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) may be imperilled at current rates of warming, and discuss the evidence for and against adaptation via behavioural or physiological means. We propose a scheme for ranking reptiles with TSD according to their vulnerability to rapid global warming, but note that critical data on the lability of the sex determining mechanism and on the heritability of behavioural and threshold traits are unavailable for most species. Nevertheless, we recommend a precautionary approach to management of reptiles identified as being at relatively high risk. In such cases, management should aim to neutralise directional sex ratio biases (e.g. by manipulating incubation temperatures or assisted migration) and promote adaptive processes, possibly by genetic supplementation of populations. These practices should aid species' persistence and buy time for research directed at more accurate prediction of species' vulnerability. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Contemporary environmental disturbances and historical contingencies are considered to be major factors driving current differences in microbial diversity. However, little was known about their relative importance. This study combines culture- independent molecular techniques and advanced statistical analyses to examine quantitatively the relative importance of contemporary disturbances and historical contingencies in influencing large- scale soil bacterial diversity using a large set of manipulated field- based molecular data ( 212 samples). Contemporary disturbances were represented by applications of different fertilizers N, P, K and organic manure ( OM) and historical contingencies by distinct geographic sampling locations and soil profiles. Multivariate regression tree ( MRT) analysis showed that diversity estimates were mainly distinguished by sampling locations, which explained 40.8% of the variation in bacterial diversity, followed by soil profiles ( 19.5%), sampling time ( 13.1%), OM ( 3.7%) and P ( 1.8%). Aggregated boosted tree ( ABT) analysis showed that the relative importance of different categorical factors on soil bacterial diversity variation was ranked as sampling locations, soil profiles, sampling time, OM and P. Both MRT and ABT analyses showed that historical contingencies were the dominant factor driving variation in bacterial diversity across a regional scale ( about 1000 km), whereas some contemporary disturbances also caused variation in bacterial diversity at a local scale. This study demonstrated that past events and contemporary disturbances had similar influence on soil bacterial diversity to that documented for macroorganisms, indicating that there might be some common aspects of biogeography to all organisms.

AB In a number of recent field studies, the positive response of soil respiration to warming has been shown to decline over time. The two main differing hypotheses proposed to explain these results are: (1) soil microbial respiration acclimates to the increased temperature, and (2) substrate availability within the soil decreases with warming so reducing the rate of soil respiration. To investigate the relative merits of these two hypotheses, soil samples (both intact cores and sieved samples) from a 3-year grassland soil-warming and shading experiment were incubated for 4 weeks at three different temperatures under constant laboratory conditions. We tested the hypothesis that sieving the soils would reduce differences in substrate availability between warmed and control plot samples and would therefore result in similar respiration rates if microbial activity had not acclimated to soil warming. In addition, to further test the effect of substrate availability, we compared the respiration rates of soils taken from shaded and unshaded plots. Both soil warming and shading significantly reduced respiration rates in the intact cores, especially under higher incubation temperatures. However, sieving the soil greatly reduced these differences suggesting that substrate availability, and not microbial acclimation to the higher temperatures, played the dominant role in determining the response of heterotrophic soil respiration to warming. The effect of shading appeared to be mediated by reduced plant productivity affecting substrate availability within the soil and hence microbial activity. Given the lack of evidence for thermal acclimation of microbial respiration, there remains the potential for prolonged carbon losses from soils in response to warming.

AB Effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning have been mainly studied in experiments that artificially create gradients in grassland plant diversity. Woody species were largely excluded from these early experiments, despite the ecological and socioeconomic importance of forest ecosystems. We discuss conceptual aspects of mechanistically driven research on the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship in forests, including the comparison of scientific approaches like 'observational studies', 'removal experiments', and 'synthetic-assemblage experiments'. We give a short overview on the differences between herbaceous and forest ecosystems, focusing on canopy characteristics, and the possibilities for individual versus population-based investigations.
   We present detailed information about the first large-scale, multisite and long-term biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment with tree species of temperate forests (BIOTREE - BIOdiversity and ecosystem processes in experimental TREE stands). At three sites of differing geology and local climate, we planted 200,000 saplings on a total area of 70 ha. At two sites, diversity gradients were established by varying the number of tree species (BIOTREE-SPECIES). At a third site, only functional diversity at a constant level of tree species richness was manipulated by selecting mixtures that differ in the functional trait values of the corresponding species (BIOTREE-FD). Additional experimental treatments at the subplot level include silvicultural management options, the addition of subdominant species, and the reduction of genetic diversity. Response variables focus on productivity, biogeochemical cycles and carbon sequestration, and resource use complementarity.
   We explore the use of different measures of functional diversity for a posteriori classifications of functional richness and their use in the analysis of our tree diversity experiment. The experiment is thought to provide a long-term research platform for a variety of scientific questions related to forest biodiversity and ecosystem processes. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

AB The emergence of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning debate in the last decade has renewed interest in understanding why some communities are more easily invaded than others and how the impact of invasion on recipient communities and ecosystems varies. To date most of the research on invasibility has focused on taxonomic diversity, i.e., species richness. However, functional diversity of the communities should be more relevant for the resistance of the community to invasions, as the extent of functional differences among the species in an assemblage is a major determinant of ecosystem processes.
   Although coastal marine habitats are among the most heavily invaded ecosystems, studies on community invasibility and vulnerability in these habitats are scarce. We carried out a manipulative field experiment in tide pools of the rocky intertidal to test the hypothesis that increasing functional richness reduces the susceptibility of macroalgal communities to invasion. We selected a priori four functional groups on the basis of previous knowledge of local species characteristics: encrusting, turf, subcanopy, and canopy species. Synthetic assemblages containing one, two, three, or four different functional groups of seaweeds were created, and invasion by native species was monitored over an eight-month period. Cover and resource availability in the assemblages with only one functional group showed different patterns in the use of space and light, confirming true functional differences among our groups. Experimental results showed that the identity of functional groups was more important than functional richness in determining the ability of macroalgal communities to resist invasion and that resistance to invasion was resource-mediated.

ID BRITISH BUTTERFLIES; CLIMATE
AB As the climate warms, many species are moving to higher latitudes and elevations. However, range shifts can be caused by many factors. These factors are unknown in most cases. The specific role of climate in these dynamics needs study to better predict future consequences of global warming. This case study evaluates whether warming,is driving the northward range expansion of a skipper butterfly (Atalopedes campestris). Recently colonized areas have warmed 2-4degreesC over the past 50 years. To assess the importance of climate change for population persistence in these areas, I compared population dynamics at two locations (at the current range edge and just inside the range) that differ by 2-3degreesC. Population growth rate at these two locations over two years was positively correlated with January mean and annual mean temperatures. To determine whether larval overwinter survivorship could explain this correlation, I transplanted larvae over winter to both sites. Larval survivorship was very low at both locations, but significantly lower at the range edge, probably because lower lethal temperatures frequently occurred there. To estimate the direct effect of cold stress on larval survivorship, I applied a previously derived hazard-rate model based on laboratory experiments. With input from field-measured daily mean temperature, the model accurately predicted transplant survivorship at both locations over two winters. Combined results from population and larval transplant analyses indicate that winter temperatures directly affect the persistence of A. campestris at its northern range edge, and that winter warming was a prerequisite for this butterfly's range expansion.

AB 1. Movements of hedgehogs, Erinaceus europaeus L., were analysed in relation to roads by recording their nocturnal foraging trajectories in urban areas adjacent to major road systems. Four male and four female hedgehogs at each of two sites were each tracked over five replicate trajectories of more than 3 h, using radio-telemetry and direct observation.
   2. Frequency of road crossings and use of habitat were compared to simulated random trajectories. For each observed trajectory, 100 trajectories were simulated with the same distribution of speeds as observed, but with random direction.
   3. Observed trajectories had lower rates of crossing large but not small roads than simulated, indicating that hedgehogs treat large roads as barriers during nightly foraging activities. Most hedgehogs were never observed to cross roads, whereas almost all simulated trajectories did cross both large and small roads.
   4. Crossing behaviour differed by site, but not by sex.
   5. Roads and road verges had the lowest rank in a habitat preference analysis at both sites, while playing fields, gardens and urban areas were preferred habitats. These results are discussed in relation to the regional scale preference for urban areas, and the attraction to road verges while dispersing, shown by hedgehogs.

AB In a microcosm experiment, I tested how species composition, species, richness. and community age affect the Susceptibility of grassland communities to invasion by a noxious weed (Centaurea solstitialis L.). I also examined how these factors influenced Centaurea's impact on the rest of the plant community.
   When grown in monoculture, eight species found in California's grasslands differed widely in their ability to suppress Centaurea growth. The most effective competitor in monoculture was Hemizonia congesta ssp. luzulifolia, which, like Centaurea, is a summer-active annual forb. On average, Centaurea growth decreased as the species richness of communities increased. However, no polyculture suppressed Centaurea growth more than the monoculture of Hemizonia. Centaurea generally made up a Smaller proportion of community, biomass in newly created ("new" microcosms than in older ("established") microcosms, largely because Centaurea's competitors were more productive in the new treatment. Measures of complementarity suggest that Centaurea partitioned resources with annual grasses in the new microcosms. This resource partitioning may help to explain Centaurea's great success in western North American grasslands.
   Centaurea strongly suppressed growth of some species, but hardly affected others. Annual grasses were the least affected species in the new monocultures, and perennial grasses were among the least affected species in the established monocultures. In the new microcosms. Centaurea's suppression of competing species marginally abated with increasing species, richness. This trend was a consequence of the declining success of Centaurea in species-rich communities, rather than a change in the vulnerability of these communities to suppression by a given amount of the invader. The impact of the invader was not related to specie., richness in the established microcosms. The results or this study suggest that, at the neighborhood level, diversity can limit invasibility and may reduce the impact of all invader.

AB Comparative genomic approaches to gene and cis-regulatory prediction are based on the principle that differential DNA sequence conservation reflects variation in functional constraint. Using this principle, we analyze noncoding sequence conservation in Drosophila for 40 loci with known or suspected cis-regulatory function encompassing > 100 kb of DNA. We estimate the fraction of noncoding DNA conserved in both intergenic and intronic regions and describe the length distribution of ungapped conserved noncoding blocks. Oil average, 22%-26% of noncoding sequences surveyed are conserved in Drosophila, with median block length similar to 19 bp. We show that point Substitution in conserved noncoding blocks exhibits transition bias as well as lineage effects in base composition, and Occurs more than all order of magnitude more frequently than insertion/deletion (indel) substitution. Overall, patterns of noncoding DNA structure and evolution differ remarkably little between intergenic and intronic conserved blocks, suggesting that the effects of transcription per se contribute minimally to the constraints operating on these Sequences. The results of this study have implications for the development of alignment and prediction algorithms specific to noncoding DNA, as well as for models of cis-regulatory DNA sequence evolution.

AB We examined the hypothesis that mutualists, predators, and host plant quality act in concert to determine the distribution and abundance of a common herbivore. The aphid, Chaitophorus populicola, is found only in association with ants, which provide tending services and protection from predators. As a consequence, aphid abundance declined by 88% on host plants located greater than or equal to6 m from an ant mound. Differences in host plant quality resulted in aphid fecundity being greatest on narrowleaf cottonwoods, 7-22% less on backcross hybrids, 37-46% less on F-1 hybrids, and 57-61% less on Fremont cottonwoods. Due to the combined effects of these factors, we found that the realized aphid habitat was only 21% of their potential habitat.
   On trees where aphids and tending ants are present, aphids and ants greatly outnumber any other arthropod species; therefore, we examined the hypothesis that the factors affecting aphid density and distribution are also determinants of arthropod community structure. On a per-tree basis, observational data showed that arthropod species richness was 51% greater and abundance was 67% greater on trees where aphid-ant mutualists were absent relative to trees where they were present. When aphids were experimentally removed and ants abandoned the tree, we found the same pattern. On a per-tree basis, arthropod species richness increased by 57%, and abundance increased by 80% where aphid-ant mutualists were removed, relative to control trees. Overall, a total of 90 arthropod species were examined in this study: 56% were found only on trees without aphid-ant mutualists, 12% were found only on trees with aphid-ant mutualists, and 32% were common to both. Specific guilds were also affected; the aphid-ant mutualism had a negative effect on herbivores, generalist predators, and other species of tending ants, and a positive effect on specialist enemies of aphids. These results suggest that, by examining the factors responsible for the population dynamics of a common herbivore, we may also uncover mechanisms that determine arthropod community structure. Furthermore, studies that address the role of mutualism in shaping communities are underrepresented in the literature; these results emphasize the importance of mutualism in ecological communities.

AB This review evaluates the generalisation that territorial, herbivorous damselfishes (Pomacentridae) have a major influence on the structure of algal, coral, other invertebrate and fish assemblages on coral reefs, Herbivorous damselfishes are a diverse, widespread and abundant component of reef fish assemblages and their territories take up a significant proportion of the shallow reef substratum, There are several mechanisms by which they potentially affect community structure within territories, including both food consumption and potential "fanning" activities, such as "weeding" of undesirable organisms, "killing" coral to grow algae, providing nutrients for algal "crops" and the aggressive "defence" of vital resources.
   A synthesis of the literature that documents assemblages both inside and outside territories revealed a number of common patterns. Erect filamentous algae often dominate territories, whereas low-lying crustose coralline and prostrate algae characterise adjacent areas. Furthermore, territories consistently support a greater biomass, productivity and species richness of algae than undefended areas. Experimental studies suggest that damselfishes modify regimes of disturbance and succession but the potentially different effects of feeding, farming and territorial exclusion suggest a more complex interaction of processes. There are also substantial differences between defended and undefended areas in coral species composition and densities of small, mobile organisms such as cryptofauna and juvenile fishes, whereas larger herbivorous fishes are excluded from territories. However, the larger-scale effects of these interactions on the ecology of "included" or "excluded" species has yet to be examined.
   Many of the above generalisations; may be premature as the literature is clearly biased towards a few larger, more aggressive species that maintain conspicuous algal mats. Our review draws attention to the numerically more abundant and less aggressive herbivorous species whose effects appear to be less dramatic. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal variability in the structure of damselfish communities is largely unknown, further restricting our ability to make valid generalisations. While the effects of territoriality have been tested by damselfish removals, more sophisticated experimental work is needed to assess the relative contributions of selective feeding, reduced herbivory, weeding and other farming activities. These mechanisms will be clearer if we have a better understanding of the function of territoriality, the actual benefits of algal turfs to the damselfishes and the separate tasks involved with establishing and maintaining territories.

AB We review recent developments in the debate over species concepts, exploring differences between the biological species concept (BSC) and the phylogenetic species concept (PSC). Three principal flaws in the BSC are reviewed: (1) the occurrence of paraphyletic or nonhistorical groups; (2) the misrepresention of the significance of hybridization among differentiated taxa; and (3) the logical difficulty in handling allopatric populations. Simple dine theory shows that likely times to fusion for hybridizing taxa exceed the average duration of most species in the fossil record. We address criticisms of PSCs (of which there are several), including the application of phylogenetic methods to populations, and whether species can be monophyletic. We suggest that the evolutionary species concept and the PSC might be more similar than generally appreciated. Empirical studies of variation in the Brown Towhee (Pipilo fuscus) complex and Fox Sparrow (Passerella iliaca) reveal that the BSC and PSC can lead to different species limits. Reasons are given for why the PSC is the preferred concept for comparative biology, phylogenetic inference, historical biogeography, estimation of biodiversity, hybrid-zone analysis, conservation biology, and speciation analysis. Despite problems associated with all species concepts, we think that a concept consistent with the PSC replace ''biological'' species concepts.

AB The study of social-ecological systems (SES) has been significantly shaped by insights from research on complex adaptive systems (CAS). We offer a brief overview of the conceptual integration of CAS research and its implications for the advancement of SES studies and methods. We propose a conceptual typology of six organizing principles of CAS based on a comparison of leading scholars' classifications of CAS features and properties. This typology clusters together similar underlying organizing principles of the features and attributes of CAS, and serves as a heuristic framework for identifying methods and approaches that account for the key features of SES. These principles can help identify appropriate methods and approaches for studying SES. We discuss three main implications of studying and engaging with SES as CAS. First, there needs to be a shift in focus when studying the dynamics and interactions in SES, to better capture the nature of the organizing principles that characterize SES behavior. Second, realizing that the nature of the intertwined social-ecological relations is complex has real consequences for how we choose methods and practical approaches for observing and studying SES interactions. Third, engagement with SES as CAS poses normative challenges for problem-oriented researchers and practitioners taking on real-world challenges.

AB Agricultural production involves the scaling of agricultural innovations such as disease-resistant and drought-tolerant maize varieties, zero-tillage techniques, permaculture cultivation practices based on perennial crops and automated milking systems. Scaling agricultural innovations should take into account complex interactions between biophysical, social, economic and institutional factors. Actual methods of scaling are rather empirical and based on the premise of 'find out what works in one place and do more of the same, in another place'. These methods thus do not sufficiently take into account complex realities beyond the concepts of innovation transfer, dissemination, diffusion and adoption. As a consequence, scaling initiatives often do not produce the desired effect. They may produce undesirable effects in the form of negative spill-overs or unanticipated side effects such as environmental degradation, bad labour conditions of farm workers and loss of control of farming communities over access to genetic resources. Therefore, here, we conceptualise scaling processes as an integral part of a systemic approach to innovation, to anticipate on the possible consequences of scaling efforts. We propose a method that connects the heuristic framework of the multi-level perspective on socio-technical transitions (MLP) to a philosophical 'modal aspects' framework, with the objective of elucidating the connectedness between technologies, processes and practices. The resultant framework, the PRactice-Oriented Multi-level perspective on Innovation and Scaling (PROMIS), can inform research and policymakers on the complex dynamics involved in scaling. This is illustrated in relation to three cases in which the framework was applied: scaling agro-ecological practices in Nicaragua, farmer field schools on cocoa cultivation in Cameroon and 'green rubber' cultivation in Southwest China.

AB Two main effects are proposed to explain biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships: niche complementarity and selection effects. Both can be functionally defined using the functional diversity (FD) and functional identity (FI) of the community respectively. Herein, we present results from the first tree diversity experiment that separated the effect of selection from that of complementarity by varying community composition in high-density plots along a gradient of FD, independent of species richness and testing for the effects of FD and community weighted means of traits (a proxy for FI) on stem biomass increment (a proxy for productivity). After 4 years of growth, most mixtures did not differ in productivity from the averages of their respective monocultures, but some did overyield significantly. Those positive diversity effects resulted mostly from selection effects, primarily driven by fast-growing deciduous species and associated traits. Net diversity effect did not increase with time over 4 years.

AB The North-Atlantic has warmed faster than all other ocean basins and climate change scenarios predict sea surface temperature isotherms to shift up to 600km northwards by the end of the 21st century. The pole-ward shift has already begun for many temperate seaweed species that are important intertidal foundation species. We asked the question: Where will climate change have the greatest impact on three foundational, macroalgal species that occur along North-Atlantic shores: Fucus serratus, Fucus vesiculosus, and Ascophyllum nodosum? To predict distributional changes of these key species under three IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate change scenarios (A2, A1B, and B1) over the coming two centuries, we generated Ecological Niche Models with the program MAXENT. Model predictions suggest that these three species will shift northwards as an assemblage or unit and that phytogeographic changes will be most pronounced in the southern Arctic and the southern temperate provinces. Our models predict that Arctic shores in Canada, Greenland, and Spitsbergen will become suitable for all three species by 2100. Shores south of 45 degrees North will become unsuitable for at least two of the three focal species on both the Northwest- and Northeast-Atlantic coasts by 2200. If these foundational species are unable to adapt to the rising temperatures, they will lose their centers of genetic diversity and their loss will trigger an unpredictable shift in the North-Atlantic intertidal ecosystem.

AB Enhanced soil respiration in response to global warming may substantially increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations above the anthropogenic contribution, depending on the mechanisms underlying the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. Here, we compared short-term and seasonal responses of soil respiration to a shifting thermal environment and variable substrate availability via laboratory incubations. To analyze the data from incubations, we implemented a novel process-based model of soil respiration in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Our process model combined a MichaelisMenten-type equation of substrate availability and microbial biomass with an Arrhenius-type nonlinear temperature response function. We tested the competing hypotheses that apparent thermal acclimation of soil respiration can be explained by depletion of labile substrates in warmed soils, or that physiological acclimation reduces respiration rates. We demonstrated that short-term apparent acclimation can be induced by substrate depletion, but that decreasing microbial biomass carbon (MBC) is also important, and lower MBC at warmer temperatures is likely due to decreased carbon-use efficiency (CUE). Observed seasonal acclimation of soil respiration was associated with higher CUE and lower basal respiration for summer- vs. winter-collected soils. Whether the observed short-term decrease in CUE or the seasonal acclimation of CUE with increased temperatures dominates the response to long-term warming will have important consequences for soil organic carbon storage.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) are often implemented to conserve or restore species, fisheries, habitats, ecosystems, and ecological functions and services; buffer against the ecological effects of climate change; and alleviate poverty in coastal communities. Scientific research provides valuable insights into the social and ecological impacts of MPAs, as well as the factors that shape these impacts, providing useful guidance or rules of thumb for science-based MPA policy. Both ecological and social factors foster effective MPAs, including substantial coverage of representative habitats and oceanographic conditions; diverse size and spacing; protection of habitat bottlenecks; participatory decision-making arrangements; bounded and contextually appropriate resource use rights; active and accountable monitoring and enforcement systems; and accessible conflict resolution mechanisms. For MPAs to realize their full potential as a tool for ocean governance, further advances in policy-relevant MPA science are required. These research frontiers include MPA impacts on nontarget and wide-ranging species and habitats; impacts beyond MPA boundaries, on ecosystem services, and on resource-dependent human populations, as well as potential scale mismatches of ecosystem service flows. Explicitly treating MPAs as policy experiments and employing the tools of impact evaluation holds particular promise as a way for policy-relevant science to inform and advance science-based MPA policy.

AB Long-distance oceanic rafting is frequently invoked as an explanation for broad geographic distributions of sedentary marine taxa, but evidence for this ecological process remains elusive. We explored empirically the potential of rafting as a dispersal mechanism by comparing circumpolar mtDNA variability in 3 codistributed subantarctic taxa: 2 direct-developing epifaunal crustacean species (Limnoria stephenseni, Parawaldeckia kidderi) and their macroalgal host (Durvillaea antarctica). A previous study of D. antarctica suggests that its subantarctic populations were established only postglacially, and we predict that the epifaunal invertebrates associated with it experienced a parallel island-colonization episode, facilitated by kelp-rafting. We generated and analysed mtDNA sequence data (cytochrome oxidase subunit I [COI] gene, >900 base pairs) from 89 L. stephenseni and 62 P. kidderi specimens and reanalysed previously published comparable data for D. antarctica. Both epifaunal species exhibited wide-scale circumpolar distributions of a single haplotype. Little sequence diversity was found within island samples, with the exception of P. kidderi in the Falkland Islands. The phylogeographic diversity and structuring of the invertebrates was very similar to that of their kelp host and consistent with a scenario of subantarctic recolonization and population expansion. The dependence of these otherwise non-dispersive crustaceans on macroalgal holdfasts for food and habitat, as well as the great abundance of D. antarctica adrift in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), support rafting as their most plausible recolonization mechanism. We suggest that macroalgal rafting may explain similarities in the species composition of intertidal marine communities across the subantarctic.

AB The S Iberian Peninsula and NW Africa constitute one of the main hotspots for plant biodiversity within the Mediterranean Basin. At the core of this hotspot, across the Strait of Gibraltar, lies a smaller region whose singular Cenozoic history and ecological features have created a distinct, nested sub-hotspot. In particular, an important relict flora, a high endemism, and the dominance of vegetation types other than the paradigmatic Mediterranean-type sclerophyllous forests and shrublands, are biogeographical features of paramount relevance. These singular environments may have provided suitable mesic habitats for stable human populations in this region throughout the Quaternary. Here we explore the possible causes of the unique biodiversity of this region. First, we show that endemism is associated with poor soils and mild Mediterranean climate, whereas relictness is primarily associated with riparian and humid habitats which might have remained relatively stable since the Late Tertiary. We then review and provide new results on lineage and molecular diversity of some taxa based on their evolutionary relationships inferred from phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses. These indicate that long-lived plants, such as trees, tend to show some discontinuity in effective gene flow, in comparison with short-lived and pioneer plants. Colonization abilities rather than dispersal vectors appear to be a crucial factor. We also analyze the role of microevolutionary processes that generate plant biodiversity in terms of reproductive features involved in lineage formation, such as breeding system, pollination biology and postdispersal regeneration. The few available studies show that this region is prone to changes in reproductive systems, associated with both abiotic and biotic conditions in the new habitats that plants face during colonization. Dispersal and regeneration ecology is especially important for relict species, as most of these species face some biotic (e.g., lack of dispersers, predation) and abiotic (edaphic and/or microclimate requirements) limitations to their recruitment. Nevertheless current limitations in the recruitment of relict plant species should not obscure the fact that they have been resilient in the face of Plio-Pleistocene climate changes in the Gibraltar region, whereas they became extinct in other Mediterranean areas. The relatively stable and mild climate of this region may have provided a suitable longterm environment for many other organisms, including humans. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plants simultaneously interact with multiple organisms which can both positively and negatively affect their growth. Herbivores can reduce plant growth through loss of plant biomass and photosynthetic area, while plant mutualists, such as mycorrhizal fungi, can increase plant growth through uptake of essential nutrients. This is the first study examining whether species-specific associations with mycorrhizal fungi alter plant tolerance to herbivory. We grew Plantago lanceolata plants with three species of mycorrhizal fungi previously shown to have differential impacts on plant growth and subjected them to herbivory by the specialist lepidopteran herbivore, Junonia coenia. Association with mycorrhizal fungus Glomus white provided the greatest growth benefit but did not alter plant response to herbivory. Alternatively, association with Archaeospora trappei provided less growth promotion but did lead to tolerance to herbivory in the form of an increased growth rate. Finally, an association with the fungus Scutellospora calospora led to neither plant growth promotion nor tolerance to herbivory. In fact, an association with S. calospora appeared to reduce plant tolerance to herbivory. An association with all three species of mycorrhizae resulted in a pattern of growth similar to that of plants grown only with Glomus white, suggesting that growth promotion by multiple mycorrhizal species is driven by the inclusion of a "super fungus,'' in this case, Glomus white. This work illustrates that plant response to herbivory depends upon the mycorrhizal fungal mutualist with which a plant is associated.

AB Efforts to anticipate threats to biodiversity take the form of species richness predictions (SRPs) based on simple correlations with current climate and habitat area. We review the major approaches that have been used for SRP, species-area curves and climate envelopes, and suggest that alternative research efforts may provide more understanding and guidance for management. Extinction prediction suffers from a number of limitations related to data and the novelty of future environments. We suggest additional attention to (1) identification of variables related to biodiversity that are diagnostic and potentially more predictable than extinction, (2) constraints on species dispersal and reproduction that will determine population persistence and range shifts, including limited sources or potential immigrants for many regions, and (3) changes in biotic interactions and phenology. We suggest combinations of observational and experimental approaches within a framework available for ingesting heterogeneous data sources. Together, these recommendations amount to a shift in emphasis from prediction of extinction numbers to identification of vulnerabilities and leading indicators of change, as well as suggestions for surveillance tools needed to evaluate important variables and the experiments likely to provide most insight.

ID TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE; MANAGEMENT
AB Lessons in conservation are often seen as resulting from cycles of overexploitation and subsequent depletion of resources, followed by catastrophic consequences of shortage and starvation, and finally, development of various strategies, including privatization of the commons, to conserve remaining resource stocks. While such scenarios have undoubtedly occurred on many occasions, we suggest that they are not the only means by which people develop conservation practices and concepts. There are other pathways leading to ecological understanding and conservation, which act at a range of scales and levels of complexity. These include: lessons from the past and from other places, perpetuated and strengthened through oral history and discourse; lessons from animals, learned through observation of migration and population cycles, predator effects, and social dynamics; monitoring resources and human effects on resources (positive and negative), building on experiences and expectations; observing changes in ecosystem cycles and natural disturbance events; trial and error experimentation and incremental modification of habitats and populations. Humans, we believe, are capable of building a sophisticated conservation ethic that transcends individual species and resources. A combination of conservation knowledge, practices, and beliefs can lead to increasingly greater sophistication of ecological understanding and the continued encoding of such knowledge in social institutions and worldview.

AB TO ecology, populations may be linked conceptually with landscapes through habitat and spatial population models. Usually, these models deal with single species and treat a range of uncertainties implicitly and explicitly. They assist managers in testing different management scenarios and making strategic decisions. Landscape pattern analysis was the first attempt to deal with multiple species, and it led to a range of landscape management strategies. Advances in landscape ecology, driven largely by the pragmatic needs of conservation, are building approaches to multispecies management that have stronger ecological foundations. However, their treatment of uncertainty is in its infancy. In this paper, we provide examples to illustrate some of these issues. We conclude that one of the most important sources of uncertainty is the choice of the modeling frame. We recommend that landscape planners use different kinds of models, identify important sources of uncertainty that may affect planning decisions, and seek options that are likely to result in tolerable outcomes, despite uncertainty.

AB Mortality is known to be high during the transition from larval to juvenile life stages in organisms that have complex life histories. We are only just beginning to understand the processes that influence which individuals survive this period of high mortality, and which traits may be beneficial. Here we document a field experiment that examines the selectivity of predation immediately following settlement to the juvenile population in a common tropical fish, Pomacentrus amboinensis (Pomacentridae). Newly metamorphosed fish were tagged and randomly placed onto replicated patches of natural habitat cleared of resident fishes. After exposure to transient predators for 3 days, fish were recollected and the attributes of survivors from patch reefs that sustained high mortality were compared to individuals from patch reefs that experienced low mortality. Seven characteristics of individuals, which were indicative of previous and present body condition, were compared between groups. Predation was found to be selective for fish that grew slowly in the latter third of their larval phase, were low in total lipids, and had a high standardized weight (Fulton's K). Traits developed in the larval phase can strongly influence the survival of individuals over this critical transition period for organisms with complex life cycles.

AB Population bottlenecks occur frequently in threatened species and result in loss of genetic diversity and evolutionary potential. These may range in severity between short intense bottlenecks, and more diffuse bottlenecks over many generations. However, there is little information on the impacts of different types of bottlenecks and disagreement as to their likely impacts. To resolve this issue, we subjected replicate Drosophila populations to intense bottlenecks, consisting of one pair over a single generation, versus diffuse bottlenecks consisting of an effective size of 100 over 57 generations. The intense and diffuse bottlenecks were designed to induce identical losses of heterozygosity. However, computer simulations showed that the probability of retaining alleles is lower in the intense than the diffuse bottleneck treatment. The effects of these bottlenecks on genetic diversity at nine microsatellite loci in Drosophila were evaluated. Bottlenecks substantially reduced allelic diversity, heterozygosity and proportion of loci polymorphic, changed allele frequency distributions and resulted in large differences among replicate populations. Allelic diversity, scaled by heterozygosity, was lower in the intense than the diffuse treatments. Short-term evolutionary potential, measured as the ability of bottlenecked populations to cope with increasing concentrations of NaCl, did not differ between the intense and diffuse bottlenecked populations. The effects of bottlenecks on short-term evolutionary potential relate to loss of heterozygosity, rather than allelic diversity.

AB There is increasing recognition that natural disturbance is a dominant force in forest development. This paper sets out to review natural disturbances and their effects in forests in Australia, and to determine whether or not the effects of management of forests for all of their benefits can be contained within the known effects of natural disturbance.
   The history and evolutionary significance of fire in Australia is reviewed, and the differing fire ecologies of two representative species, Eucalyptus regnans in the south-east (which is killed by fire and regenerates prolifically from seed after fire) and Eucalyptus marginata in the south-west (which survives all but the most severe fires and regenerates from both shoots and seeds) are outlined. The development of E. regnans following stand-replacing fire can be defined as highly resilient (returning quickly to the pre-disturbance state) and that of E. marginata as resistant (difficult to move from the pre-disturbance state).
   The topic of forest management in relation to disturbance is discussed within the context of forests of mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans), the world's tallest flowering plant, in south-eastern Australia. These forests in their natural state are essentially even-aged or at the most include two to three age-classes, the result of regeneration following stand-replacing bushfires. They produce timber of high value, and cuffent land planning and management prescriptions allow for about one-half of the forest area to be managed for timber production on a sustained-yield basis. The silvicultural system is clear-felling, followed by burning to give stand-replacing conditions. Mountain ash regenerating from this system is one of the fastest growing tree species in the world and at its best has a volume increment of 50 m3 ha-1 year-1 and net primary production of 35 t ha-1 year-1 over the first 10 years. There is no definitive evidence of a loss of diversity of plant species in timber production forests. The greatest problem is to manage land for timber production and for the diversity of fauna which depend on nesting hollows in large dead or living trees. However, all of the species found in older forests can be found in regrowth forests which have been burned or logged over the past 50 years and which include large dead or living trees with nesting hollows.
   Them has been speculation that harvesting mountain ash forests by clearfelling and regenerating them following slash-burning will lead to a loss of nutrients and a consequent loss of productivity. Nutrient cycling in mountain ash is shown to be resilient to disturbance. Rapid uptake of nutrients by the regenerating forest, immobilization of nutrients by microorganisms, and increased rates of nitrogen fixation are processes which lead to the conservation of nutrients following stand-replacing fires. There is no evidence of productivity decline following bushfire or timber harvesting.
   Another concern about forest harvesting is that there will be a reduction in carbon storage. The break-even point for E. regnans plantations yielding short-lived products (e.g. paper) is 3 7 years and for E. regnans forests grown for sawn timber, 60 years. Harvesting forests on rotations of 80-120 years will therefore result in an increase in carbon storage; however, it would take several rotations to restore carbon storage equivalent to that of old-age forest.
   Much of the literature on disturbance illustrates the difficulties of dealing with traditional and sometimes deeply entrenched concepts of how plant communities develop and the nature of the end-state of development. Development of mountain ash forest fits within Egler's model of initial floristic composition; there is no stable and self-perpetuating end-point, the climax is probably no more than the state where species change is immeasurably slow, and maximum diversity and productivity are maintained by random periodic disturbance. Does this set of conclusions provide the basis for management of the forest? The management of diversity in heath is discussed as an example; the issue is less contentious than in forests since no commercial product is harvested. Coastal heath on soils of poor fertility in Victoria also follows the model of initial floristic composition; diversity and productivity are maintained by fire, decreasing markedly within 20-50 years of disturbance. Management can use fire to maintain a mosaic of regenerated heathland to accommodate the range of responses of fauna and flora to disturbance, thereby maximizing diversity.
   The solution of maintaining diversity through an intermediate level of disturbance is well-established in the ecological literature; through disturbance, an equilibrium is never reached and higher diversity is maintained. In the managed forest, management dictates the disturbance regime (frequency, size and intensity) which must be fined to the attributes, or life histories, of the organisms to be managed.
   This paper presents the view that timber harvesting in Australian forests is ecologically sustainable and that the effects of management can be contained within the framework of those caused by natural disturbance. Given that each plot in the forest differs from all other plots and that none is at steady state, a solution for the management of diversity is to use the whole of the forest estate (parks, stream reserves, catchment reserves, old-age forest, forests of different ages resulting from past fires and logging) so that diversity of the estate, rather than diversity of each plot, is maximized.

AB True fungi (Fungi) and fungus-like organisms (e.g.Mycetozoa,Oomycota) constitute the second largest group of organisms based on global richness estimates, with around 3 million predicted species. Compared to plants and animals, fungi have simple body plans with often morphologically and ecologically obscure structures. This poses challenges for accurate and precise identifications. Here we provide a conceptual framework for the identification of fungi, encouraging the approach of integrative (polyphasic) taxonomy for species delimitation, i.e. the combination of genealogy (phylogeny), phenotype (including autecology), and reproductive biology (when feasible). This allows objective evaluation of diagnostic characters, either phenotypic or molecular or both. Verification of identifications is crucial but often neglected. Because of clade-specific evolutionary histories, there is currently no single tool for the identification of fungi, although DNA barcoding using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) remains a first diagnosis, particularly in metabarcoding studies. Secondary DNA barcodes are increasingly implemented for groups where ITS does not provide sufficient precision. Issues of pairwise sequence similarity-based identifications and OTU clustering are discussed, and multiple sequence alignment-based phylogenetic approaches with subsequent verification are recommended as more accurate alternatives. In metabarcoding approaches, the trade-off between speed and accuracy and precision of molecular identifications must be carefully considered. Intragenomic variation of the ITS and other barcoding markers should be properly documented, as phylotype diversity is not necessarily a proxy of species richness. Important strategies to improve molecular identification of fungi are: (1) broadly document intraspecific and intragenomic variation of barcoding markers; (2) substantially expand sequence repositories, focusing on undersampled clades and missing taxa; (3) improve curation of sequence labels in primary repositories and substantially increase the number of sequences based on verified material; (4) link sequence data to digital information of voucher specimens including imagery. In parallel, technological improvements to genome sequencing offer promising alternatives to DNA barcoding in the future. Despite the prevalence of DNA-based fungal taxonomy, phenotype-based approaches remain an important strategy to catalog the global diversity of fungi and establish initial species hypotheses.

AB Many insect species are under threat from the anthropogenic drivers of global change. There have been numerous well-documented examples of insect population declines and extinctions in the scientific literature, but recent weaker studies making extreme claims of a global crisis have drawn widespread media coverage and brought unprecedented public attention. This spotlight might be a double-edged sword if the veracity of alarmist insect decline statements do not stand up to close scrutiny.
   We identify seven key challenges in drawing robust inference about insect population declines: establishment of the historical baseline, representativeness of site selection, robustness of time series trend estimation, mitigation of detection bias effects, and ability to account for potential artefacts of density dependence, phenological shifts and scale-dependence in extrapolation from sample abundance to population-level inference.
   Insect population fluctuations are complex. Greater care is needed when evaluating evidence for population trends and in identifying drivers of those trends. We present guidelines for best-practise approaches that avoid methodological errors, mitigate potential biases and produce more robust analyses of time series trends.
   Despite many existing challenges and pitfalls, we present a forward-looking prospectus for the future of insect population monitoring, highlighting opportunities for more creative exploitation of existing baseline data, technological advances in sampling and novel computational approaches. Entomologists cannot tackle these challenges alone, and it is only through collaboration with citizen scientists, other research scientists in many disciplines, and data analysts that the next generation of researchers will bridge the gap between little bugs and big data.

AB Leaf mass per area (LMA) is a morphological trait widely used as a good indicator of plant functioning (i.e. photosynthetic and respiratory rates, chemical composition, resistance to herbivory, etc.). The LMA can be broken down into the leaf density (LD) and leaf volume to area ratio (LVA or thickness), which in turn are determined by anatomical tissues and chemical composition. The aim of this study is to understand the anatomical and chemical characteristics related to LMA variation in species growing in the field along a water availability gradient. We determined LMA and its components (LD, LVA and anatomical tissues) for 34 Mediterranean (20 evergreen and 14 deciduous) woody species. Variation in LMA was due to variation in both LD and LVA. For both deciduous and evergreen species LVA variation was strongly and positively related with mesophyll volume per area (VA or thickness), but for evergreen species positive relationships of LVA with the VA of epidermis, vascular plus sclerenchyma tissues and air spaces were found as well. The leaf carbon concentration was positively related with mesophyll VA in deciduous species, and with VA of vascular plus sclerenchymatic tissues in evergreens. Species occurring at the sites with lower water availability were generally characterised by a high LMA and LD.

AB Research on ecosystem services has become a dominant field within environmental management, framing the way in which human-nature relationships are understood and managed. Although ecosystem services are usually defined as 'the benefits that humans receive from nature', our work shows that most services are actually co-produced by a mixture of natural capital and various forms of social, human, financial and technological capital. Here, we review how ecosystem services are co-produced, and then we assess how this affects the quantity, quality, trade-offs, resilience and the equity of the distribution of ecosystem services. Then we discuss the implications of co-production for sustainability. Finally, we present some challenges for an adequate consideration of co-production within the assessment of ecosystem services.

AB Nutrient resorption (NR) plays a key role in the nutrient conservation of plants. However, a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that control NR remains limited. In this review, we examine how intrinsic controls (e.g., genetic variability and plant development) and extrinsic environmental controls (e.g., climate and soil fertility) influence NR. We also examined conceptual NR advances, mass loss correction, measurement in non-leaf plant tissues for whole-plant nutrient budget accounting, and the use of stoichiometric ratios in place of individual elements. Nutrient resorption from senescing leaves is greater than that from stems/culms or roots. Nutrients resorbed from stems and roots in woody plants are lower than in non-woody plants. Deciduous plants are more efficient in resorbing leaf nutrients prior to senescence than are evergreen plants. Furthermore, reproductive efforts tend to increase NR. Along a latitudinal gradient of terrestrial biomes, nitrogen resorption efficiency decreases and phosphorus resorption efficiency increases with increasing temperature and precipitation; however, latitudinal patterns reflect the influences of several coupling factors such as genetic variation, climate, soil, and disturbance history. Nutrient fertilization experiments have demonstrated that increased soil fertility reduces NR. The inquiries into the impacts of ongoing climate change on NR are still at a nascent stage. Future NR studies are needed to better understand the independent effects of a wide range of genetic variation, plant development, and environment, and possibly the different responses of plants to environmental change; particularly elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global warming.

AB There is a fundamental trade-off between leaf traits associated with either resource acquisition or resource conservation. This gradient of trait variation, called the economics spectrum, also applies to fine roots, but whether it is consistent for coarse roots or at the plant community level remains untested. We measured a set of morphological and chemical root traits at a community level (functional parameters; FP) in 20 plant communities located along land-use intensity gradients and across three climatic zones (tropical, mediterranean and montane). We hypothesized (i) the existence of a root economics spectrum in plant communities consistent within root types (fine, < 2mm; coarse, 2-5mm), (ii) that variations in root FP occur with soil depths (top 20cm of soil and 100-150cm deep) and (iii) along land-use gradients. Root FP covaried, in line with the resource acquisition-conservation trade-off, from communities with root FP associated with resource acquisition (e.g. high specific root length, SRL; thin diameters and low root dry matter contents, RDMC) to root FP associated with resource conservation (e.g. low SRL, thick diameters and high RDMC). This pattern was consistent for both fine and coarse roots indicating a strong consistency of a trade-off between resource acquisition and conservation for plant roots. Roots had different suites of traits at different depths, suggesting a disparity in root function and exploitation capacities. Shallow, fine roots were thinner, richer in nitrogen and with lower lignin concentrations associated with greater exploitation capacities compared to deep, fine roots. Shallow, coarse roots were richer in nitrogen, carbon and soluble concentrations than deep, coarse roots. Fine root parameters of highly disturbed, herbaceous-dominated plant communities in poorer soils were associated with foraging strategies, that is greater SRL and lower RDMC and lignin concentration than those from less disturbed communities. Coarse roots, however, were less sensitive to the land-use gradient.Synthesis. This study demonstrates the existence of a general trade-off in root construction at a community level, which operates within all root types, suggesting that all plant tissues are controlled by the trade-off between resource acquisition and conservation.

AB Characterization of large numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout a genome has the power to refine the understanding of population demographic history and to identify genomic regions under selection in natural populations. To this end, population genomic approaches that harness the power of next-generation sequencing to understand the ecology and evolution of marine invertebrates represent a boon to test long-standing questions in marine biology and conservation. We employed restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to identify SNPs in natural populations of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, an emerging cnidarian model with a broad geographic range in estuarine habitats in North and South America, and portions of England. We identified hundreds of SNP-containing tags in thousands of RAD loci from 30 barcoded individuals inhabiting four locations from Nova Scotia to South Carolina. Population genomic analyses using high-confidence SNPs resulted in a highly-resolved phylogeography, a result not achieved in previous studies using traditional markers. Plots of locus-specific FST against heterozygosity suggest that a majority of polymorphic sites are neutral, with a smaller proportion suggesting evidence for balancing selection. Loci inferred to be under balancing selection were mapped to the genome, where 90% were located in gene bodies, indicating potential targets of selection. The results from analyses with and without a reference genome supported similar conclusions, further highlighting RAD-seq as a method that can be efficiently applied to species lacking existing genomic resources. We discuss the utility of RAD-seq approaches in burgeoning Nematostella research as well as in other cnidarian species, particularly corals and jellyfishes, to determine phylogeographic relationships of populations and identify regions of the genome undergoing selection.

AB Camera traps have become the main method for estimating jaguar (Panthera onca) densities. Over 74 studies have been carried out throughout the species range following standard design recommendations. We reviewed the study designs used by these studies and the results obtained. Using simulated data we evaluated the performance of different statistical methods for estimating density from camera trap data including the closed-population capture-recapture models M-o and M-h with a buffer of 1/2 and the full mean maximum distance moved (MMDM) and spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models under different study designs and scenarios. We found that for the studies reviewed density estimates were negatively correlated with camera polygon size and MMDM estimates were positively correlated. The simulations showed that for camera polygons that were smaller than approximately one home range density estimates for all methods had a positive bias. For large polygons the Mh MMDM and SECR model produced the most accurate results and elongated polygons can improve estimates with the SECR model. When encounter rates and home range sizes varied by sex, estimates had a negative bias for models that did not include sex as a covariate. Based on the simulations we concluded that the majority of jaguar camera trap studies did not meet the requirements necessary to produce unbiased density estimates and likely overestimated true densities. We make clear recommendations for future study designs with respect to camera layout, number of cameras, study length, and camera placement. Our findings directly apply to camera trap studies of other large carnivores. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ecologists are increasingly recognizing the conservation significance of microrefugia, but it is inherently difficult to locate these small patches with unusual climates, and hence they are also referred to as cryptic refugia. Here we introduce a new methodology to quantify and locate potential microrefugia using fine-scale topoclimatic grids that capture extreme conditions, stable climates, and distinct differences from the surrounding matrix. We collected hourly temperature data from 150 sites in a large (200km by 300km) and diverse region of New South Wales, Australia, for a total of 671days over 2years. Sites spanned a range of habitats including coastal dune shrublands, eucalypt forests, exposed woodland ridges, sheltered rainforest gullies, upland swamps, and lowland pastures. Climate grids were interpolated using a regional regression approach based on elevation, distance to coast, canopy cover, latitude, cold-air drainage, and topographical exposure to winds and radiation. We identified extreme temperatures on two separate climatic gradients: the 5th percentile of minimum temperatures and the 95th percentile of maximum temperatures. For each gradient, climatic stability was assessed on three different time scales (intra-seasonal, intra-annual and inter-annual). Differences from the matrix were assessed using a moving window with a 5km radius. We averaged the Z-scores for these extreme, stable and isolated climates to identify potential locations of microrefugia. We found that our method successfully predicted the location of communities that were considered to occupy refugia, such as rainforests that have progressively contracted in distribution over the last 2.5 million years, and alpine grasslands that have contracted over the last 15 thousand years. However, the method was inherently sensitive to the gradient selected and other aspects of the modelling process. These uncertainties could be dealt with in a conservation planning context by repeating the methodology with various parameterizations and identifying areas that were consistently identified as microrefugia.

AB Nonlinear ecological responses to anthropogenic forcing are common, and in some cases, the ecosystem responds by assuming a new stable state. This article is an overview and serves as the introduction to several articles in this BRIDGES cluster that are directed toward managers interested in dealing with nonlinear responses in freshwaters, particularly streams. A threshold or breakpoint occurs where the system responds rapidly to a relatively small change in a driver. The existence of a threshold can signal a change in system configuration to an alternative stable state, although such a change does not occur with all thresholds. In general, a mechanistic understanding of ecological dynamics is required to predict thresholds, where they will occur, and if they are associated with the occurrence of alternative stable states. Thresholds are difficult to predict, although a variety of univariate methods has been used to indicate thresholds in ecological data. When we applied several methods to one type of response variable, the resulting threshold values varied 3-fold, indicating that more research on detection methods is necessary. Numerous case studies suggest that the threshold concept is important in all ecosystems. Managers should be aware that human actions might result in undesirable rapid changes and potentially an unwanted alternative stable state, and that recovery from that state might require far more resources and time than avoiding entering the state in the first place would have required. Given the difficulties in predicting thresholds and alternative states, the precautionary approach to ecosystem management is probably the most prudent.

AB Understanding the extent to which natural streamflow characteristics have been altered is an important consideration for ecological assessments of streams. Assessing hydrologic condition requires that we quantify the attributes of the flow regime that would be expected in the absence of anthropogenic modifications. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether selected streamflow characteristics could be predicted at regional and national scales using geospatial data. Long-term, gaged river basins distributed throughout the contiguous US that had streamflow characteristics representing least disturbed or near pristine conditions were identified. Thirteen metrics of the magnitude, frequency, duration, timing and rate of change of streamflow were calculated using a 20-50 year period of record for each site. We used random forests (RF), a robust statistical modelling approach, to develop models that predicted the value for each streamflow metric using natural watershed characteristics. We compared the performance (i.e. bias and precision) of national-and regional-scale predictive models to that of models based on landscape classifications, including major river basins, ecoregions and hydrologic landscape regions (HLR). For all hydrologic metrics, landscape stratification models produced estimates that were less biased and more precise than a null model that accounted for no natural variability. Predictive models at the national and regional scale performed equally well, and substantially improved predictions of all hydrologic metrics relative to landscape stratification models. Prediction error rates ranged from 15 to 40%, but were <= 25% for most metrics. We selected three gaged, non-reference sites to illustrate how predictive models could be used to assess hydrologic condition. These examples show how the models accurately estimate pre-disturbance conditions and are sensitive to changes in streamflow variability associated with long-term land-use change. We also demonstrate how the models can be applied to predict expected natural flow characteristics at ungaged sites. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Current discussions in evolutionary ecology and conservation genetics focus on the relative importance of using selective neutral markers or markers of coding genes to identify adaptive and evolutionary relevant processes. Genetic diversity might be particularly important in immune genes ( e. g., in genes of the major histocompatibility complex, MHC), which are influencing pathogen and parasite resistance. We investigated the effects of neutral versus adaptive genetic variation in parasite resistance in a natural population of fat-tailed dwarf lemurs ( Cheirogaleus medius). No association between neutral overall individual genetic diversity and parasite load could be detected. In 149 individuals, we identified 50 MHC class II alleles of the functionally important duplicated DRB locus. The investigation of the functional importance of immune gene ( MHC) diversity and parasite selection in natural populations is often problematic due to extensive polymorphism in the MHC genes and restrictions in available sample sizes. Here, for the first time we applied an approach that has been developed in human medical studies. Eleven MHC class II supertypes were identified based on shared antigen-binding similarities. The number of individual MHC supertypes had no influence on the nematode burden. However, we found evidence for a specific MHC supertype ( supertype 1) that was linked to infected individuals, a higher number of different nematode infections and high intensity of infection per individual. Moreover, one rare MHC supertype ( supertype 7) was revealed to be advantageous with respect to parasite burden. Thus, our results add evidence to the small body of studies that show significant associations between specific MHC constitutions and naturally occurring parasites in the complexity of natural populations.

AB The loss and fragmentation of forest habitats by human land use are recognised as important factors influencing the decline of forest-dependent fauna. Mammal species that are dependent upon forest habitats are particularly sensitive to habitat loss and fragmentation because they have highly specific habitat requirements, and in many cases have limited ability to move through and utilise the land use matrix. We addressed this problem using a case study of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) surveyed in a fragmented rural-urban landscape in southeast Queensland, Australia. We applied a logistic modelling and hierarchical partitioning analysis to determine the importance of forest area and its configuration relative to site (local) and patch-level habitat variables. After taking into account spatial auto-correlation and the year of survey, we found koala occurrence increased with the area of all forest habitats, habitat patch size and the proportion of primary Eucalyptus tree species; and decreased with mean nearest neighbour distance between forest patches, the density of forest patches, and the density of sealed roads. The difference between the effect of habitat area and configuration was not as strong as theory predicts, with the configuration of remnant forest becoming increasingly important as the area of forest habitat declines. We conclude that the area of forest, its configuration across the landscape, as well as the land use matrix, are important determinants of koala occurrence, and that habitat configuration should not be overlooked in the conservation of forest-dependent mammals, such as the koala. We highlight the implications of these findings for koala conservation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change is expected to have a number of impacts on biological communities including range extensions and contractions. Recent analyses of multidecadal data sets have shown such monotonic shifts in the distribution of plankton communities and various fish species, both groups for which there is a large amount of historical data on distribution. However, establishing the implications of climate change for the range of endangered species is problematic as historic data are often lacking. We therefore used a different approach to predict the implications of climate change for the range of the critically endangered planktivourous leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). We used long-term satellite telemetry to define the habitat utilization of this species. We show that the northerly distribution limit of this species can essentially be encapsulated by the position of the 15 degrees C isotherm and that the summer position of this isotherm has moved north by 330 km in the North Atlantic in the last 17 years. Consequently, conservation measures will need to operate over ever-widening areas to accommodate this range extension.

AB River flow regimes, controlled by climatic and catchment factors, vary over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. This hydrological dynamism is important in determining the structure and functioning of riverine ecosystems; however, such hydroecological associations remain poorly quantified. This paper explores and models relationships between a suite of flow regime predictors and macroinvertebrate community metrics from 83 rivers in England and Wales. A two-stage analytical approach was employed: (1) classification of 83 river basins based upon the magnitude and shape (form) of their long-term (1980-1999) average annual regime to group basins with similar flow responses; and (2) examination of relationships between a total of 201 flow regime descriptors identified by previous researchers and macroinvertebrate community metrics for the whole data set and long-term flow regime classes over an 11-year period (1990-2000). The classification method highlighted large-scale patterns in river flow regimes, identifying five magnitude classes and three shape classes. A west-east trend of flow regime magnitude (high-low) and timing (early-late peak) was displayed across the study area, reflecting climatic gradients and basin controls (e.g. lithology). From the suite of hydrological variables, those associated with the magnitude of the flow regime consistently produced the strongest relationships with macroinvertebrate community metrics for all sites and for the long-term regime composite classes. The results indicate that the classification (subdivision) of rivers into flow regime regions potentially offers a means of increasing predictive capacity and, in turn, better management of fluvial hydrosystems.

AB Soil microorganisms mediate many critical ecosystem processes. Little is known, however, about the factors that determine soil microbial community composition, and whether microbial community composition influences process rates. Here, we investigated whether aboveground plant diversity affects soil microbial community composition, and whether differences in microbial communities in turn affect ecosystem process rates. Using an experimental system at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we found that plant diversity (plots contained 1, 3, 5, or > 25 plant species) had a significant effect on microbial community composition (as determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis). The different microbial communities had significantly different respiration responses to 24 labile carbon compounds. We then tested whether these differences in microbial composition and catabolic capabilities were indicative of the ability of distinct microbial communities to decompose different types of litter in a fully factorial laboratory litter transplant experiment. Both microbial biomass and microbial community composition appeared to play a role in litter decomposition rates. Our work suggests, however, that the more important mechanism through which changes in plant diversity affect soil microbial communities and their carbon cycling activities may be through alterations in their abundance rather than their community composition.

AB Aims This paper reviews the way optimization theory has been used in canopy models to analyse the adaptive significance of photosynthesis-related plant characteristics and their consequences for the structure and species composition of vegetation stands.
   Scope In most studies simple optimization has been used with trait values optimal when they lead to maximum whole-stand photosynthesis. This approach is subject to the condition that the optimum for one individual is independent of the characteristics of its neighbours. This seems unlikely in vegetation stands where neighbour plants strongly influence each other's light climate. Not surprisingly, there are consistent deviations between predicted plant traits and real values: plants tend to be taller, distribute nitrogen more evenly among their leaves and produce more leaf area which is projected more horizontally than predicted by models.
   Conclusions By applying game theory to individual plant-based canopy models, other studies have shown that optimal vegetation stands with maximum whole-stand photosynthesis are not evolutionarily stable. They can be successfully invaded by mutants that are taller, project their leaves more horizontally or that produce greater than optimal leaf areas. While these individual-based models can successfully predict the canopy structure of vegetation stands. they are invariably determined at unique optimal trait values. They do not allow for the co-existence of more than one species with different characteristics. Canopy models can contribute to our understanding of species coexistence through (a) simultaneous analysis of the various traits that determine light capture and photosynthesis and the trade-offs between them, and (b) consideration of trade-offs associated with specialization to different positions in the niche space defined by temporal and spatial heterogeneity of resources.

AB We report a landscape-scale study investigating the responses of small mammals and lizards to fire in a central Australian hummock grassland. Vertebrates were surveyed on 26 study grids aged from 0 to >25 years post-fire. Analyses demonstrated that lizard and small mammal assemblages showed markedly different responses to each other with respect to post-fire vegetation succession. Lizard community composition could be arrayed along a single continuum of vegetation structure and conformed to a directional model for post-fire succession. In contrast, small mammal assemblages could not be arrayed along a continuum of post-fire vegetation succession. Geographical locality, rainfall, seedbank density and cattle grazing were prominent correlates of mammal assemblage structure. We propose a non-equilibrium state-and-transition model to describe small mammal community dynamics. This model has four temporal or geographical states that are characterized by different abundances of small mammals, and eight transitions that prompt shifts from one state to another. The model can be used to describe assemblage composition and identify areas or time periods when management activities should be implemented. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phylogenetic trees showing the evolutionary relatedness of Enterobacteriaceae based upon gyrB and 16S rRNA genes were compared. Congruence among trees of these molecules indicates that the genomes of these species are not completely mosaic and that molecular systematic studies can be carried out. Phylogenetic trees based on gyrB sequences appeared to be more reliable at determining relationships among Serratia species than trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. gyrB sequences from Serratia species formed a monophyletic group validated by significant bootstrap values. Serratia fonticola had the most deeply branching gyrB sequence in the Serratia monophyletic group, which was consistent with its atypical phenotypic characteristics. Klebsiella and Enterobacter genera seemed to be polyphyletic, but the branching patterns of gyrB and 165 rRNA gene trees were not congruent. Enterobacter aerogenes was grouped with Klebsiella pneumoniae on the gyrB phylogenetic tree, which supports that this species could be transferred to the Klebsiella genus. Unfortunately, 16S rRNA and gyrB phylogenetic trees gave conflicting evolutionary relationships for Citrobacter freundii because of its unusual gyrB evolutionary process. gyrB lateral gene transfer was suspected for Hafnia alvei. Saturation of gyrB genes was observed by the pairwise comparison of Proteus spp., Providencia alcalifaciens and Morganelia morganii sequences. Depending on their level of variability, 16S rRNA gene sequences were useful for describing phylogenetic relationships between distantly related Enterobacteriaceae, whereas gyrB sequence comparison was useful for inferring intra- and some intergeneric relationships.

The primary transformants were screened for the Rubisco to leaf N ratio, and the transformant with 65% wild-type Rubisco was selected as a plant set with optimal Rubisco content at saturating. CO2 partial pressures for photosynthesis under conditions of high irradiance and 25 degrees C. This optimal Rubisco content was estimated from the amounts and kinetic constants of Rubisco and the gas-exchange data. The R-1 selfed progeny of the selected transformant were grown hydroponically with different N concentrations. Rubisco content in the R-1 population was distributed into two groups: 56 plants had about 65% wild-type Rubisco, whereas 23 plants were very similar to the wild type. Although the plants with decreased Rubisco showed 20% lower rates of light-saturated photosynthesis in normal air (36 Pa CO2), they had 5 to 15% higher rates of photosynthesis in elevated partial pressures of CO2 (100-115 Pa CO2) than the wild-type plants for a given leaf N content. We conclude that the rice plants with 65% wild-type Rubisco show a higher N-use efficiency of photosynthesis under conditions of saturating CO2 and high irradiance.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the effect of low-quality diets and increased energy needs on nutritional aspects of the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster).  In the laboratory, high-fiber diets were correlated with higher rates of food intake and larger hindguts, as well as a lower digestibility of dry matter, cell solubles, energy, and nitrogen, but higher fiber digestibilities than low-fiber diets.  Acclimation to cold temperatures resulted in higher rates of food intake than acclimation to warm temperatures.  In addition, the size of the small intestine and cecum increased in response to cold acclimation.  Although increases in intake, resulting from acclimation to cold temperatures, did not result in changes in the digestibility of the diet or dietary components, they did result in decreases in the dietary turnover time.  Thus, increases in transit rate through the gut do not necessarily result in declines in the amount of energy extracted per gram of food ingested.  More energy per unit time, however, can be extracted from the diet, perhaps because of increases in the size of the gut allowing maintenance of digestibilities and energy need in the face of higher transit times.

AB Determining the most suitable model for phylogeny reconstruction constitutes a fundamental step in numerous evolutionary studies. Over the years, various criteria for model selection have been proposed, leading to debate over which criterion is preferable. However, the necessity of this procedure has not been questioned to date. Here, we demonstrate that although incongruency regarding the selected model is frequent over empirical and simulated data, all criteria lead to very similar inferences. When topologies and ancestral sequence reconstruction are the desired output, choosing one criterion over another is not crucial. Moreover, skipping model selection and using instead the most parameter-rich model, GTR+I+G, leads to similar inferences, thus rendering this time-consuming step nonessential, at least under current strategies of model selection.

AB Using robust, pairwise comparisons and a global dataset, we show that nitrogen concentration per unit leaf mass for nitrogen-fixing plants (N2FP; mainly legumes plus some actinorhizal species) in nonagricultural ecosystems is universally greater (43-100%) than that for other plants (OP). This difference is maintained across Koppen climate zones and growth forms and strongest in the wet tropics and within deciduous angiosperms. N2FP mostly show a similar advantage over OP in nitrogen per leaf area (N-area), even in arid climates, despite diazotrophy being sensitive to drought. We also show that, for most N2FP, carbon fixation by photosynthesis (A(sat)) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) are not related to N-area-in distinct challenge to current theories that place the leaf nitrogen-A(sat) relationship at the center of explanations of plant fitness and competitive ability. Among N2FP, only forbs displayed an N-area-g(s) relationship similar to that for OP, whereas intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi; A(sat)/g(s)) was positively related to Narea for woody N2FP. Enhanced foliar nitrogen (relative to OP) contributes strongly to other evolutionarily advantageous attributes of legumes, such as seed nitrogen and herbivore defense. These alternate explanations of clear differences in leaf N between N2FP and OP have significant implications (e.g., for global models of carbon fluxes based on relationships between leaf N and A(sat)). Combined, greater WUE and leaf nitrogen-in a variety of forms-enhance fitness and survival of genomes of N2FP, particularly in arid and semiarid climates.

AB Despite the mounting evidence for positive diversity-productivity relationships found in controlled experiments, diversity effects on productivity in natural systems remain hotly debated. Understanding the multivariate links between diversity and productivity in natural systems, in particular natural forests that host the majority of terrestrial biodiversity and provide essential services for humanity, remains a critical challenge for ecologists. We analysed data from 448 plots of varying tree species diversity, stand ages and local nutrient availability in Canada's boreal forest (52 degrees 30-55 degrees 24N latitude and 102 degrees 36-108 degrees W longitude). We used structural equation models to link multivariate relationships between above-ground biomass, tree species diversity, stand age and soil nutrient availability. Above-ground biomass increased with diversity indirectly via increasing tree size inequality, increased with stand age and was higher on sites of medium soil nutrient regime directly as well as indirectly via increased tree size inequality.Synthesis. Our results demonstrate positive diversity effects on above-ground biomass in natural forests of diverse forest ages and soil resource availability. Furthermore, we show that tree size inequality acts as a mechanism for the positive diversity effects on above-ground biomass and as a mechanism in regulating above-ground biomass and species diversity simultaneously via interactions among individuals in natural forests.

AB Rapid and inexpensive methods for genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery and genotyping are urgently needed for population management and conservation. In hybridized populations, genomic techniques that can identify and genotype thousands of species-diagnostic markers would allow precise estimates of population- and individual-level admixture as well as identification of super invasive' alleles, which show elevated rates of introgression above the genomewide background (likely due to natural selection). Techniques like restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing can discover and genotype large numbers of SNPs, but they have been limited by the length of continuous sequence data they produce with Illumina short-read sequencing. We present a novel approach, overlapping paired-end RAD sequencing, to generate RAD contigs of >300-400bp. These contigs provide sufficient flanking sequence for design of high-throughput SNP genotyping arrays and strict filtering to identify duplicate paralogous loci. We applied this approach in five populations of native westslope cutthroat trout that previously showed varying (low) levels of admixture from introduced rainbow trout (RBT). We produced 77141 RAD contigs and used these data to filter and genotype 3180 previously identified species-diagnostic SNP loci. Our population-level and individual-level estimates of admixture were generally consistent with previous microsatellite-based estimates from the same individuals. However, we observed slightly lower admixture estimates from genomewide markers, which might result from natural selection against certain genome regions, different genomic locations for microsatellites vs. RAD-derived SNPs and/or sampling error from the small number of microsatellite loci (n=7). We also identified candidate adaptive super invasive alleles from RBT that had excessively high admixture proportions in hybridized cutthroat trout populations.

AB Modified, more severe fire regimes are developing in the Mediterranean basin as a result of changes in land use and climate. Current fire management privileges fire suppression and tends to ignore land management issues, which may further accelerate the transition to a more fire-prone future and magnify the problem. Fire-smart management aims to control the fire regime by intervening on vegetation (fuel) to foster more fire-resistant (less flammable) and/or fire-resilient environments. Scientific knowledge supporting the creation and maintenance of fire-smart wildlands is critically reviewed, considering the landscape and the forest stand scales. Fuel management strategies (isolation, structural modification, and type conversion) are discussed in regards to their current and future potential to buffer the effects of global change on the extent and severity of fires. Uncertainty in the outcomes of fire-smart management arises mainly from insufficient understanding of the relative weights of fuel and weather-drought on the fire regime. Likewise, linkage between global change processes and the fire regime is not straightforward. Shrublands and, in general, open and dry vegetation types will prevail even more in future landscapes. Decrease in biomass will limit fire incidence over parts of the Mediterranean. However, the fire regime will be largely driven by weather, advising concentration of fuel management efforts in wildland-urban interfaces and in forests and their vicinity; decrease of landscape fire severity rather than area burned as the objective; prescribed burning as the treatment of choice, except in the wildland-urban interface; and focus on forest types that are fire-resilient irrespective of flammability.

AB Over the last two decades, macroecology the analysis of large-scale, multi-species ecological patterns and processes has established itself as a major line of biological research. Analyses of statistical links between environmental variables and biotic responses have long and successfully been employed as a main approach, but new developments are due to be utilized. Scanning the horizon of macroecology, we identified four challenges that will probably play a major role in the future. We support our claims by examples and bibliographic analyses. 1) Integrating the past into macroecological analyses, e.g. by using paleontological or phylogenetic information or by applying methods from historical biogeography, will sharpen our understanding of the underlying reasons for contemporary patterns. 2) Explicit consideration of the local processes that lead to the observed larger-scale patterns is necessary to understand the fine-grain variability found in nature, and will enable better prediction of future patterns (e.g. under environmental change conditions). 3) Macroecology is dependent on large-scale, high quality data from a broad spectrum of taxa and regions. More available data sources need to be tapped and new, small-grain large-extent data need to be collected. 4) Although macroecology already lead to mainstreaming cutting-edge statistical analysis techniques, we find that more sophisticated methods are needed to account for the biases inherent to sampling at large scale. Bayesian methods may be particularly suitable to address these challenges. To continue the vigorous development of the macroecological research agenda, it is time to address these challenges and to avoid becoming too complacent with current achievements.

TI How Does Spatial Study Design Influence Density Estimates from Spatial
   Capture-Recapture Models?
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID POPULATION-SIZE; HIERARCHICAL MODEL; BROWN BEARS; BLACK; SEX
AB When estimating population density from data collected on non-invasive detector arrays, recently developed spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models present an advance over non-spatial models by accounting for individual movement. While these models should be more robust to changes in trapping designs, they have not been well tested. Here we investigate how the spatial arrangement and size of the trapping array influence parameter estimates for SCR models. We analysed black bear data collected with 123 hair snares with an SCR model accounting for differences in detection and movement between sexes and across the trapping occasions. To see how the size of the trap array and trap dispersion influence parameter estimates, we repeated analysis for data from subsets of traps: 50% chosen at random, 50% in the centre of the array and 20% in the South of the array. Additionally, we simulated and analysed data under a suite of trap designs and home range sizes. In the black bear study, we found that results were similar across trap arrays, except when only 20% of the array was used. Black bear density was approximately 10 individuals per 100 km(2). Our simulation study showed that SCR models performed well as long as the extent of the trap array was similar to or larger than the extent of individual movement during the study period, and movement was at least half the distance between traps. SCR models performed well across a range of spatial trap setups and animal movements. Contrary to non-spatial capture-recapture models, they do not require the trapping grid to cover an area several times the average home range of the studied species. This renders SCR models more appropriate for the study of wide-ranging mammals and more flexible to design studies targeting multiple species.

AB Estuaries are especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because changes in climatic and hydrologic variables that influence freshwater and marine systems will also affect estuaries. We review potential impacts of climate change on Australian estuaries and their fish. Geographic differences are likely because southern Australian climates are predicted to become warmer and drier, whereas northern regions may see increased precipitation. Environmental factors, including salinity gradients, suspended sediment, dissolved oxygen and nutrient concentrations, will be influenced by changing freshwater input and other climate variables. Potential impacts will vary depending on the geomorphology of the estuary and the level of build-up of sand bars across estuarine entrances. Changes to estuarine fish assemblages will depend on associated changes to salinity and estuarine-mouth morphology. Marine migrants may be severely affected by closure of estuarine mouths, depending on whether species 'must' use estuarine habitat and the level of migratory v. resident individuals. Depending on how fish in coastal waters locate estuaries, there may be reduced cues associated with estuarine mouths, particularly in southern Australia, potentially influencing abundance. In summary, climate change is expected to have major consequences for Australian estuaries and associated fish, although the nature of impacts will show significant regional variation.

AB 1. Temperate regions with fish communities dominated by cold-water species (physiological optima <20 degrees C) are vulnerable to the effects of warming temperatures caused by climate change, including displacement by non-native cool-water (physiological optima 20-28 degrees C) and warm-water fishes (physiological optima >28 degrees C) that are able to establish and invade as the thermal constraints on the expression of their life history traits diminish.
   2. England and Wales is a temperate region into which at least 38 freshwater fishes have been introduced, although 14 of these are no longer present. Of the remaining 24 species, some have persisted but failed to establish, some have established populations without becoming invasive and some have become invasive. The aim of the study was to predict the responses of these 24 non-native fishes to the warming temperatures of England and Wales predicted under climate change in 2050.
   3. The predictive use of climate-matching models and an air and water temperature regression model suggested that there are six non-native fishes currently persistent but not established in England and Wales whose establishment and subsequent invasion would benefit substantially from the predicted warming temperatures. These included the common carp Cyprinus carpio and European catfish Silurus glanis, fishes that also exert a relatively high propagule pressure through stocking to support angling and whose spatial distribution is currently increasing significantly, including in open systems.
   4. The potential ecological impacts of the combined effects of warming temperatures, current spatial distribution and propagule pressure on the establishment and invasion of C. carpio and S. glanis were assessed. The ecological consequences of C. carpio invasion were assessed as potentially severe in England and Wales, with impacts likely to relate to habitat destruction, macrophyte loss and increased water turbidity. However, evidence of ecological impacts of S. glanis elsewhere in their introduced range was less clear and so their potential impacts in England and Wales remain uncertain.

AB We present two eight-million year long proxy records of precipitation for Southwest and Central Europe, covering the middle to late Miocene (5.3-13 Ma) at a temporal resolution of about 60 kyr and 150 kyr, respectively. The estimates of precipitation are based on the ecophysiological Structure of herpetological assemblages (amphibians and reptiles). From 13.0 Ma until about 9 Ma, both records show a similar trend, evolving from a long dry period (13-11 Ma) into a "washhouse climate" (10.2-9.8 Ma), characterized by global warm conditions and several times more precipitation than present. The transition from washhouse to a dryer climate between 9.7 and 9.5 Ma and the concomitant cooling episode appear to have triggered a severe biotic event known as the Vallesian crisis, which included the extinction of hominoids in Western Europe. A second washhouse period (9.0-8.5 Ma), coeval with a global warm episode, was unprecedentedly intense in Southwest Europe, but less pronounced in Central Europe. From 8 Ma onward, a divergence in the two precipitation records is observed, with Southwest Europe staying wetter and Central Europe becoming dryer than present. Both precipitation records are combined into a common run-off curve as a measure of the relative intensity of the hydrological cycle for moderate latitudes of continental Europe. The run-off curve shows a remarkable positive correlation with Atlantic deep-water temperatures from Ceara Rise by Lear et al. (2003), which are significantly higher (up to +3 degrees C) during the two washhouse periods and show no other positive excursion of comparable magnitude. We discuss potential links and the role of the coeval temporary restriction of the Central American Seaway on ocean and atmosphere circulation. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Root growth and soil water utilization of winter wheat in the North

ID SHOOT GROWTH; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE; IRRIGATION; YIELD; SYSTEM; DEPTH; CORN
AB Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the major crop in the North China Plain (NCP). The monsoon climate in this region causes most rain to fall in the summer season, but during the winter-wheat growing season (October-May) the rainfall is far less than the water requirements for the crop. The efficiency of soil water use by winter wheat needs to be improved to reduce the need for irrigation. In this paper, we report the results of two seasons' work on soil water utilization, root growth and distribution, root water uptake by the crop under different irrigation treatments, and possible ways to improve soil water-use efficiency. The field experiments were carried out at Luancheng Station (37degrees53'N, 114degrees41'E) from 1996 to 1997 and 1998 to 1999, two growing seasons of winter wheat. Five treatments for each season: rain-fed and irrigated winter wheat with different irrigation numbers from 1 up to 4, were set up in a randomized plot design. Soil available water-holding capacity at the experimental site was about 454 mm for the top 2 m soil profile. Root sampling results showed that winter wheat had a prolific root system with an average maximum rooting depth of 2 m. Most of the root system was concentrated in the upper 40 cm of soil. Root length density in the top layer of soil (0-20 cm) was very high, with values over 5 cm cm(-3). The distribution of water uptake from the soil profile under high soil moisture conditions was the same as the distribution of root length density. The roots in the top layer of soil played an important role in soil water uptake. When root length density was less than 0.8 cm cm(-3), the root was the main factor limiting the complete utilization of soil water by crops. The scarcity of roots in the deep soil layers restricted the full utilization of soil water by the crops. Thus, at maturity, over 100 mm of available water remained in the root zone for the rain-fed treatment, although the upper layers had already entered water deficit. The crop took up 80% of the total available soil water in the treatment without irrigation in a dry season. For irrigated wheat, from 40 to 50% of crop water uptake was from the stored soil water. Available stored soil water played an important role in the higher production of wheat crops in the NCP. Effective measures to increase the utilization of stored soil water could improve crop performance under conditions of limited water supply. Results showed that deep tillage to break the soil pan improved root growth in the deeper soil layers, and sowing the crop evenly also enhanced water uptake from the top soil layer to compete with soil evaporation.

AB This paper presents a new habitat suitability modeling method whose main properties are as follows: (1) It is based on the density of observation points in the environmental space, which enables it to fit complex distributions (e.g. nongaussian, bimodal, asymmetrical, etc.). (2) This density is modeled by computing the geometric mean to all observation points, which we show to be a good trade-off between goodness of fit and prediction power. (3) It does not need any absence information, which is generally difficult to collect and of dubious reliability. (4) The environmental space is represented either by an expert-selection of standardized variables or the axes of a factor analysis [in this paper we used the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA)].We first explain the details of the geometric mean algorithm and then we apply it to the bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) habitat in the Swiss Alps. The results are compared to those obtained by the "median algorithm" and tested by jack-knife cross-validation. We also discuss other related algorithms (BIOCLIM, HABITAT, and DOMAIN). All these analyses were implemented into and performed with the ecology-oriented GIS software BIOMAPPER 2.0.The results show the geometric mean to perform better than the median algorithm, as it produces a tighter fit to the bimodal distribution of the bearded vulture in the environmental space. However, the "median algorithm" being quicker, it could be preferred when modeling more usual distribution.

AB We compared photosynthesis-nitrogen relationships of one broad-leaved (poplar; Populus X euroamericana (Dole) Guinier) and one conifer (Douglas-fir; Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) species. Plants were grown in large pots to allow free root development and were kept well watered. We determined effects of low, intermediate and high nitrogen supply rates on area-based leaf nitrogen (N-a) and chlorophyll concentrations, leaf mass per area (LMA), light-saturated photosynthesis (A(max)), maximum carboxylation (V-cmax) and electron transport rate (J(max)), photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE), and proportions of leaf N in active Rubisco (P-R), bioenergetic pools (P-B) and the light-harvesting complex (P-LH). Nitrogen supply significantly affected leaf Na. Leaf mass per area did not differ between species and was unaffected by the N treatments. In both species, there was a positive correlation between leaf N-a and chlorophyll concentration, and between leaf N-a and the photosynthetic parameters A(max), J(max) and V-cmax. At comparable leaf N-a, however, poplar showed twofold higher PNUE and a threefold steeper slope of the Am -nitrogen relationship than Douglas-fir. Leaf Na was negatively correlated with PNUE in Douglas-fir but not in poplar. Leaf Na was also negatively correlated with P-R, P-B and P-LH in Douglas-fir, whereas in poplar, a negative correlation was found only for P-LH. Parameter P-R was significantly higher in poplar than in Douglas-fir. The ratio of CO2 concentration in the intercellular space to that in ambient air was higher in poplar than in Douglas-fir. Overall, our data suggest that differences in the photosynthesis-nitrogen relationship and PNUE between Douglas-fir and poplar primarily reflect a different investment of N to active Rubisco, and possibly a different constraint to CO2 diffusion.

AB Delphinium barbeyi is a common herbaceous wildflower in montane meadows at 2,900 m near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, and its flowers are important nectar resources for bumblebees and hummingbirds. During the period 1977-1999 flowering was highly variable in both timing (date of first flower ranged from 5 July to 6 August, mean=17 July) and abundance (maximum open flowers per 2x2-m plot ranged from 11.3 to 197.9, mean=82). Time and abundance of flowering are highly correlated with the previous winter's snowpack, as measured by the amount of snow remaining on the ground on 15 May (range 0-185 cm, mean=67.1). We used structural equation modeling to investigate relationships among snowpack, first date of bare ground, first date of flowering, number of inflorescences produced, and peak number of flowers, all of which arc significantly correlated with each other. Snowpack depth on 15 May is a significant predictor of the first date of bare ground (R-2=0.872), which in turn is a significant predictor of the first date of flowering (R-2=0.858); snowpack depth is also significantly correlated with number of inflorescences produced (R-2=0.713). Both the number of inflorescences and mean date of first flowering are significant predictors of flowers produced (but with no residual effect of snowpack). Part of the effect of snowpack on flowering may be mediated through an increased probability of frost damage in years with lower snowpack - the frequency of early-season "frost events" explained a significant proportion of the variance in the number of flowers per stem. There is significant reduction of flower production in La Nina episodes. The variation in number of flowers we have observed is likely to affect the pollination, mating system, and demography of the species. Through its effect on snowpack, frost events, and their interaction, climate change may influence all of these variables.

AB Combination of the targeted amplification of nuclear introns and the analysis of single-stranded conformational polymorphisms has the potential to provide an inexpensive, rapid, versatile and sensitive genetic assay for evolutionary studies and conservation. We are developing primers and protocols to analyse nuclear introns in vertebrates, and are testing them in a population genetic study of marbled murrelets Brachyramphus marmoratus. Here we present protocols and results for introns for aldolase B, alpha-enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and lamin A. Results suggest that this approach presents a potentially powerful method for detecting genetic variation within and among local populations and species of animals: (i) a variety of genes can be surveyed, including genes of special interest such as those involved in disease resistance; (ii) assays are rapid and relatively inexpensive; (iii) large numbers of genes can be assayed, enabling accurate estimation of variation in the total genome; (iv) almost any mutation can be detected in the genes amplified; (v) the exact nature of variation can be investigated by sequence analysis if desired; (vi) statistical methods previously developed for proteins and/or sequence data can be used; (vii) protocols can be easily transferred to other species and other laboratories; and (viii) assays can be performed on old or degraded samples, blood or museum skins, so that animals need not be killed. Results of analyses for murrelets support earlier evidence that North American and Asiatic subspecies represent reproductively isolated species, and that genetic differences exist among murrelets from different sites within North America.

   CORALS; NEW-ZEALAND; HISTORY; EQUILIBRIUM
AB One of the major questions in ecology is, what controls the structure of communities? We used projection matrix models to examine community dynamics and patterns of succession. The inputs of the model are transition probabilities of species replacements that were measured repeatedly during a long-term (1962-1989) study of diverse coral assemblages on Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef. Transitions varied strikingly among species and sites, reflecting differences in recruitment, growth, longevity (persistence), and the rate of replacement of one species by another. Species that had a poor ability to persist (e.g., algae and Pocilloporid corals) were generally good colonists. The observed number of transitions expressed as a proportion of the maximum number possible provides an index of the complexity of interactions in an assemblage, analogous to the concept of connectance in food-web analysis. Transitions occurred to and from nearly every species group, indicating that there was no competitive dominant in this system.
   We use the models in simulations to track transitory changes in species abundance and community composition following a major disturbance (e.g., due to a cyclone or outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish). Some species showed a rapid initial increase followed by a decline to lower equilibrium levels, while others increased smoothly to a generally higher equilibrial abundance. The length of time required to reach a climax assemblage using the same matrix recurrently (approximate to 20 yr) is far greater than the observed interval between major disturbances, supporting nonequilibrium theories of coral reef communities. Climax assemblages were highly diverse and varied in composition from site to site. The ''intermediate disturbance hypothesis'' does not fully predict successional changes in these shallow-water coral assemblages since diversity remained very high at equilibrium (i.e., long after a major disturbance), Competitively inferior species were not eliminated because routine mortality ensured that some space always remained available for colonization.
   We also present a novel method for quantifying the relative importance of each species interaction to community composition and the rate of succession, based on a sensitivity analysis of the transition matrix. The analysis shows that the importance of a species to the dynamics of a community may be unrelated to its abundance at equilibrium, with some rare species groups having a greater impact than more common ones. Sensitivity analysis of this type will provide a powerful means of identifying ''keystone'' species in complex assemblages where experimental manipulation of each species is impossible.

AB In a number of insects male size has been shown to be positively correlated with mating success.  Since variance in male mating success should increase with the degree of female polygamy, sexual selection for large male size may be stronger under polyandry than under monandry.  To test this hypothesis we correlated male/female sexual size dimorphism, defined as male/female forewing length, with the degree of female polygamy, assessed by counting the number of spermatophores in wild-caught females.  Both sets of data were assessed from 23 species of butterflies, 11 in the Pieridae and 12 in the Satyridae.  There was a positive correlation between male/female sexual size dimorphism and female polygamy in both families.  Although size is affected by many factors, we contend that this result is best explained by sperm competition; in butterflies, the mass of the ejaculate delivered by a male is positively correlated with male size, and large ejaculates induce a longer period of female unreceptivity, resulting in sexual selection favouring large male size in species where females mate repeatedly.
   Although there is an obvious conflict between having a short development time and acquiring large size, the expected negative relationship between sexual size dimorphism and protandry was not statistically significant under direct development in the 8 species tested.  This suggests that males under direct development achieve both large size and short development time simultaneously by increasing their growth rate.  In diapause generations of 14 species (including overwintering generations of the 8 bivoltine species above) there was, however, such a negative relationship.  Since protandry in diapause generations is mainly the result of morphogenesis of the adult during postdiapause pupal development, this is consistent with the tendency for small individuals, males, to require shorter morphogenetic development times than larger individuals, females.  We found a weak negative correlation between polyandry and protandry, statistically significant only under diapause development.  This suggests that mating with virgin females is more beneficial than mating with non-virgins also under female polygamy, and indicates that selection for early male emergence is only weakly relaxed in species where females mate repeatedly.

AB This paper reviews current knowledge of substrate-associated juvenile Sebastes. In general, juvenile rockfish recruit to shallower depths than those occupied by conspecific adults. Habitat use by newly recruited rockfish differs markedly among species. While a few species recruit to shallow-dwelling macrophytes, such as Zostera, many others recruit to larger brown algae, such as Nereocystis and Macrocystis. A few deeper dwelling species recruit to low relief or soft substrata. However, little is known on recruitment of these deeper dwellers. Crustaceans are the major component of the diets of newly recruited Sebastes. Species which continue to forage in the water column shift to larger crustaceans (e.g. euphausids) and fish as they grow. Species which shift to substrate-associated prey soon begin to feed on larger algal-associated gammarid amphipods, shrimps and isopods. Field studies indicate variation in intraspecific growth rates over large geographic distances, among nearby sites and among algal habitats on the same reef, with food availability and water temperature being major factors in the differences. In particular, laboratory studies have shown that temperature is one of the most important factors in growth rates. Many species of juvenile rockfish make ontogenetic movements, often moving into deeper water as they age. Most seasonal movements appear to be related to changes in water temperature and turbulence.

AB Our understanding of domestication comes largely from archeology and genetics. Here, we advocate using current ecological theory and methodologies to provide novel insights into the causes and limitations of evolution under cultivation, as well as into the wider ecological impacts of domestication. We discuss the importance of natural selection under cultivation, that is, the forces promoting differences in Darwinian fitness between plants in crop populations and of constraints, that is, limitations of diverse nature that, given values for trait X, shorten the range of variation of trait Y, during the domestication process. Throughout this opinion paper, we highlight how ecology can yield insight into the effects of domestication on plant traits, on crop feedback over ecological processes, and on how species interactions develop in croplands.

AB Biochar has significant potential to improve crop performance. This study examined the effect of biochar application on the photosynthesis and yield of peanut crop grown on two soil types. The commercial peanut cultivar Middleton was grown on red ferrosol and redoxi-hydrosol (Queensland, Australia) amended with a peanut shell biochar gradient (0, 0.375, 0.750, 1.50, 3.00 and 6.00 %, w/w, equivalent up to 85 t ha(-1)) in a glasshouse pot experiment. Biomass and pod yield, photosynthesis-[CO2] response parameters, leaf characteristics and soil properties (carbon, nitrogen (N) and nutrients) were quantified. Biochar significantly improved peanut biomass and pod yield up to 2- and 3-folds respectively in red ferrosol and redoxi-hydrosol. A modest (but significant) biochar-induced improvement of the maximum electron transport rate and saturating photosynthetic rate was observed for red ferrosol. This response was correlated to increased leaf N and accompanied with improved soil available N and biological N fixation. Biochar application also improved the availability of other soil nutrients, which appeared critical in improving peanut performance, especially on infertile redoxi-hydrosol. Our study suggests that application of peanut shell derived biochar has strong potential to improve peanut yield on red ferrosol and redoxi-hydrosol. Biochar soil amendment can affect leaf N status and photosynthesis, but the effect varied with soil type.

AB More people and goods are moving further and more frequently via many different trade and transport networks under current trends of globalisation. These networks can play a major role in the unintended introduction of exotic species to new locations. With the continuing rise in global trade, more research attention is being focused on the role of networks in the spread of invasive species. This represents an emerging field of research in invasion science and the substantial knowledge being generated within other disciplines can provide ecologists with new tools with which to study invasions. For the first time, we synthesise studies from several perspectives, approaches and disciplines to derive the fundamental characteristics of network topology determining the likelihood of spread of organisms via trade and transport networks. These characteristics can be used to identify critical points of vulnerability within these networks and enable the development of more effective strategies to prevent invasions.

AB Earth System Models (ESMs) aim to project global change. Central to this aim is the need to accurately model global carbon fluxes. Photosynthetic carbon dioxide assimilation by the terrestrial biosphere is the largest of these fluxes, and in many ESMs is represented by the Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry (FvCB) model of photosynthesis. The maximum rate of carboxylation by the enzyme Rubisco, commonly termed Vc,max, is a key parameter in the FvCB model. This study investigated the derivation of the values of Vc,max used to represent different plant functional types (PFTs) in ESMs. Four methods for estimating Vc,max were identified; (1) an empirical or (2) mechanistic relationship was used to relate Vc,max to leaf N content, (3) Vc,max was estimated using an approach based on the optimization of photosynthesis and respiration or (4) calibration of a user-defined Vc,max to obtain a target model output. Despite representing the same PFTs, the land model components of ESMs were parameterized with a wide range of values for Vc,max (-46 to +77 % of the PFT mean). In many cases, parameterization was based on limited data sets and poorly defined coefficients that were used to adjust model parameters and set PFT-specific values for Vc,max. Examination of the models that linked leaf N mechanistically to Vc,max identified potential changes to fixed parameters that collectively would decrease Vc,max by 31 % in C-3 plants and 11 % in C-4 plants. Plant trait data bases are now available that offer an excellent opportunity for models to update PFT-specific parameters used to estimate Vc,max. However, data for parameterizing some PFTs, particularly those in the Tropics and the Arctic are either highly variable or largely absent.

AB As a dominant paradigm, ecosystem-based fisheries have to come to terms with uncertainty and complexity, an interdisciplinary visioning of management objectives, and putting humans back into the ecosystem. The goal of this article is to suggest that implementing ecosystem-based management (EBM) has to be revolutionary in the sense of going beyond conventional practices. It would require the use of multiple disciplines and multiple objectives, dealing with technically unresolvable management problems of complex adaptive systems and expanding scope from management to governance. Developing the governance toolbox would require expanding into new kinds of interaction unforeseen by the mid-twentieth-century fathers of fishery science governance that may involve cooperative, multilevel management, partnerships, social learning and knowledge co-production. In addition to incorporating relatively well-known resilience, adaptive management and co-management approaches, taking EBM to the next stage may include some of the following: conceptualizing EBM as a wicked problem; conceptualizing fisheries as social-ecological systems; picking and choosing from an assortment of new governance approaches; and finding creative ways to handle complexity.

AB As Earth's atmosphere accumulates carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases, Earth's climate is expected to warm and precipitation patterns will likely change. The manner in which terrestrial ecosystems respond to climatic changes will in turn affect the rate of climate change. Here we describe responses of an old-field herbaceous community to a factorial combination of four levels of warming (up to 4 degrees C) and three precipitation regimes (drought, ambient and rain addition) over 2 years. Warming suppressed total production, shoot production, and species richness, but only in the drought treatment. Root production did not respond to warming, but drought stimulated the growth of deeper (> 10 cm) roots by 121% in 1 year. Warming and precipitation treatments both affected functional group composition, with C4 grasses and other annual and biennial species entering the C3 perennial-dominated community in ambient rainfall and rain addition treatments as well as in warmed treatments. Our results suggest that, in this mesic system, expected changes in temperature or large changes in precipitation alone can alter functional composition, but they have little effect on total herbaceous plant growth. However, drought limits the capacity of the entire system to withstand warming. The relative insensitivity of our study system to climate suggests that the herbaceous component of old-field communities will not dramatically increase production in response to warming or precipitation change, and so it is unlikely to provide either substantial increases in forage production or a meaningful negative feedback to climate change later this century.

AB The onset of spring, noted by the timing of wildlife migratory and breeding behaviors, has been occurring earlier over the past few decades. Here, we examine 15 years of loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta, nesting patterns along a 40.5 km beach on Florida's Atlantic coast. This small section of beach is considered to be the most important nesting area for this threatened species in the western hemisphere. From 1989 to 2003, the annual number of nests fluctuated between 13 000 and 25 000 without a conspicuous trend; however, based on a regression analysis, the median nesting date became earlier by roughly 10 days. The Julian day of median nesting was significantly correlated with near-shore, May sea surface temperatures that warmed an average of 0.8degreesC over this period. This marine example from warm temperate/subtropical waters represents another response of nature to recent climate trends.

AB It has been suggested that restoration of roadsides to native habitat can benefit wildlife by adding habitat and restoring connectivity between fragmented reserves. In Iowa, which has one of the highest road densities in the United States, roadside vegetation has traditionally been managed to maintain a monoculture of exotic grass. Recently, several Iowa counties have begun integrated roadside vegetation management, a program that both restores roadsides to native prairie vegetation and restricts the use of herbicides and mowing. We evaluated the effect of this management regime on butterfly populations along central Iowa roadsides. We surveyed 12 separate prairie roadside areas, comparing the abundance and species richness of disturbance-tolerant and habitat-sensitive butterflies in roadside prairies with those of nearby roadsides dominated by either weeds (primarily non-native legumes) or non-native grasses. We found that management of roadsides profoundly affected the butterfly community. Species richness of habitat-sensitive butterflies showed a two-fold increase in prairie compared with grassy and weedy roadsides (p < 0.001), and abundance increased almost five times more on the prairie than on grassy roadsides (p < 0.02). Species richness of disturbance-tolerant butterflies showed no response to roadside management, although abundance was slightly higher in weedy and prairie roadsides than on grassy roadsides (p < 0.01). Of all habitat variables explored, the species richness of plants in flower showed the strongest effect on mean richness and abundance of both disturbance-tolerant and habitat sensitive butterfly species. Although there were higher concentrations of road-killed butterflies near weedy and prairie roadsides than on grassy roadsides, relative numbers indicated that mortality risk was more than twice as high on grassy roadsides (p < 0.0001). Tracking studies showed that butterflies were less likely to exit prairie roadsides, indicating that their mortality rates may be lower and offering preliminary evidence that roadsides have the potential to be used as corridors. Overall, our results indicate that roadside restoration benefits butterfly populations. More detailed demographic data are necessary, however, to explore the possibility that roadsides are acting as sink habitat for some habitat-restricted species.

AB Soil salinization is a growing environmental problem caused by both natural and human activities. Excessive salinity in soil suppresses growth, decreases species diversity, and alters the community composition of plants; however, the effect of salinity on soil microbial communities is poorly understood. Here, we characterize the soil microbial community along a natural salinity gradient in Gurbantunggut Desert, Northwestern China. Microbial diversity linearly decreased with increases in salinity, and community dissimilarity significantly increased with salinity differences. Soil salinity showed a strong effect on microbial community dissimilarity, even after controlling for the effects of spatial distance and other environmental variables. Microbial phylotypes (n = 270) belonging to Halobacteria, Nitriliruptoria, [Rhodothermi], Gammaproteobacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria showed a high-salinity niche preference. Out of nine potential phenotypes predicted by BugBase, oxygen-related phenotypes showed a significant relationship with salinity content. To explore the community assembly processes, we used null models of within-community (nearest-taxon index [NTI]) and between-community (beta NTI) phylogenetic composition. NTI showed a significantly negative relationship with salinity, suggesting that the microbial community was less phylogenetically clustered in more-saline soils. beta NTI, the between-community analogue of NTI, showed that deterministic processes have overtaken stochastic processes across all sites, suggesting the importance of environmental filtering in microbial community assembly. Taken together, these results suggest the importance of salinity in soil microbial community composition and assembly processes in a desert ecosystem.
   IMPORTANCE Belowground microorganisms are indispensable components for nutrient cycling in desert ecosystems, and understanding how they respond to increased salinity is essential for managing and ameliorating salinization. Our sequence-based data revealed that microbial diversity decreased with increasing salinity, and certain salt-tolerant phylotypes and phenotypes showed a positive relationship with salinity. Using a null modeling approach to estimate microbial community assembly processes along a salinity gradient, we found that salinity imposed a strong selection pressure on the microbial community, which resulted in a dominance of deterministic processes. Studying microbial diversity and community assembly processes along salinity gradients is essential in understanding the fundamental ecological processes in desert ecosystems affected by salinization.

AB Across the globe, rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns have caused persistent regional droughts, lengthened fire seasons, and increased the number of weather-driven extreme fire events. Because wildfires currently impact an increasing proportion of the total area burned, land managers need to better understand reburns in which previously burned areas can modify the patterns and severity of subsequent fires. For example, knowing how long past fire boundaries can function as barriers to fire spread may empower decision-makers to manage some wildfires as large-scale fuel treatments, or alternatively, determine where prescribed burning or strategic wildfire management are required. Additionally, a clear understanding of how prior burn mosaics influence future fire spread and burn severity is critical knowledge for landscape and fire-dependent wildlife habitat planning under a rapidly changing climate. Here, we review published studies on reburns in fire-adapted ecosystems of the world, including temperate forests of North America, semi-arid forests and rangelands, tropical and subtropical forests, grasslands and savannas, and Mediterranean ecosystems. To date, research on reburns is unevenly distributed across the world with a relative abundance of literature in Australia, Europe and North America and a scarcity of studies in Africa, Asia and South America. This review highlights the complex role of repeated fires in modifying vegetation and fuels, and patterns of subsequent wildfires. In fire prone ecosystems, the return of fire is inevitable, and legacies of past fires, or their absence, often dictate the characteristics of subsequent fires. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Several maturity indices were evaluated for in-vessel co-composting of chicken manure and pine sawdust with three different biochars. All the seven mixtures (piles) contained chicken manure and sawdust. Six of these piles contained biochar; each biochar was added at two rates, 5% and 10% wet weight. The maturity of composts was assessed by C/N, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), seed germination, NO3 -N/ NH4+-N, and the Solvita test. The C/N values of finished composts were from 31.5 to 35.7, which were much higher than the optimum value of 21 for matured compost. Nevertheless, the rest of the parameters indicated that the composts were matured. The C/N values were high because of the high amount of recalcitrant carbon present in the feedstocks: biochar and sawdust. Biochar treated piles showed higher respiration as well as decomposition of DOC indicating higher microbial activity. Use of biochar in composting may reduce NH3 emission and nitrate leaching.

AB Livestock depredation by large carnivores is an important conservation and economic concern and conservation management would benefit from a better understanding of spatial variation and underlying causes of depredation events. Focusing on the endangered snow leopard Panthera uncia and the wolf Canis lupus, we identify the ecological factors that predispose areas within a landscape to livestock depredation. We also examine the potential mismatch between reality and human perceptions of livestock depredation by these carnivores whose survival is threatened due to persecution by pastoralists. We assessed the distribution of the snow leopard, wolf and wild ungulate prey through field surveys in the 4000km2 Upper Spiti Landscape of trans-Himalayan India. We interviewed local people in all 25 villages to assess the distribution of livestock and peoples' perceptions of the risk to livestock from these carnivores. We monitored village-level livestock mortality over a 2-year period to assess the actual level of livestock depredation. We quantified several possibly influential independent variables that together captured variation in topography, carnivore abundance and abundance and other attributes of livestock. We identified the key variables influencing livestock depredation using multiple logistic regressions and hierarchical partitioning. Our results revealed notable differences in livestock selectivity and ecological correlates of livestock depredation both perceived and actual by snow leopards and wolves. Stocking density of large-bodied free-ranging livestock (yaks and horses) best explained people's threat perception of livestock depredation by snow leopards, while actual livestock depredation was explained by the relative abundance of snow leopards and wild prey. In the case of wolves, peoples' perception was best explained by abundance of wolves, while actual depredation by wolves was explained by habitat structure. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that (i) human perceptions can be at odds with actual patterns of livestock depredation, (ii) increases in wild prey populations will intensify livestock depredation by snow leopards, and prey recovery programmes must be accompanied by measures to protect livestock, (iii) compensation or insurance programmes should target large-bodied livestock in snow leopard habitats and (iv) sustained awareness programmes are much needed, especially for the wolf.

ID FIRE REGIMES; PATTERNS; MACROFOSSIL; RECOVERY; WILDFIRE; IMPACTS; RANGE
AB Recent climatic warming has resulted in pronounced environmental changes in the Arctic, including shrub cover expansion and sea ice shrinkage. These changes foreshadow more dramatic impacts that will occur if the warming trend continues. Among the major challenges in anticipating these impacts are "surprises" stemming from changes in system components that have remained relatively stable in the historic record. Tundra burning is potentially one such component. Here we report paleoecological evidence showing that recent tundra burning is unprecedented in the central Alaskan Arctic within the last 5000 years. Analysis of lake sediment cores reveals peak values of charcoal accumulation corresponding to the Anaktuvuk River Fire in 2007, with no evidence of other fire events throughout the past five millennia in that area. Atmospheric reanalysis suggests that the fire was favored by exceptionally warm and dry weather conditions in summer and early autumn. Boosted regression tree modeling shows that such conditions also explain 95% of the interannual variability in tundra area burned throughout Alaska over the past 60 years and that the response of tundra burning to climatic warming is nonlinear. These results contribute to an emerging body of evidence suggesting that tundra ecosystems can burn more frequently under suitable climatic and fuel conditions. The Anaktuvuk River Fire coincides with extreme sea ice retreat, and tundra area burned in Alaska is moderately correlated with sea ice extent from 1979 to 2009 (r = -0.43, p (-) 0.02). Recurrences of large tundra fires as a result of sea ice disappearance may represent a novel manifestation of coupled marine-terrestrial responses to climatic warming.

AB Examination of temperate and polar regions of Earth shows that the nonbiological world is exquisitely sensitive to the direct effects of temperature, whereas the biological world is largely organized by light. Herein, we discuss the use of day length by animals at physiological and genetic levels, beginning with a comparative experimental study that shows the preeminent role of light in determining fitness in seasonal environments. Typically, at seasonally appropriate times, light initiates a cascade of physiological events mediating the input and interpretation of day length to the output of specific hormones that ultimately determine whether animals prepare to develop, reproduce, hibernate, enter dormancy, or migrate. The mechanisms that form the basis of seasonal time keeping and their adjustment during climate change are reviewed at the physiological and genetic levels. Future avenues for research are proposed that span basic questions from how animals transition from dependency on tropical cues to temperate cues during range expansions, to more applied questions of species survival and conservation biology during periods of climatic stress.

AB This paper discusses biotic interactions in agroecosystems and how they may be manipulated to support crop productivity and environmental health by provision of ecosystem services such as weed, pest and disease management, nutrient cycling and biodiversity conservation. Important elements for understanding biotic interactions include consideration of the effects of diversity, species composition and food web structure on ecosystem processes; the impacts of timing, frequency and intensity of disturbance; and the importance of multitrophic interactions. All of these elements need to be considered at multiple scales that depend in part on the range of the movement of the organisms involved. These issues are first discussed in general, followed by an examination of the application of these concepts in agricultural management. The potential for a greater use of ecological management approaches is high; however, owing to the nature of complex interactions in ecosystems, there is some inherent unpredictability about responses to management interventions under different conditions. Such uncertainty needs to be accommodated in the development of recommendations for farm management. This requires an increased emphasis on the effective synthesis of complex and often apparently contradictory information and on field-based adaptive research, monitoring and social learning by farmer/researcher collaborations.

AB Many studies have shown that the total abundance of hyphae in the soil covaries seasonally with soil moisture. We investigated the extent to which soil hyphal abundance varies as a function of depth and moisture availability within the soil profile during the dry season, and determined whether soil moisture compensation via hydraulic lift (HL) buffers rhizosphere fungi from the effects of severe soil drying. We measured soil water potential, isotopic composition of soil water and total hyphal length in a California coast live oak stand and adjacent grassland at the beginning and end of the 5-month summer drought period. Throughout the summer, oaks maintained predawn water potential values (-0.4 +/- 0.1 MPa) that were significantly above those recorded in the 0-200 cm soil depth interval, strongly suggesting root access to groundwater. Direct evaporation of soil water was much more intense and affected deeper layers of the profile in the grassland compared to the oak stand, as indicated by extremely negative water potential values and very enriched isotopic composition of soil water near the surface. Significantly higher soil water potential and less isotopically enriched soil water at 15-40cm, depth in the oak stand were consistent with oak root exudation of isotopically depleted groundwater or deep soil water not exposed to evaporation. Hyphal length in the soil profile declined markedly during the summer drought period in the grassland, particularly in upper layers (41-75% decrease at 0-40cm depth), indicating rapid turnover of the arbuscular mycorrhizae (AMF) dominated hyphal carbon pool after grass senescence. By contrast, soil hyphal length in the ectomycorrhizal (EM)/AM oak stand remained remarkably constant throughout the summer drought period, with the only exception of the topsoil layer exposed to direct evaporation (49% decrease at 5 cm depth). The sustained exudation of water from roots to soil through HL may have buffered rhizosphere hyphae against the negative effects of extreme soil desiccation in the oak stand. These data suggest that HL by deep-rooted trees may influence the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients in seasonally dry ecosystems through effects on rhizosphere fungi.

AB This study investigated the influence of reproductive strategy (benthic or pelagic eggs) and habitat preferences (lagoon or outer slope) on both diversity and genetic differentiation using a set of populations of seven coral reef fish species over different geographic scales within French Polynesia. We hypothesized that a Holocene sea-level decrease contributed to severe reduction of population size for species inhabiting lagoons and a subsequent decrease of genetic diversity. Conversely, we proposed that species inhabiting stable environments, such as the outer slope, should demonstrate higher genetic diversity but also more structured populations because they have potentially reached a migration-genetic drift equilibrium. Sequences of the 5' end of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region were compared among populations sampled in five isolated islands within two archipelagos of French Polynesia. For all the species, no significant divergences among populations were found. Significant differences in mtDNA diversity between lagoonal and outer-slope species were demonstrated both for haplotype diversity and sequence divergence but none were found between species with different egg types. Pairwise mismatch distributions suggested rapid population growth for all the seven species involved in this study, but they revealed different distributions, depending on the habitat preference of the species. Although several scenarios can explain the observed patterns, the hypothesis of population size reduction events relative to Holocene sea-level regression and its consequence on French Polynesia coral reefs is the most parsimonious. Outer-slope species have undergone a probable weak and/or old bottleneck (outer reefs persisted during low sea level, leading to reef area reductions), whereas lagoonal species suffered a strong and/or recent bottleneck since Holocene sea-level regression resulted in the drying out of all the atolls that are maximum 70 meters deep. Since present sea level was reached between 5000 and 6000 years ago, different demographic events (bottlenecks or founder events) have lead to the actual populations of lagoons in French Polynesia.

DT Article
DE anti-drought; Australian rivers; drought; low flows; regulated rivers
ID VARIABILITY; PATTERNS; IMPACT; ENSO
AB 1. Droughts are not easily defined other than by culturally driven judgements about the extent and nature of impact. Natural ecosystems are adapted to the magnitude and frequency of dry periods and these are instrumental in controlling the long term functioning of these systems.
   2. In unregulated rivers, low flows are derived from water in long-term storage in the catchment, commonly as shallow groundwater. Four types of low flow sequences are evident for representative rivers from each of the seven flow regime zones in Australia and an arid zone stream: perennial streams with low annual flow variability that have seasonal low flows but do not cease to flow; perennial streams with high annual variability that cease to flow in extreme years; ephemeral streams that regularly cease to flow in the dry season; and arid zone streams with long and erratic periods of no flow.
   3. Although Australian rivers record runs of consecutive years of low flows longer than would be expected theoretically, the departures from the expected are not statistically significant. Trends and quasi-cycles in sequences of low-flow years are observed over decadal time scales.
   4. Examples of the effects of river regulation on low flows in southern Australia indicate that, while in detail the impacts of regulation vary, in general regulation mitigates the severity of low flows.
   5. It is our contention that the indigenous biota of Australian rivers are adapted to the naturally occurring low flow conditions and that, while there is considerable scientific interest in the effects of climate change on stream ecology, such studies have little practical relevance for the management of indigenous biota in unregulated rivers.
   6. The changes brought about by the regulation of rivers are much more rapid and dramatic than those which might occur as a result of climate change and it is possible to develop management procedures to mitigate them. In regulated rivers, the real problem may be 'anti-droughts'- the removal of significant natural low-flow events from the flow pattern.

ID GENE; CONSERVATION; RESISTANCE; SEQUENCE; LOCI
AB Most studies of genetic variation within species to date are based on random markers. However, how well this correlates with quantitative variation is contentious. Yet, functional, or 'ecotypic' variation in quantitative traits determines the ecological niche of a species, its future evolutionary potential, and, for livestock, crops and their wild relatives, their usefulness as a genetic resource for breeding. But nowadays we can also assess genetic diversity using markers directly targeted at specific genes or gene families. Such gene-targeted, multilocus profiles of markers can contribute to ex-situ management of genetic resources, ecological studies of diversity, and conservation of endangered species.

AB Darwin's finches comprise a group of passerine birds first collected by Charles Darwin during his visit to the Galapagos Archipelago. The group, a textbook example of adaptive radiation (the diversification of a founding population into an array of species differentially adapted to diverse environmental niches), encompasses 14 currently recognized species, of which 13 live on the Galapagos Islands and one on the Cocos Island in the Pacific Ocean. Although Darwin's finches have been studied extensively by morphologists, ecologists, and ethologists, their phylogenetic relationships remain uncertain. Here, sequences of two mtDNA segments, the cytochrome b and the control region, have been used to infer the evolutionary history of the group. The data reveal the Darwin's finches to be a monophyletic group with the warbler finch being the species closest;to the founding stock, followed by the vegetarian finch, and then by two sister groups, the ground and the tree finches. The Cocos finch is related to the tree finches of the Galapagos Islands. The traditional classification of ground finches into six species and tree finches into five species is not reflected in the molecular data. In these two groups, ancestral polymorphisms have not, as yet, been sorted out among the cross-hybridizing species.

In this study, we simulated the urban expansion in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration in China from 2013 to 2040, and assessed its potential impacts on ESs based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and the Land Use Scenario Dynamics-urban (LUSD-urban) model. We found that urban land in the BTH urban agglomeration is expected to increase from 7605.25 km(2) in 2013 to 9401.75-11,936.00 km(2) in 2040. With continuing urban expansion, food production (FP), carbon storage (CS), water retention (WR), and air purification (AP) will decrease by 1.34-3.16%, 0.68-1.60%, 0.80-1.89%, and 0.37-0.87%, respectively. The conversion of cropland to urban land will be the main cause of ES losses. During 2013-2040, the losses of ESs caused by this conversion will account for 83.66-97.11% of the total losses in the whole region. Furthermore, the ES losses can cause considerable negative impacts on human well-being. The loss of FP will be equivalent to the food requirement of 3.68-8.61% of the total population in 2040, and the loss of CS will be 2.55-6.01% of the total standard coal consumption in 2013. To ensure sustainable development in the region, we suggest that effective policies and regulations should be implemented to protect cropland with high ES values from urban expansion.

AB The aim of the current study is to map landslide susceptibility over the Ziarat watershed in the Golestan Province, Iran, using Maximum Entropy (ME), as a machine learning model, with two sampling strategies: Mahalanobis distance (MEMD) and random sampling (MERS). To this aim, a total of 92 landslides in the watershed were recorded as point features using a GPS (Global Positioning System) device, along with several field surveys and available local data. By reviewing landslide-related studies and using principal component analysis, 12 landslide-controlling factors were chosen namely altitude, slope percent, slope aspect, lithological formations, proximity (to faults, streams, and roads), land use/cover, precipitation, plan and profile curvature and the state-ofthe-art topo-hydrological factor known as height above the nearest drainage (HAND). Two sampling methods were used to divide landslides into two sets of training (70%) and test (30%). The Area under the success rate curve (AUSRC) and the area under the prediction rate curve (AUPRC) were used to evaluate the results of the MEMD and MERS. The results showed that both MEMD and MERS strategies with the respective AUSRC values of 0.884 and 0.878, have good performance in modelling the landslide susceptibility in the study area. However, AUPRC test showed slightly different results in which MEMD with the value of 0.906 showed excellent predictive power in comparison with the MERS with the AUPRC value of 0.846. The higher AUPRC value in relation to AUSRC indicated the MEMD as the premier model in the current study. According to the MEMD, three landslide controlling factors including lithological formations, proximity to roads and precipitation with the respective contribution percentages of 25.1%, 23.3%, and 19.1%, contained more information in relation to the rest. Moreover, according to one-by-one factor removal test, lithological formations and proximity to faults were identified to have a unique information compared to the rest. According to the MEMD, about 13.8% of the study area is located within high to very high susceptibility classes which can be matter of great interest to decision makers and the local authorities for formulating land use planning strategies and implementing pragmatic measures.

AB The metaphor of ecosystem service may blind us to the complexity of the natural systems which underpin and produce services. We, reviewed key references and propose a framework to illustrate the social system relying on the ecological system and the relationships between ecosystem composition, ecosystem structure, ecosystem processes and ecosystem services, in order to reduce this complexity. We argue that plans to manage ecosystem services will not be successful without a deep understanding of their link with the ecosystem processes that support them. By linking ecosystem processes and ecosystem services, we explore the possible determinants of the biodiversity components on the quantity, quality and reliability of ecosystem services at all levels, and its usefulness in making targeted decisions. Disentangling the complex interrelationships among multiple ecosystem services from the driven processes is helpful in lowering the risk of unwanted trade-offs, and taking advantage of synergies. In landscape management, it is advisable to design suitable ecosystem structures for maximizing ecosystem services based on knowledge of the natural ecosystem processes.

AB Molecular evolutionary rate estimates have been shown to depend on the time period over which they are estimated. Factors such as demographic processes, calibration errors, purifying selection, and the heterogeneity of substitution rates among sites (RHAS) are known to affect the accuracy with which rates of evolution are estimated. We use mathematical modeling and Bayesian analyses of simulated sequence alignments to explore how mutational hotspots can lead to time-dependent rate estimates. Mathematical modeling shows that underestimation of molecular rates over increasing time scales is inevitable when RHAS is ignored. Although a gamma distribution is commonly used to model RHAS, we show that when the actual RHAS deviates from a gamma-like distribution, rates can either be under- or overestimated in a time-dependent manner. Simulations performed under different scenarios of RHAS confirm the mathematical modeling and demonstrate the impacts of time-dependent rates on estimates of divergence times. Most notably, erroneous rate estimates can have narrow credibility intervals, leading to false confidence in biased estimates of rates, and node ages. Surprisingly, large errors in estimates of overall molecular rate do not necessarily generate large errors in divergence time estimates. Finally, we illustrate the correlation between time-dependent rate patterns and differential saturation between quickly and slowly evolving sites. Our results suggest that data partitioning or simple nonparametric mixture models of RHAS significantly improve the accuracy with which node ages and substitution rates can be estimated.

AB We review the variety of existing modelling approaches applied to species habitat mapping and we discuss issues arising from the availability and nature of sampled biological data and corresponding ecological and environmental habitat descriptors, as well as the different spatial analysis approaches that are selected according to specific hypotheses. We focus on marine species habitat mapping, presenting an overview of work on modelling fish habitat carried out through a European Communities Policy-Support Action, EnviEFH 'Environmental Approach to Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) Designation' (2005-2008). The selection of the appropriate habitat model is dataset-specific and the resulting EFH maps are often similar in spite of using different models. Derived EFH maps are based on either environmental ranges (used as minimum and maximum environmental habitat descriptors) or probability of occurrence values. We apply model outputs to regions larger than sampled areas making use of the capacity of satellite data to cover wide areas.

AB Nitrogen use efficiency is higher in newer than in older maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids, but the physiological mechanisms underlying differences in N-use efficiency are unknown. The objective of this study was to quantify differences between an older and a newer maize hybrid in their response to N availability throughout the life cycle at both the leaf and the whole-plant level. An older and a newer maize hybrid were grown in a field hydroponic system located near Guelph, ON, in 2005 at a high and a low N level. Leaf carbon exchange rate (CER), chlorophyll index, and the thylakoid electron transport rate (ETR) were measured weekly from 2 wk presilking to 8 wk postsilking. Plant-component dry matter and N content were determined from 1 wk presilking to maturity. At the leaf level, leaf CER declined during the grain-filling period, and the decline was greater under low than high N availability. The decline in leaf CER during the grain-filling period was less in the newer than in the older hybrid under both high and low N availability, and differences in leaf CER were associated most strongly with a reduction in leaf CER per unit absorbed photosynthetic photon flux density. At the whole-plant level, reduction in grain yield in low vs. high N was greater in the older than in the newer hybrid. The hybrid x N interaction for grain yield was attributable predominantly to a greater decline in the proportion of dry matter allocated to the grain in the older hybrid.

AB Parasites represent a great proportion of the world's living organisms and are of overwhelming significance because of their impact on hosts (evolutionarily, medically, agronomical and economically). The knowledge of the population biology of such organisms is thus of fundamental importance to population biologists. Most parasites cannot be studied by direct methods and their biology has to be assessed via indirect means, most notably using molecular markers. In this review, we present the molecular tools, the null models employed, the statistical tools available and the kinds of inferences one can make when using molecular markers to study the ecology/epidemiology of host-parasite systems (molecular ecology/molecular epidemiology). We conclude with relevant examples, most issued from our laboratory, to illustrate the pros and cons of such methods for the study of parasites, vectors, micropathogens and their hosts and briefly discuss future needs.

AB Recent attempts at projecting climate change impacts on biodiversity have used the IUCN Red List Criteria to obtain estimates of extinction rates based on projected range shifts. In these studies, the Criteria are often misapplied, potentially introducing substantial bias and uncertainty. These misapplications include arbitrary changes to temporal and spatial scales; confusion of the spatial variables; and assume a linear relationship between abundance and range area. Using the IUCN Red List Criteria to identify which species are threatened by climate change presents special problems and uncertainties, especially for shorter-lived species. Responses of most species to future climate change are not understood well enough to estimate extinction risks based solely on climate change scenarios and projections of shifts and/or reductions in range areas. One way to further such understanding would be to analyze the interactions among habitat shifts, landscape structure and demography for a number of species, using a combination of models. Evaluating the patterns in the results might allow the development of guidelines for assigning species to threat categories, based on a combination of life history parameters, characteristics of the landscapes in which they live, and projected range changes.

AB Spatial and temporal variation in fish-assemblage structure within isolated waterholes on the floodplains of Cooper Creek, Australia, was studied during the 2001 dry season, a period of natural drought in this arid-zone river. Spatial variation in fish-assemblage structure and the abundance of five species in disconnected waterholes early in the dry season (April 2001) were related to the extent of floodplain inundation 14 months previously, and to the interconnectedness of waterholes and waterhole habitat structure. As the dry season progressed, waterhole volumes decreased owing to evaporative water loss and structural habitat elements (anabranches, bars, boulders) became exposed. Marked changes in fish assemblage structure between the early (April) and late (September) dry season were related to habitat loss but not to water chemistry. Interactions between flow and habitat across a nested hierarchy of spatial scales (the floodplain, the waterhole and habitat patches within waterholes) were crucial to the persistence of fish assemblages through the 2001 dry season. We conclude that the magnitude, timing and frequency of floodplain inundation and natural variations in waterhole volume must be maintained if we wish to sustain the distinctive habitats and fish assemblages of this arid-zone floodplain river.

AB Recent advances in quantifying biochemical and cellular-level responses to thermal stress have facilitated a new exploration of the role of climate and climate change in driving intertidal community and population ecology. To fruitfully, connect these disciplines, we first need to understand what the body temperatures of intertidal organisms are under field conditions, and how they change in space and time. Newly available data logger technology makes such an exploration possible, but several potential pitfalls must be avoided. Body temperature during aerial exposure is driven by multiple, interacting climatic factors, and extremes during low tide far exceed those during submersion. Moreover, because of effects of body size and morphology, two organisms exposed to identical climatic conditions can display very different body temperatures, which can also be substantially different from the temperature of the surrounding air. These same factors drive the temperature recorded by data loggers, and one logger type is unlikely to serve as an effective proxy for all organisms at a site. Here I describe the difficulties involved in quantifying patterns of body temperature in intertidal organisms, and explore the implications of this complexity for intertidal physiological ecology. I do so using data from temperature loggers designed to mimic the thermal characteristics of the mussel Mytilus californianus, and deployed at multiple sites along the West Coast of the United States. Results indicate a highly intricate pattern of thermal stress, where the interaction of climate with the dynamics of the tidal cycle determines the timing and magnitude of temperature extremes, creating a unique "thermal signal" at each site.

AB The population structure of black-browed (Thalassarche melanophris and T. impavida) and grey-headed (T. chrysostoma) albatrosses was examined using both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite analyses. mtDNA sequences from 73 black-browed and 50 grey-headed albatrosses were obtained from five island groups in the Southern Ocean. High levels of sequence divergence were found in both taxa (0.55-7.20% in black-browed albatrosses and 2.10-3.90% in grey-headed albatrosses). Black-browed albatrosses form three distinct groups: Falklands, Diego Ramirez/South Georgia/Kerguelen, and Campbell Island (T. impavida). T. melanophris from Campbell Island contain birds from each of the three groups, indicating high levels of mixture and hybridization. In contrast, grey-headed albatrosses form one globally panmictic population. Microsatellite analyses on a larger number of samples using seven highly variable markers found similar population structure to the mtDNA analyses in both black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses. Differences in population structure between these two very similar and closely related species could be the result of differences in foraging and dispersal patterns. Breeding black-browed albatrosses forage mainly over continental shelves and migrate to similar areas when not breeding. Grey-headed albatrosses forage mainly at frontal systems, travelling widely across oceanic habitats outside the breeding season. Genetic analyses support the current classification of T. impavida as being distinct from T. melanophris, but would also suggest splitting T. melanophris into two groups: Falkland Islands, and Diego Ramirez/South Georgia/Kerguelen.

AB The light-nitrogen hypothesis suggests canopy photosynthesis is maximized when there is a positive relationship between irradiance received by foliage, its nitrogen content (per unit area N-area), and maximum rate of photosynthesis (A(max)). Relationships among relative irradiance and N-area allocation of nitrogen within the photosynthetic apparatus to Rubisco and chlorophyll, and A(max) were examined in Pinus pinaster Ait. needles up to 6 years of age. Measurements were made before bud break in August 1998, and in May 1999 after the first 'winter' rains. In August, N-area in P. pinaster needles decreased from 5.1 to 5.7 g m(-2) in sunlit 1-year-old needles to 2.3 g m(-2) in shaded 6-year-old needles. In May, N-area was 5-40% less but spatial trends were the same. At both sampling dates, A(max) was less in old shaded needles compared with young sunlit needles, and was thus consistent with the light-nitrogen hypothesis. Relationships between N-area and A(max) were positive at both dates yet varied in strength and form. Allocation of nitrogen within the photosynthetic apparatus was qualitatively consistent with acclimation to light (i.e. Rubisco/Chl decreased with shading), but quantitatively suboptimal with respect to photosynthesis owing to consistent over-investment in Rubisco. This over-investment increased with height in the canopy and was greater in May than in August.

AB In most species the offspring of closely related parents have reduced fitness compared with the offspring of unrelated parents, a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression. However if parents are very distantly related, their offspring may also have reduced fitness. This pattern, outbreeding depression, has been most commonly observed in plants and only rarely in animals. Here we examine the consequences of inbreeding and outbreeding on juvenile survival of reintroduced Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) in Oman, a population with a small number of founders drawn from a number of sources. Using microsatellite-based measures of inbreeding and outbreeding, there was no apparent relationship between inbreeding or outbreeding and survival when inbreeding and outbreeding were tested in separate statistical models. However when inbreeding and outbreeding were tested in the same statistical model, we found simultaneous inbreeding depression and outbreeding depression acting on juvenile survival. Outbreeding depression may be more common in vertebrates than previously supposed, and conservation strategies that seek to maximize the genetic diversity of managed populations may risk mixing lineages that are sufficiently differentiated to cause outbreeding depression among descendants.

AB Climate change triggers poleward shifts in species distribution leading to changes in biogeography. In the marine environment, fish respond quickly to warming, causing community-wide reorganizations, which result in profound changes in ecosystem functioning. Functional biogeography provides a framework to address how ecosystem functioning may be affected by climate change over large spatial scales. However, there are few studies on functional biogeography in the marine environment, and none in the Arctic, where climate-driven changes are most rapid and extensive. We investigated the impact of climate warming on the functional biogeography of the Barents Sea, which is characterized by a sharp zoogeographic divide separating boreal from Arctic species. Our unique dataset covered 52 fish species, 15 functional traits, and 3,660 stations sampled during the recent warming period. We found that the functional traits characterizing Arctic fish communities, mainly composed of small-sized bottom-dwelling benthivores, are being rapidly replaced by traits of incoming boreal species, particularly the larger, longer lived, and more piscivorous species. The changes in functional traits detected in the Arctic can be predicted based on the characteristics of species expected to undergo quick poleward shifts in response to warming. These are the large, generalist, motile species, such as cod and haddock. We show how functional biogeography can provide important insights into the relationship between species composition, diversity, ecosystem functioning, and environmental drivers. This represents invaluable knowledge in a period when communities and ecosystems experience rapid climate-driven changes across biogeographical regions.

AB Grain-legume plants fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil and thus do not need nitrogen fertilizers. Therefore, grain legumes can potentially decrease global warming, as nitrogen fertilization is responsible for half of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, grain-legumes have many functional and nutritional properties both as feed and food. Despite the fact that the European Union has granted considerable subsidies to promote grain-legume cultivation, their production continues to fall and there has been no satisfactory explanation as to why. This study provides an answer by showing that a situation of technological lock-in has resulted from the co-evolution of crop systems, based on an agrochemical paradigm, public policies, and market dynamics that promote cereals. This process began with the historical choice by European and French public institutions to relegate grain-legumes to feed in direct competition with imported soybeans. Moreover, interrelated factors, such as breeding selection, public subsidies, and food systems, have favored increasing returns to adoption for cereals to the detriment of grain-legumes. Finally, the evolutionary economics approach used here identified several actions that must be implemented together, such as agricultural cost-accounting methods, nitrogen management, institutional innovations, and market outlets to promote grain-legumes and move towards more sustainable agriculture.

AB Background: Despite considerable progress in systematics, a comprehensive scenario of the evolution of phenotypic characters in the mega-diverse Holometabola based on a solid phylogenetic hypothesis was still missing. We addressed this issue by de novo sequencing transcriptome libraries of representatives of all orders of holometabolan insects (13 species in total) and by using a previously published extensive morphological dataset. We tested competing phylogenetic hypotheses by analyzing various specifically designed sets of amino acid sequence data, using maximum likelihood (ML) based tree inference and Four-cluster Likelihood Mapping (FcLM). By maximum parsimony-based mapping of the morphological data on the phylogenetic relationships we traced evolutionary transformations at the phenotypic level and reconstructed the groundplan of Holometabola and of selected subgroups.
   Results: In our analysis of the amino acid sequence data of 1,343 single-copy orthologous genes, Hymenoptera are placed as sister group to all remaining holometabolan orders, i.e., to a clade Aparaglossata, comprising two monophyletic subunits Mecopterida (Amphiesmenoptera + Antliophora) and Neuropteroidea (Neuropterida + Coleopterida). The monophyly of Coleopterida (Coleoptera and Strepsiptera) remains ambiguous in the analyses of the transcriptome data, but appears likely based on the morphological data. Highly supported relationships within Neuropterida and Antliophora are Raphidioptera + (Neuroptera + monophyletic Megaloptera), and Diptera + (Siphonaptera + Mecoptera). ML tree inference and FcLM yielded largely congruent results. However, FcLM, which was applied here for the first time to large phylogenomic supermatrices, displayed additional signal in the datasets that was not identified in the ML trees.
   Conclusions: Our phylogenetic results imply that an orthognathous larva belongs to the groundplan of Holometabola, with compound eyes and well-developed thoracic legs, externally feeding on plants or fungi. Ancestral larvae of Aparaglossata were prognathous, equipped with single larval eyes (stemmata), and possibly agile and predacious. Ancestral holometabolan adults likely resembled in their morphology the groundplan of adult neopteran insects. Within Aparaglossata, the adult's flight apparatus and ovipositor underwent strong modifications. We show that the combination of well-resolved phylogenies obtained by phylogenomic analyses and well-documented extensive morphological datasets is an appropriate basis for reconstructing complex morphological transformations and for the inference of evolutionary histories.

AB We estimate organic carbon (C): total nitrogen (N): total phosphorus (P) ratios in soils under Australia's major native vegetation groups.
   We use digital datasets for climate, soils, and vegetation created for the National Land and Water Resources Audit in 2001. Analysis-of-variance is used to investigate differences in nutrient ratios between ecosystems. Linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression are used to investigate the relative importance of climatic variables and soil nutrients in vegetation patterns.
   We find that the N:P and C:P ratios have a greater range of values than the C:N ratio, although major vegetation groups tend to show similar trends across all three ratios. Some apparently homeostatic groupings emerge: those with very low, low, medium, or high N:P and C:P. Tussock grasslands have very low soil N, N:P, and C:P, probably due to frequent burning. Eucalypt woodlands have low soil N:P and C:P ratios, although their total P level varies. Rainforests and Melaleuca forests have medium soil N:P and C:P ratios, although their total P level is different. Heathlands, tall open eucalypt forests, and shrublands occur on soils with low levels of total P, and high N:P and C:P ratios that reflect foliar nutrient ratios and recalcitrant litter.
   Certain plant communities have typical soil nutrient stoichiometries but there is no single Redfield-like ratio. Vegetation patterns largely reflect soil moisture but for several plant communities, eucalypt communities in particular, soil N and P (or N:P) also play a significant role. Soil N:P and the presence of Proteaceae appear indicative of nutrient constraints in ecosystems.

AB In an attempt to link the microbial community composition and function in mine tailings to the generation of acid mine drainage, we simultaneously explored the geochemistry and microbiology of six tailings collected from a lead/zinc mine, i.e. primary tailings (T1), slightly acidic tailings (T2), extremely acidic tailings (T3, T4 and T5) and orange-coloured oxidized tailings (T6). Geochemical results showed that the six tailings (from T1 to T6) likely represented sequential stages of the acidification process of the mine tailings. 16S rRNA pyrosequencing revealed a contrasting microbial composition between the six tailings: Proteobacteria-related sequences dominated T1-T3 with relative abundance ranging from 56 to 93%, whereas Ferroplasma-related sequences dominated T4-T6 with relative abundance ranging from 28 to 58%. Furthermore, metagenomic analysis of the microbial communities of T2 and T6 indicated that the genes encoding key enzymes for microbial carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation and sulfur oxidation in T2 were largely from Thiobacillus and Acidithiobacillus, Methylococcus capsulatus, and Thiobacillus denitrificans respectively; while those in T6 were mostly identified in Acidithiobacillus and Leptospirillum, Acidithiobacillus and Leptospirillum, and Acidithiobacillus respectively. The microbial communities in T2 and T6 harboured more genes suggesting diverse metabolic capacities for sulfur oxidation/heavy metal detoxification and tolerating low pH respectively.

AB Respiration by plants and microorganisms is primarily responsible for mediating carbon exchanges between the biosphere and atmosphere. Climate warming has the potential to influence the activity of these organisms, regulating exchanges between carbon pools. Physiological down-regulation' of warm-adapted species (acclimation) could ameliorate the predicted respiratory losses of soil carbon under climate change scenarios, but unlike plants and symbiotic microbes, the existence of this phenomenon in heterotrophic soil microbes remains controversial. Previous studies using complex soil microbial communities are unable to distinguish physiological acclimation from other community-scale adjustments. We explored the temperature-sensitivity of individual saprotrophic basidiomycete fungi growing in agar, showing definitively that these widespread heterotrophic fungi can acclimate to temperature. In almost all cases, the warm-acclimated individuals had lower growth and respiration rates at intermediate temperatures than cold-acclimated isolates. Inclusion of such microbial physiological responses to warming is essential to enhance the robustness of global climate-ecosystem carbon models.

In the first part of the paper we present, in a conceptual way, the general framework of ML and explain the basis of the underlying theory. In the second part we describe some outstanding ML techniques to treat ecological data. In the third part we present our ecological problem and we illustrate exposed ML techniques with our data. Finally, we briefly summarize some extensions of several methods for multi-class output prediction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Species distribution model (SDM) projections under future climate scenarios are increasingly being used to inform resource management and conservation strategies. A critical assumption for projecting climate change responses is that SDMs are transferable through time, an assumption that is largely untested because investigators often lack temporally independent data for assessing transferability. Further, understanding how the ecology of species influences temporal transferability is critical yet almost wholly lacking. This raises two questions. (1) Are SDM projections transferable in time? (2) Does temporal transferability relate to species ecological traits? To address these questions we developed SDMs for 133 vascular plant species using data from the mountain ranges of California (USA) from two time periods: the 1930s and the present day. We forecast historical models over 75 years of measured climate change and assessed their projections against current distributions. Similarly, we hindcast contemporary models and compared their projections to historical data. We quantified transferability and related it to species ecological traits including physiognomy, endemism, dispersal capacity, fire adaptation, and commonness. We found that non-endemic species with greater dispersal capacity, intermediate levels of prevalence, and little fire adaptation had higher transferability than endemic species with limited dispersal capacity that rely on fire for reproduction. We demonstrate that variability in model performance was driven principally by differences among species as compared to model algorithms or time period of model calibration. Further, our results suggest that the traits correlated with prediction accuracy in a single time period may not be related to transferability between time periods. Our findings provide a priori guidance for the suitability of SDM as an approach for forecasting climate change responses for certain taxa.

AB The evolutionary and biogeographic history of the contemporary Antarctic terrestrial and marine biotas reveals many components of ancient origin. For large elements of the terrestrial biota, long-term isolation over timescales from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of years, and thus persistence through multiple glacial cycles, now appears to be the norm rather than the exception. For the marine biota there are some parallels with benthic communities also including ancient components, together with an incidence of species-level endemism indicating long-term isolation on the Antarctic continental shelf Although it has long been known that a few ice-free terrestrial locations have existed in Antarctica for up to 10-12 million years, particularly in the Dry Valleys of Victoria Land along with certain nunataks and higher regions of large mountain ranges, these do not provide potential refugia for the majority of terrestrial biota, which occur mainly in coastal and/or low-lying locations and exhibit considerable biogeographic regionalisation within the continent. Current glacial models and reconstructions do not have the spatial resolution to detect unequivocally either the number or geographical distribution of these glacial refugia, or areas of the continental shelf that have remained periodically free from ice scouring, but do provide limits for their maximum spatial extent. Recent work on the evolution of the terrestrial biota indicates that refugia were much more widespread than has been recognised and it is now clear that terrestrial biology provides novel constraints for reconstructing the past glacial history of Antarctica, and new marine biological investigations of the Antarctic shelf are starting to do likewise.

AB Vehicle exhaust emissions are a dominant feature of urban environments and are widely believed to have detrimental effects on plants. The effects of diesel exhaust emissions on 12 herbaceous species were studied with respect to growth, flower development leaf senescence and leaf surface wax characteristics. A diesel generator was used to produce concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) representative of urban conditions, in solardome chambers. Annual mean NOx concentrations ranged from 77 nl l(-1) to 98 nil l(-1), with NO:NO2 ratios of 1.4-2.2, providing a good experimental simulation of polluted roadside environments. Pollutant exposure resulted in species-specific changes in growth and phenology, with a consistent trend for accelerated senescence and delayed flowering. Leaf surface characteristics were also affected; contact angle measurements indicated changes in surface wax structure following pollutant exposure. The study demonstrated clearly the potential for realistic levels of vehicle exhaust pollution to have direct adverse effects on urban vegetation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fishers and small-scale fisheries worldwide have been marginalized historically. Now it is clear that integrating fishers in management processes is key to resource conservation, but it is less clear how to do it. Here, based on a literature review and new information, we present and analyze a case in which the participation of fishers in the management process was crucial in recovering an overexploited small-scale fishery for the pirarucu (Arapaima spp.) in the Amazon Basin, Brazil. In 8 years of experimental management, from 1999 to 2006, the population of pirarucu increased 9-fold (from about 2200 to 20,650 individuals), harvest quotas increased 10-fold (from 120 to 1249 individuals), and fishers' participation in the management process increased and they benefited from increased monetary returns. Additionally, the number of communities conducting the management scheme increased from 4 in 1999 to 108 in 2006, following the demands of fishers and regional government agencies. Based on our analysis, we suggest that the participation of fishers in the management of other small-scale fisheries in the world can be improved by focusing on (1) applying the knowledge and skills of fishers in resource monitoring and management, (2) bridging knowledge systems among all involved stakeholders, (3) collaborating with fishers that are interested in, and capable of conducting, resource conservation schemes, and (4) conducting management under conditions of uncertainty.

AB 1. Studies of landscape change are seldom conducted at scales commensurate with the processes they purport to investigate. Landscape change is a landscape-level process, yet most studies focus on patches. Even when landscape context is considered, inference remains at the patch-level. The unit of investigation must be extended beyond individual patches to whole mosaics in order to advance understanding of faunal responses to landscape change.
   2. In this study, we aggregated data from multiple sites per landscape such that both the response and explanatory variables characterized 'whole' landscapes, allowing for landscape-level inference about factors influencing species' incidence.
   3. We used hierarchical partitioning and Bayesian variable selection methods to develop species-specific models that examined the influence of four categories of landscape properties - habitat extent, habitat configuration, landscape composition and geographical location - on the incidence of 58 species of woodland-dependent birds in 24 agricultural landscapes (each 100 km(2)) in south-eastern Australia.
   4. There was strong evidence for a positive effect of habitat extent for 27 species. Thirty species were related to at least one of the four landscape composition variables, and geographical location was important for 19 species. Habitat configuration was influential for 13 species and where important, the impacts of fragmentation per se were detrimental.
   5. Variation among species in the influential landscape variables indicates that different species respond to different sets of cues in land mosaics. Thus, although all species were grouped a priori as 'woodland-dependent', expectations based on general ecological characteristics may prove unreliable.
   6. Synthesis and applications. These results underscore the value of moving beyond the fragmentation paradigm focused on the spatial pattern of habitat vs. non-habitat, to a greater appreciation of the composition and heterogeneity of land mosaics. Landscape-level inference will enable improved conservation outcomes by recognizing the influence of landscape properties on biota and devising strategies at this scale to complement patch-based management. We provide strong empirical evidence that biodiversity management in agricultural landscapes must focus on habitat extent. Complementary management of other landscape attributes, such as habitat aggregation and intensity of agricultural land-use, will also enhance the value of agricultural landscapes for woodland birds.

AB Few studies to date have examined genetic variabililty of widespread tropical amphibian species over their distributional range using different kinds of molecular markers. Here, we use genetic data in an attempt to delimit evolutionary entities within two groups of Neotropical frogs, the Scinax ruber species group and the Rhinella margaritifera species group. We combined mitochondrial and nuclear markers for a phylogenetic (a total of similar to 2500 bp) and phylogeographic study (similar to 1300 bp) to test the reliability of the currently accepted taxonomic assignments and to explore the geographic structure of their genetic variation, mainly based upon samples from the French Guianan region. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated the polyphyly of Scinax ruber and Rhinella margaritifera. S. ruber consists of six lineages that may all merit species status. Conflicting signals of mitochondrial and nuclear markers indicated, among some Scinax lineages and species, the possibility of ongoing hybridization processes. R. margaritifera consisted of 11 lineages which might represent distinct species as well. Phylogeographic analyses added further information in support of the specific status of these lineages. Lineages of low divergence were found in sympatry and were reciprocally monophyletic for mitochondrial as well as nuclear genes, indicating the existence of young lineages that should be awarded species status. Our results highlight the utility of combining phylogenetic and phylogeographic methods, as well as the use of both mitochondrial and nuclear markers within one study. This approach helped to better understand the evolutionary history of taxonomically complex groups of species. The assessment of the geographic distribution of genetic diversity in tropical amphibian communities can lead to conclusions that differ strongly from prior analyses based on the occurrence of currently recognized species alone. Such studies, therefore, hold the potential to contribute to a more objective assessment of amphibian conservation priorities in tropical areas. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Endosymbioses are a major form of biological complexity affecting the ecological and evolutionary diversification of many eukaryotic groups. These associations are exemplified by nutritional symbioses of insects for which phylogenetic studies have demonstrated numerous cases of long-term codiversification between a bacterial and a host lineage. Some insects, including most leafhoppers (Insecta: Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), have more than one bacterial symbiont within specialized host cells, raising questions regarding the patterns of codiversification of these multiple partners and the evolutionary persistence of complex symbiotic systems. Previous studies reported the presence of two dominant symbiont types in a member of the leafhopper subfamily Cicadellinae (sharpshooters). In this study, 16S rRNA sequences were obtained and used to examine the occurrence and evolutionary relationships of the two dominant symbiont types across 29 leafhopper species. Candidatus Sulcia muelleri (Bacteroidetes) was detected in all leafhopper species examined, a finding that is consistent with a previous report of its ancient association with the Auchenorrhyncha (a grouping that includes leafhoppers, treehoppers, cicadas, planthoppers, and spittlebugs). Baumannia cicadellinicola (Proteobacteria), previously known from only five sharpshooter species, was found only in the sharpshooter tribes Cicadellini and Proconiini, as well as in the subfamily Phereurhininae. Mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences were obtained and used to reconstruct host phylogenies. Analyses of host and symbiont data sets support a congruent evolutionary history between sharpshooters, Sulcia and Baumannia and thus provide the first strong evidence for long-term co-inheritance of multiple symbionts during the diversification of a eukaryotic host. Sulcia shows a fivefold lower rate of 16S rDNA sequence divergence than does Baumannia for the same host pairs. The term 'coprimary' symbiont is proposed for such cases.

AB Aim To estimate the relative importance of climate and soil nutritional variables for predicting the distribution of Acer campestre (L.) in French forests.
   Location France.
   Methods We used presence/absence information for A. campestre in 3286 forest plots scattered all over France, coupled with climatic and edaphic data. More than 150 climatic variables (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, evapotranspiration, water balance) were obtained using a digital elevation model (DEM) and a geographical information system (GIS). Six direct soil variables (pH, C/N ratio, base saturation rate, concentrations of calcium, magnesium and potassium) were available from EcoPlant, a phytoecological data base for French forests. Using a forward stepwise logistic regression technique, we derived two distinct predictive models for A. campestre; the first with climatic variables alone and the second with both climatic and edaphic variables.
   Results The distribution of A. campestre was poorly modelled when including only climatic variables. The inclusion of edaphic variables significantly improved the quality of predictions for this species, allowing prediction of patches of presence/absence within the study region.
   Main conclusion Soil nutritional variables may improve the performance of fine-scale (grain) plant species distribution models.

AB 1. We compared the reproduction of a marine diving bird, Brunnich's guillemot (Uria lomvia), breeding at two Arctic colonies close to the northern and southern limits of the species' range in the Canadian Arctic.
   2. At both colonies, timing of breeding for Brunnich's guillemots was positively correlated with summer ice cover, which was determined by winter and spring temperatures. Spring temperatures also modified the effects of ice conditions on timing of breeding.
   3. At Coats Island, northern Hudson Bay, in low Arctic waters, the date of egg-laying has advanced since 1981, simultaneous with a decrease in summer ice cover in surrounding waters. Lower ice cover in this region is correlated with lower chick growth rates and lower adult body mass, suggesting that reduction in summer ice extent is having a negative effect on reproduction.
   4. Conversely, at Prince Leopold Island, in the High Arctic, there has been no trend in summer ice cover and no detectable change in timing of breeding. Reproduction there is less successful in years of late ice than in years of early ice break-up. 5. Current trends suggest that continued warming should benefit birds breeding on the northern limit of the species range, while adversely affecting reproduction for those on the southern margin. The probable result will be an eventual northward displacement of the population. Although this type of effect has been widely predicted, this study is among the first to demonstrate a potential causal mechanism.

AB We evaluated leaf characteristics and herbivory intensities for saplings of fifteen tropical tree species differing in their successional position. Eight leaf traits were selected, related to the costs of leaf display (specific leaf area [SLA], water content), photosynthesis (N and P concentration per unit mass), and herbivory defence (lignin concentration, C:N ratio). We hypothesised that species traits are shaped by variation in abiotic and biotic (herbivory) selection pressures along the successional gradient. All leaf traits varied with the successional position of the species. The SLA, water content and nutrient concentration decreased, and lignin concentration increased with the successional position. Herbivory damage (defined as the percentage of damage found at one moment in time) varied from 0.9-8.5% among the species, but was not related to their successional position. Herbivory damage appeared to be a poor estimator of the herbivory rate experienced by species, due to the confounding effect of leaf lifespan. Herbivory rate (defined as percentage leaf area removal per unit time) declined with the successional position of the species. Herbivory rate was only positively correlated to water content, and negatively correlated to lignin concentration, suggesting that herbivores select leaves based upon their digestibility rather than upon their nutritive value. Surprisingly, most species traits change linearly with succession, while resource availability (light, nutrients) declines exponentially with succession.

AB Many recent studies suggest that more diverse communities are more resistant to invasion. Community characteristics that most strongly influence invasion are uncertain, however, due to covariation of diversity with competition and crowding. We examined separately the effects of species richness and dominance on invasion by an exotic legume, Melilotus officinalis, in intact, native Kansas grassland. We manipulated dominance of C-4 grasses by reducing their abundance (i.e. ramet densities) by similar to25 and 50%. In addition, richness was reduced by removing species that were mainly rare and uncommon as might be expected with environmental changes such as drought and fragmentation. In both years of the study (2001-2002), invasibility, measured as peak establishment of Melilotus, was not affected by a 3-fold reduction in species richness, nor was there an interaction between loss of species and reduced dominance on invasion. In contrast, reductions in abundance of the dominants significantly reduced invasibility of the grassland plots in both years. Because the abundance of dominants was highly correlated with measures of competition (i.e. ratio of dominant biomass to total biomass) and crowding (total stem densities), this pattern was opposite to that expected if competition were indeed limiting invasion. Rather, invasion appeared to be facilitated by the dominant species, most likely because reduced dominance increased environmental stress. Our results suggest that dominance is the key community characteristic determining invasibility, because highly competitive and space-filling species can either enhance or reduce susceptibility to invasion depending on whether dominants create a more competitive environment or alleviate stressful conditions.

AB Trichoptera are holometabolous insects with aquatic larvae that, together with the Lepidoptera, make up the Amphiesmenoptera. Despite extensive previous morphological work, little phylogenetic agreement has been reached about the relationship among the three suborders-Annulipalpia, Spicipalpia, and Integripalpia-or about the monophyly of Spicipalpia. In an effort to resolve this conflict, we sequenced fragments of the large and small subunit nuclear ribosomal RNAs (1078 nt; D1, D3, V4-5), the nuclear elongation factor la gene (EF-1alpha; 1098 nt), and a fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI; 411 nt). Seventy adult and larval morphological characters were reanalyzed and added to molecular data in a combined analysis. We evaluated signal and homoplasy in each of the molecular datasets and attempted to rank the particular datasets according to how appropriate they were for inferring relationships among suborders. This evaluation included testing for conflict among datasets, comparing tree lengths among alternative hypotheses, measuring the left-skew of tree-length distributions from maximally divergent sets of taxa, evaluating the recovery of expected clades, visualizing whether or not substitutions were accumulating with time, and estimating nucleotide compositional bias.
   Although all these measures cast doubt on the reliability of the deep-level signal coming from the nucleotides of the COI and EF-1alpha genes, these data could still be included in combined analyses without overturning the results from the most conservative marker, the rRNA. The different datasets were found to be evolving under extremely different rates.
   A site-specific likelihood method for dealing with combined data with nonoverlapping parameters was proposed, and a similar weighting scheme under parsimony was evaluated.
   Among our phylogenetic conclusions, we found Annulipalpia to be the most basal of the three suborders, with Spicipalpia and Integripalpia forming a clade. Monophyly of Annulipalpia and Integripalpia was confirmed but the relationships among spicipalpians remain equivocal.

AB The phylogeographic structure of 15 genera of Amazonian marsupials and rodents is summarized based on comparative sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The data are limited in geographical coverage, with samples widely scattered throughout Amazonia from the base of the Andes in Peru to the Guianan coast and eastern Brazil. We use this approach to define species boundaries, based minimally on the principle of reciprocal monophyly, in conjunction with morphological or other genetic discontinuities. The taxa so defined are older than previously appreciated, with many lineages dating from 1 to more than 3 Myr, and thus apparently predating the early Pleistocene. We relate patterns of concordant geographical shifts with underlying tectonic history and to current positions of major rivers. Finally, we provide comments on the utility of these data and patterns to conservation, articulating a need to incorporate phylogeographic information as part of the rationale in establishing conservation priorities at the organismal and geographical area levels.

AB Debate on the control of population dynamics in reef fishes has centred on whether patterns in abundance are determined by the supply of planktonic recruits, or by post-recruitment processes. Recruitment limitation implies little or no regulation of the reef-associated population, and is supported by several experimental studies that failed to detect density dependence. Previous manipulations of population density have, however, focused on juveniles, and there have been no tests for density-dependent interactions among adult reef fishes. I tested for population regulation in Coryphopterus glaucofraenum, a small, short-lived goby that is common in the Caribbean. Adult density was manipulated on artificial reefs and adults were also monitored on reefs where they varied in density naturally. Survival of adult gobies showed a strong inverse relationship with their initial density across a realistic range of densities. Individually marked gobies, however, grew at similar rates across all densities, suggesting that density-dependent survival was not associated with depressed growth, and so may result from predation or parasitism rather than from food shortage. Like adult survival, the accumulation of new recruits on reefs was also much lower at high adult densities than at low densities. Suppression of recruitment by adults may occur because adults cause either reduced larval settlement or reduced early post-settlement survival. In summary, this study has documented a previously unrecorded regulatory mechanism for reef fish populations (density-dependent adult mortality) and provided a particularly strong example of a well-established mechanism (density-dependent recruitment). In combination, these two compensatory mechanisms have the potential to strongly regulate the abundance of this species, and rule out the control of abundance by the supply of recruits.

AB Seasonal ecophysiology, leaf structure and nitrogen were measured in saplings of early (Populus grandidentata Michx. and Prunus serotina J.F. Ehrh.), middle (Fraxinus americana L. and Carya tomentosa Nutt.) and late (Acer rubrum L. and Cornus florida L.) successional tree species during severe drought on adjacent open and understory sites in central Pennsylvania, USA. Area-based net photosynthesis (A) and leaf conductance to water vapor diffusion (g(wv)) varied by site and species and were highest in open growing plants and early successional species at both the open and understory sites. In response to the period of maximum drought, both sunfleck and sun leaves of the early successional species exhibited smaller decreases in A than leaves of the other species. Shaded understory leaves of all species were more susceptible to drought than sun leaves and had negative midday A values during the middle and later growing season. Shaded understory leaves also displayed a reduced photosynthetic light response during the peak drought period. Sun leaves were thicker and had a greater mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen (N) content than shaded leaves, and early and middle successional species had higher N contents and concentrations than late successional species. In both sunfleck and sun leaves, seasonal A was positively related to predawn leaf Psi, g(wv), LMA and N, and was negatively related to vapor pressure deficit, midday leaf Psi and internal CO2. Although a significant amount of plasticity occurred in all species for most gas exchange and leaf structural parameters, middle successional species exhibited the largest degree of phenotypic plasticity between open and understory plants.

AB Aim: Tropical forests account for a quarter of the global carbon storage and a third of the terrestrial productivity. Few studies have teased apart the relative importance of environmental factors and forest attributes for ecosystem functioning, especially for the tropics. This study aims to relate aboveground biomass (AGB) and biomass dynamics (i.e., net biomass productivity and its underlying demographic drivers: biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) to forest attributes (tree diversity, community-mean traits and stand basal area) and environmental conditions (water availability, soil fertility and disturbance).
   Location: Neotropics.
   Methods: We used data from 26 sites, 201 1-ha plots and >92,000 trees distributed across the Neotropics. We quantified for each site water availability and soil total exchangeable bases and for each plot three key community-weighted mean functional traits that are important for biomass stocks and productivity. We used structural equation models to test the hypothesis that all drivers have independent, positive effects on biomass stocks and dynamics.
   Results: Of the relationships analysed, vegetation attributes were more frequently associated significantly with biomass stocks and dynamics than environmental conditions (in 67 vs. 33% of the relationships). High climatic water availability increased biomass growth and stocks, light disturbance increased biomass growth, and soil bases had no effect. Rarefied tree species richness had consistent positive relationships with biomass stocks and dynamics, probably because of niche complementarity, but was not related to net biomass productivity. Community-mean traits were good predictors of biomass stocks and dynamics.
   Main conclusions: Water availability has a strong positive effect on biomass stocks and growth, and a future predicted increase in (atmospheric) drought might, therefore, potentially reduce carbon storage. Forest attributes, including species diversity and community-weighted mean traits, have independent and important relationships with AGB stocks, dynamics and ecosystem functioning, not only in relatively simple temperate systems, but also in structurally complex hyper-diverse tropical forests.

AB Rehabilitation and restoration of forest ecosystems are in growing demand to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss and desertification major environmental problems of our time. Interest in restoration of ecosystems is increasingly translated into strong political commitment to large-scale tree planting projects. Along with this new impetus and the enormous scale of planned projects come both opportunities and risks: opportunities to significantly increase the use of native species, and risks of failure associated with the use of inadequate or mismatched reproductive material, which though it may provide forest cover in the short term, will not likely establish a self-sustaining ecosystem. The value of using native tree species in ecosystem restoration is receiving growing recognition both among restoration practitioners and policy makers. However, insufficient attention has been given to genetic variation within and among native tree species, their life histories and the consequences of their interactions with each other and with their environment. Also restoration practitioners have often neglected to build in safeguards against the anticipated effects of anthropogenic climate change. Measurement of restoration success has tended to be assessments of hectares covered or seedling survival in a short timeframe, neither of which is an indicator of ecosystem establishment in the long term. In this article, we review current practices in ecosystem restoration using native tree species, with a particular focus on genetic considerations. Our discussion is organised across three themes: (i) species selection and the sourcing of forest reproductive material; (ii) increasing resilience by fostering natural selection, ecological connectivity and species associations; and (iii) measuring the success of restoration activities. We present a number of practical recommendations for researchers, policymakers and restoration practitioners to increase the potential for successful interventions. We recommend the development and adoption of decision-support tools for: (i) collecting and propagating germplasm in a way that ensures a broad genetic base of restored tree populations, including planning the sourcing of propagation material of desired species well before the intended planting time; (ii) matching species and provenances to restoration sites based on current and future site conditions, predicted or known patterns of variation in adaptive traits and availability of seed sources; and (iii) landscape-level planning in restoration projects.

AB A striking example of climate-mediated range shifts in marine systems is the intrusion of tropical species into temperate areas world-wide, but we know very little about the ecological consequences of these range expansions. In the Mediterranean Sea, the range expansion of tropical rabbitfishes that first entered the basin via the Suez Canal provides a good example of how tropical herbivorous fish can impact the structure of rocky bottoms in temperate seas. Two species of rabbitfishes have now become a dominant component of total fish biomass in the southernmost part of the eastern Mediterranean. Experimental evidence shows these species can profoundly transform benthic communities, turning algal forests into barrens', but the specific mechanisms that facilitate this shift have not been established. We surveyed 1000km of coastline in the eastern Mediterranean and identified two clearly distinct areas, a warmer group of regions with abundant tropical rabbitfish and a colder group of regions where these consumers were absent/ extremely rare. In regions with abundant rabbitfish, canopy algae were 65% less abundant, and there was a 60% reduction of overall benthic biomass (algae and invertebrates) and a 40% decrease in total species richness. Video-recorded feeding experiments showed that the extensive barrens characteristic of regions with abundant rabbitfish were not due to greater rates of herbivory by these tropical consumers, but rather by functional differences among the herbivores. Temperate herbivorous fish displayed the greatest macroalgae consumption rates overall, but they fed exclusively on established adult macroalgae. In contrast, in regions with abundant rabbitfishes, these consumers fed complementarily on both established macroalgae and on the epilithic algal matrix, which typically contains macroalgal recruits.Synthesis. Range-shifting tropical rabbitfish can severely reduce the biomass and biodiversity of temperate reefs at a scale of hundreds of kilometres. A shift from macroalgal dominance to barrens is mediated by the addition of functionally diverse herbivores that characterize tropical reefs. This work highlights the importance of assessing the functional traits of range-shifting species to determine potential mechanisms of impact on ecological communities.

AB Climate influences the biogeography of bats, their access to food, timing of hibernation, reproduction and development, frequency and duration of torpor and rate of energy expenditure. Empirical data on the impact of climate change on bats are a cause for concern as current increases in global temperature are one fifth, or less, of those expected over the next century. We review observed impacts of climate change on bats and identify risk factors allowing species-specific predictions. The impact on species is reviewed in relation to six aspects, namely foraging, roosting, reproduction, biogeography, extreme weather events and indirect effects of climate change. For some aspects of species' ecology, there are insufficient data available to make accurate assessment of impacts. We identify seven risk factors encompassing three broad aspects: biogeography - small range size, high latitude or high altitude range and a range occupying a geographic area likely to become water stressed; foraging niche - frugivory and species restricted to aerial hawking; dispersal ability - species with restricted dispersal behaviour. We use the European and north-west African bats as a case study to assess the relative risk of climate change to individual species. Risk scores are compared with existing International Union for Conservation of Nature conservation assessments providing further insight into the conservation outlook for individual species. We provide a base for Chiroptera to be incorporated into future frameworks of risk assessment and identify areas that require further research.

AB The primary aim of this review was to evaluate the state of knowledge of the geographical distribution of all infectious diseases of clinical significance to humans. A systematic review was conducted to enumerate cartographic progress, with respect to the data available for mapping and the methods currently applied. The results helped define the minimum information requirements for mapping infectious disease occurrence, and a quantitative framework for assessing the mapping opportunities for all infectious diseases. This revealed that of 355 infectious diseases identified, 174 (49%) have a strong rationale for mapping and of these only 7 (4%) had been comprehensively mapped. A variety of ambitions, such as the quantification of the global burden of infectious disease, international biosurveillance, assessing the likelihood of infectious disease outbreaks and exploring the propensity for infectious disease evolution and emergence, are limited by these omissions. An overview of the factors hindering progress in disease cartography is provided. It is argued that rapid improvement in the landscape of infectious diseases mapping can be made by embracing non-conventional data sources, automation of geo-positioning and mapping procedures enabled by machine learning and information technology, respectively, in addition to harnessing labour of the volunteer 'cognitive surplus' through crowdsourcing.

AB Quantifying how functional traits relate to environmental gradients provides insight into mechanisms governing species distributions. Here, we bring together the fields of species distribution modelling and functional trait ecology with hierarchical modelling by explicitly incorporating traits into a multi-species distribution model. We combined traits from the leaf-height-seed strategy scheme (specific leaf area (SLA), plant height and seed mass) with a distribution model for 20 eucalypt taxa in Victoria, Australia. The key insight of this approach is how traits modulate species responses to environmental gradients. The strongest link was between SLA and percent rock cover (species with low SLA had positive responses to rockiness, whereas high SLA species responded negatively to rockiness). We found evidence for complex yet potentially important interactions. For instance, the probability of species occurrence increased with rainfall and solar radiation on average yet the response varied depending on species height and SLA. Tall species were predicted to increase with rainfall and solar radiation across the range of SLA values (tall species with low SLA were especially sensitive to rainfall). Short species responded positively to rainfall and solar radiation only if they had low SLA. This framework readily accounts for interactions between combinations of traits and environmental variables unlike multi-step approaches. Further application of this concept will contribute to a generalized mechanistic understanding of how traits influence species distributions along environmental gradients, with implications for understanding the response of species to global change.

AB We develop a hierarchical capture-recapture model for demographically open populations when auxiliary spatial information about location of capture is obtained. Such spatial capture-recapture data arise from studies based on camera trapping, DNA sampling, and other situations in which a spatial array of devices records encounters of unique individuals. We integrate an individual-based formulation of a Jolly-Seber type model with recently developed spatially explicit capture-recapture models to estimate density and demographic parameters for survival and recruitment. We adopt a Bayesian framework for inference under this model using the method of data augmentation which is implemented in the software program WinBUGS. The model was motivated by a camera trapping study of Pampas cats Leopardus colocolo from Argentina, which we present as an illustration of the model in this paper. We provide estimates of density and the first quantitative assessment of vital rates for the Pampas cat in the High Andes. The precision of these estimates is poor due likely to the sparse data set. Unlike conventional inference methods which usually rely on asymptotic arguments, Bayesian inferences are valid in arbitrary sample sizes, and thus the method is ideal for the study of rare or endangered species for which small data sets are typical.

AB Southwest Western Australia (SWWA) has experienced a 15-20% reduction in rainfall since the 1970s with severe reductions in inflows to Perth drinking water reservoirs. To quantify rainfall and runoff patterns, we used trend and change point analyses for a 50 year record (1950-2008) and in the last two decades (1989-2008). From 1950-2008, trend tests showed significant declines in annual rainfall and runoff with corresponding change points for both rainfall and flow in the late 1960s or mid-1970s. In the more recent record (1989-2008), runoff declined in the majority of catchments, but rainfall did not show a significant downward trend. Rather, streamflow decline was observed as a step change in response to the occurrence of below-average rainfall years. A shift from perennial to ephemeral streams and a decline in the runoff coefficient (runoff/rainfall) in the last decade suggests a new hydrologic regime has developed with important implications for future surface water supply.

AB Conservation genetics studies of populations bottlenecks are commonly framed under the detrimental paradigm of inbreeding depression. This conceptual paradigm presupposes a direct and unambiguous relationship between population size, genetic diversity, fitness, and extinction. Here, I review a series of studies that emphasize the role of chance, selection, and history in determining the genetic consequences of population bottlenecks. The variable responses of bottlenecks to fitness, phenotypic variation, and heritable variation emphasize the necessity to explore the relationship between molecular genetic diversity, fitness, adaptive genetic diversity, and extinction beyond the detrimental paradigm of inbreeding depression. Implications for conservation and management are presented as guidelines and testable predictions regarding the potential effects of bottlenecks on population viability and extinction.

AB By facilitating independent shifts in species' distributions, climate disruption may result in the rapid development of novel species assemblages that challenge the capacity of species to co-exist and adapt. We used a multivariate approach borrowed from paleoecology to quantify the potential change in California terrestrial breeding bird communities based on current and future species-distribution models for 60 focal species. Projections of future no-analog communities based on two climate models and two species-distribution-model algorithms indicate that by 2070 over half of California could be occupied by novel assemblages of bird species, implying the potential for dramatic community reshuffling and altered patterns of species interactions. The expected percentage of no-analog bird communities was dependent on the community scale examined, but consistent geographic patterns indicated several locations that are particularly likely to host novel bird communities in the future. These no-analog areas did not always coincide with areas of greatest projected species turnover. Efforts to conserve and manage biodiversity could be substantially improved by considering not just future changes in the distribution of individual species, but including the potential for unprecedented changes in community composition and unanticipated consequences of novel species assemblages.

AB Many published phylogenies are based on methods that assume equal nucleotide composition among taxa. Studies have shown, however, that this assumption is often not accurate, particularly in divergent lineages. Nonstationary sequence evolution, when taxa in different lineages evolve in different ways, can lead to unequal nucleotide composition. This can cause inference methods to fail and phylogenies to be inaccurate. Recent advancements in phylogenetic theory have proposed new models of nonstationary sequence evolution; these models often outperform equivalent stationary models. A variety of new phylogenetic software implementing such models has been developed, but the studies employing the new methodology are still few. We discovered convergence of nucleotide composition within mitochondrial genomes of the insect order Coleoptera (beetles). We found variation in base content both among species and among genes in the genome. To this data set, we have applied a broad range of phylogenetic methods, including some traditional stationary models of evolution and all the more recent nonstationary models. We compare 8 inference methods applied to the same data set. Although the more commonly used methods universally fail to recover established clades, we find that some of the newer software packages are more appropriate for data of this nature. The software packages p4, PHASE, and nhPhyML were able to overcome the systematic bias in our data set, but parsimony, MrBayes, NJ, LogDet, and PhyloBayes were not.

AB The current global fisheries crises have immense implications for the health and viability of animal populations, as well as the ecosystems and habitats that support this biodiversity. These crises have provoked a wide variety of management solutions and alternatives that are closely aligned with other small-scale resource extraction conservation approaches, but have been analyzed separately from the common-pool resource management literature. We summarize findings from an analysis of progressive small-scale fisheries worldwide and find that solutions arise from a historical trial and error management process as problems become dire. We find high success in the social organization and regulation of resources among these progressive fisheries but poor evidence for improved ecosystems. Based on evidence provided by the most progressive fisheries, we suggest a change in policy towards the management of small-scale fisheries. This change includes four major avenues of problem solving that focus on facilitating socio-ecological processes rather than primarily promoting a high level of quantitative science and implementing findings, technological concepts, or tools. Adoption is often culturally and context specific and, therefore, the above often have poor success when not socially integrated. We encourage facilitating and catalyzing local-level adoption of rules that create limits to appropriation and technology, since it is increasingly recognized that such limits are key solutions to the threats. This will be achieved if policy and actions (1) encourage professionalism (formation of "societies", setting standards, certification, self-policing, appropriate technology, etc.), (2) create forums where all opinions about solutions, the status of targeted species, and environmental requirements are represented, (3) promote social rules that consider the realities and limits of the households and local social economy, and (4) craft solutions tailored to the specific and agreed upon diagnoses. We predict that as this socio-ecological process matures, it will also increase the inclusiveness of resource management goals to include non-use factors, such as biodiversity and other ecosystem services, which are still poorly evaluated and managed in even the most progressive small-scale fisheries.

AB Recently, conservation estate in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province has increased 10-fold resulting in large predators being increasingly reintroduced to restore ecological integrity and maximize tourism. We describe the reintroductions of large carnivores (>10 kg) that have occurred in the Eastern Cape and use various criteria to assess their success. Lion Panthera leo reintroduction has been highly successful with a population of 56 currently extant in the region and problems of overpopulation arising. The African wild dog Lycaon pictus population has increased to 24 from a founder population of 11. Preliminary results for spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta also indicate success. Wild populations of leopards Panthera pardus exist on several reserves and have been supplemented by translocated individuals, although deaths of known individuals have occurred and no estimate of reproduction is available. Cheetah Acinonyx jubatus reintroduction has also been less successful with 36 individuals reintroduced and 23 cubs being born but only 41 individuals surviving in 2005. Criteria for assessing the success of reintroductions of species that naturally occur in low densities, such as top predators, generally have limited value. Carrying capacity for large predators is unknown and continued monitoring and intensive management will be necessary in enclosed, and possibly all, conservation areas in the Eastern Cape to ensure conservation success.

AB The thermodynamic parameters of the enzymes catalase, dehydrogenase, casein-protease, alpha-N-benzoyl-L-argininamide (BAA)-protease, urease, Carboxymethyl (CM)-cellulase, invertase, beta-glucosidase and arylsulphatase, were investigated in grassland soils from a European temperate-humid zone (Galicia, NW Spain). The effect of temperature on enzyme activity was determined at 5, 18, 27, 37, 57 and 70 degrees C. The temperature-dependence of the rate of substrate hydrolysis varied depending on the enzyme and soil. In general, the soil containing the least amount of organic matter (OM) showed the lowest enzyme activity for all temperatures and enzymes, whereas soils with similar OM contents showed similar levels of activity for the entire temperature range. Temperature had a noteworthy effect on the activity of oxidoreductases. Product formation in the reaction catalyzed by dehydrogenase increased with increasing temperature until 70 degrees C, which was attributed to chemical reduction of iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT) at high temperatures. Catalase activity was not affected above 37 degrees C, which may be explained either by non-enzymatic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide or by the fact that catalase has reached kinetic perfection, and is therefore not saturated with substrate.
   The Arrhenius equation was used to determine the activation energy (Ea) and the temperature coefficient (Q(10)) for all enzymes. The values of E. and Q10 for each enzyme differed among soils, although in general the differences were small, especially for those enzymes that act on substrates of low molecular weight. In terms of the values of E. and Q10 and the differences established among soils, the results obtained for those enzymes that act on substrates of high molecular weight differed most from those corresponding to the other enzymes. Thus the lowest Ea and Q10 values corresponded to BAA-protease, and the highest values to CM-cellulase and casein-protease. Except for catalase in one of the soils, the values of E,, and Q10 for the oxidoreductases were similar to those of most of the hydrolases. In general, the effect of temperature appeared to be more dependent on the type of enzyme than on the characteristics of the soil. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The importance of hydrologic variability in sustaining natural riverine ecosystems is now well accepted. Over the last 15 years or so, many typologies and assessment tools have been developed to assist ecologists and managers in describing natural flow regimes in quantitative terms. In the course of this recent progress, however, some critical questions have arisen concerning the degree to which generalizations about flow regime characteristics are geographically dependent both within and among regions, and the degree to which flow variability alone captures critical environmental variability. In this paper we address these issues in a hierarchical framework that allows comparative statements about hydrologic variability to be made a multiple spatial scales, from local to global.
   First, we examined hydrologic variability among 463 readily available daily streamflow gauges from five continents/ countries around the world: Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Europe, and the United States. Using ordination and clustering techniques, we identified similarities and differences among these gauges. We found that the US gauges exhibited the greatest overall flow variability among a suite of 66 hydrologic indicators, whereas Australian streams showed the greatest influence by interannual variability in flow. Similarities in overall flow regime were greatest between Australia and the US, whereas New Zealand streams were most regionally distinctive. These results support the idea of intercontinental distinction in streamflow variability at a global scale; however, they also point to important similarities in flow characteristics among continents/countries.
   Second, within the continental United States, we examined how hydrologic variability changes along river profiles as catchment area increases for five river basins arrayed across a gradient of hydroclimatic variation. Using historical streamflow records that precede river impoundment, we found that small 'headwater' streams exhibit the greatest similarity in flow characteristics across the basins, as compared to mid-sized and larger river reaches, which often diverged among the rivers. These results reveal the importance of more carefully defining the spatial domain of allowable hydrologic extrapolation from individual stream gauges and emphasize the need to stratify within basins when considering hydrologic variability at regional scales.
   Third, we used a modeling approach to illustrate how geomorphic setting provides a context for assessing the ecological consequences of flow variation at the local scale of stream reaches. For modeled channels having the same sediment size distribution but with either entrenched or floodplain morphology, we found that the effective regime of bed movement for three hydrologically distinct streams depended as much on geomorphic setting as on flow regime per se. These results emphasize the need to integrate hydrology with geomorphology to characterize 'disturbance regimes' at the channel reach scale to allow generation of spatially explicit mapping of flow-mediated habitat dynamics for entire drainage networks within specific regions.
   In sum, if riverine scientists wish to develop a general framework for comparing hydrologic variability across basins, regions, and continents, a hierarchical approach is advised. At very broad scales, intercontinental differences in flow regimes could allow a stratification of basins to identify similar hydroecological settings. Within continents or hydroclimatically similar regions, finer-scale spatial analysis of flow regime types would further assist in hydrologic stratification, based only on the regionally-relevant components of flow variability. Finally, within hydrologically homogeneous sub-regions, geomorphic stratification could be applied to identify stream reaches or segments having similar hydrogeomorphic properties.

AB Obtaining useful information about elusive or endangered species can be logistically difficult, particularly if relying entirely on field signs such as hair, feathers or faeces. However, recent developments in molecular technology add substantially to the utility of such 'non-invasive' samples, which provide a source of DNA that can be used to identify not only species but also individuals and their gender. This provides great potential to improve the accuracy of abundance estimates and determine behavioural parameters, such as home-range size, individual habitat and dietary preferences, and even some forms of social interaction. Non-invasive samples can also be a useful alternative to blood or tissue samples ( the collection of which traditionally has required trapping of animals) as genetic material for applications such as relatedness, population genetic and phylogenetic analyses. Despite the huge potential of non-invasive genetic sampling, the current technology does have limitations. The low quantity and quality of DNA often obtained from such sources results in an increased risk of genotyping errors, which may lead to incorrect inferences, particularly false identification of individuals. Appropriate precautions and pilot studies are required to minimise these risks, and in some cases it may be wise to employ traditional methods when they are adequate.

AB Global warming may affect the physiology, distributions, phenology and adaptations of plants and animals. In Israel, minimum summer temperatures increased by an average of 0.26 degreesC per decade during the second half of the 20th century. Bergmann's rule predicts that, in warm-blooded animals, races from warm regions are smaller than races from cold regions. Numerous studies have reported general correlations between body mass in fossil animals and independently established palaeoclimatic changes from various parts of the world in accordance with this rule. Using museum specimens, I tested the prediction that the body mass and tarsus length of five resident passerine species in Israel declined between 1950 and 1999. The body mass of four species (the graceful warbler Prinia gracilis, the house sparrow Passer domesticus, the yellow-vented bulbul Pycnonotus xanthopygos and the Sardinian warbler Sylvia melanocephala, but not of the crested lark Galerida cristata) declined significantly during this period. Tarsus length also declined significantly during this period for two species (the graceful warbler and the house sparrow). Body condition (body mass-to-tarsus length ratio) decreased in the Sardinian warbler, the yellow-vented bulbul and the crested lark. It is suggested that the above declines in body mass and tarsus length are due to global warming and also in accordance with Bergmann's rule. The above explanation does not exclude the possibility that other factors, such as a decrease in food availability, contributed to the decline in body mass. These declines may have serious implications for community structure and competition among bird species and may affect the survival of small passerines.

AB As maximum-likelihood approaches to the study of molecular systematics and evolution become both more flexible and more accessible, the importance of understanding the statistical properties of parameter estimation becomes critical. Using variation in NADH-2 sequences for 40 species of requiem sharks, we illustrate that estimates of rate heterogeneity parameters are highly sensitive to taxon sampling when the data are best explained by a mixed-distribution model of among-site rate variation (invariable sites plus gamma distribution [I+Gamma]). Using computer simulation, we attempt to differentiate two possible causes of this sensitivity. While the possibility of nonstationarity cannot be definitively rejected, our results suggest that sampling error alone provides an adequate explanation for the pattern of uncertainty observed in estimates from the real data. Furthermore, we illustrate that two parameters estimated under the I+Gamma model (the proportion of sites not free to change and the gamma distribution shape parameter) are highly correlated and that the likelihood surface across the rate heterogeneity parameter space can be poorly behaved when only a small number of sequences (taxa) are considered.

AB The sea urchins Arbacia lixula and Paracentrotus lividus are common on shallow subtidal reefs in the Mediterranean. Previous studies on the ecology of these species reported that P. lividus is generally more abundant on horizontal or gently sloping substrata, where it forages mainly on erect algae. In contrast, A. lixula is more common on vertical substrata and it is considered a main grazer of encrusting coralline algae. Observations on some rocky shores in the Ligurian sea indicated that P. lividus occurs mainly in crevices at the bottom of the vertical walls, and that neither species is present on horizontal or sub-horizontal substrata. In this study we investigated the distribution and abundance of the two species of sea urchins on vertical substrata at different spatial scales and through time. A field experiment was used to test whether A. lixula constrained the distribution of P. lividus on vertical substrata, and to test for the predicted differences in the effects of the 2 species on assemblages of algae and invertebrates. Four treatments were used: (1) control (sea urchins left untouched); (2) A. lixula removed, P. lividus present; (3) A. lixula present, P. lividus removed, and (4) both species removed. The effects of sea urchins on colonising algae and invertebrates were examined after 6, 12 and 18 months. A. lixula was consistently more abundant than P. lividus on patches of vertical substrata, but the removal of A. lixula did not affect the abundance of P. lividus. There was no effect of A. lixula on encrusting corallines, but the cover erect algae increased and the number of limpets decreased significantly where A. lixula was removed. P. lividus had only a minor impact on the assemblage, probably due to its low abundance. A. lixula had effects close to those predicted for P. lividus, suggesting that the ecological role of these herbivores may be more similar than previously thought. The implications of these results for the management of the edible sea urchin, P. lividus, are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we characterized microsatellite and mtDNA variation among 779 individuals representing 26 brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchill) populations from La Mauricie National Park (LMNP) to test the general hypothesis that microsatellite analysis may provide greater resolution than mtDNA to infer the evolutionary history of closely related and geographically proximate populations. We also assessed the relative efficiency of stepwise mutation model (SMM) and non-SMM genetic information, used separately and together, to depict population relationships and to quantify the divergence and the partitioning of genetic variance among populations. Based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and single-strand conformation polymorphism sequence data, LMNP displayed a disjunct mtDNA genetic composition compared to other northeastern North American populations. However, these populations formed a homogeneous group, suggesting that they originated from a different glacial refuge. The screening of five microsatellites revealed high levels of diversity, strongly partitioned among populations, based on both allelic and molecular variance (F-ST = 37.04%; Phi(ST) = 45.96%). The use of chord distance was more reliable than (delta mu)(2) distance in resolving population tree topology using the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm. However, the construction of a hybrid tree obtained using the NJ-D-CE topology and the least-squares method branch length estimation from (delta mu)(2) distances appeared to better reflect both the relationships and the divergence of populations. This tree was composed of seven population lineages characterized by different genetic compositions and the presence of unique alleles. These lineages coincided only partially with drainages, and, consequently, genetic variance was more strongly partitioned among them than among drainages. The magnitude of (delta mu)(2) distance suggested that LMNP has been recolonized by seven ancestral populations, already isolated prior to the beginning of the last Wisconsinian glacial period, and that differences among lineages could be as old as the refuge from which they originated. This supports the view that microsatellite polymorphism holds the potential for analysis of the evolutionary history of populations over short temporal and geographical scales. These results also suggest that the use of microsatellites in conservation genetics may change our views about the problems of temporal and geographical scales to be considered in order to optimize conservation strategies.

AB Nitrogen redistribution between and within leaves was examined in a plot of lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Aurora) in relation to potential canopy photosynthesis. The canopy was sampled during regrowth after cutting and just prior to flowering. As leaves were progressively shaded by the newly produced leaves, nitrogen content fell and photosynthetic acclimation occurred. The rate of acclimation in the canopy was the same as occurred following a step change to 23 or 6% sunlight. The profile of leaf nitrogen content was stable with respect to leaf area index and independent of time of sampling. Optimal profiles of nitrogen distribution between leaves, photosynthetic rate per unit chlorophyll and nitrogen partitioning within leaves were calculated from the relationships between photosynthesis and nitrogen in conjunction with the light environment of the preceding 3 days. The optimal nitrogen content of the leaves should vary in proportion to the relative daily irradiance at each leaf. The observed distribution achieved 88% of the potential daily photosynthesis, while a uniform nitrogen distribution yielded only 80%. Photosynthetic acclimation and nitrogen partitioning within each leaf both responded to daily irradiance similarly to the calculated optimum except at the two extremes. At the top of the canopy, photosynthetic rate per unit of chlorophyll did not increase as much as the calculated optimum, while at the base of the canopy, nitrogen partitioning failed to fall as much as the calculated optimum. This may reflect the constraints on the flexibility of the photosynthetic system. Nitrogen redistribution between leaves made a dramatic contribution to increasing the potential photosynthesis by the canopy. Although acclimation to low irradiance reduced the photosynthetic capacity per unit nitrogen by 12%, the considerable reorganisation of proteins within the thylakoids increased potential daily photosynthesis by 20% over that which would have been gained by a 'sun' leaf. However, in terms of canopy photosynthesis, which is dominated by leaves intercepting most of the light, acclimation contributed only a few per cent to the potential daily canopy photosynthesis.

AB The short- and long-term post-fire response patterns of small mammals, reptiles and amphibians inhabiting mallee woodlands and heathlands in temperate Australia are reviewed with respect to species' life history parameters in a search for unifying trends. Pyric response patterns of small mammal species are closely lied to their shelter, food and breeding requirements. There is a trend of increased specificity and reduced flexibility in life history traits concomitant with increased impact of fire and later post-fire recolonization. For reptiles there appears to be a strong relationship between the shelter and foraging requirements of species and their abundance in various successional states. The high incidence of burrowing in the mallee/heath amphibian fauna imparts considerable resilience to fire, and most species' abundance and distribution patterns seem more closely linked to moisture regimes than to fire per se.
   The high degree of consistency between species' post-fire response patterns and their life history parameters points to the feasibility of developing a model to predict the impact of fire on small vertebrates. Such a model is currently being developed

AB The effects of plants on the biosphere, atmosphere and geosphere are key determinants of terrestrial ecosystem functioning. However, despite substantial progress made regarding plant belowground components, we are still only beginning to explore the complex relationships between root traits and functions. Drawing on the literature in plant physiology, ecophysiology, ecology, agronomy and soil science, we reviewed 24 aspects of plant and ecosystem functioning and their relationships with a number of root system traits, including aspects of architecture, physiology, morphology, anatomy, chemistry, biomechanics and biotic interactions. Based on this assessment, we critically evaluated the current strengths and gaps in our knowledge, and identify future research challenges in the field of root ecology. Most importantly, we found that belowground traits with the broadest importance in plant and ecosystem functioning are not those most commonly measured. Also, the estimation of trait relative importance for functioning requires us to consider a more comprehensive range of functionally relevant traits from a diverse range of species, across environments and over time series. We also advocate that establishing causal hierarchical links among root traits will provide a hypothesis-based framework to identify the most parsimonious sets of traits with the strongest links on functions, and to link genotypes to plant and ecosystem functioning.

TI Jack-of-all-trades effects drive biodiversity-ecosystem

AB There is considerable evidence that biodiversity promotes multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality), thus ensuring the delivery of ecosystem services important for human well-being. However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are poorly understood, especially in natural ecosystems. We develop a novel approach to partition biodiversity effects on multifunctionality into three mechanisms and apply this to European forest data. We show that throughout Europe, tree diversity is positively related with multifunctionality when moderate levels of functioning are required, but negatively when very high function levels are desired. For two well-known mechanisms, 'complementarity' and 'selection', we detect only minor effects on multifunctionality. Instead a third, so far overlooked mechanism, the 'jack-of-all-trades' effect, caused by the averaging of individual species effects on function, drives observed patterns. Simulations demonstrate that jack-of-all-trades effects occur whenever species effects on different functions are not perfectly correlated, meaning they may contribute to diversity-multifunctionality relationships in many of the world's ecosystems.

AB Leaf economics and hydraulic traits are critical to leaf photosynthesis, yet it is debated whether these two sets of traits vary in a fully coordinated manner or there is room for independent variation. Here, we tested the relationship between leaf economics traits, including leaf nitrogen concentration and leaf dry mass per area, and leaf hydraulic traits including stomatal density and vein density in five tropical-subtropical forests. Surprisingly, these two suites of traits were statistically decoupled. This decoupling suggests that independent trait dimensions exist within a leaf, with leaf economics dimension corresponding to light capture and tissue longevity, and the hydraulic dimension to water-use and leaf temperature maintenance. Clearly, leaf economics and hydraulic traits can vary independently, thus allowing for more possible plant trait combinations. Compared with a single trait dimension, multiple trait dimensions may better enable species adaptations to multifarious niche dimensions, promote diverse plant strategies and facilitate species coexistence.

AB Inference and estimates of abundance are critical for quantifying population dynamics and impacts of environmental change. Yet imperfect detection and other phenomena that cause zero inflation can induce estimation error and obscure ecological patterns. Recent statistical advances provide an increasingly diverse array of analytical approaches for estimating population size to address these phenomena. We examine how detection error and zero inflation in count data inform the choice of analytical method for estimating population size of unmarked individuals that are not uniquely identified. We review two established (GLMs and distance sampling) and nine emerging methods that use N-mixture models (Royle-Nichols model, and basic, zero inflated, temporary emigration, beta-binomial, generalized open-population, spatially explicit, single visit and multispecies) to estimate abundance of unmarked populations, focusing on their requirements and how each method accounts for imperfect detection and zero inflation. Eight of the emerging methods can account for both imperfect detection and additional variation in population size in the forms of non-occupancy, temporary emigration, correlated detection and population dynamics. Methods differ in sampling design requirements (e.g. count vs. detection/non-detection data, single vs. multiple visits, covariate data), and their suitability for a particular study will depend on the characteristics of the study species, scale and objectives of the study, and financial and logistical considerations. Most emerging methods were developed over the past decade, so their efficacy is still under study, and additional statistical advances are likely to occur.

AB Melatonin has an important anti-aging role in plant physiology. We tested the effects of long-term melatonin exposure on metabolic status and protein degradation during natural leaf senescence in trees of Malus hupehensis Rehd. The 2-month regular supplement of 100m melatonin to the soil once every 6days altered the metabolic status and delayed protein degradation. For example, leaves from treated plants had significantly higher photosynthetic activity, chlorophyll concentrations, and levels of three photosynthetic end products (sorbitol, sucrose, and starch) when compared with the control. The significant inhibition of hexose (fructose and glucose) accumulation possibly regulated the signaling of MdHXK1, a gene for which expression was also repressed by melatonin during senescence. The plants also exhibited better preservation of their nitrogen, total soluble protein, and Rubisco protein concentrations than the control. The slower process of protein degradation might be a result of melatonin-linked inhibition on the expression of apple autophagy-related genes (ATGs). Our results are the first to provide evidence for this delay in senescence based on the metabolic alteration and protein degradation.

AB Seasonal recurrence of biological processes (phenology) and its relationship to environmental change is recognized as being of key scientific and public concern, but its current study largely overlooks the extent to which phenology is based on biological time-keeping mechanisms. We highlight the relevance of physiological and neurobiological regulation for organisms' responsiveness to environmental conditions. Focusing on avian and mammalian examples, we describe circannual rhythmicity of reproduction, migration and hibernation, and address responses of animals to photic and thermal conditions. Climate change and urbanization are used as urgent examples of anthropogenic influences that put biological timing systems under pressure. We furthermore propose that consideration of Homo sapiens as principally a 'seasonal animal' can inspire new perspectives for understanding medical and psychological problems.

AB Random forests have emerged as a versatile and highly accurate classification and regression methodology, requiring little tuning and providing interpretable outputs. Here, we briefly outline the genesis of, and motivation for, the random forest paradigm as an outgrowth from earlier tree-structured techniques. We elaborate on aspects of prediction error and attendant tuning parameter issues. However, our emphasis is on extending the random forest schema to the multiple response setting. We provide a simple illustrative example from ecology that showcases the improved fit and enhanced interpretation afforded by the random forest framework. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Given bees' central effect on vegetation communities, it is important to understand how and why bee distributions vary across ecological gradients. We examined how plant community composition, plant diversity, nesting suitability, canopy cover, land use, and fire history affected bee distribution across an open-forest gradient in northwest Indiana, USA, a gradient similar to the historic Midwest United States landscape mosaic. When considered with the other predictors, plant community composition was not a significant predictor of bee community composition. Bee abundance was negatively related to canopy cover and positively to recent fire frequency, bee richness was positively related to plant richness and abundance of potential nesting resources, and bee community composition was significantly related to plant richness, soil characteristics potentially related to nesting suitability, and canopy cover. Thus, bee abundance was predicted by a different set of environmental characteristics than was bee species richness, and bee community composition was predicted, in large part, by a combination of the significant predictors of bee abundance and richness. Differences in bee community composition along the woody vegetation gradient were correlated with relative abundance of oligolectic, or diet specialist, bees. Because oligoleges were rarer than diet generalists and were associated with open habitats, their populations may be especially affected by degradation of open habitats.
   More habitat-specialist bees were documented for open and forest/scrub habitats than for savanna/woodland habitats, consistent with bees responding to habitats of intermediate woody vegetation density, such as savannas, as ecotones rather than as distinct habitat types. Similarity of bee community composition, similarity of bee abundance, and similarity of bee richness between sites were not significantly related to proximity of sites to each other. Nestedness analysis indicated that species composition in species-poor sites was not merely a subset of species composition at richer sites. The lack of significant proximity or nestedness effects suggests that factors at a small spatial scale strongly influence bees' use of sites. The findings indicate that patterns of plant diversity, nesting resource availability, recent fire, and habitat shading, present at the scale of a few hundred meters, are key determinants of bee community patterns in the mosaic open-savanna-forest landscape.

AB Here, we present a new primate phylogeny inferred from molecular supermatrix analyses of size 42 kb containing 70% of missing data, and representing 75% of primate species diversity. The supermatrix was analysed using a gene-partitioned maximum likelihood approach to obtain an exhaustive molecular phylogenetic framework. All clades recovered from recent molecular works were upheld in our analyses demonstrating that the presence of missing data did not bias our supermatrix inference. The resulting phylogenetic tree was subsequently dated with a molecular dating method to provide a timescale for speciation events. Results obtained from our relaxed molecular clock analyses concurred with previous works based on the same fossil constraints. The resulting dated tree allowed to infer of macroevolutionary processes among the primates. Shifts in diversification rate and speciation rates were determined using the SymmeTREE method and a birthdeath process. No significant asymmetry was detected for the primate clade, but significant shifts in diversification rate were identified for seven clades: Anthropoidea, Lemuriformes, Lemuridae, Galagidae, Callithrix genus, the Cercopithecinae and Asian Macaca. Comparisons with previous primate supertree results reveal that (i) there was a diversification event at the root of the Lemuriformes, (ii) a higher diversification rate is detected for Cercopithecidae and Anthropoidea and (iii) a shift in diversification is always recovered for Macaca genus. Macroevolutionary inferences and primate divergence dates show that major primate diversification events occurred after the Paleogene, suggesting the extinction of ancient primate lineages.

AB Communities of plants, biological soil crusts (BSCs), and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are known to influence soil stability individually, but their relative contributions, interactions, and combined effects are not well understood, particularly in arid and semiarid ecosystems. In a landscape-scale field study we quantified plant, BSC, and AM fungal communities at 216 locations along a gradient of soil stability levels in southern Utah, USA. We used multivariate modeling to examine the relative influences of plants, BSCs, and AM fungi on surface and subsurface stability in a semiarid shrubland landscape. Models were found to be congruent with the data and explained 35% of the variation in surface stability and 54% of the variation in subsurface stability. The results support several tentative conclusions. While BSCs, plants, and AM fungi all contribute to surface stability, only plants and AM fungi contribute to subsurface stability. In both surface and subsurface models, the strongest contributions to soil stability are made by biological components of the system. Biological soil crust cover was found to have the strongest direct effect on surface soil stability (0.60; controlling for other factors). Surprisingly, AM fungi appeared to influence surface soil stability (0.37), even though they are not generally considered to exist in the top few millimeters of the soil. In the subsurface model, plant cover appeared to have the strongest direct influence on soil stability (0.42); in both models, results indicate that plant cover influences soil stability both directly (controlling for other factors) and indirectly through influences on other organisms. Soil organic matter was not found to have a direct contribution to surface or subsurface stability in this system. The relative influence of AM fungi on soil stability in these semiarid shrublands was similar to that reported for a mesic tallgrass prairie. Estimates of effects that BSCs, plants, and AM fungi have on soil stability in these models are used to suggest the relative amounts of resources that erosion control practitioners should devote to promoting these communities. This study highlights the need for system approaches in combating erosion, soil degradation, and arid-land desertification.

AB We propose here some refinements of the ecological-niche factor analysis (ENFA) to describe precisely one organism's habitat selection. The ENFA is based on the concept of the ecological niche, and provides a measure of the realised niche within the available space from the computation of two parameters, the marginality and the specialization. By measuring the departure of the ecological niche from the average available habitat, the marginality identifies the preference of the individual, population, or species for specific conditions of the environment among the whole set of possibilities. The specialization appears as a consequence of the narrowness of the niche on some environmental variables. The ENFA is a factorial analysis that extracts one axis of marginality and several axes of specialization. We present here the use of biplots (i.e., the projection of both the pixels of the map and the environmental variables in the subspace extracted by the ENFA) as a way to identify the key-variables for management, assessing which habitat features are of prime importance and should be preserved or reinforced. With the help of this tool, we are now able to describe much more precisely the habitat selection of the organism under focus. In our application to the lynx in the Vosges mountains, based on sightings as well as other indices of lynx presence, we thus underlined a strong avoidance of agricultural areas by the lynx. We also highlighted the relative indifference of the lynx to the proximity of artificial areas and at the opposite, the sensitivity to the proximity of highways. The ENTA provides a suitable way to measure habitat use/selection under a large range of ecological contexts and should be used to define precisely the ecological niche and therefore identify the characteristics searched for by the organism under study.

AB Hundreds of species are shifting their ranges in response to recent climate warming. To predict how continued climate warming will affect the potential, or "bioclimatic range," of a skipper butterfly, we present a population-dynamic model of range shift in which population growth is a function of temperature. We estimate the parameters of this model using previously published data for Atalopedes campestris. Summer and winter temperatures affect population growth rate independently in this species and therefore interact as potential range-limiting factors. Our model predicts a two-phase response to climate change; one range-limiting factor gradually becomes dominant, even if warming occurs steadily along a thermally linear landscape. Whether the range shift accelerates or decelerates and whether the number of generations per year at the range edge increases or decreases depend on whether summer or winter warms faster. To estimate the uncertainty in our predictions of range shift, we use a parametric bootstrap of biological parameter values. Our results show that even modest amounts of data yield predictions with reasonably small confidence intervals, indicating that ecophysiological models can be useful in predicting range changes. Nevertheless, the confidence intervals are sensitive to regional differences in the underlying thermal landscape and the warming scenario.

AB The data requirements and resources needed to develop multispecies indicators of fishing impacts are often lacking and this is particularly true for coral reef fisheries. Size-spectra, relationships between abundance and body-size class, regardless of taxonomy, can be calculated from simple sizeabundance data. Both the slope and the mid-point height of the relationship can be compared at different fishing intensities. Here, we develop size-spectra for reef fish assemblages using body size-abundance data collected by underwater visual census in each of ten fishing grounds across a known gradient of fishing intensity in the Kadavu Island group, Fiji. Slopes of the size-spectra became steeper (F-9,F-69=3.20, p < 0.01) and the height declined (F-9,F-69=15.78, p < 0.001) with increasing fishing intensity. Regressions of numbers of individuals per size class across grounds were negative for all size classes, although the slope was almost zero for the smallest size class. Response to exploitation of each size class category was greatest for larger fish. Steepening of the slope with increasing fishing intensity largely resulted from reductions in the relative abundance of large fish and not from the ecological release of small fish following depletion of their predators. The slope and height of the size-spectrum appear to be good indicators of fishing effects on reef fish assemblages.

   AND AREA-BASED EXPRESSIONS
SO OECOLOGIA

DE SPECIFIC LEAF AREA; RAIN FORESTS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; NITROGEN
ID LIFE-SPAN; LEAVES
AB The relationships between leaf nitrogen (N), specific leaf area (SLA) (an inverse index of leaf ''thickness'' or ''density''), and photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) were studied in 23 Amazonian tree species to characterize scaling in these properties among natural populations of leaves of different ages and light microenvironments, and to examine how variation within species in N and SLA can influence the expression of the A(max)-to-N relationship on mass versus area bases. The slope of the A(max)-N relationship, change in A per change in N (mumol CO2 gN-1 s-1), was consistently greater, by as much as 300%, when both measures were expressed on mass rather than area bases. The x-intercept of this relationship (N-compensation point) was generally positive on a mass but not an area basis. In this paper we address the causes and implications of such differences. Significant linear relationships (p < 0.05) between mass-based leaf N (N(mass)) and SLA were observed in 12 species and all 23 regressions had positive slopes. In 13 species, mass-based A(max) (A(mass)) was positively related (p < 0.05) with SLA. These patterns reflect the concurrent decline in N(mass) and SLA with increasing leaf age. Significant (p < 0.05) relationships between area-based leaf N (N(area)) and SLA were observed in 18 species. In this case, all relationships had negative slopes. Taken collectively, and consistent in all species, as SLA decreased (leaves become ''thicker'') across increasing leaf age and light gradients, N(mass) also decreased, but proportionally more slowly, such that N(area) increased. Due to the linear dependence of A(mass) on N(mass) and a negative 4-intercept, ''thicker'' leaves (low SLA) therefore tend, on average, to have lower N(mass) and A(mass) but higher N(area) than ''thinner'' leaves. This tendency towards decreasing A(mass) with increasing N(area) decreases the rate at which A(area) increases with Na(area) resulting in a lower slope of the A(max)-N relationship on an area than mass basis in 16 of 17 species where both were significant. For the sole species exception (higher area than mass-based slope) variation in N(area) was related to variation in N(mass) and not in SLA, and thus, these data are also consistent with this explanation. The relations between N, SLA and A(max) explain how the rate of change in A(max) per change in N can vary three-fold depending on whether a mass or area mode of expression is used.

AB Although many studies have explored the relationship between the built environment and travel behavior, the literature offers limited evidence about the collective influence of built environment attributes, and their non-linear effects on travel. This study innovatively adopts gradient boosting decision trees to fill the gaps. Using data from Oslo, we apply this method to the data on both weekdays and weekends to illustrate the differential effects of built environment characteristics on driving distance. We found that they have a stronger effect on weekdays than on weekends. On weekdays, their collective influence is larger than that of demographics. Furthermore, they show salient non-linear effects on driving distance in both models, challenging the linearity assumption commonly adopted in the literature. This study also identifies effective ranges of distance to different centers and population density, and highlights the important role of sub-centers in driving reduction.

AB AimDuring the past decade ecologists have attempted to estimate the parameters of species distribution models by combining locations of species presence observed in opportunistic surveys with spatially referenced covariates of occurrence. Several statistical models have been proposed for the analysis of presence-only data, but these models have largely ignored the effects of imperfect detection and survey bias. In this paper I describe a model-based approach for the analysis of presence-only data that accounts for errors in the detection of individuals and for biased selection of survey locations.
   InnovationI develop a hierarchical, statistical model that allows presence-only data to be analysed in conjunction with data acquired independently in planned surveys. One component of the model specifies the spatial distribution of individuals within a bounded, geographic region as a realization of a spatial point process. A second component of the model specifies two kinds of observations, the detection of individuals encountered during opportunistic surveys and the detection of individuals encountered during planned surveys.
   Main conclusionsUsing mathematical proof and simulation-based comparisons, I demonstrate that biases induced by errors in detection or biased selection of survey locations can be reduced or eliminated by using the hierarchical model to analyse presence-only data in conjunction with counts observed in planned surveys. I show that a relatively small number of high-quality data (from planned surveys) can be used to leverage the information in presence-only observations, which usually have broad spatial coverage but may not be informative of both occurrence and detectability of individuals. Because a variety of sampling protocols can be used in planned surveys, this approach to the analysis of presence-only data is widely applicable. In addition, since the point-process model is formulated at the level of an individual, it can be extended to account for biological interactions between individuals and temporal changes in their spatial distributions.

AB Large numbers of hatchery salmon spawn in wild populations each year. Hatchery fish with multiple generations of hatchery ancestry often have heritably lower reproductive success than wild fish and may reduce the fitness of an entire population. Whether this reduced fitness also occurs for hatchery fish created with local- and predominantly wild-origin parents remains controversial. Here, we review recent studies on the reproductive success of such early-generation' hatchery fish that spawn in the wild. Combining 51 estimates from six studies on four salmon species, we found that (i) early-generation hatchery fish averaged only half the reproductive success of their wild-origin counterparts when spawning in the wild, (ii) the reduction in reproductive success was more severe for males than for females, and (iii) all species showed reduced fitness due to hatchery rearing. We review commonalities among studies that point to possible mechanisms (e.g., environmental versus genetic effects). Furthermore, we illustrate that sample sizes typical of these studies result in low statistical power to detect fitness differences unless the differences are substantial. This review demonstrates that reduced fitness of early-generation hatchery fish may be a general phenomenon. Future research should focus on determining the causes of those fitness reductions and whether they lead to long-term reductions in the fitness of wild populations.

AB Climate change will lead to loss of range for many species, and thus to loss of genetic diversity crucial for their long-term persistence. We analysed range-wide genetic diversity (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) in 9581 samples from 1200 populations of 27 northern plant species, to assess genetic consequences of range reduction and potential association with species traits. We used species distribution modelling (SDM, eight techniques, two global circulation models and two emission scenarios) to predict loss of range and genetic diversity by 2080. Loss of genetic diversity varied considerably among species, and this variation could be explained by dispersal adaptation (up to 57%) and by genetic differentiation among populations (F-ST; up to 61%). Herbs lacking adaptations for long-distance dispersal were estimated to lose genetic diversity at higher rate than dwarf shrubs adapted to long-distance dispersal. The expected range reduction in these 27 northern species was larger than reported for temperate plants, and all were predicted to lose genetic diversity according to at least one scenario. SDM combined with F-ST estimates and/or with species trait information thus allows the prediction of species' vulnerability to climate change, aiding rational prioritization of conservation efforts.

AB Large mammalian herbivores manifest a strong top-down control on ecosystems that can transform entire landscapes, but their impacts have not been reviewed in the context of terrestrial carbon storage. Here, we evaluate the effects of plant biomass consumption by large mammalian herbivores (>10 kg adult biomass), and the responses of ecosystems to these herbivores, on carbon stocks in temperate and tropical regions, and the Arctic. We calculate the difference in carbon stocks resulting from herbivore exclusion using the results of 108 studies from 52 vegetation types. Our estimates suggest that herbivores can reduce terrestrial above- and below-ground carbon stocks across vegetation types but reductions in carbon stocks may approach zero given sufficient periods of time for systems to respond to herbivory (i.e. decades). We estimate that if all large herbivores were removed from the vegetation types sampled in our review, increases in terrestrial carbon stocks would be up to three orders of magnitude less than many of the natural and human-influenced sources of carbon emissions. However, we lack estimates for the effects of herbivores on below-ground biomass and soil carbon levels in many regions, including those with high herbivore densities, and upwards revisions of our estimates may be necessary. Our results provide a starting point for a discussion on the magnitude of the effects of herbivory on the global carbon cycle, particularly given that large herbivores are common in many ecosystems. We suggest that herbivore removal might represent an important strategy towards increasing terrestrial carbon stocks at local and regional scales within specific vegetation types, since humans influence populations of most large mammals.

AB Anthropogenically mediated decreases in pH, termed ocean acidification (OA), may be a major threat to marine organisms and communities. Research has focussed mainly on tropical coral reefs, but temperate reefs play a no less important ecological role in colder waters, where OA effects may first be manifest. Herein, we report that trends in pH at the surface of three ecologically important cold-water calcifiers (a primary producer and herbivores), under a range of fluid flows, differ substantially from one another, and for two of the three calcifiers, the pH, during darkness, is lower than the mean projected pH due to OA for the surface waters of the global ocean beyond the year 2100. Using micro-electrodes, we show that each calcifier had a different pH gradient between its surface and mainstream seawater, i.e. within the diffusion boundary layer (DBL) that appears to act as an environmental buffer to mainstream pH. Abalone encountered only mainstream seawater pH, whereas pH at the sea urchins' surface was reduced by similar to 0.35 units. For coralline algae, pH was similar to 0.5 units higher in the light and similar to 0.35 units lower under darkness than in ambient mainstream seawater. This wide range of pH within the DBL of some calcifiers will probably affect their performance under projected future reductions in pH due to OA. Differing exposure to a range of surface pH may result in differential susceptibility of calcifiers to OA. Such fluctuations are no doubt regulated by the interplay of water movement, morphology and metabolic rates (e. g. respiration, calcification and/or photosynthesis). Our study, by considering physics (flow regime), chemistry (pH gradients vs. OA future projections) and biology (trophic level, physiology and morphology), reveals that predicting species-specific responses and subsequent ecosystem restructuring to OA is complex and requires a holistic, eco-mechanical, approach.

AB DNA barcoding-sequencing a standard region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene (COI)-promises a rapid, accurate means of identifying animals to a species level. This study establishes that sequence variability in the barcode region permits discrimination of 98% of 201 fish species from the Canadian Pacific. The average sequence variation within species was 0.25%, while the average distance separating species within genera was 3.75%. The latter value was considerably lower than values reported in other studies, reflecting the dominance of the Canadian fauna by members of the young and highly diverse genus Sebastes. Although most sebastids possessed distinctive COI sequences, four species did not. As a partial offset to these cases, the barcode records indicated the presence of a new, broadly distributed species of Paraliparis and the possibility that Paraliparis pectoralis is actually a species pair. The present study shows that most fish species in Pacific Canadian waters correspond to a single, tightly cohesive array of barcode sequences that are distinct from those of any other species, but also highlights some taxonomic issues that need further investigation.

AB The study of population genetics of invasive species offers opportunities to investigate rapid evolutionary processes at work, and while the ecology of biological invasions has enjoyed extensive attention in the past, the recentness of molecular techniques makes their application in invasion ecology a fairly new approach. Despite this, molecular biology has already proved powerful in inferring aspects not only relevant to the evolutionary biologist but also to those concerned with invasive species management. Here, we review the different molecular markers routinely used in such studies and their application(s) in addressing different questions in invasion ecology. We then review the current literature on molecular genetic studies aimed at improving management and the understanding of invasive species by resolving of taxonomic issues, elucidating geographical sources of invaders, detecting hybridisation and introgression, tracking dispersal and spread and assessing the importance of genetic diversity in invasion success. Finally, we make some suggestions for future research efforts in molecular ecology of biological invasions.

AB Population geneticists and community ecologists have long recognized the importance of sampling design for uncovering patterns of diversity within and among populations and in communities. Invasion ecologists increasingly have utilized phylogeographical patterns of mitochondrial or chloroplast DNA sequence variation to link introduced populations with putative source populations. However, many studies have ignored lessons from population genetics and community ecology and are vulnerable to sampling errors owing to insufficient field collections. A review of published invasion studies that utilized mitochondrial or chloroplast DNA markers reveals that insufficient sampling could strongly influence results and interpretations. Sixty per cent of studies sampled an average of less than six individuals per source population, vs. only 45% for introduced populations. Typically, far fewer introduced than source populations were surveyed, although they were sampled more intensively. Simulations based on published data forming a comprehensive mtDNA haplotype data set highlight and quantify the impact of the number of individuals surveyed per source population and number of putative source populations surveyed for accurate assignment of introduced individuals. Errors associated with sampling a low number of individuals are most acute when rare source haplotypes are dominant or fixed in the introduced population. Accuracy of assignment of introduced individuals is also directly related to the number of source populations surveyed and to the degree of genetic differentiation among them (F-ST). Incorrect interpretations resulting from sampling errors can be avoided if sampling design is considered before field collections are made.

AB Gas exchange was measured in a forest plantation dominated by Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl. and Quercus robur L. in northern Italy, over three growing seasons that differed in water availability (2001, 2002 and 2003). The objectives were to: (1) determine variability in the photosynthetic parameters V(cmax) (maximum carboxylation capacity) and J(max) (maximum rate of electron transport) in relation to species, leaf ontogeny and drought; and (2) assess the potential of the photosynthesis-nitro-en relationship for estimating leaf photosynthetic capacity.
   Marked seasonal and interannual variability in photosynthetic capacity was observed, primarily caused by changes in leaf ontogeny and water stress. Relatively small differences were apparent between species. 1n the absence of water stress (year 2002), the seasonal patterns of V(max) and J(max) were characterized by a rapid increase during spring, a relatively steady state during summer and a rapid decline during autumn. In years with a moderate (year 2001) or a severe (year 2003) water stress, photosynthetic capacity decreased during the summer in proportion to drought intensity, without a parallel decline in leaf nitrogen content. The V(cmax)-nitrogen relationship was significantly affected by both leaf ontogeny and drought. As a consequence, the use of a single annual regression to predict V(cmax) from leaf nitrogen yielded good estimates only during the summer and in the absence of water stress. Irrespective of the mechanisms by which photosynthetic capacity is affected by water stress, its large seasonal and interannual variability is of great relevance for modeling the forest carbon cycle.

AB We assessed the effectiveness of forest reserves (i.e., protected old secondary and primary forests), fragments (i.e., scattered ruderal vegetation), and urban parks (i.e., artificially revegetated habitats) in conserving butterfly diversity in a highly urbanized tropical landscape (i.e., Singapore), by testing the hypothesis that forest reserves have the highest butterfly species richness among these habitats. We investigated which environmental factors (e.g., canopy cover) affect the distribution of butterflies across the habitats; and also tested the hypothesis that butterfly communities of different habitats have distinct ecological traits. Further, we examined the important determinants (e.g., area) of butterfly richness in urban parks, by testing the hypothesis that the number of potential larval host plant species occurring in the park is the best predictor of butterfly species richness. Rarefaction analyses showed that forest reserves had the highest number of species, number of unique species, density of species, and community evenness among the habitats, implying that, in urban landscapes, the least human-disturbed habitats should be given the highest conservation priority. Forest reserves and urban parks adjoining forests collectively accounted for 91% of all butterfly species recorded in this study, suggesting that their preservation will likely achieve maximum complementarity for effective butterfly conservation. Ordination analyses revealed that different butterfly species responded differently to environmental factors (e.g., canopy cover), highlighting the importance of maintaining environmental heterogeneity for the conservation of different butterfly species. Classification tree analysis indicated that butterfly communities of different habitats (e.g., forests, urban parks) have distinct ecological traits (e.g., host plant specificity), whereby urban avoiders were 89% likely to be forest dependent and 63% likely to be monophagous, while urban adapters were 87% likely to be cosmopolitan and 67% likely to be oligo- or polyphagous. Regression analyses showed that the number of potential larval host plant species and isolation from forests were important determinants of butterfly species richness in urban parks, indicating that urban parks should be revegetated with a diversity of potential larval host plants and should be situated as near as possible to a forest, in order to maximize their conservation value.

AB It is widely assumed that commercial fisheries of highly fecund species are particularly resilient to exploitation, and that, should populations become seriously diminished, economic constraints will force fishing to cease before biological extinction can occur. Indeed, among commercially exploited marine fishes there is not one confirmed global extinction. Here we document, using nonconventional means, a story that not only questions such assumptions but that should also alert us to how little we know about significant fisheries in some parts of the world. Our case study is that of the highly threatened Chinese bahaba, Bahaba taipingensis, a member of the Sciaenidae (the drums or croakers), and an example of a fecund and commercially important group of fishes that appears to be especially vulnerable to fishing. We also demonstrate that the careful use of informal, or traditional, information can provide a powerful, sometimes unique, means of identifying and assessing the status and history of species that might be quietly slipping away before we learn anything about them.

AB The concomitantly variable codons hypothesis of DNA substitution argues that at any time only a fraction of the codons in a gene are capable of accepting a mutation. However, as mutations are fixed at some positions in a gene, the sites that are potentially variable also change because of changed functional constraints. This hypothesis as been termed the "covarion" hypothesis or when the model is applied to nucleotides, the "covariotide" hypothesis, The covarion-covariotide model has proven to be remarkably difficult to test. Here I examine a covariotide hypothesis for I I genes using a likelihood ratio test. I show that in nine of the genes examined a covariotide model provides a better explanation of the data than a model that does not allow constraints to change over time.

AB Coastal zones are usually managed with two main objectives: (1) conservation/maintenance of biodiversity and. intrinsic ecosystem services and (2) maintenance of sustainable fisheries. The management needs that can be met with marine protected areas fall into corresponding categories. First, fully protected (that is, no-take) reserves-parks-offer benchmarks and protect ecosystem integrity while encouraging research, education, and aesthetic appreciation of nature. Second, by allowing focused local control of human impacts, marine protected areas can be used to focus more intense local management designed to increase yield and allow research to help define sustainability and protect against uncertainty by using carefully managed fisheries as a research tool. We have been gambling with the future by establishing a poor balance between short-term profit and long-term risks. The absence of meaningful, fully protected reserves has produced a situation in which there are virtually no areas north of the Antarctic in the world's oceans that have exploitable resources where scientists can study natural marine systems. In most areas the higher-order predators and many other important species have been virtually eliminated; many benthic habitats have been much changed by fishing activities. Without solid data documenting changes through time, the relative merits of various causes and effects that operate in complex ecological systems can always be argued. Without natural systems important questions cannot be studied-for example, how the ecosystem roles of various species can be assessed, how they can be managed in a sustainable manner, and how we can evaluate resilience or relative rates of recovery. Networks of fully-protected reserves could facilitate research into such questions, contribute to the recovery of many coastal systems, and enable society to enrich its existence by observing species that should be part of its heritage (Murray ct al., 1999). The use of marine protected areas as fishing refugia has met strong resistance by fishers and many managers, and it is misunderstood by many conservation biologists because different proponents have different, usually simplistic, visions. It is important to spell out the objectives of each proposed example. Our essential habitat perspective emphasizes that each situation depends on specific life-history parameters and emphasizes critical thresholds in population dynamics, including density and behavior for fertilization, transport processes, settlement, survivorship, and growth to maturity. These are extremely difficult problems, and we cannot expect simplistic solutions to be effective. The only basis for optimism is that most of the seriously affected species are not yet extinct, and we still have a little time to establish permanent fully protected reserves to allow mankind to appreciate its rich but much depleted biological heritage. At least in some systems recovery can be measured over short time scales (<10 yrs), whereas others are much slower. Society as a whole is the ultimate stakeholder, not only the commercial and sports fishing industries that so dominate the public arena. Society will have to play a more active role if these species and habitats are to be saved.

AB We document the phylogenetic behavior of the 18S rRNA molecule in 67 taxa from 28 metazoan phyla and assess the effects of among-site rate variation on reconstructing phylogenies of the animal kingdom. This empirical assessment was undertaken to clarify further the limits of resolution of the 18S rRNA gene as a phylogenetic marker and to address the question of whether 18S rRNA phylogenies can be used as a source of evidence to infer the reality of a Cambrian explosion. A notable degree of among-site rate variation exists between different regions of the 18S rRNA molecule, as well as within all classes of secondary structure. There is a significant negative correlation between inferred number of nucleotide substitutions and phylogenetic information, as well as with the degree of substitutional saturation within the molecule. Base compositional differences both within and between taxa exist and, in certain lineages, mag; be associated with long branches and phylogenetic position, Importantly, excluding sites with different de,degrees of nucleotide substitution significantly influences the topology and degree of resolution of maximum-parsimony phylogenies as well as neighbor-joining phylogenies (corrected and uncorrected for among-site rate variation) reconstructed at the metazoan scale, Together, these data indicate that the 18S rRNA molecule is an unsuitable candidate for reconstructing the evolutionary history of all metazoan phyla, and that the polytomies, i.e., unresolved nodes within 18S rRNA phylogenies, cannot be used as a single or reliable source of evidence to support the hypothesis of a Cambrian explosion.

AB The harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) has one of the broadest geographic distributions of any pinniped, stretching from the east Baltic, west across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to southern Japan. Although individuals may travel several hundred kilometers on annual feeding migrations, harbor seals are generally believed to be philopatric, returning to the same areas each year to breed. Consequently, seals from different areas are likely to be genetically differentiated, with levels of genetic divergence increasing with distance. Differentiation may also be caused by long-standing topographic barriers such as the polar sea ice. We analyzed samples of 227 harbor seals from 24 Localities and defined 34 genotypes based on 435 bp of control region sequence. Phylogenetic analysis and analysis of molecular variance showed that populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and east and west coast populations of these oceans are significantly differentiated. Within these four regions, populations that are geographically farthest apart generally are the most differentiated and often do not share genotypes or differ in genotype frequency. The average corrected sequence divergence between populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is 3.28% +/- 0.38% and those among populations within each of these oceans are 0.75% +/- 0.69% and 1.19% +/- 0.65%, respectively. Our results suggest that harbor seals are regionally philopatric, on the scale of several hundred kilometers. However, generic discontinuities may exist, even between neighboring populations such as those on the Scottish and east English coasts or the east and west Baltic. The mitochondrial data are consistent with an ancient isolation of populations in both oceans, due to the development of polar sea ice. In the Atlantic and Pacific, populations appear to have been colonized from west to east with the European populations showing the most recent common ancestry. We suggest the recent ancestry of European seal populations may reflect recolonization from Ice Age refugia after the last glaciation.

AB Many populations are heterogeneous collections of different sizes or stages of conspecifics.  Existing overlap indices do not account for the size-/stage-structured nature of these populations.  In this paper I present new overlap indices that use information about the sizes of individuals that co-occur in time and space to predict the potential for interactions in size-structured guilds.  An index of the opportunity for competition (IOC) calculates the frequency with which similar size classes of two species encounter each other, whereas an index of the opportunity for intraguild predation (IOP) calculates the frequency of encounters among disparate size classes of the same two species.
   To illustrate that these indices are more appropriate for size-structured populations than conventional indices, I calculated overlap, IOP, and IOC for all species pairs in a diverse assemblage of dragonfly larvae.  The new indices revealed size-specific patterns of overlap that were not detected by the conventional index, including that (1) some species with high overlap values should interact mainly as competitors, others mainly as intraguild predators, and many as both competitors and predators, (2) subtle differences in phenology and/or size-specific shifts in habitat distribution can lead to the potential for asymmetric interspecific interactions, (3) some species with low pairwise IOP and IOC values are nonetheless vulnerable to the effects of diffuse competition or intraguild predation, (4) seasonal segregation reduces competitive overlap but at the same time increases the opportunity for intraguild predation.  The indices are general in form and should be useful for analyzing distributional data for any size-structured assemblage in which the type and intensity of interaction varies as a function of relative size.

AB Whole-genome resequencing (WGR) is a powerful method for addressing fundamental evolutionary biology questions that have not been fully resolved using traditional methods. WGR includes four approaches: the sequencing of individuals to a high depth of coverage with either unresolved or resolved haplotypes, the sequencing of population genomes to a high depth by mixing equimolar amounts of unlabelled-individual DNA (Pool-seq) and the sequencing of multiple individuals from a population to a low depth (IcWGR). These techniques require the availability of a reference genome. This, along with the still high cost of shotgun sequencing and the large demand for computing resources and storage, has limited their implementation in nonmodel species with scarce genomic resources and in fields such as conservation biology. Our goal here is to describe the various WGR methods, their pros and cons and potential applications in conservation biology. WGR offers an unprecedented marker density and surveys a wide diversity of genetic variations not limited to single nucleotide polymorphisms (e.g., structural variants and mutations in regulatory elements), increasing their power for the detection of signatures of selection and local adaptation as well as for the identification of the genetic basis of phenotypic traits and diseases. Currently, though, no single WGR approach fulfils all requirements of conservation genetics, and each method has its own limitations and sources of potential bias. We discuss proposed ways to minimize such biases. We envision a not distant future where the analysis of whole genomes becomes a routine task in many nonmodel species and fields including conservation biology.

AB Numerous field studies have found changes in soil respiration and microbial abundance under experimental warming. Yet, it is uncertain whether the magnitude of these responses remains consistent over the long-term. We performed a meta-analysis on 25 field experiments to examine how warming effects on soil respiration, microbial biomass, and soil microbial C respond to the duration of warming. For each parameter, we hypothesized that effect sizes of warming would diminish as the duration of warming increased. In support of our hypothesis, warming initially increased soil respiration, but the magnitude of this effect declined significantly as warming progressed as evidenced by the two longest studies in our meta-analysis. In fact, after 10 years of warming, soil respiration in warmed treatments was similar to controls. In contrast, warming effect sizes for fungal biomass, bacterial biomass, and soil microbial C did not respond significantly to the duration of warming. Microbial acclimation, community shifts, adaptation, or reductions in labile C may have ameliorated warming effects on soil respiration in the longterm. Accordingly, long-term soil C losses might be smaller than those suggested by short-term warming studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the crucial role of carbon transport in whole plant physiology and its impact on plant-environment interactions and ecosystem function, relatively little research has tried to examine how phloem physiology impacts plant ecology. In this review, we highlight several areas of active research where inquiry into phloem physiology has increased our understanding of whole plant function and ecological processes. We consider how xylem-phloem interactions impact plant drought tolerance and reproduction, how phloem transport influences carbon allocation in trees and carbon cycling in ecosystems and how phloem function mediates plant relations with insects, pests, microbes and symbiotes. We argue that in spite of challenges that exist in studying phloem physiology, it is critical that we consider the role of this dynamic vascular system when examining the relationship between plants and their biotic and abiotic environment.
   This review highlights the important but understudied role of phloem physiology in mediating how plants interact with their biotic and abiotic environment and shaping larger ecological patterns. We focus on three critical areas of current research: interactions between the xylem and phloem, carbon fluxes both in plants and at the ecosystem scale and interactions between plants and their biotic environment. The goal of this review is to draw attention to the critical role of carbon transport in plant physiological ecology and outline many of the questions that remain to be answered about this critical part of the plant vascular system.

AB Background:The adverse childhood experience (ACE) study found that risk for depression increased as a function of number of types of childhood maltreatment, and interpret this as a result of cumulative stress. An alternative hypothesis is that risk depends on type and timing of maltreatment. This will also present as a linear increase, since exposure to more types of abuse increases likelihood of experiencing a critical type of abuse at a critical age.
   Methods: 560 (223M/337F) young adults (18-25 years) were recruited from the community without regard to diagnosis and balanced to have equal exposure to 0-4 plus types of maltreatment. The Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure Scale assessed severity of exposure to 10 types of maltreatment across each year of childhood. Major depressive disorder (MDD) and current symptoms were evaluated by SCID, interview, and self-report. Predictive analytics assessed importance of exposure at each age and evaluated whether exposure at one or two ages was a more important predictor than number, severity, or duration of maltreatment across childhood.
   Results: The most important predictors of lifetime history of MDD were non-verbal emotional abuse in males and peer emotional abuse (EA) in females at 14 years of age, and these were more important predictors across models than number of types of maltreatment (males: t(9) = 16.39, p < 10(-7); females t(9) = 5.78, p < 10(-4)). Suicidal ideation was predicted, in part, by NVEA and peer EA at age 14, but most importantly by parental verbal abuse at age 5 in males and sexual abuse at age 18 in females.
   Conclusion: This study provides evidence for sensitive exposure periods when maltreatment maximally impacts risk for depression, and provides an alternative interpretation of the ACE study results. These findings fit with emerging neuroimaging evidence for regional sensitivity periods. The presence of sensitive exposure periods has important implications for prevention, preemption, and treatment of MDD.

AB Increase of belowground C allocation by plants under global warming or elevated CO2 may promote decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) by priming and strongly affects SOC dynamics. The specific effects by priming of SOC depend on the amount and frequency of C inputs. Most previous priming studies have investigated single C additions, but they are not very representative for litterfall and root exudation in many terrestrial ecosystems. We evaluated effects of C-13-labeled glucose added to soil in three temporal patterns: single, repeated, and continuous on dynamics of CO2 and priming of SOC decomposition over 6 months. Total and C-13 labeled CO2 were monitored to analyze priming dynamics and net C balance between SOC loss caused by priming and the retention of added glucose-C. Cumulative priming ranged from 1.3 to 5.5mgCg(-1) SOC in the subtropical, and from -0.6 to 5.5mgCg(-1) SOC in the tropical soils. Single addition induced more priming than repeated and continuous inputs. Therefore, single additions of high substrate amounts may overestimate priming effects over the short term. The amount of added glucose C remaining in soil after 6months (subtropical: 8.1-11.2mgCg(-1) SOC or 41-56% of added glucose; tropical: 8.7-15.0mgCg(-1) SOC or 43-75% of glucose) was substantially higher than the net C loss due to SOC decomposition including priming effect. This overcompensation of C losses was highest with continuous inputs and lowest with single inputs. Therefore, raised labile organic C input to soils by higher plant productivity will increase SOC content even though priming accelerates decomposition of native SOC. Consequently, higher continuous input of C belowground by plants under warming or elevated CO2 can increase C stocks in soil despite accelerated C cycling by priming in soils.

AB Although generations of researchers have studied the factors that limit the distributions of species, we still do not seem to understand this phenomenon comprehensively. Traditionally, species' ranges have been seen as the consequence of abiotic conditions and local adaptation to the environment. However, during the last years it has become more and more evident that biotic factors - such as intra- and interspecific interactions or the dispersal capacity of species - and even rapidly occurring evolutionary processes can strongly influence the range of a species and its potential to spread to new habitats. Relevant eco-evolutionary forces can be found at all hierarchical levels: from landscapes to communities via populations, individuals and genes. We here use the metapopulation concept to develop a framework that allows us to synthesize this broad spectrum of different factors. Since species' ranges are the result of a dynamic equilibrium of colonization and local extinction events, the importance of dispersal is immediately clear. We highlight the complex interrelations and feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary forces that shape dispersal and result in non-trivial and partially counter-intuitive range dynamics. Our concept synthesizes current knowledge on range biology and the eco-evolutionary dynamics of dispersal. Synthesis What factors are responsible for the dynamics of species' ranges? Answering this question has never been more important than today, in the light of rapid environmental changes. Surprisingly, the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of dispersal - which represent the driving forces behind range formation - have rarely been considered in this context. We here present a framework that closes this gap. Dispersal evolution may be responsible for highly complex and non-trivial range dynamics. In order to understand these, and possibly provide projections of future range positions, it is crucial to take the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of dispersal into account.

AB Wildland fire is an important natural process in many ecosystems. However, fire exclusion has reduced frequency of fire and area burned in many dry forest types, which may affect vegetation structure and composition, and potential fire behavior. In forests of the western U.S., these effects pose a challenge for fire and land managers who seek to restore the ecological process of fire to ecosystems. Recent research suggests that landscapes with unaltered fire regimes are more "self-regulating" than those that have experienced fire-regime shifts; in self-regulating systems, fire size and severity are moderated by the effect of previous fire. To determine if burn severity is moderated in areas that recently burned, we analyzed 117 wildland fires in 2 wilderness areas in the western U.S. that have experienced substantial recent fire activity. Burn severity was measured using a Landsat satellite-based metric at a 30-m resolution. We evaluated (1) whether pixels that burned at least twice since 1984 experienced lower burn severity than pixels that burned once, (2) the relationship between burn severity and fire history, pre-fire vegetation, and topography, and (3) how the moderating effect of a previous fire decays with time. Results show burn severity is significantly lower in areas that have recently burned compared to areas that have not. This effect is still evident at around 22 years between wildland fire events. Results further indicate that burn severity generally increases with time since and severity of previous wildfire. These findings may assist land managers to anticipate the consequences of allowing fires to burn and provide rationale for using wildfire as a "fuel treatment".

TI Independent variation in photosynthetic capacity and stomatal

AB Intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEintr), the ratio of photosynthesis to stomatal conductance to water, is often used as an index for crop water use in breeding projects. However, WUEintr conflates variation in these two processes, and thus may be less useful as a selection trait than knowledge of both components. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the contribution of photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance to WUEintr varied independently between soybean genotypes and whether this pattern was interactive with mild drought. Photosynthetic capacity was defined as the variation in WUEintr that would occur if genotypes of interest had the same stomatal conductance as a reference genotype and only differed in photosynthesis; similarly, the contribution of stomatal conductance to WUEintr was calculated assuming a constant photosynthetic capacity across genotypes. Genotypic differences in stomatal conductance had the greatest effect on WUEintr (26% variation when well watered), and was uncorrelated with the effect of photosynthetic capacity on WUEintr. Thus, photosynthetic advantages of 8.3% were maintained under drought. The maximal rate of Rubisco carboxylation, generally the limiting photosynthetic process for soybeans, was correlated with photosynthetic capacity. As this trait was not interactive with leaf temperature, and photosynthetic capacity differences were maintained under mild drought, the observed patterns of photosynthetic advantage for particular genotypes are likely to be consistent across a range of environmental conditions. This suggests that it is possible to employ a selection strategy of breeding water-saving soybeans with high photosynthetic capacities to compensate for otherwise reduced photosynthesis in genotypes with lower stomatal conductance.

AB A population of bottlenose dolphins inhabits 7 of the 14 fjords that compose Fiordland, New Zealand. One of these fjords, Milford Sound, supports a large tourism industry that results in intense boat traffic. Bottlenose dolphins regularly visited Milford Sound and tour boats interacted with them during these visits, I studied the factors affecting the frequency of visits to Milford Sound by relating the residency pattern of dolphins in this fjord to oceanographic parameters and variations in boat traffic between December 1999 and February 2002. Boat traffic was the only variable that could explain the frequency of dolphin visits to Milford Sound. Dolphins spent less time in Milford Sound during seasons of intense boat traffic. Moreover, when dolphins visited this fjord, they spent more time at the entrance of the fjord when boat traffic was intense, out of the reach of tour boats. It seems that dolphins avoid Milford Sound when traffic is heavy. This avoidance could have long-term implications for the demography of the population.

AB In Europe, concordant geographical distribution among genetic lineages within different species is rare, which suggests distinct reactions to Quaternary ice ages. This study aims to determine whether such a discrepancy also affects a pair of sympatric species, which are morphologically and taxonomically closely related but which have slight differences in their ecological habits. The phylogeographic structures of two European rodents, the Yellow-necked fieldmouse (A. flavicollis) and the woodmouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) were, therefore, compared on the basis of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b (mtDNA cyt b) sequences (965 base pairs) from 196 specimens collected from 59 European localities spread throughout the species distributions. The results indicate that the two species survived in different ways through the Quaternary glaciations. A. sylvaticus survived in the Iberian Peninsula from where it recolonized almost all Europe at the end of the last glaciation. Conversely, the refuge from which A. flavicollis recolonized Europe, including northern Spain, during the Holocene corresponds to the Italo-Balkan area, where A. sylvaticus suffered a serious genetic bottleneck. This study confirms that even closely related species may have highly different phylogeographic histories and shows the importance of ecological plasticity of the species for their survival through climate change. Finally, it suggests that phylogeographic distinctiveness may be a general feature of European species.

AB Lizards of the family Eublepharidae exhibit interspecific diversity in body size, sexual size dimorphism (SSD), head size dimorphism (HSD), occurrence of male combat, and presence of male precloacal pores. Hence, they offer an opportunity for testing hypotheses for the evolution and maintenance of sexual dimorphism. Historical analysis of male agonistic behaviour indicates that territoriality is ancestral in eublepharid geckos. Within Eublepharidae, male combat disappeared twice. In keeping with predictions from sexual selection theory, both events were associated with parallel loss of male-biased HSD and ventral scent glands. Eublepharids therefore provide new evidence that male-biased dimorphic heads are weapons used in aggressive encounters and that the ventral glands probably function in territory marking rather than in intersexual communication. Male-biased SSD is a plesiomorphic characteristic and was affected by at least three inversions. Shifts in SSD and male combat were not historically correlated. Therefore, other factors than male rivalry appear responsible for SSD inversions. Eublepharids demonstrate the full scope of Rensch's rule (small species tend to be female-larger, larger species male-larger). Most plausibly, SSD pattern hence seems to reflect body size variation.

AB Seasonal variation in N-2 fixation, N transfer from clover to ryegrass, and soil N absorption in white clover-ryegrass swards were investigated under field conditions over three consecutive years. The plots were established with different seeding ratios of clover and ryegrass and contrasting fertilizer N ranging from 3 to 72 kg ha(-1) year(-1).
   An initially poor clover population needed at least one growing season to reach the same yield output as an initially well established clover population. The clover content of the sward decreased by the annual application of 72 kg N ha(-1) but not by smaller N dressings.
   The total amount of atmospherically derived N in clover growing in mixture with ryegrass was, on average over the three years equal to 83, 71, 68 and 60 kg N ha(-1) for the treatments of 3, 24, 48 and 72 kg N ha(-1), respectively. The proportion of atmospherically derived N declined with increasing N application, but never became smaller than 80% of total clover N. The proportion of atmospherically derived N in a pure stand white clover amounted to 60-80% of the total N content, equivalent to 109, 110, 103 and 90 kg N ha(-1) for the treatments of 3, 24, 48 and 72 kg N ha(-1), respectively.
   Only small amounts of atmospherically derived N was transferred to the associated ryegrass during the first production year, while in each of the following years up to 21 kg ha(-1) was transferred. The average amount of N transferred from clover to ryegrass was equivalent to 3, 16 and 31% of the N accumulated in ryegrass in the first, second and third production year, respectively. Expressed relative to the total amount of fixed N-2 in the clover-ryegrass mixture, the transfer amounted to 3, 17 and 22% in the first, second and third production year, respectively. Thus transfer of atmospherically derived N from clover contributed significantly to the N economy of the associated ryegrass.
   The clover-ryegrass mixture absorbed constantly higher amount of soil derived N than the pure stands of the two species. Only 11% of the total accumulated fertilizer N and soil derived N in the mixture was contained within the clover component. Lower water use efficiencies for the plants grown in mixture compared to pure stands were mainly related to the increased N uptake in the mixture, with the subsequent increase in growth compared to the pure stands.
   It is concluded that positive interactions between clover and ryegrass growing in mixture ensure a more efficient fixation of atmospheric N-2 and absorption of fertilizer N and soil derived N than pure stands of the same species.

AB Populations of fishes on coral reefs are replenished by the settlement of pelagic larvae to demersal populations. Recruitment varies spatially and temporally and can exert strong effects on the dynamics of reef fish populations. This study examined the effect of microhabitat characteristics on small-scale and large-scale recruitment variation in the three-spot damselfish, Stegastes planifrons (Cuvier). Comparison of 0.25-m(2) quadrats occupied by three-spots with randomly sampled null quadrats showed that three-spots quadrats contained a higher percent cover of the coral Montastrea annularis than would be expected at random. Manipulative experiments on three types of 1.0-m(2) patch reefs (living M. annularis, dead Porites Porites and dead Acropora palmata) patch reefs on showed that this non-random distribution was established by microhabitat choice during settlement and not by differential post-settlement survival. The presence of conspecific juveniles did not affect settlement. Recruitment was monitored at nine sites on three islands over 3 years. Recruitment showed no consistent pattern in the relative levels of recruitment among sites. Similarly, no consistent relationship emerged between recruitment levels and microhabitat characteristics at the nine sites. For example, at this large scale, the percent cover of M. annularis explained variation in recruitment in only 1 out of 3 years. These results suggest that small-scale recruitment patterns are influenced by microhabitat choice during settlement, but that these habitat effects do not scale up to influence large-scale variation in recruitment.

AB Sugar beets (Beta vulgaris L. cv F58-554H1) were grown hydroponically in a 16-h light, 8-h dark period at a photosynthetic photon flux density of 0.5 mmol m(-2) s(-1) for 4 weeks in half-Hoagland culture solution containing only nitrate-nitrogen. Half of the plants were then transferred to half-Hoagland solution with ammonium-nitrogen (7.5 mM), while the other half continued on 7.5 mM nitrate. Growth analysis was carried out by sampling the plants at 3-d intervals over a period of 21 d. Compared to plants supplied with nitrate, ammonium initially slowed the growth of shoots more than roots. Ammonium reduced both the area expansion of individual leaves and the relative water content of these leaves, but increased the amount of dry matter/area. The increase in specific leaf weight in ammonium-grown leaves was associated with a doubling of chloroplast volume, as much as a 62% rise in chlorophyll content, and a 4.3-fold higher accumulation of soluble protein. Ammonium nutrition substantially decreased the rate of expansion of photosynthetic (leaf) surface but did not decrease the rate of photosynthesis per area; in fact, net photosynthetic CO2 exchange rates were slightly higher than in nitrate plants, due to the build-up in stromal enzymes of the Calvin cycle, several of which increased in total extractable activity on a leaf area basis, e.g. ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase oxygenase, sedoheptulose-1,7-biphosphatase. Nitrogen source had no effect on stomatal conductance. Rates of photosynthesis per chlorophyll were decreased slightly in ammonium-grown leaves, possibly due to an increased CO2-diffusion resistance associated with the enlarged chloroplasts.

AB Analysing communities of soil bacteria under differing nutrient concentrations, the authors show that extensive growth with high levels of nutrients results in stronger interactions among species, leading to declines in biodiversity and stability.
   Organisms-especially microbes-tend to live together in ecosystems. While some of these ecosystems are very biodiverse, others are not, and while some are very stable over time, others undergo strong temporal fluctuations. Despite a long history of research and a plethora of data, it is not fully understood what determines the biodiversity and stability of ecosystems. Theory and experiments suggest a connection between species interaction, biodiversity and the stability of ecosystems, where an increase in ecosystem stability with biodiversity could be observed in several cases. However, what causes these connections remains unclear. Here, we show in microbial ecosystems in the laboratory that the concentrations of available nutrients can set the strength of interactions between bacteria. High nutrient concentrations allowed the bacteria to strongly alter the chemical environment, causing on average more negative interactions between species. These stronger interactions excluded more species from the community, resulting in a loss of biodiversity. At the same time, the stronger interactions also decreased the stability of the microbial communities, providing a mechanistic link between species interaction, biodiversity and stability in microbial ecosystems.

AB Teleost fishes are the most diverse group of vertebrates on Earth. On tropical coral reefs, their species richness exceeds 6000 species; one tenth of total vertebrate biodiversity. A large proportion of this diversity is composed of cryptobenthic reef fishes (CRFs): bottom-dwelling, morphologically or behaviourally cryptic species typically less than 50 mm in length. Yet, despite their diversity and abundance, these fishes are both poorly defined and understood. Herein we provide a new quantitative definition and synthesise current knowledge on the diversity, distribution and life history of CRFs. First, we use size distributions within families to define 17 core CRF families as characterised by the high prevalence (>10%) of small-bodied species (<50 mm). This stands in strong contrast to 42 families of large reef fishes, in which virtually no small-bodied species have evolved. We posit that small body size has allowed CRFs to diversify at extremely high rates, primarily by allowing for fine partitioning of microhabitats and facilitation of allopatric reproductive isolation; yet, we are far from understanding and documenting the biodiversity of CRFs. Using rates of description since 1758, we predict that approximately 30 new species of cryptobenthic species will be described per year until 2050 (approximately twice the annual rate compared to large fishes). Furthermore, we predict that by the year 2031, more than half of the described coral reef fish biodiversity will consist of CRFs. These fishes are the 'hidden half' of vertebrate biodiversity on coral reefs. Notably, global geographic coverage and spatial resolution of quantitative data on CRF communities is uniformly poor, which further emphasises the remarkable reservoir of biodiversity that is yet to be discovered. Although small body size may have enabled extensive diversification within CRF families, small size also comes with a suite of ecological challenges that affect fishes' capacities to feed, survive and reproduce; we identify a range of life-history adaptations that have enabled CRFs to overcome these limitations. In turn, these adaptations bestow a unique socio-ecological role on CRFs, which includes a key role in coral reef trophodynamics by cycling trophic energy provided by microscopic prey to larger consumers. Although small in body size, the ecology and evolutionary history of CRFs may make them a critical component of coral-reef food webs; yet our review also shows that these fishes are highly susceptible to a variety of anthropogenic disturbances. Understanding the consequences of these changes for CRFs and coral reef ecosystems will require us to shed more light on this frequently overlooked but highly diverse and abundant guild of coral reef fishes.

AB The increasing use of species distribution modeling (SDM) has raised new concerns regarding the inaccuracies, misunderstanding, and misuses of this important tool. One of those possible pitfalls - collinearity among environmental predictors - is assumed as an important source of model uncertainty, although it has not been subjected to a detailed evaluation in recent SDM studies. It is expected that collinearity will increase uncertainty in model parameters and decrease statistical power. Here we use a virtual species approach to compare models built using subsets of PCA-derived variables with models based on the original highly correlated climate variables. Moreover, we evaluated whether modelling algorithms and species data characteristics generate models with varying sensitivity to collinearity. As expected, collinearity among predictors decreases the efficiency and increases the uncertainty of species distribution models. Nevertheless, the intensity of the effect varied according to the algorithm properties: more complex procedures behaved better than simple envelope models. This may support the claim that complex models such as Maxent take advantage of existing collinearity in finding the best set of parameters. The interaction of the different factors with species characteristics (centroid and tolerance in environmental space) highlighted the importance of the so-called "idiosyncrasy in species responses" to model efficiency, but differences in prevalence may represent a better explanation. However, even models with low accuracy to predict suitability of individual cells may provide meaningful information on the estimation of range-size, a key species-trait for macroecological studies. We concluded that the use of PCA-derived variables is advised both to control the negative effects of collinearity and as a more objective solution for the problem of variable selection in studies dealing with large number of species with heterogeneous responses to environmental variables.

AB We describe an implementation of the Ecosystem Demography (ED) concept in the Community Land Model. The structure of CLM(ED) and the physiological and structural modifications applied to the CLM are presented. A major motivation of this development is to allow the prediction of biome boundaries directly from plant physiological traits via their competitive interactions. Here we investigate the performance of the model for an example biome boundary in eastern North America. We explore the sensitivity of the predicted biome boundaries and ecosystem properties to the variation of leaf properties using the parameter space defined by the GLOPNET global leaf trait database. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of four sequential alterations to the structural assumptions in the model governing the relative carbon economy of deciduous and evergreen plants. The default assumption is that the costs and benefits of deciduous vs. evergreen leaf strategies, in terms of carbon assimilation and expenditure, can reproduce the geographical structure of biome boundaries and ecosystem functioning. We find some support for this assumption, but only under particular combinations of model traits and structural assumptions. Many questions remain regarding the preferred methods for deployment of plant trait information in land surface models. In some cases, plant traits might best be closely linked to each other, but we also find support for direct linkages to environmental conditions. We advocate intensified study of the costs and benefits of plant life history strategies in different environments and the increased use of parametric and structural ensembles in the development and analysis of complex vegetation models.

AB Leaf-level determinants of species environmental stress tolerance are still poorly understood. Here, we explored dependencies of species shade (T-shade) and drought (T-drought) tolerance scores on key leaf structural and functional traits in 339 Northern Hemisphere temperate woody species.
   In general, T-shade was positively associated with leaf life-span (L-L), and negatively with leaf dry mass (M-A), nitrogen content (N-A), and photosynthetic capacity (A(A)) per area, while opposite relationships were observed with drought tolerance. Different trait combinations responsible for T-shade and T-drought were observed among the key plant functional types: deciduous and evergreen broadleaves and evergreen conifers.
   According to principal component analysis, resource-conserving species with low N content and photosynthetic capacity, and high L-L and M-A, had higher T-drought, consistent with the general stress tolerance strategy, whereas variation in T-shade did not concur with the postulated stress tolerance strategy.
   As drought and shade often interact in natural communities, reverse effects of foliar traits on these key environmental stress tolerances demonstrate that species niche differentiation is inherently constrained in temperate woody species. Different combinations of traits among key plant functional types further explain the contrasting bivariate correlations often observed in studies seeking functional explanation of variation in species environmental tolerances.

AB Determining the factors that influence the rate of spread of invasive species is an important goal for conservation biology. if invasive species utilize specific landscape features as dispersal corridors, control programs can target such corridors. Radio-telemetry was used to determine landscape level factors that influence dispersal of an introduced anuran species (the cane toad) at an invasion front in tropical Australia. Most radio-tracked toads moved along roads and cleared fencelines, avoiding heavily vegetated habitat; they typically sheltered overnight close to these open corridors, returning to the road each evening to recommence dispersal. Surveys of the compass orientation of dispersing toads on roads showed that most animals were oriented along the main axis of the road (and thus, travelling along the road) rather than moving across it. To test the hypothesis that use of roads enables toads to disperse more rapidly than would be possible across more thickly vegetated sites, locomotor performance of toads was quantified under field conditions. As predicted, toads rapidly slowed down in dense roadside vegetation but continued to move rapidly through open areas. These results suggest that simple habitat manipulations of roadside verges might help to reduce the rate of dispersal of cane toads across tropical Australia. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB circle Leaf mass per area (LMA), nitrogen concentration (on mass and area bases, N-mass and N-area, respectively), photosynthetic capacity (A(mass) and A(area)) and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) are key foliar traits, but few data are available from cold, high-altitude environments.
   circle Here, we systematically measured these leaf traits in 74 species at 49 research sites on the Tibetan Plateau to examine how these traits, measured near the extremes of plant tolerance, compare with global patterns.
   circle Overall, Tibetan species had higher leaf nitrogen concentrations and photosynthetic capacities compared with a global dataset, but they had a slightly lower A(mass) at a given N-mass. These leaf trait relationships were consistent with those reported from the global dataset, with slopes of the standardized major axes A(mass)-LMA, N-mass-LMA and A(mass)-N-mass identical to those from the global dataset. Climate only weakly modulated leaf traits.
   circle Our data indicate that covarying sets of leaf traits are consistent across environments and biogeographic regions. Our results demonstrate functional convergence of leaf trait relationships in an extreme environment.

AB The life cycles of plants and animals are changing around the world in line with the predictions originated from hypotheses concerning the impact of global warming and climate change on biological systems. Commonly, the search for ecological mechanisms behind the observed changes in bird phenology has focused on the analysis of climatic patterns from the species breeding grounds. However, the ecology of bird migration suggests that the spring arrival of long-distance migrants (such as trans-Saharan birds) is more likely to be influenced by climate conditions in wintering areas given their direct impact on the onset of migration and its progression. We tested this hypothesis by analysing the first arrival dates (FADs) of six trans-Saharan migrants (cuckoo Cuculus canorus, swift Apus apus, hoopoe Upupa epops, swallow Hirundo rustica, house martin Delichon urbica and nightingale Luscinia megarhynchos), in a western Mediterranean area since from 1952 to 2003. By means of multiple regression analyses, FADs were analysed in relation to the monthly temperature and precipitation patterns of five African climatic regions south of the Sahara where species are thought to overwinter and from the European site from where FADs were collected. We obtained significant models for five species explaining 9-41% of the variation in FADs. The interpretation of the models suggests that: (1) The climate in wintering quarters, especially the precipitation, has a stronger influence on FADs than that in the species' potential European breeding grounds. (2) The accumulative effects of climate patterns prior to migration onset may be of considerable importance since those climate variables that served to summarize climate patterns 12 months prior to the onset of migration were selected by final models. (3) Temperature and precipitation in African regions are likely to affect departure decision in the species studied through their indirect effects on food availability and the build-up of reserves for migration. Our results concerning the factors that affect the arrival times of trans-Saharan migrants indicate that the effects of climate change are more complex than previously suggested, and that these effects might have an interacting impact on species ecology, for example by reversing ecological pressures during species' life cycles.

AB Processes that occur around the transition between larval and juvenile life-stages can have a major effect on the population dynamics of organisms with complex life cycles. We explore the roles of larval history and selective post-settlement mortality in determining the growth and survival of newly settled individuals of the damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis (Pomacentridae). Specifically, we determine whether the direction and intensity of selection on the recruits differs among various size-classes of predators. A mark-recapture study showed that individuals who survived 9 or more days were significantly larger at settlement than those that died within the first day (12.3 vs 11.9 mm SL), when mortality was highest (25% d(-1)). Censuses revealed that the species and size composition of piscivores differed markedly between two reef habitats where P. amboinensis was common. A cage experiment, conducted in both habitats, manipulated the sizes of predators that could access newly settled P. amboinensis to determine whether the resulting mortality of the recently settled fish was influenced by larval growth history or size at settlement. Ten days after the start of the experiment individuals that grew slowly in the second half of their larval life had been lost from most of the experimental treatments. Small fish were also selectively lost from the coarse-mesh cage on the reef base. Significant positive relationships between pre- and post-settlement growth rates were found in both habitats for the fine mesh cages, cage controls and open patch reefs. This relationship was reversed in the coarse mesh cages in both habitats. This growth compensation was facilitated through the action of a particular size range of predators, whose impact was disrupted or masked in the open treatments by the action of a diverse predator pool. The present study underscores the complexity of the processes that influence the early post-transition growth and survival in organisms with complex life-histories.

AB Antarctic waters represent a unique marine environment delimited by an oceanographic barrier, the Polar Front Zone, and characterized by constant subzero temperatures and presence of sea ice. A group of teleost fish, the Notothenioidei, have adapted to these challenging environmental conditions, undergoing a remarkable diversification. In the present study a total of 798 base pairs, generated from partial sequencing of 16S and 12S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes, were examined in 33 notothenioid species representative of all families included in the suborder Notothenioidei. Phylogenetic trees, reconstructed on the basis of sequence data by different methods, indicate that traditional hypotheses on notothenioid systematics and biogeography might be in need of reexamination. Molecular evidence suggests that vicariant speciation could be invoked to explain the early divergence of Eleginops maclovinus, a species previously included in the family Nototheniidae, which is now proposed as the closest sister group to all the rest of notothenioids apart from bovichtids. On the other hand, repeated, independent dispersal through the Polar Front is proposed for the divergence of other subantarctic notothenioid species. Likewise, multiple, independent transitions from benthic to pelagic habit are inferred from molecular data, at variance with the more conservative hypothesis based on cladograms reconstructed from morphological data.

AB Reductions in fishing mortality within no-take coral reef marine reserves can produce gradients in the density and size of fishes across reserve boundaries. Such gradients may be affected by other factors, however, including differences in habitat quality between reserve and non-reserve areas and the movement of fish across reserve boundaries. To examine the effects of protection from fishing mortality and of habitat quality on an assemblage of exploited reef fishes, we measured the spatial patterns of fish density and size on fringing reefs near the boundary of the Barbados Marine Reserve (Barbados, West Indies) and statistically controlled for habitat correlates of fish density and size. Reserve sites supported a higher total density and size of fishes than non-reserve sites. Most species had a non-significantly higher mean density and size at reserve sites. The density and/or size of many species were correlated with the depth, rugosity, and/or substrate composition of sites. After statistically controlling for the effects of habitat correlates, the difference in total density between reserve and non-reserve sites remained significant, and the mean density and size of most species remained nonsignificantly higher at reserve sites. Neither the mobility of species nor their vulnerability to capture by Antillean fish traps was correlated with their relative difference in density or size between reserve and non-reserve sites. Spearfishing target species had a significantly higher relative difference in size between reserve and non-reserve sites than non-target species. Protection from fishing mortality and higher habitat quality appear to contribute to the increased density and size of fishes on study reefs in the Barbados Marine Reserve, and this difference is not compromised by emigration from the reserve.

AB The functional roles of the contrasting morphologies of sun and shade shoots of the evergreen shrub Heteromeles arbutifolia were investigated in chaparral and understory habitats by applying a three-dimensional plant architecture simulation model, YPLANT. The simulations were shown to accurately predict the measured frequency distribution of photosynthetic photon flux density (PFD) on both the leaves and a horizontal surface in the open, and gave reasonably good agreement for the more complex light environment in the shade. The sun shoot architecture was orthotropic and characterized by steeply inclined (mean = 71 degrees) leaves in a spiral phyllotaxy with short internodes. This architecture resulted in relatively low light absorption efficiencies (E-A) for both diffuse and direct PFD, especially during the summer when solar elevation angles were high. Shade shoots were more plagiotropic with longer internodes and a pseudo-distichous phyllotaxis caused by bending of the petioles that positioned the leaves in a nearly horizontal plane (mean = 5 degrees). This shade-shoot architecture resulted in higher E-A values for both direct and diffuse PFD as compared to those of the sun shoots. Differences in E-A between sun and shade shoots and between summer and winter were related to differences in projection efficiencies as determined by leaf and solar angles, and by differences in self shading resulting from leaf overlap. The leaves exhibited photosynthetic acclimation to the sun and the shade, with the sun leaves having higher photosynthetic capacities per unit area, higher leaf mass per unit area and lower respiration rates per unit area than shade leaves. Despite having 7 times greater available PFD, sun shoots absorbed only 3 times more and had daily carbon gains only double of those of shade shoots. Simulations showed that sun and shade plants performed similarly in the open light environment, but that shade shoots substantially outperformed sun shoots in the shade light environment. The shoot architecture observed in sun plants appears to achieve an efficient compromise between maximizing carbon gain while minimizing the time that the leaf surfaces are exposed to PFDs in excess of those required for light saturation of photosynthesis and therefore potentially photoinhibitory.

AB Responses of photosynthesis (A) to intercellular CO2 concentration (c(i)) in 2-year-old Pinus radiata D. Don seedlings were measured at a range of temperatures in order to parametrize a biophysical model of leaf photosynthesis. Increasing leaf temperature from 8 to 30 degrees C caused a 4-fold increase in V-cmax, the maximum rate of carboxylation (10.7-43.3 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and a 3-fold increase in J(max), the maximum electron transport rate (20.5-60.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The temperature optimum for J(max) was lower than that for V-cmax, causing a decline in the ratio J(max):V-cmax from 2.0 to 1.4 as leaf temperature increased from 8 to 30 degrees C, To determine the response of photosynthesis to leaf nitrogen concentration, additional measurements were made on seedlings grown under four nitrogen treatments, Foliar N concentrations varied between 0.36 and 1.27 mol kg(-1), and there were linear relationships between N concentration and both V-cmax and J(max). Measurements made throughout the crown of a plantation forest tree, where foliar N concentrations varied from 0.83 mol kg(-1) near the base to 1.54 mol kg(-1) near the lender, yielded similar relationships. These results will be useful in scaling carbon assimilation models from leaves to canopies.

AB Terrestrial plant photosynthesis may be limited both by stomatal behavior and leaf biochemical capacity. While inferences have been made about the importance of stomatal and biochemical limitations to photosynthesis in a variety of species in a range of environments, genetic variation in these limitations has never been documented in wild plant populations. Genetic variation provides the raw material for adaptive evolution in rates of carbon assimilation. We examined genetic variation in gas exchange physiology and in stomatal and biochemical traits in 16 genetic lines of the annual plant, Polygonum arenastrum. The photosynthesis against leaf internal CO2 (A-ci) response curve was measured on three greenhouse-grown individuals per line. We measured the photosynthetic rate (A) and stomatal conductance (g), and calculated the internal CO2 concentration (ci) at ambient CO2 levels. In addition, the following stomatal and biochemical characteristics were obtained from the A-ci curve on each individual: the degree of stomatal limitation to photosynthesis (L(s)), the maximum ribulose 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) activity (Vc(max)) and electron transport capacity (J(max)). All physiological traits were genetically variable, with broad sense heritabilities ranging from 0.66 for L(s) to 0.94 for J(max). Strong positive genetic correlations were found between Vc(max) and J(max), between g and biochemical chemical capacity. Path analyses revealed strong causal influences of stomatal conductance and leaf biochemistry on A and ci. Path analysis also indicated that L(s) confounds both stomatal and biochemical effects, and is an appropriate measure of stomatal influences on photosynthesis, only when biochemical variation is accounted for. In total, our results indicate that differences among lines in photosynthesis and ci result from simultaneous changes in biochemical and stomatal characteristics and are consistent with theoretical predictions that there should be co-limitation of photosynthesis by ribulose-1,5-biphosphate (RuBP) utilization and regeneration, and by stomatal conductance and leaf biochemistry. Gas exchange characteristics of genetic lines in the present study were generally consistent with measurements of the same lines in a previous field study. Our new results indicate that the mechanisms underlying variation in gas exchange include variation in both stomatal conductance and biochemical capacity. In addition, A, g, and ci in the present study tended also to be positively correlated with carbon isotope discrimination (Delta), and negatively correlated with time to flowering, life span, and leaf size based on earlier work. The pattern of correlation between physiology and life span among genetic lines of P. arenastrum parallels interspecific patterns of character correlations. We suggest that the range of trait constellations among lines in P. arenastrum represents a continuum between stress avoidance (rapid development, high gas exchange metabolism) and stress tolerance (slow development, low gas exchange metabolism), and that genetic variation in these character combinations may be maintained by environmental variation in stress levels in the species' ruderal habitat.

AB Spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi were isolated from two heavy-metal polluted soils in France via trap culture with leek (Allium porrum L.). Preliminary identification showed that the predominant spore type of both cultures (P2 and Cd40) belongs to the Glomus mosseae group. Their sensitivity to cadmium was compared to a laboratory reference strain (G. mosseae) by in vitro germination tests with cadmium nitrate solutions at a range of concentrations (0 to 100 mg L-1) as well as extracts from a metal-polluted and unpolluted soils. Both cultures of AM fungi from heavy-metal polluted soils were more tolerant to cadmium than the G. mosseae reference strain. The graphically estimated EC50 was 0.8 mg L-1 Cd (concentration added to the test device) for G. mosseae and 7 mg L-1 for P2 culture, corresponding to effective Cd concentrations of approximately 50-70 mug L-1 and 200-500 mug L-1, respectively. The extract of the metal-polluted soil P2 decreased germination of spores from the reference G. mosseae but not from P2 culture. However, the extracts of two unpolluted soils with different physico-chemical characteristics did not affect G. mosseae, whereas germination of P2 spores was markedly decreased in the presence of one of the extracts. These results indicate a potential adaptation of AM fungi to elevated metal concentrations in soil. The tested spores may be considered as metal-tolerant ecotypes. Spore germination results in presence of soil extracts show the difficulty of assessing the ecotoxic effect of metals on AM fungi without considering other soil factors that may interfere in spore germination and hyphal extension.

AB Trait-based approaches have taken an increasingly dominant role in community ecology. Although trait-based strategy dimensions such as the leaf economic spectrum (LES) have been identified primarily at global-scales, trait variation at the community scale is often interpreted in this context. Here we argue from several lines of evidence that a research priority should be to determine whether global-scale trait relationships hold at more local scales. We review recent literature assessing trait variation at smaller scales, and then present a case study exploring the relationship between the correlation strength of leaf traits and their similarity in variation structure across ecological scales. We find that the correlation strength between pairs of leaf traits does not predict whether the traits respond similarly to different drivers of variation. Instead, correlation strength only sets an upper bound to the dissimilarity in trait variation structure. With moderate correlation strengths, LES traits largely retain the ability to respond independently to different drivers of phenotypic variation at different scales. Recent literature and our results suggest that LES relationships may not hold at local scales. Clarifying under what conditions and at which scales the LES is consistently expressed is necessary for us to make the most of the emerging trait toolbox.

AB In most current farming system classifications (e.g. "conventional"versus "organic"), each type of farming system encompasses a wide variety of farming practices and performances. Classifying farming systems using concepts such as "ecological", "sustainable intensification"or "agro-ecology"is not satisfactory because the concepts "overlap in. definitions, principles and practices, thus creating. confusion in their meanings, interpretations and implications". Existing classifications most often focus either on biotechnical functioning or on socio-economic contexts of farming systems. We reviewed the literature to develop an original analytical framework of the diversity of farming systems and agriculture models that deal with these limits. To describe this framework, we first present the main differences between three biotechnical types of farming systems differing in the role of ecosystem services and external inputs: chemical input-, biological input-and biodiversity-based farming systems. Second, we describe four key socio-economic contexts which determine development and functioning of these farming systems: globalised commodity-based food systems, circular economies, alternative food systems and integrated landscape approaches. Third, we present our original analytical framework of agriculture models, defined as biotechnical types of farming systems associated with one or a combination of socio-economic contexts differing in the role of relationships based on global market prices and "territorial embeddedness". We demonstrate the potential of this framework by describing six key agriculture models and reviewing key scientific issues in agronomy associated with each one. We then analyse the added value of our analytical framework and its generic character. Lastly, we discuss transversal research issues of the agriculture models, concerning the technologies required, their function in the bioeconomy, their multi-criteria and multi-level assessments, their co-existence and the transitions between them.

AB Context Although there is a need to develop a spatially explicit methodological approach that addresses the social importance of cultural ecosystem services for regional planning, few studies have analysed the spatial distribution on the cultural ecosystem services based on social perceptions.
   Objective The main objective of this study was to identify cultural ecosystem service hot-spots, and factors that characterize such hot-spots and define the spatial associations between cultural ecosystem services in Southern Patagonia (Argentina).
   Methods The study was carried out in Southern Patagonia (243.9 thousand km 2) located between 46 degrees and 55 degrees SL with the Andes mountains on the western fringe and the Atlantic Ocean on the eastern fringe of the study area. The study region has a range of different vegetation types (grasslands, shrub-lands, peat-lands and forests) though the cold arid steppe is the main vegetation type. We used geo-tagged digital images that local people and visitors posted in the Panoramio web platform to identify hot-spots of four cultural ecosystem services (aesthetic value, existence value, recreation and local identity) and relate these hot-spots with social and biophysical landscape features.
   Results Aesthetic value was the main cultural service tagged by people, followed by the existence value for biodiversity conservation, followed by local identity and then recreational activity. The spatial distribution of these cultural ecosystem services are associated with different social and biophysical characteristics, such as the presence of water bodies, vegetation types, marine and terrestrial fauna, protected areas, urbanization, accessibility and tourism offer. The most important factors are the presence of water in Santa Cruz and tourism offer in Tierra del Fuego.
   Conclusions Our results demonstrate that this methodology is useful for assessing cultural ecosystem services at the regional scale, especially in areas with low data availability and field accessibility, such as Southern Patagonia. We also identify new research challenges that can be addressed in cultural ecosystem services research through the use of this method.

AB Biological invasions as drivers of biodiversity loss have recently been challenged. Fundamentally, we must know where species that are threatened by invasive alien species (IAS) live, and the degree to which they are threatened. We report the first study linking 1372 vertebrates threatened by more than 200 IAS from the completely revised Global Invasive Species Database. New maps of the vulnerability of threatened vertebrates to IAS permit assessments of whether IAS have a major influence on biodiversity, and if so, which taxonomic groups are threatened and where they are threatened. We found that centres of IAS-threatened vertebrates are concentrated in the Americas, India, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. The areas in which IAS-threatened species are located do not fully match the current hotspots of invasions, or the current hotspots of threatened species. The relative importance of biological invasions as drivers of biodiversity loss clearly varies across regions and taxa, and changes over time, with mammals from India, Indonesia, Australia and Europe are increasingly being threatened by IAS. The chytrid fungus primarily threatens amphibians, whereas invasive mammals primarily threaten other vertebrates. The differences in IAS threats between regions and taxa can help efficiently target IAS, which is essential for achieving the Strategic Plan 2020 of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

AB Understanding the causes and consequences of land use and land cover change in drylands is crucial for global sustainability. Inner Mongolia consists of arid and semiarid ecosystems of global importance.
   Our main goal was twofold: to review the patterns and drivers of land use and land cover change in Inner Mongolia, and to discuss ecological impacts and strategies for promoting landscape and regional sustainability.
   We took an interdisciplinary and retrospective approach, based on historical records and remote sensing data.
   Inner Mongolia has evolved from an ocean to a forested region and then to a dryland area in the past millions of years. As a cradle of Chinese civilization, Inner Mongolia has experienced a series of land transitions from localized primitive agriculture that occurred in prehistoric times to broad-scale nomadic pastoralism that lasted for a few 1000 years, and to sedentary pastoralism with increasing agriculture and urbanization since the 1960s. The general land use pattern has long been shaped by the interactions between nomadic pastoralism and agrarian culture. The major drivers of land use and land cover change include: climate, demography, socioeconomic structures, institutional changes, and technological innovations.
   The landscapes of Inner Mongolia have evolved historically through several phases, and the profound and unsustainable landscape transformations during the past 50 years have been driven primarily by land use policies. Strategies based on landscape sustainability science are needed to curb ecosystem degradation and promote sustainability in the region.

AB This review presents a framework for evaluating how cells, tissues, organs, and whole plants perform both hydraulic and mechanical functions. The morphological alterations that affect dual functionality are varied: individual cells can have altered morphology; tissues can have altered partitioning to functions or altered cell alignment; and organs and whole plants can differ in their allocation to different tissues, or in the geometric distribution of the tissues they have. A hierarchical model emphasizes that morphological traits influence the hydraulic or mechanical properties; the properties, combined with the plant unit's environment, then influence the performance of that plant unit. As a special case, we discuss the mechanisms by which the proxy property wood density has strong correlations to performance but without direct causality. Traits and properties influence multiple aspects of performance, and there can be mutual compensations such that similar performance occurs. This compensation emphasizes that natural selection acts on, and a plant's viability is determined by, its performance, rather than its contributing traits and properties. Continued research on the relationships among traits, and on their effects on multiple aspects of performance, will help us better predict, manage, and select plant material for success under multiple stresses in the future.

AB By changing the chemical composition of foliage, the increase in atmospheric CO2 is fundamentally altering insect herbivory. The responses of folivorous insects to these changes is, however, highly variable. In this review we highlight emerging mechanisms by which increasing CO2 alters the defense chemistry and signaling of plants. The response of allelochemicals affecting insect performance varies under elevated CO2, and results suggest this is driven by changes in plant hormones. Increasing CO2 suppresses the production of jasmonates and ethylene and increases the production of salicylic acid, and these differential responses of plant hormones affect specific secondary chemical pathways. In addition to changes in secondary chemistry, elevated CO2 decreases rates of water loss from leaves, increases temperature and feeding rates, and alters nutritional content. New insights into the mechanistic responses of secondary chemistry to elevated CO2 increase our ability to predict the ecological and evolutionary responses of plants attacked by insects.

AB P>1. Methods that assess patterns of phylogenetic relatedness, as well as character distribution and evolution, allow one to infer the ecological processes involved in community assembly. Assuming niche conservatism, assemblages should shift from phylogenetic clustering to evenness with decreasing geographic scale because the relative importance of mechanisms that shape assemblages is hypothesized to be scale-dependent. Whereas habitat filtering is more likely to act at regional scales because of increased habitat heterogeneity that allows sorting of ecologically similar species in contrasting environments, competition is more likely to act at local scales because low habitat heterogeneity provides few opportunities for niche partitioning.
   2. We used species lists to assess assemblage composition, data on ecologically-relevant traits, and a molecular phylogeny, to examine the phylogenetic structure of antbird (Thamnophilidae) assemblages at three different geographical scales: regional (ecoregions), intermediate (100-ha plots) and local (mixed-flocks). In addition, we used patterns of phylogenetic beta diversity and beta diversity to separate the factors that structure antbird assemblages at regional scales.
   3. Contrary to previous findings, we found a shift from phylogenetic evenness to clustering with decreasing geographical scale. We argue that this does not reject the hypothesis that habitat filtering is the predominant force in regional community assembly, because analyses of trait evolution and structure indicated a lack of niche conservatism in antbirds.
   4. In some cases, phylogenetic evenness at regional scales can be an effect of historical biogeographic processes instead of niche-based processes. However, regional patterns of beta diversity and phylogenetic beta diversity suggested that phylogenetic structure in our study cannot be explained by the history of speciation and dispersal of antbirds, further supporting the habitat-filtering hypothesis.
   5. Our analyses suggested that competitive interactions might not play an important role locally, which would provide a plausible explanation for the high alpha diversity of antbirds in Amazonia.
   6. Finally, we emphasize the importance of including trait information in studies of phylogenetic community structure to adequately assess the mechanisms that determine species co-existence.

AB Resources are produced in pulses in many terrestrial environments, and have important effects on the population dynamics and assemblage structure of animals that consume them. Resource-pulsing is particularly dramatic in Australian desert environments owing to marked spatial and temporal variability in rainfall, and thus primary productivity. Here, we first review how Australia's desert mammals respond to fluctuations in resource production, and evaluate the merits of three currently accepted models (the ecological refuge, predator refuge and fire-mosaic models) as explanations of the observed dynamics. We then integrate elements of these models into a novel state-and-transition model and apply it to well-studied small mammal assemblages that inhabit the vast hummock grassland, or spinifex, landscapes of the continental inland. The model has four states that are defined by differences in species composition and abundance, and eight transitions or processes that prompt shifts from one state to another. Using this model as a template, we construct three further models to explain mammalian dynamics in cracking soil habitats of the Lake Eyre Basin, gibber plains of the Channel Country, and the chenopod shrublands of arid southern Australia. As non-equilibrium concepts that recognise the strongly intermittent nature of resource pulsing in arid Australia, state-and-transition models provide useful descriptors of both spatial and temporal patterns in mammal assemblages. The models should help managers to identify when and where to implement interventions to conserve native mammals, such as control burns, reduced grazing or predator management. The models also should improve understanding of the potential effects of future climate change on mammal assemblages in arid environments in general. We conclude by proposing several tests that could be used to refine the models and guide further research.

AB For more than 10 years, ecologists have been discussing the concept of ecosystem engineering (i.e., nontrophic interactions of an organism that alters the physical state of its environment and affects other species). In conservation biology, the functional role of species is of interest because persistence of some species may be necessary for maintaining an entire assemblage with many threatened species. The great capricorn (Cerambyx cerdo), an endangered beetle listed in the European Union's Habitats Directive, has suffered a dramatic decline in the number of populations and in population sizes in Central Europe over the last century. The damage caused by C. cerdo larvae on sound oak trees has considerable effects on the physiological characteristics of these trees. We investigated the impacts of these effects on the species richness and heterogeneity of the saproxylic beetle assemblage on oaks. We compared the catches made with flight interception traps on 10 oaks colonized and 10 oaks uncolonized by C. cerdo in a study area in Lower Saxony (Germany). Our results revealed a significantly more species-rich assemblage on the trees colonized by C. cerdo. Colonized trees also harbored more red-listed beetle species. Our results suggest that an endangered beetle species can alter its own habitat to create favorable habitat conditions for other threatened beetle species. Efforts to preserve C. cerdo therefore have a positive effect on an entire assemblage of insects, including other highly endangered species. On the basis of the impact C. cerdo seems to have on the saproxylic beetle assemblage, reintroductions might be considered in regions where the species has become extinct.

AB Saproxylic insects are characterised by their exceptional diversity and high proportion of threatened species. No recent studies have demonstrated the validity of habitat suitability analysis for scientifically based habitat management for these species. We studied the habitat requirements of the endangered longhorn beetle Cerambyx cerdo, a species with a supposed keystone function for the saproxylic insect community living on oaks. We used species distribution modelling based on datasets from Central Europe to understand the species-habitat relationships and to find the environmental variables responsible for habitat selection of C. cerdo. Our results show that the most important parameters, insolation, presence of oak sap, bark depth and the distance from the next colonised tree, are able to predict the presence of C. cerdo very well. A spatial validation procedure revealed very similar predictive power, indicating the general validity of our model. Tree-level parameters were shown to have a stronger effect on the occurrence probability than landscape-level predictors. To improve the tree-level conditions (e.g. insolation on the trunk) habitat management in the form of semi-open pasture landscapes is recommended from which many other taxa will also draw considerable benefit. The provision of such conditions over decades is the essential key in the conservation of this longhorn beetle species. The success of the European network of conservation areas "Natura 2000" heavily depends on broad biological knowledge of the designated protected species. The present paper shows that species distribution models can give valuable contributions for conservation in saproxylic insects. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The phylogenetic relationships amongbaleen whales (Order: Cetacea) remain uncertain despite extensive research in cetacean molecular phylogenetics and a potential morphological sample size of over 2 million animals harvested. Questions remain regarding the number of species and the monophyly of genera, as well as higher order relationships. Here, we approach mysticete phylogeny with complete mitochondrial genome sequence analysis. We determined complete mtDNA sequences of 10 extant Mysticeti species, inferred their phylogenetic relationships, and estimated node divergence times. The mtDNA sequence analysis concurs with previous molecular studies in the ordering of the principal branches, with Balaenidae (right whales) as sister to all other mysticetes base, followed by Neobalaenidae (pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (gray whale), and finally Balaenopteridae (rorquals + humpback whale). The mtDNA analysis further suggests that four lineages exist within the clade of Eschrichtiidae + Balaenopteridae, including a sister relationship between the humpback and fin whales, and a monophyletic group formed by the blue, sei, and Brycle's whales, each of which represents a newly recognized phylogenetic relationship in Mysticeti. We also estimated the divergence times of all extant mysticete species, accounting for evolutionary rate heterogeneity among lineages. When the mtDNA divergence estimates are compared with the mysticete fossil record, several lineages have molecular divergence estimates strikingly older than indicated by paleontological data. We suggest this discrepancy reflects both a large amount of ancestral polymorphism and long generation times of ancestral baleen whale populations.

TI Long branch attraction, taxon sampling, and the earliest angiosperms:

AB Background: Numerous studies, using in aggregate some 28 genes, have achieved a consensus in recognizing three groups of plants, including Amborella, as comprising the basal-most grade of all other angiosperms. A major exception is the recent study by Goremykin et al. ( 2003; Mol. Biol. Evol. 20: 1499 1505), whose analyses of 61 genes from 13 sequenced chloroplast genomes of land plants nearly always found 100% support for monocots as the deepest angiosperms relative to Amborella, Calycanthus, and eudicots. We hypothesized that this conflict reflects a misrooting of angiosperms resulting from inadequate taxon sampling, inappropriate phylogenetic methodology, and rapid evolution in the grass lineage used to represent monocots.
   Results: We used two main approaches to test this hypothesis. First, we sequenced a large number of chloroplast genes from the monocot Acorus and added these plus previously sequenced Acorus genes to the Goremykin et al. ( 2003) dataset in order to explore the effects of altered monocot sampling under the same analytical conditions used in their study. With Acorus alone representing monocots, strongly supported Amborella-sister trees were obtained in all maximum likelihood and parsimony analyses, and in some distance-based analyses. Trees with both Acorus and grasses gave either a well-supported Amborellasister topology or else a highly unlikely topology with 100% support for grasses-sister and paraphyly of monocots (i.e., Acorus sister to "dicots" rather than to grasses). Second, we reanalyzed the Goremykin et al. ( 2003) dataset focusing on methods designed to account for rate heterogeneity. These analyses supported an Amborella-sister hypothesis, with bootstrap support values often conflicting strongly with cognate analyses performed without allowing for rate heterogeneity. In addition, we carried out a limited set of analyses that included the chloroplast genome of Nymphaea, whose position as a basal angiosperm was also, and very recently, challenged.
   Conclusions: These analyses show that Amborella ( or Amborella plus Nymphaea), but not monocots, is the sister group of all other angiosperms among this limited set of taxa and that the grasses-sister topology is a long-branch-attraction artifact leading to incorrect rooting of angiosperms. These results highlight the danger of having lots of characters but too few and, especially, molecularly divergent taxa, a situation long recognized as potentially producing strongly misleading molecular trees. They also emphasize the importance in phylogenetic analysis of using appropriate evolutionary models.

AB 1. Understanding the spatial structure of populations is important in developing effective management strategies for feral and invasive species, such as feral pigs Sus scrofa. World-wide, feral pigs can act as 'triple threat' pests, impacting upon biodiversity, agricultural production and public health; in Australia they are a significant vertebrate pest. We utilized a molecular approach to investigate the structure of populations of feral pigs in south-western Australia. These approaches have been underutilized in pest management.
   2. Using 14 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers from 276 adult pigs, we identified eight inferred (K = 8) pig populations that would be difficult to define with standard ecological techniques. All populations had moderate heterozygosity (HE = 0.680) and moderate to high levels of differentiation (F-ST = 0.118; R-ST = 0.132) between populations.
   3. The molecular approach identified feral pig groups that appeared to be acting as a source for reinvasion following control operations. It also identified populations where current control measures were less successful in reducing 'effective population size'. Additionally, the data indicated that dispersal rates between, but not within, the inferred feral pig populations were relatively low.
   4. The potential for the spread of directly transmitted wildlife diseases between the pig populations studied was low. However, under some circumstances, such as within major river catchments, the role of feral pigs in the transmission of endemic or exotic diseases is likely to be high.
   5. Synthesis and applications. A molecular-based approach allowed us to determine the genetic structure and dispersal patterns of a cryptic, destructive and invasive vertebrate pest. Our results indicated that the feral pig populations studied were unlikely to be acting as closed populations and, importantly, it identified where movement between groups was likely to occur. This should lead to more informed decisions for managing the potential risk posed by feral species, such as pigs, in the transmission of wildlife diseases. The suggested technique could help in understanding the dynamics of many other free-ranging pest animal populations.

AB Trypanosoma cruzi is thought to undergo predominant clonal evolution, as determined by population genetics studies. However, this model does not exclude occasional recombination, which existence is strongly suggested by several recent studies. We sequenced a portion of the maxicircle cytochrome b (CYb) gene and of the nuclear rRNA promoter region from representative strains of six T. cruzi genetic lineages isolated from anthroponotic environments and man (lineages IIb, IId and IIe), sylvatic environments (lineages IIa and IIc) or both (lineage I). Phylogenetic analyses based on the two genes were incongruent. Remarkably, in lineage IIe, CYb and rRNA sequences were very closely related to those of lineages IIc and IIb, respectively. One stock of lineage IId showed rRNA sequence heterogeneity, with both IIb-like and IIc-like copies. Analysis of the size variation of six distinct pairs of putative homologous chromosomes revealed a bimodal distribution of chromosomal sizes across T. cruzi. Notably, stocks of lineages IId and IIe had several chromosomal pairs distributed in distinct modes, with the corresponding modes individually found in lineages IIb and IIc. Together, these data indicate the origin of lineages IId and IIe by hybridization between representatives of lineages IIb and IIc. CYb and rRNA sequences clustered into three and four major lineages, respectively. Data were in agreement with the distinction of six genetic lineages, but not with their proposed grouping into two primary lineages, as lineage II was not monophyletic. Based on a CYb substitution rate of 1% per million years (Myr), the major lineages are estimated to have diverged around 10 million years ago. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Phylogenetic relationships between 32 species of rodents representing 14 subfamilies of Muridae and four subfamilies of Dipodidae were studied using sequences of the nuclear protein-coding genes Lecithin Cholesterol Acyl Transferase (LCAT) and von Willebrand Factor (vWF). An examination of some evolutionary properties of each data matrix indicates that the two genes are rather complementary, with lower rates of nonsynonymous substitutions for LCAT. Both markers exhibit a wide range of GC3 percentages (55%-89%), with several taxa above 70% GC3 for vWF, which indicates that those exonic regions might belong to the richest class of isochores. The primary sequence data apparently harbor few saturations, except for transitions on third codon positions for vWF, as indicated by comparisons of observed and expected pairwise values of substitutions. Phylogenetic trees based on 1,962 nucleotidic sites from the two genes indicate that the 14 Muridae subfamilies are organized into five major lineages. An early isolation leads to the clade uniting the fossorial Spalacinae and semifossorial Rhizomyinae with a strong robustness. The second lineage includes a series of African taxa representing nesomyines, dendromurines, cricetomyines, and the sole living member of mystromyines. The third one comprises only the mouselike hamster Calomyscus. The fourth clade represents the cricetines, myospalacines, sigmodontines, and arvicolines, whereas the fifth one comprises four "traditional" subfamilies (Gerbillinae, Murinae, Otomyinae, and Acomyinae). Within these groups, we confirm the monophyly of almost all studied subfamilies, namely, Spalacinae, Rhizomyinae, Nesomyinae, Cricetomyinae, Arvicolinae, Sigmodontinae, Cricetinae, Gerbillinae, Acomyinae, and Murinae. Finally, we present evidence that the sister group of Acomyinae is Gerbillinae, and we confirm a nested position of Myospalacinae within Cricetinae and Otomyinae within Murinae. From a biogeographical point of view, the five main lineages spread and radiated from Asia with different degrees of success: the first three groups are now represented by a limited number of species and genera localized in some regions, whereas the last two groups radiated in a large variety of species and genera dispersed all over the world.

AB The influence of ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity on plant performance was investigated by establishing a gradient of ectomycorrhizal diversity on Betula populifolia (grey birch) seedlings.
   We measured growth, as well as N and P uptake, of individual B. populifolia seedlings inoculated with replicate one, two and four species 'communities' of ectomycorrhizal fungi simultaneously and without mycorrhizas in axenic culture.
   Colonization of B. populifolia by individual species of ectomycorrhizal fungi decreased with increasing fungal diversity although total colonization increased. Shoot biomass decreased with increasing ectomycorrhizal diversity and mycorrhizal root biomass increased. Plant biomass did not differ with individual mycorrhizal species or composition. Shoot N concentration showed a small increase with increasing ectomycorrhizal diversity. Whole plant P content and concentration increased across the ectomycorrhizal diversity gradient. Despite higher mycorrhizal colonization rates with increasing fungal diversity, plant growth and nutrient responses were best explained by changes in ectomycorrhizal diversity.
   Greater ectomycorrhizal diversity per se, rather than colonization or composition, increased mycorrhizal root biomass at the expense of shoot biomass and increased P uptake of B. populifolia seedlings.

AB Recent experience with molecular phylogeny has shown that all molecular markers have strengths and weaknesses. Nonetheless, despite several notable discrepancies with phylogenies obtained from protein data, the merits of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) as a molecular phylogenetic marker remain indisputable. Over the last 10 to 15 years a massive SSU rRNA database has been gathered, including more then 3000 complete sequences from eukaryotes. This creates a huge computational challenge, which is exacerbated by phenomena such as extensive rate variation among sites in the molecule. A few years ago, a fast phylogenetic method was developed that takes into account among-site rate variation in the estimation of evolutionary distances. This "substitution rate calibration" (SRC) method not only corrects for a major source of artifacts in phylogeny reconstruction but, because it is based on a distance approach, allows comprehensive trees including thousands of sequences to be constructed in a reasonable amount of time. In this study, a nucleotide variability map and a phylogenetic tree were constructed, using the SRC method, based on all available (January 2000) complete SSU rRNA sequences (2551) for species belonging to the so-called eukaryotic crown. The resulting phylogeny constitutes the most complete description of overall eukaryote diversity and relationships to date. Furthermore, branch lengths estimated with the SRC method better reflect the huge differences in evolutionary rates among and within eukaryotic lineages. The ribosomal RNA tree is compared with a recent protein phylogeny obtained from concatenated actin, alpha -tubulin, beta -tubulin, and elongation factor 1-alpha amino acid sequences. A consensus phylogeny of the eukaryotic crown based on currently available molecular data is discussed, as well as specific problems encountered in analyzing sequences when large differences in substitution rate are present, either between different sequences (rate variation among lineages) or between different positions within the same sequence (among-site rate variation).

AB Conservative genetics has expanded its purview such that molecular techniques are now used routinely to prioritize populations for listing and protection and infer their historical relationships in addition to addressing more traditional questions of heterozygosity and inbreeding depression. Failure to specify whether molecular data are being used for diagnosis-related questions or for population viability questions, however can lead either to misinterpretation of character data as adaptive information or to misinterpretation of frequency or distance data as diagnostic or historical information. Each of these misinterpretations will confound conservation programs. The character-based approach to delimiting phylogenetic species is both operationally and logically superior to "diagnostic" methods that involve distance- or frequency-based routines, which are unstable over time. Tree-based criteria for the diagnosis of conservation "units" are also inappropriate because they can depend on patterns inferred without reference to diagnostic characters. Intraspecific studies, conservation-related or otherwise, that adopt terminology and methods designed to infer nested hierarchic relationships confuse diagnosis with historical inferences by treating diagnosis as outcomes rather than as precursors to phylogeny reconstruction. A character-based diagnostic approach recognizes the analytical dichotomy between species hierarchies and population statistics and provided a framework for the understanding of each. No species concept, however, should be viewed as an absolute criterion for protecting populations, but as part of a framework from within which identification of protection and management goals can be achieved effectively and defensibly.

AB Models have been formulated for monospecific stands in which canopy photosynthesis is determined by the vertical distribution of leaf area, nitrogen and light. In such stands, resident plants can maximize canopy photosynthesis by distributing their nitrogen parallel to the light gradient, with high contents per unit leaf area at the top of the vegetation and low contents at the bottom. Using principles from game theory, we expanded these models by introducing a second species into the vegetation, with the same vertical distribution of biomass and nitrogen as the resident plants but with the ability to adjust its specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area:leaf mass). The rule of the game is that invaders replace the resident plants if they have a higher plant carbon gain than those of the resident plants. We showed that such invaders induce major changes in the vegetation. By increasing their SLA, invading plants could increase their light interception as well as their photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE, the rate of photosynthesis per unit organic nitrogen). By comparison with stands in which canopy photosynthesis is maximized, those invaded by species of high SLA have the following characteristics: (1) the leaf area index is higher; (2) the vertical distribution of nitrogen is skewed less; (3) as a result of the supra-optimal leaf area index and the more uniform distribution of nitrogen, total canopy photosynthesis is lower. Thus, in dense canopies we face a classical tragedy of the commons: plants that have a strategy to maximize canopy carbon gain cannot compete with those that maximize their own carbon gain. However, because of this strategy, individual as well as total canopy carbon gain are eventually lower. We showed that it is an evolutionarily stable strategy to increase SLA up to the point where the PNUE of each leaf is maximized.

AB In this review, studies in plant nutrition are-classified according to their time scales and micro-or macroscopic level of approach. Short-time scale studies are mostly dealt by plant physiologists with the prospect of building mechanistic models. They describe elementary plant functions implicated in, or dependent on ion uptake, with the goal of explaining the mechanisms underneath the functions. The concept of 'active ion transport' across the root plasma membrane derives from precise analyses of uptake 'isotherms' describing nutrition as a function of ion concentration in the root medium. Attempts to introduce feedback mechanisms, as required to model whole-plant response to the environment, are reviewed. Similarly, the response of plant photosynthetic capacity to leaf nitrogen status is extremely rapid and the role of nitrogen in regulating photosynthesis seems to hold for a large number of species. Therefore, it appears possible to introduce nitrogen regulation on leaf photosynthesis, thus allowing better simulations of plant growth under nitrogen limiting conditions. Long-time scale studies are dealt by agronomists and have long been the basis of fertilization advice. They attempt to predict crops' mineral nutrient requirements over the entire cycle from the empirical knowledge of 'general laws' governing crop growth. Recent advances propose to manage nutrition on the basis of crop structure independently from species and give opportunities to develop mechanistic concepts at this time scale. For nitrogen, this has been formalized extensively in crops such as cereals and grasses. It deserves to be carefully looked at for horticultural crops. These models also provide a sound basis to diagnosis through plant analysis. In horticultural agrosystems, such as those found for hydroponic cultures under commercial glasshouses, the use of on-line sensors is currently an alternative to crop models, since fertilization is induced by the immediate response of the sensors. This practice made possible by technological breakthrough is meant to correct drifts but lacks anticipation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Density, biomass and productivity of animals >0.5 mm were estimated in 4 shallow subtidal rocky reef habitats in temperate northeastern New Zealand. The main objective was to determine the relative contributions of mobile epifauna (0.5-10 mm) and megafauna (>10 mm) to the flux of materials on the reef. The habitats surveyed were (1) Carpophyllum plumosum var. capillifolium forest (Phaeophyceae: Fucales), (2) Ecklonia radiata forest (Phaeophyceae: Laminariales), (3) urchin barrens, and (4) articulated coralline algal turf flats. Epifauna comprised >99.5% of individuals in each habitat. Epifauna dominated biomass (>86%) in the finely structured Carpophyllum forest and turf flats, where they contributed >97% of total secondary productivity. Although lower in the other 2 habitats, the epifaunal contribution to total secondary productivity was still similar to 78% on the scale of the entire reef. These results show that epifauna are major contributors to the flux of materials in rocky reef habitats, and should therefore be included in trophic models of these systems. Consumption by fish could only account for similar to 26% of epifaunal production, with the fate of the remainder unknown. Estimated annual secondary productivity within the Carpophyllum forest and turf flats habitats (100 to 115 g AFDW m(-2) yr(-1)) was higher than Literature values for a range of soft sediment habitats, and was exceeded only by 2 other hard-bottom communities.

AB Hutchinson's n-dimensional hypervolume concept for the interpretation of niches as geometric shapes has provided a foundation for research across different fields of ecology and evolution. There is now an expanding set of applications for hypervolume concepts, as well as a growing set of statistical methods available to operationalize this concept with data. The concept has been applied to environmental, resource, functional trait, and morphometric axes and to different scales, i.e. from individuals, species, to communities and clades. Further, these shapes have been variously interpreted as niches, ecological or evolutionary strategy spaces, or proxies for community structure. This paper highlights these applications' shared mathematical framework, surveys uses of the hypervolume concept across fields, discusses key limitations and assumptions of hypervolume concepts in general, provides a critical guide to available statistical estimation methods, and delineates the situations where hypervolume concepts can be useful.

AB Bushfires are one of the most frequent natural hazards experienced in Australia. Fires play an important role in shaping the landscape and its ecological dynamics, but may also have devastating effects that cause human injuries and fatalities, as well as broad-scale environmental damage. While there has been considerable effort to quantify changes in the occurrence of bushfire in Australia, a comprehensive assessment of the most extreme bushfire cases, which exact the greatest economic and environmental impacts, is lacking. In this paper we reflect upon recently developed understanding of bushfire dynamics to consider (i) historical changes in the occurrence of extreme bushfires, and (ii) the potential for increasing frequency in the future under climate change projections. The science of extreme bushfires is still a developing area, thus our conclusions about emerging patterns in their occurrence should be considered tentative. Nonetheless, historical information on noteworthy bushfire events suggests an increased occurrence in recent decades. Based on our best current understanding of how extreme bushfires develop, there is strong potential for them to increase in frequency in the future. As such there is a pressing need for a greater understanding of these powerful and often destructive phenomena.

AB Many studies have investigated patterns in the near-surface soil microbial community over large spatial scales. However, less is known about variation in subsurface (15-30 cm of depth) microbial communities. Here we studied depth profiles of microbial communities in high-elevation soils from Tibet. The relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi and Alphaproteobacteria was higher in near-surface layers, while the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes and Betaproteobacteria was higher in the subsurface samples. The microbial community structure was distinct between the surface and subsurface soil layers, strongly correlating with variation in total carbon (TC) and carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N). The differences in the microbial community between the layers were about the same as the horizontal differences between sites separated by many kilometers. Overall, we found that TC and C/N were the best predictors for both surface and subsurface microbial community distribution. Exploration of the relative contribution of distance and environmental variables to community composition suggests that the contemporary environment is the primary driver of microbial distribution in this region. Reflecting niche conservatism in evolution, the microbial communities in each soil site and layer tended to be more phylogenetically clustered than expected by chance, and surface soil layer samples were more likely to be clustered than subsurface samples.

AB Soil organisms are considered drivers of soil ecosystem services (primary productivity, nutrient cycling, carbon cycling, water regulation) associated with sustainable agricultural production. Soil biodiversity was highlighted in the soil thematic strategy as a key component of soil quality. The lack of quantitative standardised data at a large scale has resulted in poor understanding of how soil biodiversity could be incorporated into legislation for the protection of soil quality. In 2011, the EcoFINDERS (FP7) project sampled 76 sites across 11 European countries, covering five biogeographical zones (Alpine, Atlantic, Boreal, Continental and Mediterranean) and three land-uses (arable, grass, forestry). Samples collected from across these sites ranged in soil properties; soil organic carbon (SOC), pH and texture. To assess the range in biodiversity and ecosystem function across the sites, fourteen biological methods were applied as proxy indicators for these functions. These methods measured the following: microbial diversity: DNA yields (molecular biomass), archaea, bacteria, total fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; micro fauna diversity: nematode trophic groups; meso fauna diversity: enchytraeids and Collembola species; microbial function: nitrification, extracellular enzymes, multiple substrate induced respiration, community level physiological profiling and ammonia oxidiser/nitrification functional genes. Network analysis was used to identify the key connections between organisms under the different land use scenarios. Highest network density was found in forest soils and lowest density occurred in arable soils. Key taxomonic units (TUs) were identified in each land-use type and in relation to SOC and pH categorisations. Top-connected taxonomic units (i.e. displaying the most co-occurrence to other TUs) were identified for each land use type. In arable sites this was dominated by bacteria and fungi, while in grassland sites bacteria and fungi were most connected. In forest soils archaeal, enchytraeid and fungal TUs displayed the largest number of neighbours, reflecting the greatest connectivity. Multiple regression models were applied to assess the potential contribution of soil organisms to carbon cycling and storage and nutrient cycling of specifically nitrogen and phosphorus. Key drivers of carbon cycling were microbial biomass, basal respiration and fungal richness; these three measures have often been associated with carbon cycling in soils. Regression models of nutrient cycling were dependent on the model applied, showing variation in biological indicators. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Assessments and sustainable management of ecosystem services (ES) require an understanding of both ES supply and demand qualities, quantities, spatial scales and dynamics. Mismatches, i.e., differences in quality or quantity between the supply and demand of ES, can occur in many different forms. Being able to identify these mismatches and their nature is of prime importance for informing governance and management decisions. This manuscript explores which mismatches can be detected by current ES supply and demand assessments and which mismatches currently remain unidentified.
   An analytic framework was developed comprised of five interlinked components of ES supply and demand linking nature and society (i.e., potential supply, managed supply, match, demand, and interests). This framework was used to examine 11 recent papers, which applied ES assessments to both ES supply and demand, to determine which mismatches were or could be identified and which mismatches remained unidentified.
   The selected papers typically used multiple methods in their assessments to capture supply and demand components. The found diversity in methods and the inclusion of temporal and spatial dimensions, and the existence of multiple stakeholder groups allowed for the assessments to identify several mismatches, but also lead to differences in the discriminative capacity of the assessments between the selected papers. The mismatch that was most often included in the assessments was Unsatisfied demand, whereas the least included mismatch was Unsustainable uptake. The mismatches caused by differing spatial patterns were most often identified, whereas the existence of mismatches among different stakeholder groups was least often detected in the assessment methods.
   Three options emerged that could further strengthen the discriminative capacity of ES supply and demand assessments to inform sustainable ES governance and management decisions: (i) include multiple stakeholders groups and the diversification of their roles and demands; (ii) acknowledge that ES supply is not only determined by the bio-geophysical conditions, but also determined by the ES demand by society, in terms of their quantity, quality and location, as well as by the applied management; (iii) include temporal and spatial scale sensitivity into the discriminative capacity of assessment methods to allow for a better identification which institutional structures could most effectively act upon them.

AB We used a functional trait-based approach to assess the impacts of aridity and shrub encroachment on the functional structure of Mediterranean dryland communities (functional diversity (FD) and community-weighted mean trait values (CWM)), and to evaluate how these functional attributes ultimately affect multifunctionality (i.e. the provision of several ecosystem functions simultaneously). Shrub encroachment (the increase in the abundance/cover of shrubs) is a major land cover change that is taking place in grasslands worldwide. Studies conducted on drylands have reported positive or negative impacts of shrub encroachment depending on the functions and the traits of the sprouting or nonsprouting shrub species considered. FD and CWM were equally important as drivers of multifunctionality responses to both aridity and shrub encroachment. Size traits (e.g. vegetative height or lateral spread) and leaf traits (e.g. specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content) captured the effect of shrub encroachment on multifunctionality with a relative high accuracy (r(2)=0.63). FD also improved the resistance of multifunctionality along the aridity gradient studied. Maintaining and enhancing FD in plant communities may help to buffer negative effects of ongoing global environmental change on dryland multifunctionality.

AB The mechanistic links between climate and the environmental sensitivities of organisms occur through the microclimatic conditions that organisms experience. Here we present a dataset of gridded hourly estimates of typical microclimatic conditions (air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, solar radiation, sky radiation and substrate temperatures from the surface to 1 m depth) at high resolution (similar to 15 km) for the globe. The estimates are for the middle day of each month, based on long-term average macroclimates, and include six shade levels and three generic substrates (soil, rock and sand) per pixel. These data are suitable for deriving biophysical estimates of the heat, water and activity budgets of terrestrial organisms.

AB Crop yields need to nearly double over the next 35 years to keep pace with projected population growth. Improving photosynthesis, via a range of genetic engineering strategies, has been identified as a promising target for crop improvement with regard to increased photosynthetic yield and better water-use efficiency (WUE). One approach is based on integrating components of the highly efficient CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) present in cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) into the chloroplasts of key C-3 crop plants, particularly wheat and rice. Four progressive phases towards engineering components of the cyanobacterial CCM into C-3 species can be envisaged. The first phase (1a), and simplest, is to consider the transplantation of cyanobacterial bicarbonate transporters to C-3 chloroplasts, by host genomic expression and chloroplast targeting, to raise CO2 levels in the chloroplast and provide a significant improvement in photosynthetic performance. Mathematical modelling indicates that improvements in photosynthesis as high as 28% could be achieved by introducing both of the single-gene, cyanobacterial bicarbonate transporters, known as BicA and SbtA, into C-3 plant chloroplasts. Part of the first phase (1b) includes the more challenging integration of a functional cyanobacterial carboxysome into the chloroplast by chloroplast genome transformation. The later three phases would be progressively more elaborate, taking longer to engineer other functional components of the cyanobacterial CCM into the chloroplast, and targeting photosynthetic and WUE efficiencies typical of C-4 photosynthesis. These later stages would include the addition of NDH-1-type CO2 pumps and suppression of carbonic anhydrase and C-3 Rubisco in the chloroplast stroma. We include a score card for assessing the success of physiological modifications gained in phase 1a.

AB Many studies have been conducted on ecosystem services and double counting is a frequent problem that causes uncertainty and poor reliability of estimating the value of ecosystem services. By referring to previous studies of ecosystem service valuation, our research has identified the basic causes of double counting. These include ambiguous definitions and inconsistent classifications of ecosystem services, poor understanding of ecosystem complexity, inadequate recognition of exclusiveness and complementarities of individual ecosystem services, spatio-temporal scale dependence of ecosystem services, and overlap and lack of cross-referencing between ecosystem service valuation methods. Measures for reducing double counting in ecosystem service valuation are proposed as follow: (1) identifying the spatio-temporal scales of ecosystem services; (2) valuing the final benefits obtained from ecosystem services; (3) establishing consistent classification systems for ecosystem services; and (4) selecting valuation methods appropriate for the study context.

AB The enormity and complexity of problems like environmental degradation and biodiversity loss have led to the development of indicator species and other surrogate approaches to track changes in environments and/or in biodiversity. Under these approaches particular species or groups of species are used as proxies for other biota, particular environmental conditions, or for environmental change. The indicator species approach contrasts with a direct measurement approach in which the focus is on a single entity or a highly targeted subset of entities in a given ecosystem but no surrogacy relationships with unmeasured entities are assumed. Here, we present a broad philosophical discussion of the indicator species and direct measurement approaches because their relative advantages and disadvantages are not well understood by many researchers, resource managers and policy makers. A goal of the direct measurement approach is to demonstrate a causal relationship between key attributes of the target ecosystem system (for example, particular environmental conditions) and the entities selected for measurement. The key steps in the approach are based on the fundamental scientific principles of hypothesis testing and associated direct measurement that drive research activities, management activities and monitoring programs. The direct measurement approach is based on four critical assumptions:(1) the 'right' entities to measure have been selected, (2) these entities are well known, (3) there is sufficient understanding about key ecological processes and (4) the entities selected can be accurately measured. The direct measurement approach is reductionist and many elements of the biota, many biotic processes and environmental factors must be ignored because of practical considerations. The steps in applying the indicator species approach are broadly similar to the direct measurement approach, except surrogacy relationships also must be quantified between a supposed indicator species or indicator group and the factors for which it is purported to be a proxy. Such quantification needs to occur via: (1) determining the taxonomic, spatial and temporal bounds for which a surrogacy relationship does and does not hold. That is, the extent of transferability of a given surrogate such as an indicator species to other biotic groups, to landscapes, ecosystems, environmental circumstances or over time in the same location can be determined; and (2) determining the ecological mechanisms underpinning a surrogacy relationship (for example, through fundamental studies of community structure). Very few studies have rigorously addressed these two tasks, despite the extremely widespread use of the indicator species approach and similar kinds of surrogate schemes in virtually all fields of environmental, resource and conservation management. We argue that this has the potential to create significant problems; thus, the use of an indicator species approach needs to be better justified. Attempts to quantify surrogacy relationships may reveal that, in some circumstances, the alternative of direct measurement of particular entities of environmental or conservation interest will be the best option.

AB The temperature dependence of soil respiration (R-S) is widely used as a key characteristic of soils or organic matter fractions within soils, and in the context of global climatic change is often applied to infer likely responses of R-S to warmer future conditions. However, the way in which these temperature dependencies are calculated, interpreted and implemented in ecosystem models requires careful consideration of possible artefacts and assumptions. We argue that more conceptual clarity in the reported relationships is needed to obtain meaningful meta-analyses and better constrained parameters informing ecosystem models. Our critical assessment of common methodologies shows that it is impossible to measure actual temperature response of R-S, and that a range of confounding effects creates the observed apparent temperature relations reported in the literature. Thus, any measureable temperature response function will likely fail to predict effects of climate change on R-S. For improving our understanding of R-S in changing environments we need a better integration of the relationships between substrate supply and the soil biota, and of their long-term responses to changes in abiotic soil conditions. This is best achieved by experiments combining isotopic techniques and ecosystem manipulations, which allow a disentangling of abiotic and biotic factors underlying the temperature response of soil CO2 efflux.

AB Attempts to gauge the biological impacts of climate change have typically focussed on the lower levels of organization (individuals to populations), rather than considering more complex multi-species systems, such as entire ecological networks (food webs, mutualistic and host-parasitoid networks). We evaluate the possibility that a few principal drivers underpin network-level responses to climate change, and that these drivers can be studied to develop a more coherent theoretical framework than is currently provided by phenomenological approaches. For instance, warming will elevate individual ectotherm metabolic rates, and direct and indirect effects of changes in atmospheric conditions are expected to alter the stoichiometry of interactions between primary consumers and basal resources; these effects are general and pervasive, and will permeate through the entire networks that they affect. In addition, changes in the density and viscosity of aqueous media could alter interactions among very small organisms and disrupt the pycnoclines that currently compartmentalize many aquatic networks in time and space. We identify a range of approaches and potential model systems that are particularly well suited to network-level studies within the context of climate change. We also highlight potentially fruitful areas of research with a view to improving our predictive power regarding climate change impacts on networks. We focus throughout on mechanistic approaches rooted in first principles that demonstrate potential for application across a wide range of taxa and systems.

AB P>1. Ecosystem services are the benefits humans obtain from ecosystems. The importance of research into ecosystem services has been widely recognized, and rapid progress is being made. However, the prevailing approach to quantifying ecosystem services is still based on static analyses and single services, ignoring system dynamics, uncertainty and feedbacks. This is not only partly due to a lack of mechanistic understanding of processes and a dearth of empirical data, but also due to a failure to engage fully with the interdisciplinarity of the problem.
   2. We argue that there is a tendency to ignore the feedbacks between and within both social and ecological systems, and a lack of explicit consideration of uncertainty. Metrics need to be developed that can predict thresholds, which requires strong linkages to underlying processes, while the development of policy for management of ecosystem services needs to be based on a broader understanding of value and drivers of human well-being.
   3. We highlight the complexities, gaps in current knowledge and research, and the potentially promising avenues for future investigation in four priority research areas: agendas, processes, metrics and uncertainty.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The research interest in the field of ecosystem services is rapidly expanding, and can contribute significantly to the sustainable management of natural resources. However, a narrow disciplinary approach, or an approach which does not consider feedbacks within and between ecological and social systems, has the potential to produce dangerously misleading policy recommendations. In contrast, if we explicitly acknowledge and address uncertainties and complexities in the provision of ecosystem services, progress may appear slower but our models will be substantially more robust and informative about the effects of environmental change.

AB Climate-change effects on rivers and streams might interact with other pressures, such as pollution, but long-term investigations are scarce. We assessed trends among macroinvertebrates in 50 southern English streams in relation to temperature, discharge and water quality over 18 years (1989-2007).
   Long-term records, coupled with estimates from inter-site calibrations of 3-4 years, showed that mean stream temperatures in the study area had increased by 2.1-2.9 degrees C in winter and 1.1-1.5 degrees C in summer over the 26 year period from 1980 to 2006, with trends in winter strongest.
   While invertebrate assemblages in surface-fed streams were constant, those in chalk-streams changed significantly during 1989-2007. Invertebrate trends correlated significantly with temperature, but effects were spurious because (i) assemblages gained taxa typical of faster flow or well-oxygenated conditions, contrary to expectations from warming; (ii) more invertebrate families increased in abundance than declined and (iii) concomitant changes in water quality (e.g. declining orthophosphate, ammonia and biochemical oxygen demand), or at some sites changes in discharge, explained more variation in invertebrate abundance and composition than did temperature.
   These patterns were reconfirmed in both group- and site-specific analyses.
   We conclude that recent winter-biased warming in southern English chalk-streams has been insufficient to affect invertebrates negatively over a period of improving water quality. This implies that positive management can minimize some climate-change impacts on stream ecosystems. Chalk-stream invertebrates are sensitive, nevertheless, to variations in discharge, and detectable changes could occur if climate change alters flow pattern.
   Because climatic trends now characterize many inter-annual time-series, we caution other investigators to examine whether putative effects on ecological systems are real or linked spuriously to other causes of change.

AB Facilitation is a positive interaction assembling ecological communities and preserving global biodiversity. Although communities acquire emerging properties when many species interact, most of our knowledge about facilitation is based on studies between pairs of species. To understand how plant facilitation preserves biodiversity in complex ecological communities, we propose to move from the study of pairwise interactions to the network approach. We show that facilitation networks behave as mutualistic networks do, characterized by a nonrandom, nested structure of plant-plant interactions in which a few generalist nurses facilitate a large number of species while the rest of the nurses facilitate only a subset of them. Consequently, generalist nurses shape a dense and highly connected network. Interestingly, such generalist nurses are the most abundant species in the community, making facilitation-shaped communities strongly resistant to extinction, as revealed by coextinction simulations. The nested structure of facilitative networks explains why facilitation, by preventing extinction, preserves biodiversity.

AB Aim This study used data from temperate forest communities to assess: (1) five different stepwise selection methods with generalized additive models, (2) the effect of weighting absences to ensure a prevalence of 0.5, (3) the effect of limiting absences beyond the environmental envelope defined by presences, (4) four different methods for incorporating spatial autocorrelation, and (5) the effect of integrating an interaction factor defined by a regression tree on the residuals of an initial environmental model.
   Location State of Vaud, western Switzerland.
   Methods Generalized additive models (GAMs) were fitted using the grasp package (generalized regression analysis and spatial predictions, http://www.cscf.ch/grasp).
   Results Model selection based on cross-validation appeared to be the best compromise between model stability and performance (parsimony) among the five methods tested. Weighting absences returned models that perform better than models fitted with the original sample prevalence. This appeared to be mainly due to the impact of very low prevalence values on evaluation statistics. Removing zeroes beyond the range of presences on main environmental gradients changed the set of selected predictors, and potentially their response curve shape. Moreover, removing zeroes slightly improved model performance and stability when compared with the baseline model on the same data set. Incorporating a spatial trend predictor improved model performance and stability significantly. Even better models were obtained when including local spatial autocorrelation. A novel approach to include interactions proved to be an efficient way to account for interactions between all predictors at once.
   Main conclusions Models and spatial predictions of 18 forest communities were significantly improved by using either: (1) cross-validation as a model selection method, (2) weighted absences, (3) limited absences, (4) predictors accounting for spatial autocorrelation, or (5) a factor variable accounting for interactions between all predictors. The final choice of model strategy should depend on the nature of the available data and the specific study aims. Statistical evaluation is useful in searching for the best modelling practice. However, one should not neglect to consider the shapes and interpretability of response curves, as well as the resulting spatial predictions in the final assessment.

AB Most of the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) populations in Europe experienced dramatic declines during the twentieth century. However, owing to intense conservation actions and the ban of DDT and other persistent pollutants, populations are currently recovering. We show that despite passing through demographic bottlenecks, white-tailed eagle populations have retained significant levels of genetic diversity. Both genetic and ringing data indicate that migration between populations has not been a major factor for the maintenance of genetic variability. We argue that the long generation time of eagles has acted as an intrinsic buffer against loss of genetic diversity, leading to a shorter effective time of the experienced bottleneck. Notably, conservation actions taken in several small sub-populations have ensured the preservation of a larger proportion of the total genetic diversity than if conservation had focused on the population stronghold in Norway. For conservation programmes targeting other endangered, long-lived species, our results highlight the possibility for local retention of high genetic diversity in isolated remnant populations.

AB Trends in the composition of nestling thick-billed murre diets were analyzed for the period 1980-2002 on the basis of observations of food delivered to nestlings at two breeding colonies in northern Hudson Bay. The incidence of arctic cod, sculpins, and benthic Zoarcidae decreased and the incidence of capelin and sandlance increased over the period considered. Arctic cod fell from a mean of 43% of deliveries in the mid-1980s to 15% in the late 1990s; benthic species (zoarcids and sculpins) fell from 36% to 15%, while capelin increased from 15% to 50% over the same period. July ice cover in Hudson Bay approximately halved during 1981-99. We suggest that the observed changes in diet composition reflect changes in the relative abundance of the fish species involved and that the decline in arctic cod and increase in capelin and sandlance were associated with a general warming of Hudson Bay waters, the result of ongoing climate change in the region.

AB Margaritifera margaritifera and M. auricularia are among the most endangered freshwater mussels in the world, and the only species of the genus found in Europe. Our genetic study explores allozymic variability (27 loci) and differentiation at the mitochondrial sequence level (partial COI and 16S rRNA gene sequences). The Spanish M. auricularia population showed genetic parameters of variation that were of the same order as those of other freshwater molluscs (though at the lower end of the range), probably permitting its potential recovery. The difference between this species and M. margaritifera was clearly established (ten diagnostic allozymic loci, Nei = 0.462, and mean nucleotide divergence around 9.4%). The M. margaritifera populations analysed showed a certain degree of population genetic structure (according to allozyme data) that was not, however, related to a geographical cline. Nevertheless, two mitochondrial lineages (albeit very closely related) were identified: a northern lineage extending from Ireland to the Kola Peninsula including the western Atlantic coast, and a second cluster distributed from Ireland to the Iberian Peninsula. The phylogenetic relationships between these two species and other related taxa were established. The putative M. m. durrovensis could be considered an 'ecophenotype'. Palaeobiogeographical scenarios are presented and indicate unexpected 'recent' gene flow between M. margaritifera populations that were theoretically isolated in the early Tertiary.

AB In a growing body of literature from a variety of ecosystems is strong evidence that various components of biodiversity have significant impacts on ecosystem functioning. However, much of this evidence comes from short-term, small-scale experiments in which communities are synthesized from relatively small species pools and conditions are highly controlled. Extrapolation of the results of such experiments to longer time scales and larger spatial scales-those of whole ecosystems-is difficult because the experiments do not incorporate natural processes such as recruitment limitation and colonization of new species. We show how long-term study of planned and accidental changes in species richness and composition suggests that the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning will vary over time and space. More important, we also highlight areas of uncertainty that need to be addressed through coordinated cross-scale and cross-site research.

AB A regular and distinct feature of seasonal plankton succession in temperate lakes is the early summer period of algal suppression by herbivores, i.e. the clearwater phase. Within the last 30 years the timing of this food-web interaction between algae and herbivores has advanced on average by approximately two weeks in central European lakes due to faster population growth of herbivores in warmer water. Trend and interannual variability in clearwater timing were strongly related to the climate dynamics of the North Atlantic, i.e. the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Due to its large-scale effects, the NAO synchronized plankton succession in central European lakes, causing a striking temporal coherence of a food-web interaction over several hundreds of kilometres.

AB The mammalian order Xenarthra (armadillos, anteaters and sloths) is one of the four major clades of placentals, but it remains poorly studied from the molecular phylogenetics perspective. We present here a study encompassing most of the order's diversity in order to establish xenarthrans' intra-ordinal relationships, discuss the evolution of their morphological characters, search for their extant sister group and specify the timing of their radiation with special emphasis on the status of the controversial fossil. Eurotamandua. Sequences of three genes (nuclear exon 28 of the Von Willebrand factor and mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNAs) are compared for eight of the 13 living genera. Phylogenetic analyses confirm the order's monophyly and that of its three major lineages: armadillos (Cingulata), anteaters (Vermilingua) and sloths ('Tardigrada', renamed in 'Folivora'), and our results strongly support the grouping of hairy xenarthrans (anteaters and sloths) into Pilosa. Within placentals, Afrotheria might be the first lineage to branch off, followed by Xenarthra. The morphological adaptative convergence between New World xenarthrans and Old World pangolins is confirmed. Molecular datings place the early emergence of armadillos around the Cretaceous/ Tertiary boundary, followed by the divergence between anteaters and sloths in the Early Eocene era. These Tertiary dates contradict the concept of a very ancient origin of modern xenarthran lineages. They also question the placement of the purported fossil anteater (Eurotamandua) from the Middle Eocene period of Europe with the Vermilingua and instead suggest the independent and convergent evolution of this enigmatic taxon.

AB I have examined the adaptive significance of polyandry using the Australian field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus. Previous studies of polyandry have examined differences in offspring production by females mated multiply to a single male or females mated multiply to different males. Here I combine this approach with a study of parentage of offspring produced in the later group. Females mated to two different males had a higher proportion of their eggs hatching than did females mating twice with a single male. Offspring fitness parameters were not effected. There was little evidence to suggest that females elevate their hatching success via fertilizing their eggs with sperm from genetically compatible males. Although the average paternity points towards random sperm mixing, there was considerable individual variation in sperm competition success. Patterns of parentage were consistent across females mating twice or four times. Sperm competition success was not related to offspring viability or performance. Thus, the notion that competitively superior sperm produce competitively superior offspring is not supported either. The mechanism underlying increased hatching success with polyandry requires further study.

AB The cessation or reduction of fishing in marine protected areas (MPAs) should promote an increase in abundance and mean size and age of previously exploited populations. Thus density-dependent changes ill life-history characteristics should occur when populations are allowed to recover in MPAs. In this review, we synthesize the existing information on resource limitation ill marine ecosystems, density-dependent changes in life-history traits of exploited populations and evidence for biomass export from MPAs. Most evidence for compensator!, changes in biological variables has been derived from observations on populations depleted by high fishing mortality or on strong year classes, but these changes are more evident in juveniles than in adults and in freshwater rather than in marine systems. It is unclear if adults of exploited marine populations are resource limited. This may suggest that exploited populations are controlled mainly by density-independent processes, which could be a consequence of the depleted state of most exploited populations. MPAs could be a useful tool for testing these hypotheses. If we assume that resources become limiting inside MPAs, it is plausible that, if suitable habitats exist, mobile species will search for resources outside of the MPAs, leading to export of biomass to areas which are fished. However, it is not possible to establish from the available data whether this export will be a response to resource limitation inside the MPAs, the result of random movements across MPA boundaries or both, We discuss the implications of this process for the use of MPAs as fisheries management tools.

AB Phylogeographical studies of Nearctic songbirds conducted to date have yielded unexpectedly low levels of genetic differentiation and weak phylogeographical structure in mitochondrial DNA lineages as compared with species studied in Neotropical areas. Factors leading to this pattern may include (i) gene flow, (ii) population expansions from bottlenecked populations, and (iii) selective sweeps. Here we provide evidence for the role played by Pleistocene postglacial population expansions on the phylogeography of MacGillivray's warbler (Oporornis tolmiei), a long-distance migratory bird. Samples from 12 breeding localities in the temperate USA were compared with those from two localities in north-eastern Mexico. The former showed evidence of a Late Pleistocene population expansion as indicated by low haplotype and nucleotide diversity, a star-like phylogeny of alleles, and a mismatch distribution indicating a sudden increase in effective population size. By contrast, the Mexican population showed high levels of genetic diversity and a mismatch distribution as expected for a population unaffected by sudden demographic change. Haplotypes from the two regions formed two distinct phylogroups which separated roughly one million years ago according to a conventional molecular clock for songbirds. This study provides support for the Pleistocene expansion hypothesis in MacGillivray's warbler and suggests that postglacial expansion of bottlenecked populations is responsible for the lack of variation and structure reported for most North American songbird species.

AB 1. Metrosideros polymorpha (O'hia), the dominant tree species in Hawaiian forest ecosystems, grows from sea level to treeline (2500 m). Consistent changes in its morphology and anatomy occur along this altitudinal/temperature gradient. Patterns of variation in photosynthetic gas exchange, leaf nitrogen content, nitrogen-use efficiency, delta(13)C, and morphological and anatomical characteristics were determined across the elevational gradient. In addition, on-line carbon isotope discrimination studies of high and low elevation M. polymorpha were performed.
   2. Observed trends with increasing altitude were: (1) progressively higher carboxylation efficiency, leaf N content on an area basis, leaf mass per unit area (LMA), less negative foliar delta(13)C and (2) progressively smaller leaf size. Net CO2 assimilation (A) expressed on an area basis, leaf dry mass and N content per leaf remained relatively constant along the gradient.
   3. Foliar delta(13)C became less negative with increasing elevation (- 30 parts per thousand at low elevation to - 24 parts per thousand at high elevation) and was strongly correlated with foliar N and LMA. Foliar delta(13)C was also correlated with variations in the ratio of intercellular to ambient partial pressure of CO2 (p(i)/p(a)), as determined by field gas-exchange studies.
   4. Results from on-line fractionation experiments suggested that the relatively large internal resistance to CO2 diffusion did not differ between high and low elevation populations, despite differences in LMA. Less negative values of delta(13)C at high elevations and corresponding lower values of p(i)/p(a) were associated with increased carboxylation efficiency and N content on a unit leaf area basis.
   5. Two major homeostatic responses in M. polymorpha plants along elevational/temperature gradients were observed: (1) maintenance of similar photosynthetic rates per unit leaf surface area despite suboptimal conditions for CO2 assimilation at high elevation and (2) similar N content per leaf despite lower soil N availability at high elevations. These homeostatic mechanisms allow M. polymorpha to maintain a relatively high level of growth-related activities at high elevation, despite limiting environmental conditions.

AB Recent studies have used comparisons of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence divergence among populations and species to test existing hypotheses about avian evolution during the Pleistocene epoch. In 1998, Avise and Walker concluded that the Pleistocene was an important time for avian evolution, including the initiation of phylogeographic separations and the completion of speciation events that began in the Pliocene. The study implied that these conclusions conflicted with the study, in 1997, by Klicka and Zink, which concluded that most species pairs previously thought to have originated in the past 250 000 years ct:ere much older. The two studies are complementary in the sense that Avise and Walker dealt primarily with phylogeographic (intraspecific) separations. Furthermore, Klicka and Zink concentrated on the inception of divergences whereas Avise and Walker focused on the timing of the completion of speciation. To accomplish this, Avise and Walker analysed 'phylogroups', geographically coherent subsets of biological species in which mtDNA haplotypes exhibit reciprocal monophyly. The study used the average interphylogroup mtDNA distance (0.027), calibrated at 2% per million years, to conclude that speciation required on average one million years to complete, Hence, speciation events begun in the Late Pliocene would have been completed in the mid- to late Pleistocene. Although we appreciate the extended nature of the speciation process and Avise and Walker's insightful attempt to estimate its duration, we conclude that their value was an overestimate by a factor of two. In particular we question whether phylogroups can be used in the novel evolutionary role that Avise and Walker envisioned, because of the vagaries of taxonomic practices and lack of consensus regarding species concepts. To extend their analysis of intraspecific, phylogeographic separations, we compiled previously analysed and newly available data for divergence times for North American songbird (order Passeriformes) phylogroups. More than 80% were initiated at least one million years ago, which is inconsistent with the late Pleistocene origins model previously rejected by Klicka and Zink. Although some divergence events can be traced to the late Pleistocene, the significance of the distribution must be judged with reference to a null model. Whether the Pleistocene was a profound time for avian phylogeographic differentiation is at present unknown.

AB Variations in the partitioning of foliar carbon and nitrogen in combination with changes in needle and shoot structure were studied in trees of Picea abies along a vertical gradient of relative irradiance (RI). RI was the major determinant of needle morphology, causing all needle linear parameters - width, thickness and length - to increase. Due to the different responsiveness of needle thickness and width in respect of RI, the ratio of total to projected needle area increased with RI. Furthermore, shoot structure was also influenced by RI, and the ratio of shoot silhouette area to total needle area, which characterises the packing of needles and needle area within the shoot, was greater at lower values of irradiance. Needle dry weight per total needle area (LWA(t)) was also increased by RI. Similarly, irrespective of the measure for surface area, needle nitrogen content per area. as the product of needle dry weight per area and nitrogen content per needle dry weight (Nm), scaled quasi-linearly with needle weight per area. Thus, the changes in needle and shoot morphology made it possible to invest more photosynthesising weight per unit light-intercepting surface there, where the pay-back due to elevated irradiances was the highest. However, N-m behaved in an entirely different manner, decreasing hyperbolically with LWA(t). Since non-structural (carbon in non-structural carbohydrates), and structural (total minus non-structural) needle carbon per dry weight also increased with LWA(t) N-m was inversely correlated with both non-structural and structural carbon. Total tree height, increasing significantly LWA(t), also influenced needle structure. It appeared that total height did not affect needle thickness or width, but larger trees had greater needle density (dry weight per volume). Because needle density was positively correlated with needle carbon content per dry weight, it was assumed that the greater values of needle carbon content can be attributed to increased lignification and thickening of needle cell walls. Thus, it appeared that the proportion of supporting structures was greater in needles of larger trees. Inasmuch as an increased fraction of supporting structures dilutes other leaf substances, including also leaf compounds responsible for CO2-assimilation, enhanced requirement for supporting structures may be responsible for lower rates of carbon assimilation per foliage dry weight observed in large trees. Increasing water limitation with increasing tree size is discussed as a possible cause for increased needle supporting costs in large uses.

AB Few insects are susceptible to pathogens at all stages of their life cycle. The population dynamic consequences of introducing age and stage structure are examined through the use of models of insect-pathogen interactions in which hosts are assumed to contract the disease by ingesting infectious particles in the environment. The models are phrased as delay-differential equations that assume constant demographic parameters within age or stage classes. The first and simplest model assumes that only the adult insect is susceptible to infection, while the second model assumes a juvenile susceptible stage. Two further Variants of the second model are considered: one in which the disease does not have a fixed incubation period and one that assumes that a reservoir for pathogen particles exists in the environment. Both linear and nonlinear transmission processes are examined. The introduction of explicit time delays has little effect on model equilibria but strongly influences dynamics. Multigenerational host-pathogen cycles are predicted by all models, although the parameter space in which they occur is markedly model specific. A type of population dynamics Previously observed in host-parasitoid models, but not in insect-pathogen models, was also found: cycles with a period of one host generation or of a fraction of a host generation. This dynamic behavior arises through the interaction of unequal time delays in the two populations. The absence of a fixed incubation period and the presence of a pathogen reservoir both tend to be stabilizing. The models developed in this article are most applicable to insect-pathogen interactions in tropical or subtropical environments, where populations are not synchronized by a severe winter.

AB 1 A series of ammonium nitrate additions have been made to calcareous and acidic grasslands in the Peak District of Great Britain to simulate increasing loads of nitrogen deposition. Supplementary plots investigated (i) the effects of glucose addition, (ii) the role of phosphorus limitation, and (iii) compared the impact of ammonium nitrate with that of ammonium sulphate.
   2 Ammonium sulphate caused a decline in the moss Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus on the acid site, but no other change in vegetation composition was detected after 3 years of any treatment.
   3 Plant nitrogen concentration and nitrate reductase activity increased with increasing nitrogen supply in most of the vascular plants, and there was no loss of the capacity for induction in nitrate reductase activity. In contrast, nitrate reductase activity declined in the moss R. squarrosus and there was a loss of induceability. Leaf and shoot growth did not change with nitrogen additions.
   4 Plant growth appeared to be colimited by phosphorus and nitrogen supply on the calcareous site. Any changes in vegetation composition would result from subtle changes in chemical composition and physiology, rather than differences in growth response of different species, and would be expected to take many years.
   5 Data gathered at the site suggest that atmospheric deposition is a larger source of plant nitrogen supply than mineralization in the soil. Soil nitrogen mineralization rate was also stimulated by additional nitrogen input.

AB Societal, economic and scientific interests in knowing where biodiversity is, how it is faring and what can be done to efficiently mitigate further biodiversity loss and the associated loss of ecosystem services are at an all-time high. So far, however, biodiversity monitoring has primarily focused on structural and compositional features of ecosystems despite growing evidence that ecosystem functions are key to elucidating the mechanisms through which biological diversity generates services to humanity. This monitoring gap can be traced to the current lack of consensus on what exactly ecosystem functions are and how to track them at scales beyond the site level. This contribution aims to advance the development of a global biodiversity monitoring strategy by proposing the adoption of a set of definitions and a typology for ecosystem functions, and reviewing current opportunities and potential limitations for satellite remote sensing technology to support the monitoring of ecosystem functions worldwide. By clearly defining ecosystem processes, functions and services and their interrelationships, we provide a framework to improve communication between ecologists, land and marine managers, remote sensing specialists and policy makers, thereby addressing a major barrier in the field.

AB Modern advances in cloud computing and machine-leaning algorithms are shifting the manner in which Earth-observation (EO) data are used for environmental monitoring, particularly as we settle into the era of free, open-access satellite data streams. Wetland delineation represents a particularly worthy application of this emerging research trend, since wetlands are an ecologically important yet chronically under-represented component of contemporary mapping and monitoring programs, particularly at the regional and national levels. Exploiting Google Earth Engine and R Statistical software, we developed a workflow for predicting the probability of wetland occurrence using a boosted regression tree machine-learning framework applied to digital topographic and EO data. Working in a 13,700 km(2) study area in northern Alberta, our best models produced excellent results, with AUC (area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve) values of 0.898 and explained-deviance values of 0.708. Our results demonstrate the central role of high-quality topographic variables for modeling wetland distribution at regional scales. Including optical and/or radar variables into the workflow substantially improved model performance, though optical data performed slightly better. Converting our wetland probability-of-occurrence model into a binary Wet-Dry classification yielded an overall accuracy of 85%, which is virtually identical to that derived from the Alberta Merged Wetland Inventory (AMWI): the contemporary inventory used by the Government of Alberta. However, our workflow contains several key advantages over that used to produce the AMWI, and provides a scalable foundation for province-wide monitoring initiatives.

AB Aim: Although global trade is implicated in biological invasions, the assumption that trade networks explain the large-scale distributions of non-native species remains largely untested. We addressed this by analysing relationships between global trade networks and plant pest invasion.
   Location: Forty-eight countries in Europe and the Mediterranean.
   Time period: Current.
   Major taxa studied: Four hundred and twenty-two non-native plant pests (173 invertebrates, 166 pathogens, 83 plants).
   Methods: Ten types of connectivity index were developed, representing potential roles of trade networks, air transport links, geographical proximity, climatic similarity and source country wealth in facilitating invasion. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) identified the connectivity index that best explained both historical and recent invasion. Then, more complex GLMMs were developed including connectivity through trade networks for multiple commodities relevant for pests (live plants, forest products, fruit and vegetables and seeds) and species' transport associations with those commodities.
   Results: Total import volumes, species' global prevalence and connectivity measures based on air transport, geographical distance or climate did not explain invasion as well as connectivity through global trade networks. Invasion was strongly promoted by agricultural imports from countries in which the focal species was present and that were climatically similar to the importing country. However, live plant imports from nearby countries provided a better explanation of the most recent invasions. Connectivity through multiple trade networks predicted invasion better than total agricultural trade, and there was support for our hypothesis that species known to be transported with a particular network had greater sensitivity to its connectivity.
   Main conclusions: Our findings show that patterns of invasion are governed to a large extent by global trade networks connecting source areas for non-native species and the dispersal of those species through multiple trade networks. This enhances potential for developing a predictive framework to improve risk assessment, biosecurity and surveillance for invasions.

Here, we assess the global human impact on the potential value of six freshwater ecosystem services (ES) and estimate the proportion of each used globally (the mean value across all countries is in parentheses): biodiversity (0.37), disturbance regulation (0.24), commodities (0.39), greenhouse gases (0.09), water availability (0.10), and water quality (0.33). We also created a composite index of the impact. Using different valuation schemes, we found that humans have used potential global freshwater ES scaled by a relative value of roughly 4-20%, with a median of 16%. All countries use a considerable amount of the potential ES value, invalidating the idea that wealthier countries have less impact on their ES once they have developed. The data suggest that humans have diminished the potential ES provided by freshwaters across the globe and that factors associated with high population growth rates are related to the overall degradation.

AB We propose a conceptual framework for restoration of threatened plant species that encourages integration of technological, ecological, and social spheres. A sphere encompasses ideas relevant to restoration and the people working within similar areas of influence or expertise. Increased capacity within a sphere and a higher degree of coalescing among spheres predict a greater probability of successful restoration. We illustrate this with Castanea dentata, a foundation forest tree in North America that was annihilated by an introduced pathogen; the species is a model that effectively merges biotechnology, reintroduction biology, and restoration ecology. Because of C. dentata's ecological and social importance, scientists have aggressively pursued blight resistance through various approaches. We summarize recent advancements in tree breeding and biotechnology that have emerged from C. dentata research, and describe their potential to bring new tools to bear on socio-ecological restoration problems. Successful reintroduction of C. dentata will also depend upon an enhanced understanding of its ecology within contemporary forests. We identify a critical need for a deeper understanding of societal influences that may affect setting and achieving realistic restoration goals. Castanea dentata may serve as an important model to inform reintroduction of threatened plant species in general and foundation forest trees in particular.

AB Fusarium is a large, complex genus that causes a wide variety of plant diseases, produces a number of mycotoxins and is becoming increasingly recognized as a significant human pathogen. These fungi occur in ecosystems in all parts of the globe, which makes them useful as a model to better understand biogeographic processes affecting the distribution of fungi. Here we review the information available on the biogeography of different species and clades of Fusarium and some of the likely processes affecting dispersal and speciation.

AB Reestablishment of locally extinct populations and augmentation of declining populations are management activities used with increasing frequency in the conservation of imperiled fishes in the United States. Unfortunately, these options were not always carefully or appropriately used in past cases, partly owing to a lack Of guidelines that address scientifically-based protocols for propagation, translocation, reintroduction, and augmentation (PTRA). PTRA programs are,in important management tool for the recovery of imperiled fishes when undertaken with careful planning, including everything from determining that PTRA is necessary to incorporating knowledge of life history and genetics into the PTRA plan. In addition, PTRA programs must also assemble advisory groups, obtain funding and permitting, construct and maintain propagation facilities, and raise community awareness of the program. Because such diverse skills are needed, Successful PTRA programs should prepare for long-term partnerships to achieve the goal of recovery.

AB Understanding gene interaction and pleiotropy are long-standing goals of developmental and evolutionary biology. We examine the genetic control of diapause in insects and show how the failure to recognize the difference between modular and gene pleiotropy has confounded our understanding of the genetic basis of this important phenotype. This has led to complications in understanding the role of the circadian clock in the control of diapause in Drosophila and other insects. We emphasize three successive modules - each containing functionally related genes-that lead to diapause: photoperiodism, hormonal events and diapause itself. Understanding the genetic basis for environmental control of diapause has wider implications for evolutionary response to rapid climate change and for the opportunity to observe evolutionary change in contemporary time.

AB Bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus are amongst the best-known cetaceans. In the Mediterranean Sea, however, modern field studies of cetaceans did not start until the late 1980s. Bottlenose dolphins have been studied only in relatively small portions of the basin, and wide areas remain largely unexplored.
   This paper reviews the ecology, behaviour, interactions with fisheries and conservation status of Mediterranean bottlenose dolphins, and identifies threats likely to have affected them in historical and recent times.
   Whilst intentional killing was probably the most important cause of mortality until the 1960s, important ongoing threats include incidental mortality in fishing gear and the reduced availability of key prey caused by overfishing and environmental degradation throughout the region. Additional potential or likely threats include the toxic effects of xenobiotic chemicals, epizootic outbreaks, direct disturbance from boating and shipping, noise, and the consequences of climate change.
   The flexible social organization and opportunistic diet and behaviour of bottlenose dolphins may allow them to withstand at least some of the effects of overfishing and habitat degradation. However, dolphin abundance is thought to have declined considerably in the region and management measures are needed to prevent further decline.
   Management strategies that could benefit bottlenose dolphins, such as sustainable fishing, curbing marine pollution and protecting biodiversity, are already embedded in legislation and treaties. Compliance with those existing commitments and obligations should be given high priority.

AB A fleet of baited remote underwater video stations was set in lagoonal and inter-reef waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, across 14 degrees of latitude and the entire shelf. Counts of the maximum number seen in any one field of view were used to estimate relative abundance of 347 species of bony fishes, cartilaginous fishes and sea snakes. Boosted regression trees were used to assess the influence of depth and location of sampling sites on species richness. Multivariate regression trees and indices of specificity and fidelity (Dufrene-Legendre indices) were used to distinguish 17 spatially contiguous vertebrate groups within a hierarchy of spatial scales. Location across the shelf and depth had the greatest influence on species richness, with peaks occurring around the similar to 35 m iso-bath in the inter-reef waters of the reef matrix, coinciding with shallow banks and shoals. Richness increased slightly toward the equator. Nine terminal vertebrate communities parallel to the coast were distinguished inshore and offshore in deep and shallow water along a latitudinal gradient. There were important community boundaries at Bowen in the south, Townsville in the centre, and Cape Flattery in the north. Latitudinal groupings were most evident inshore. Offshore communities were spatially extensive and separated lagoonal, mid-shelf and outer-shelf sites. Community boundaries were correlated with knowledge of strong gradients in sedimentary and oceanographic processes influenced by the shape of the reef matrix and regional tides and currents.

   SURFACE-WATER; MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES; FLOODPLAIN HABITATS;
   HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE; DOMINATED STREAM; SPAWNING STREAM; CHALK STREAM
AB Many rivers are classified as groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs), owing to the contribution of groundwater to their base flow. However, there has been little explicit recognition of the way groundwater influences riverine biota or processes, how degrees of ecological dependency may vary, and the management implications of this dependency. The permeable beds and banks of these GDEs where surface water and groundwater exchange are termed 'hyporheic zones'. They are often inhabited by invertebrates, with varying reliance on groundwater, although the ecological roles of these invertebrates are little known. Upwelling hyporheic water can promote surface primary productivity, influence sediment microbial activity, and affect organic matter decomposition. In many intermittent streams, variable groundwater inputs alter the duration of flow or water permanence, and the duration and timing of these largely govern the biota and rates of many ecosystem processes ( e. g. leaf decomposition). Not only is the physical presence of water important, thermal and chemical conditions arising from groundwater inputs also have direct and indirect effects on riverine biota and rates or types of in-stream processes. Differing degrees of dependency of rivers on groundwater mediate all these influences, and may change over time and in response to human activities. Alteration of groundwater inputs through extraction from riparianwells or changes in localwater table have an impact on these GDEs, and some current management plans aim to restrict groundwater extraction from near permeable river channels. However, these are often 'blanket' restrictions and the mechanisms of GDE dependency or timing of groundwater requirements are poorly understood, hampering refinement of this management approach. More effective management of these GDEs into the future can result only from a better understanding of the mechanisms of the dependency, how these vary among river types and what in-stream changes might be predicted from alteration of groundwater inputs.

AB Relationships between photosynthetic capacity, and needle contents of N, Rubisco and amino acids were investigated in potted Pinus sylvestris L. trees. Three-year-old seedlings of P. sylvestris were grown for 4 years with three nutrient regimes. Concentrations of N, amino acids, an-fides and Rubisco were measured and expressed on a needle area basis, and the in vivo performances of Rubisco (maximum rate of carboxylation, V-cmax) and of electron transport (maximum light driven electron flux, J(max)) were estimated via a biochemically based model of photosynthesis. Needle content of Rubisco-N was at least six times that of amino acid + amide-N and was positively related to N-area. The estimated in vivo specific activity of Rubisco (V-cmax/Rubisco content per unit area) was low and negatively related to N content per unit area (N-area). J(max)/Rubisco content was negatively related to N-area, whereas V-cmax/J(max) was unrelated to N-area. Hence, Rubisco content was in excess of the amount required for photosynthesis and this excess was positively related to Narea. These data support the hypothesis that with increasing N-area, Rubisco functions increasingly as a storage protein in addition to its catalytic functions.

AB A novel in-growth core system, enabling functional studies of natural communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) mycelia in soil is described and tested.
   The cores have windows covered with nylon mesh of 35 mum pore size that prevent in-growth of roots but permit penetration of AM hyphae. They were inserted into grassland turf and contained either sterilized sand and a 'bait' seedling of Trifolium repens or nonsterile natural soil without bait plants. The impacts of hyphal severance, achieved by periodic rotation of some of the cores, upon AM colonization of bait plants (experiment 1) and transfer of P-33 from soil to plants outside the cores (experiment 2) were examined.
   Severance of AM hyphae reduced both AM colonization of bait plants and their shoot P concentrations. The shoot P-33 concentrations of plants with mycelial access to (PO4)-P-33-labelled cores were 10-fold greater than those which had no mycelial access.
   It is concluded that this novel approach enables the functioning of mycorrhizal mycelial networks to be evaluated under conditions closely simulating those occurring in nature. (C) New Phytologist (2001).

AB The role of morphological versus physiological foliar plasticity in the capacity for, and mechanisms of, photosynthetic acclimation was assessed in Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Abies alba Mill. saplings in a forest gap-understory light gradient (relative irradiance, RI, ranging from 0.02 to 0.32). The species investigated showed a similar foliar morphological plasticity along the light gradient, at both the needle level (through alteration in leaf dry mass per area) and the shoot level (through alteration in the silhouette area ratio, e.g., shoot silhouette to projected needle area ratio). In both species chlorophyll (Chl) concentration on a mass basis decreased at increasing RI, but was independent of RI when expressed on an area basis. In contrast, leaf N concentration on a mass basis was independent of RI, but was positively influenced by RI when expressed on an area basis. The parameters describing photosynthetic performance at low light (dark respiration rate, apparent quantum yield and light compensation point) suggest that Abies alba was better suited to maintain a positive carbon balance in shaded conditions. By contrast, parameters describing biochemical capacity at high light (maximum electron transport rate, J(max). and maximum ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylation capacity, V-cmax) indicate that only Picea abies was capable of acclimating physiologically to high photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFDs) by increasing nitrogen partitioning to rubisco and V-cmax/mass, by increasing RI. These results support the hypothesis that interspecific differences in nitrogen partitioning within the photosynthetic apparatus may provide a mechanistic basis for species separation along a light gradient. The differences in photosynthetic plasticity observed are likely to influence regeneration patterns and habitat breadth of the species investigated. The limited ability of Abies alba saplings to exploit high-light conditions may be a competitive disadvantage in large canopy gaps and thus limit recruitment of this species to small gaps.

AB Aim Species transported to and introduced into non-native environments, termed 'introductions', constitute a growing component of many regional floras and faunas, yet not all such species successfully establish. Investigations into why some introductions succeed while others fail are often based on analyses of the outcome of historical introductions. Such 'experiments in nature' have the drawback that the effects of interest may be confounded because they have not been randomized with respect to each other, and because the species and locations chosen for introduction may not be a random subset of the available species or locations. Our aim is to quantify this non-randomness using a global data set of bird introductions, and examine the factors associated with introduction probability in two subsets of these data, one taxonomic (order Anseriformes) and one geographical (British birds).
   Location Global.
   Methods Statistical analyses of the distributions among taxa and locations for 1378 introduction events for 426 bird species across the world, and statistical analyses of the characteristics of Ariseriform and British bird species selected for introduction.
   Results Global introductions of birds have been highly non-random with respect to taxon, location of origin, and location of introduction. Most introductions involve species in just five families (Phasianidae, Passeridae, Psittacidae, Anatidae and Columbidae), and most introductions have been to temperate and island locations. Within the taxonomic and geographical subsets, the species chosen for introduction tend to be abundant species that would have been relatively easy to obtain.
   Main conclusions The characteristics of the species and locations chosen for introduction are not representative of species and locations in general, which limits our ability to draw general conclusions from historical records, and generates problems of confounding and non-independence in statistical analyses of introduction success. We suggest possible solutions for these problems.

AB Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites that have long been considered to be primitive eukaryotes, both on the basis of morphological features and on the basis of molecular, mainly ribosomal RNA-based, phylogenies. However, accumulating sequence data and the use of more sophisticated tree construction methods now seem to suggest that microsporidia share a common origin with fungi and are therefore most probably just curious fungi. In this paper, we describe the current views on the phylogenetic position of the microsporidia and present additional evidence for a close relationship between fungi and microsporidia on the basis of reanalysed ribosomal RNA data. In this respect, the importance of incorporating detailed knowledge of the substitution pattern of sequences into phylogenetic methods is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Differences between plant species in the benefit derived from arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization have often been attributed to differences in physical properties of their roots, especially in root hair development. To test this hypothesis, the growth response to phosphate of five pasture species which differed markedly in the length of their root hairs was measured. Plants in the mycorrhizal treatments were inoculated with a Glomus sp. (isolate WUM 10(1)) while non-mycorrhizal plants received control inoculum. Benefit was described as the relative effectiveness of phosphorus (P) for the mycorrhizal plants compared with non-mycorrhizal plants. The beneficial effect of Glomus sp. was inversely related to root hair length of the host plant but it was not well related to root diameter, root length per plant or root/shoot ratio. It is suggested that root hairs and external hyphae of Glomus sp. act as alternative, similar ways of shortening the distance for the diffusion of phosphate in soils.

AB The delineation of conservation units (CUs) is a challenging issue that has profound implications forminimizing the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. CU delineation typically seeks to prioritize evolutionary significance, and genetic methods play a pivotal role in the delineation process by quantifying overall differentiation between populations. Although CUs that primarily reflect overall genetic differentiation do protect adaptive differences between distant populations, they do not necessarily protect adaptive variation within highly connected populations. Advances in genomic methodology facilitate the characterization of adaptive genetic variation, but the potential utility of this information for CU delineation is unclear. We use genomic methods to investigate the evolutionary basis of premature migration in Pacific salmon, a complex behavioral and physiological phenotype that exists within highly connected populations and has experienced severe declines. Strikingly, we find that premature migration is associated with the same single locus across multiple populations in each of two different species. Patterns of variation at this locus suggest that the premature migration alleles arose from a single evolutionary event within each species and were subsequently spread to distant populations through straying and positive selection. Our results reveal that complex adaptive variation can depend on rare mutational events at a single locus, demonstrate that CUs reflecting overall genetic differentiation can fail to protect evolutionarily significant variation that has substantial ecological and societal benefits, and suggest that a supplemental framework for protecting specific adaptive variation will sometimes be necessary to prevent the loss of significant biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB Aim Niche-based species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to predict impacts of global change on biodiversity, but the reliability of these predictions in space and time depends on their transferability. We tested how the strategy used to choose predictors impacts the transferability of SDMs at a cross-continental scale.
   Location North America, Eurasia and Australia.
   Method We used a systematic approach including 50 Holarctic plant invaders and 27 initial predictor variables, considering 10 different strategies for variable selection, accounting for the proximality, multicollinearity and climate analogy of predictors. We compared the average performance of each strategy, some of which used a large number of predictor combinations. Next, we looked for the single best model for each species across all the predictor combinations retained in the analysis. Transferability was considered as the predictive success of SDMs calibrated in the native range and projected onto the invaded range.
   Results Two strategies showed better SDM transferability on average: a set of predictors known for their ecologically meaningful effects on plant distribution, and the two first axes of a principal component analysis calibrated on all predictor variables (S-pc2). From the more than 2000 combinations of predictors per species across strategies, the best set of predictors yielded SDMs with good transferability for 45 species (90%). These best combinations consisted of eight randomly assembled (39 species) or uncorrelated predictors (6 species) and S-pc2 (5 species). We also found that internal cross-validation was not sufficient to give full information about the transferability of a SDM to a distinct range.
   Main conclusion Transferring SDMs at the macroclimatic scale, and thus anticipating invasions, is possible for the large majority of invasive plants considered in this study, but the accuracy of the predictions relies strongly on the choice of predictors. From our results, we recommend including either proximal and state-of-the-art variables or a reduced and orthogonalized set to obtain robust SDM projections.

AB Understanding the phylogenetic relationships among the yeasts of the subphylum Saccharomycotina is a prerequisite for understanding the evolution of their metabolisms and ecological lifestyles. In the last two decades, the use of rDNA and multilocus data sets has greatly advanced our understanding of the yeast phylogeny, but many deep relationships remain unsupported. In contrast, phylogenomic analyses have involved relatively few taxa and lineages that were often selected with limited considerations for covering the breadth of yeast biodiversity. Here we used genome sequence data from 86 publicly available yeast genomes representing nine of the 11 known major lineages and 10 nonyeast fungal outgroups to generate a 1233-gene, 96-taxon data matrix. Species phylogenies reconstructed using two different methods (concatenation and coalescence) and two data matrices (amino acids or the first two codon positions) yielded identical and highly supported relationships between the nine major lineages. Aside from the lineage comprised by the family Pichiaceae, all other lineages were monophyletic. Most interrelationships among yeast species were robust across the two methods and data matrices. However, eight of the 93 internodes conflicted between analyses or data sets, including the placements of: the clade defined by species that have reassigned the CUG codon to encode serine, instead of leucine; the clade defined by a whole genome duplication; and the species Ascoidea rubescens. These phylogenomic analyses provide a robust roadmap for future comparative work across the yeast subphylum in the disciplines of taxonomy, molecular genetics, evolutionary biology, ecology, and biotechnology. To further this end, we have also provided a BLAST server to query the 86 Saccharomycotina genomes, which can be found at http://y1000plus.org/blast.

AB The effects of tree species differing in foliage and litter chemistry on the chemical, micro-morphological, and biological properties of soil were studied on post-mining sites afforested with one of six tree species (spruce, pine, larch, oak, lime, and alder) and also on sites left to natural succession (dominated by willow). The sites were located on a large colliery spoil heap that had been produced by the mining of coal in alkaline tertiary clays near the city of Sokolov, Czech Republic. Because no topsoil had been applied to the sites, soil development resulted from in situ interactions among the deposited overburden (spoil), trees, and soil biota. Soil formation differed markedly among sites afforested with different tree species. On sites with trees producing litter with a low C/N ratio (the deciduous species), the organic Oe layer was narrow or absent and a thick organomineral A layer was evident. On sites with trees producing litter with a high C/N ratio (the evergreen species), in contrast, a thick Oe layer and a thin A layer were evident. Besides C/N ratio, earthworm abundance and earthworm bioturbation activity (measured as the amount of earthworm casts in the topsoil) were the strongest predictors of A layer thickness and C accumulation in the mineral topsoil. Sites with higher C accumulation in mineral soil had higher microbial biomass and lower microbial respiration, which may have contributed to the higher C storage. The gradient of bioturbaton was correlated with changes in the composition of the bacterial community and other soil biota, but partial correlation showed that the effects of litter quality and bioturbation were largely independent. Overall, the results indicate that the effect of tree species on soil development is substantially mediated by soil fauna activity and especially by earthworm bioturbation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB It is known from present-day climates that both temporal and spatial variations in precipitation can be more pronounced than those in temperature and thus influence ecosystems and human society in more substantial way. However, very little is known about such variations in the past. Here we present an analysis of 206 palaeoprecipitation data from two twelve million year long proxy records of precipitation for Southwest (Calatayud-Teruel basin) and Central Europe (Western and Central Paratethys), spanning the late Early and Middle to Late Miocene (17.8-5.3 Ma) at a temporal resolution of about 80 kyr and 200 kyr, respectively. The estimates of precipitation are based on the ecophysiological structure of herpetological assemblages. The results show that precipitation variations in both regions have large amplitudes during the Miocene with comparable temporal trends at longer time scales. With locally 300 mm up to more than 1000 mm more rainfall per year than present, the early Langhian and the Tortonian were relatively wet periods, whereas the late Langhian and late Serravallian were relatively dry, with up to 300 to 500 mm less precipitation than present. The most humid time intervals were the early and middle Tortonian washhouse climate periods. Overall, our data suggest that the latitudinal precipitation gradient in Europe from the Middle to Late Miocene were highly variable, with a general tendency towards a reduced gradient relative to present day values. The gradient decreases during cooling periods and increases during warming periods, similar to results from simulations of future climate change. Interestingly, the precipitation gradient was reversed during the second washhouse climate period and the Early Messinian, which may have causes a negative hydrologic balance in the Eastern Paratethys during the latter time. Yet, our reconstructed gradient curve shows no direct correlation with the global temperature signal from oxygen isotopes, which implies a non-linear regional response. Our results further suggest that major fluctuations in the precipitation gradient can be responsible for shifts in ecosystem distribution, and particularly, for faunal turnover in South Western Europe.

AB Mycorrhizal species richness and host ranges were investigated in mixed deciduous stands composed of Fagus sylvatica, Tilia spp., Carpinus betulus, Acer spp., and Fraxinus excelsior. Acer and Fraxinus were colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizas and contributed 5% to total stand mycorrhizal fungal species richness. Tilia hosted similar and Carpinus half the number of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal taxa compared with Fagus (75 putative taxa). The relative abundance of the host tree the EM fungal richness decreased in the order Fagus > Tilia >> Carpinus. After correction for similar sampling intensities, EM fungal species richness of Carpinus was still about 30-40% lower than that of Fagus and Tilia. About 10% of the mycorrhizal species were shared among the EM forming trees; 29% were associated with two host tree species and 61% with only one of the hosts. The latter group consisted mainly of rare EM fungal species colonizing about 20% of the root tips and included known specialists but also putative non-host associations such as conifer or shrub mycorrhizas. Our data indicate that EM fungal species richness was associated with tree identity and suggest that Fagus secures EM fungal diversity in an ecosystem since it shared more common EM fungi with Tilia and Carpinus than the latter two among each other.

AB Effects of nitrogen (N) supply on the limiting step of CO2 assimilation rate (A) at 380 mu mol mol-1 CO2 concentration (A(380)) at several leaf temperatures were studied in several crops, since N nutrition alters N allocation between photosynthetic components. Contents of leaf N, ribulose 1 center dot 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and cytochrome f (cyt f) increased with increasing N supply, but the cyt f/Rubisco ratio decreased. Large leaf N content was linked to a high stomatal (g(s)) and mesophyll conductance (g(m)), but resulted in a lower intercellular (C-i) and chloroplast CO2 concentration (C-c) because the increase in g(s) and g(m) was insufficient to compensate for change in A(380). The A-C-c response was used to estimate the maximum rate of RuBP carboxylation (V-cmax) and chloroplast electron transport (J(max)). The J(max)/V-cmax ratio decreased with reductions in leaf N content, which was consistent with the results of the cyt f/Rubisco ratio. Analysis using the C-3 photosynthesis model indicated that A(380) tended to be limited by RuBP carboxylation in plants grown at low N concentration, whereas it was limited by RuBP regeneration in plants grown at high N concentration. We conclude that the limiting step of A(380) depends on leaf N content and is mainly determined by N partitioning between Rubisco and electron transport components.

AB Freshwater environments and their fishes are particularly vulnerable to climate change because the persistence and quality of aquatic habitat depend heavily on climatic and hydrologic regimes. In Australia, projections indicate that the rate and magnitude of climate change will vary across the continent. We review the likely effects of these changes on Australian freshwater fishes across geographic regions encompassing a diversity of habitats and climatic variability. Commonalities in the predicted implications of climate change on fish included habitat loss and fragmentation, surpassing of physiological tolerances and spread of alien species. Existing anthropogenic stressors in more developed regions are likely to compound these impacts because of the already reduced resilience of fish assemblages. Many Australian freshwater fish species are adapted to variable or unpredictable flow conditions and, in some cases, this evolutionary history may confer resistance or resilience to the impacts of climate change. However, the rate and magnitude of projected change will outpace the adaptive capacities of many species. Climate change therefore seriously threatens the persistence of many of Australia's freshwater fish species, especially of those with limited ranges or specific habitat requirements, or of those that are already occurring close to physiological tolerance limits. Human responses to climate change should be proactive and focus on maintaining population resilience through the protection of habitat, mitigation of current anthropogenic stressors, adequate planning and provisioning of environmental flows and the consideration of more interventionist options such as managed translocations.

AB Respiration of heterotrophic microorganisms decomposing soil organic carbon releases carbon dioxide from soils to the atmosphere. In the short term, soil microbial respiration is strongly dependent on temperature. In the long term, the response of heterotrophic soil respiration to temperature is uncertain. However, following established evolutionary trade-offs, mass-specific respiration (R-mass) rates of heterotrophic soil microbes should decrease in response to sustained increases in temperature (and vice-versa). Using a laboratory microcosm approach, we tested the potential for the R-mass of the microbial biomass in six different soils to adapt to three, experimentally imposed, thermal regimes (constant 10, 20 or 30 degrees C). To determine R-mass rates of the heterotrophic soil microbial biomass across the temperature range of the imposed thermal regimes, we periodically assayed soil subsamples using similar approaches to those used in plant, animal and microbial thermal adaptation studies. As would be expected given trade-offs between maximum catalytic rates and the stability of the binding structure of enzymes, after 77 days of incubation R-mass rates across the range of assay temperatures were greatest for the 10 degrees C experimentally incubated soils and lowest for the 30 degrees C soils, with the 20 degrees C incubated soils intermediate. The relative magnitude of the difference in R-mass rates between the different incubation temperature treatments was unaffected by assay temperature, suggesting that maximum activities and not Q(10) were the characteristics involved in thermal adaptation. The time taken for changes in R-mass to manifest (77 days) suggests they likely resulted from population or species shifts during the experimental incubations; we discuss alternate mechanistic explanations for those results we observed. A future research priority is to evaluate the role that thermal adaptation plays in regulating heterotrophic respiration rates from field soils in response to changing temperature, whether seasonally or through climate change.

AB Vegetation albedo is a critical component of the Earth's climate system, yet efforts to evaluate and improve albedo parameterizations in climate models have lagged relative to other aspects of model development. Here, we calculated growing season albedos for deciduous and evergreen forests, crops, and grasslands based on over 40 site-years of data from the AmeriFlux network and compared them with estimates presently used in the land surface formulations of a variety of climate models. Generally, the albedo estimates used in land surface models agreed well with this data compilation. However, a variety of models using fixed seasonal estimates of albedo overestimated the growing season albedo of northerly evergreen trees. In contrast, climate models that rely on a common two-stream albedo submodel provided accurate predictions of boreal needle-leaf evergreen albedo but overestimated grassland albedos. Inverse analysis showed that parameters of the two-stream model were highly correlated. Consistent with recent observations based on remotely sensed albedo, the AmeriFlux dataset demonstrated a tight linear relationship between canopy albedo and foliage nitrogen concentration (for forest vegetation: albedo=0.01+0.071%N, r2=0.91; forests, grassland, and maize: albedo=0.02+0.067%N, r2=0.80). However, this relationship saturated at the higher nitrogen concentrations displayed by soybean foliage. We developed similar relationships between a foliar parameter used in the two-stream albedo model and foliage nitrogen concentration. These nitrogen-based relationships can serve as the basis for a new approach to land surface albedo modeling that simplifies albedo estimation while providing a link to other important ecosystem processes.

AB The emerging threat of pollinator decline has motivated research on bee conservation biology in order to both understand the causes of declines and to develop appropriate conservation strategies. The application of genetics to the conservation of diploid animals has proven to be important for both overcoming genetic threats to population viability and for providing tools to guide conservation programs. However, the haplodiploid bees have several unusual genetic properties of relevance to their conservation, which warrant special attention. Here I review how haplodiploidy and complementary sex determination affect genetic parameters pertinent to the viability and future evolutionary potential of bee populations. I also review how genetic tools can improve the conservation management of bees. I find that bees are especially prone to extinction for genetic reasons, and that genetics can provide invaluable tools for managing bee populations to circumvent pollinator decline.

AB The global degradation of coral reefs is having profound effects on the structure and species richness of associated reef fish assemblages. Historically, variation in the composition of fish communities has largely been attributed to factors affecting settlement of reef fish larvae. However, the mechanisms that determine how fish settlers respond to different stages of coral stress and the extent of coral loss on fish settlement are poorly understood. Here, we examined the effects of habitat degradation on fish settlement using a two-stage experimental approach. First, we employed laboratory choice experiments to test how settlers responded to early and terminal stages of coral degradation. We then quantified the settlement response of the whole reef fish assemblage in a field perturbation experiment. The laboratory choice experiments tested how juveniles from nine common Indo-Pacific fishes chose among live colonies, partially degraded colonies, and dead colonies with recent algal growth. Many species did not distinguish between live and partially degraded colonies, suggesting settlement patterns are resilient to the early stages of declining coral health. Several species preferred live or degraded corals, and none preferred to associate with dead, algal-covered colonies. In the field experiment, fish recruitment to coral colonies was monitored before and after the introduction of a coral predator (the crown-of-thorns starfish) and compared with undisturbed control colonies. Starfish reduced live coral cover by 95-100%, causing persistent negative effects on the recruitment of coral-associated fishes. Rapid reductions in new recruit abundance, greater numbers of unoccupied colonies and a shift in the recruit community structure from one dominated by coral-associated fishes before degradation to one predominantly composed of algal-associated fish species were observed. Our results suggest that while resistant to coral stress, coral death alters the process of replenishment of coral reef fish communities.

AB Despite a growing interest in species distribution modelling, relatively little attention has been paid to spatial autocorrelation and non-stationarity. Both spatial autocorrelation (the tendency for adjacent locations to be more similar than distant ones) and non-stationarity (the variation in modelled relationships over space) are likely to be common properties of ecological systems. This paper focuses on non-stationarity and uses two local techniques, geographically weighted regression (GWR) and varying coefficient modelling (VCM), to assess its impact on model predictions. We extend two published studies, one on the presence-absence of calandra larks in Spain and the other on bird species richness in Britain, to compare GWR and VCM with the more usual global generalized linear modelling (GLM) and generalized additive modelling (GAM). For the calandra lark data, GWR and VCM produced better-fitting models than GLM or GAM. VCM in particular gave significantly reduced spatial autocorrelation in the model residuals. GWR showed that individual predictors became stationary at different spatial scales, indicating that distributions are influenced by ecological processes operating over multiple scales. VCM was able to predict occurrence accurately on independent data from the same geographical area as the training data but not beyond, whereas the GAM produced good results on all areas. Individual predictions from the local methods often differed substantially from the global models. For the species richness data, VCM and GWR produced far better predictions than ordinary regression. Our analyses suggest that modellers interpolating data to produce maps for practical actions (e.g. conservation) should consider local methods, whereas they should not be used for extrapolation to new areas. We argue that local methods are complementary to global methods, revealing details of habitat associations and data properties which global methods average out and miss.

AB 1. The ability of many introduced fish species to thrive in degraded aquatic habitats and their potential to impact on aquatic ecosystem structure and function suggest that introduced fish may represent both a symptom and a cause of decline in river health and the integrity of native aquatic communities.
   2. The varying sensitivities of many commonly introduced fish species to degraded stream conditions, the mechanism and reason for their introduction and the differential susceptibility of local stream habitats to invasion because of the environmental and biological characteristics of the receiving water body, are all confounding factors that may obscure the interpretation of patterns of introduced fish species distribution and abundance and therefore their reliability as indicators of river health.
   3. In the present study, we address the question of whether alien fish (i.e. those species introduced from other countries) are a reliable indicator of the health of streams and rivers in south-eastern Queensland, Australia. We examine the relationships of alien fish species distributions and indices of abundance and biomass with the natural environmental features, the biotic characteristics of the local native fish assemblages and indicators of anthropogenic disturbance at a large number of sites subject to varying sources and intensities of human impact.
   4. Alien fish species were found to be widespread and often abundant in south-eastern Queensland rivers and streams, and the five species collected were considered to be relatively tolerant to river degradation, making them good candidate indicators of river health. Variation in alien species indices was unrelated to the size of the study sites, the sampling effort expended or natural environmental gradients. The biological resistance of the native fish fauna was not concluded to be an important factor mediating invasion success by alien species. Variation in alien fish indices was, however, strongly related to indicators of disturbance intensity describing local in-stream habitat and riparian degradation, water quality and surrounding land use, particularly the amount of urban development in the catchment.
   5. Potential confounding factors that may influence the likelihood of introduction and successful establishment of an alien species and the implications of these factors for river bioassessment are discussed. We conclude that the potentially strong impact that many alien fish species can have on the biological integrity of natural aquatic ecosystems, together with their potential to be used as an initial basis to find out other forms of human disturbance impacts, suggest that some alien species (particularly species from the family Poeciliidae) can represent a reliable 'first cut' indicator of river health.

AB Larvae of the sessile marine invertebrate Bugula neritina (Bryozoa) are protected by an effective chemical defense. From the larvae, we isolated three bryostatin-class macrocyclic polyketides, including the novel bryostatin 20, that deterred feeding by a common planktivorous fish that co-occurs with B. neritina. A unique bacterial symbiont of B. neritina, Endobugula sertula, was hypothesized as the putative source of the bryostatins. We show that: (1) bryostatins are concentrated in B. neritina larvae and protect them against predation by fish; (2) the adults are not defended by bryostatins; and (3) E. sertula produces bryostatins. This study represents the first example from the marine environment of a microbial symbiont producing an anti-predator defense for its host and, in this case, specifically for the host's larval stage, which is exceptionally vulnerable to predators.

AB Current assessments of climate-change effects on ecosystems use two key approaches: (1) empirical synthesis and modeling of species range shifts and life-cycle processes that coincide with recent evidence of climate warming, from which scenarios of ecosystem change are inferred; and (2) experiments examining plant-soil interactions under simulated climate warming. Both kinds of assessment offer indisputable evidence that climate change and its effects on ecosystems are ongoing. However, both approaches often provide conservative estimates of the effects of climate change on ecosystems, because they do not consider the interplay and feedback among higher trophic levels in ecosystems, which may have a large effect on plant species composition and on ecosystem services such as productivity, Understanding the impacts of these top-down processes on ecosystems is critical for determining large-scale ecosystem response to climate change. Using examples of links between climate forcing, trophic interactions, and changes in ecosystem state in selected terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems, we show that the ability to understand and accurately forecast future effects of climate change requires an integrated perspective, linking climate and the biotic components of the ecosystem as a whole.

AB Climate change treatments - winter warming, summer drought and increased summer precipitation - have been imposed on an upland grassland continuously for 7 years. The vegetation was surveyed yearly. In the seventh year, soil samples were collected on four occasions through the growing season in order to assess mycorrhizal fungal abundance. Mycorrhizal fungal colonisation of roots and extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal (EMH) density in the soil were both affected by the climatic manipulations, especially by summer drought. Both winter warming and summer drought increased the proportion of root length colonised (RLC) and decreased the density of external mycorrhizal hyphal. Much of the response of mycorrhizal fungi to climate change could be attributed to climate-induced changes in the vegetation, especially plant species relative abundance. However, it is possible that some of the mycorrhizal response to the climatic manipulations was direct - for example, the response of the EMH density to the drought treatment. Future work should address the likely change in mycorrhizal functioning under warmer and drier conditions.

AB Previous research suggested that the hydraulic properties of root systems of intact plants could be described by two parameters: the hydraulic conductivity (Lp(r)) or the slope of the flow-density/water potential gradient relationship, and the offset or minimum water potential gradient required to induce flow. In this study, Lp(r) and offset were correlated with anatomical features of the root radial path in plants with contrasting root anatomy. Two woody and three herbaceous species were examined which exhibit a range of root anatomical features: Asparagus densiflorus (Kunth) Jessop (asparagus), Dendrobium superbum Rchb. f. (dendrobium), Glycine max (L.) Merr. (soybean), Prunus persica (L.) Batsch. (peach), Citrus aurantium L. (sour orange). Lp(r) varied about 8-fold, and the offset varied about 6-fold among the five species. Lp(r) was inversely related to root diameter (r(2) = 0.39) and cortex width (r(2) = 0.55), suggesting that species with thinner roots or roots with a thin cortex had the highest Lp(r). Further observations suggested that the cortex width was a stronger determinant of Lp(r) than root diameter. However, the offset was not correlated with root diameter, stele diameter or cortex width, but was >2-fold higher in species having an exodermis in the root radial path (sour orange, asparagus, and dendrobium) compared to those lacking an exodermis (peach and soybean). The data of root Lp(r) obtained were similar to those given in the literature for both intact plants and excised roots which have been measured with different techniques. It is concluded that Lp(r) and offset, which describe the flow-water potential relationship for intact root systems, are related to differences in the root cortex; specifically, its thickness and the presence/absence of a suberized exodermis. Hence, these anatomical differences may, in part, cause the variability in root hydraulic properties that exists among plant species.

AB Understanding how landscape components affect the urban heat islands is crucial for urban ecological planning and sustainable development.
   The purpose of this study was to quantify the spatial pattern of land surface temperatures (LSTs) and associated heat fluxes in relation to land-cover types in Beijing, China, using portable infrared thermometers, thermal infrared imagers, and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer.
   The spatial differences and the relationships between LSTs and the hierarchical landscape structure were analyzed with in situ observations of surface radiation and heat fluxes.
   Large LST differences were found among various land-use/land-cover types, urban structures, and building materials. Within the urban area, the mean LST of urban impervious surfaces was about 6-12 A degrees C higher than that of the urban green space. LSTs of built-up areas were on average 3-6 A degrees C higher than LSTs of rural areas. The observations for surface radiation and heat fluxes indicated that the differences were caused by different fractions of sensible heat or latent heat flux in net radiation. LSTs decreased with increasing elevation and normalized difference vegetation index.
   Variations in building materials and urban structure significantly influenced the spatial pattern of LSTs in urban areas. By contrast, elevation and vegetation cover are the major determinants of the LST pattern in rural areas. To alleviate urban heat island intensity, urban planners and policy makers should pay special attention to the selection of appropriate building materials, the reasonable arrangement of urban structures, and the rational design of landscape components.

AB Our dependence on biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES) is increasing, due to population expansion and economic growth. Consequently, maintaining biodiversity and sustaining ES supply should consistently be incorporated into conservation project objectives. We reviewed 238 scientific articles to evaluate current knowledge, guided by three questions: (I) How do we identify important sites for ES conservation? (2) How can we maximize synergy between biodiversity and ES during conservation planning? (3) Does integrating the concept of ES provide new tools to facilitate biodiversity conservation? We found that the most effective approach to identifying ES priority areas for conservation is based on quantifiable biophysical indicators as well as their spatiotemporal flow scale. Moreover, we found that the general lack of spatial congruence between biodiversity and ES is attributable to: (i) the type of data used for ES mapping; (ii) the greater accuracy of functional diversity, compared to other biodiversity features, in predicting ES provision; (iii) the higher positive spatial correlation of regulating services with biodiversity, whereas provisioning services are negatively correlated. Systematic conservation planning procedures based on site complementarity would increase the efficiency of both biodiversity and ES conservation. Economic valuation of ES, such as through cost-benefit analysis, could help to justify conservation actions by showing that the financial benefits of nature conservation greatly exceed the cost. Moreover, payments for ecosystem services could create new incentives and funding sources for the conservation of biodiversity. We conclude by proposing areas for further research for the fostering of conservation synergies between biodiversity and ES. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We quantified the relative influence of maternal fidelity to feeding grounds and natal fidelity to breeding grounds on the population structure of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae based on an ocean-wide survey of mitochondrial (mt) DNA diversity in the North Pacific. For 2193 biopsy samples collected from whales in 10 feeding regions and 8 breeding regions during the winter and summer of 2004 to 2006, we first used microsatellite genotyping (average, 9.5 loci) to identify replicate samples. From sequences of the mtDNA control region (500 bp) we identified 28 unique haplotypes from 30 variable sites. Haplotype frequencies differed markedly among feeding regions (overall F-ST = 0.121, Phi(ST) = 0.178, p < 0.0001), supporting previous evidence of strong maternal fidelity. Haplotype frequencies also differed markedly among breeding regions (overall F-ST = 0.093, Phi(ST) = 0.106, p < 0.0001), providing evidence of strong natal fidelity. Although sex-biased dispersal was not evident, differentiation of microsatellite allele frequencies was weak compared to differentiation of mtDNA haplotypes, suggesting male-biased gene flow. Feeding and breeding regions showed significant differences in haplotype frequencies, even for regions known to be strongly connected by patterns of individual migration. Thus, the influence of migratory fidelity seems to operate somewhat independently on feeding and breeding grounds over an evolutionary time scale. This results in a complex population structure and the potential to define multiple units to conserve in either seasonal habitat.

AB Growing concern about the influence of climate change on flowering plants, pollinators, and the mutualistic interactions between them has led to a recent surge in research. Much of this research has addressed the consequences of warming for phenological and distributional shifts. In contrast, relatively little is known about the physiological responses of plants and insect pollinators to climate warming and, in particular, how these responses might affect plant-pollinator interactions. Here, we summarize the direct physiological effects of temperature on flowering plants and pollinating insects to highlight ways in which plant and pollinator responses could affect floral resources for pollinators, and pollination success for plants, respectively. We also consider the overall effects of these responses on plant-pollinator interaction networks. Plant responses to warming, which include altered flower, nectar, and pollen production, could modify floral resource availability and reproductive output of pollinating insects. Similarly, pollinator responses, such as altered foraging activity, body size, and life span, could affect patterns of pollen flow and pollination success of flowering plants. As a result, network structure could be altered as interactions are gained and lost, weakened and strengthened, even without the gain or loss of species or temporal overlap. Future research that addresses not only how plant and pollinator physiology are affected by warming but also how responses scale up to affect interactions and networks should allow us to better understand and predict the effects of climate change on this important ecosystem service.

AB Savanna covers about two-thirds of Africa, with forage quantity and quality being important factors determining the distribution and density of wildlife and domestic stock. Testing hypotheses about the distribution of herbivores is hampered by the absence of reliable methods for measuring the variability of vegetation quality (e.g. biochemical composition) across the landscape. It is demonstrated that hyperspectral remote sensing fills this gap by revealing simultaneously the spatial variation of foliar nitrogen (crude protein) as well as the total amount of polyphenols, in grasses and trees. For the first time, the pattern of resources important for feeding preferences in herbivores (polyphenols and nitrogen) is mapped across an extensive landscape and the modeled foliar concentrations are shown to fit with ecological knowledge of the area. We explain how estimates of nitrogen (crude protein) and polyphenols may be scaled up from point-based observations to reveal their spatial pattern, and how the variation in forage quality can influence the management of savannas, including farms, communal grazing areas, and conservation areas. It provides a glimpse of the choices herbivores must face in selecting food resources of different qualities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To identify the effect of nitrogen (N) nutrition on photosynthetic efficiency and mesophyll conductance of rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L., cv. 'Shanyou 63' hybrid indica China), hydroponic experiments with different concentrations of N were conducted in a greenhouse. Although leaf N concentration on a dry mass basis increased with increasing supply of N, no significant differences in seedling biomass were observed. A higher light-saturated CO2 assimilation rate (A) with a high concentration of supplied N was associated with a higher carboxylation efficiency (CE), but not a higher apparent quantum yield (alpha). Based on classic photosynthetic models, both the Rubisco content and the ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration rate were sufficient for light-saturated photosynthesis in rice seedlings; the estimated chloroplastic CO2 concentration (C-c) and mesophyll conductance (g(m)) demonstrated that a low C-c was the ultimate limiting factor to photosynthetic efficiency with a higher N supply. Due to a greater chloroplast size (i.e. a shorter distance to the plasma membrane) with a higher supply of N, the CO2 transport resistance in the liquid phase (g(liq)) in high-N leaves was lower than that in low-N leaves, which resulted in higher g(m) and C-c in high-N leaves. Although CEA/Ci was higher with a high supply of N, there were no differences in CEA/Cc between plants grown with different concentrations of N, indicating that the carboxylation capacity of Rubisco between plants grown at different N concentrations was constant. The enhanced photosynthetic rate with supply of a high N concentration was attributed to a higher CO2 concentration in the chloroplasts, related to a higher mesophyll conductance due to an increased chloroplast size.

AB Spatially periodic vegetation patterns, forming gaps, bands, labyrinths, or spots, are characteristic of arid and semiarid landscapes. Self-organization models can explain this variety of structures within a unified conceptual framework. All these models are based on the interplay of positive and negative effects of plants on soil water, but they can be divided according to whether they assume the interactions to be mediated by water redistribution through runoff/diffusion or by plants' organs. We carried out a multi-proxy approach of the processes operating in a gapped pattern in southwest Niger dominated by a shrub species. Soil moisture within the root layer was monitored in time and space over one month of the rainy season. Soil water recharge displayed no spatial variation with respect to vegetation cover, but the stock half-life under cover was twice that of bare areas. A kernel of facilitation by the aboveground parts of shrubs was parameterized, and soil water half-life was significantly correlated to the cumulated facilitative effects of shrubs. The kernel range was found to be smaller than the canopy radius (81%). This effect of plants on soil water dynamics, probably through a reduction of evaporation by shading, is shown to be a better explanatory variable than potentially relevant soil and topography parameters. The root systems of five individuals of Combretum micranthum G. Don were excavated. Root density data were used as a proxy to parameterize a kernel function of interplant competition. The range of this kernel was larger than the canopy radius (125%). The facilitation-to-competition range ratio, reflecting the above-to-belowground ratio of plant lateral extent, was smaller than 1 (0.64), a result supporting models assuming that patterning may emerge from an adaptation of plant morphology to aridity and shallow soils by means of an extended lateral root system. Moreover, observed soil water gradients had directions opposite to those assumed by alternative mathematical models based on underground water diffusion. This study contributes to the growing awareness that combined facilitative and competitive plant interactions can induce landscape-scale patterns and shape the two-way feedback loops between environment and vegetation.

AB The relative influence of temperature versus local physical factors on the spatial distribution of riverine fish species was investigated in a large watershed of south-western France. Using generalised additive models and hierarchical partitioning, we modelled the ecological responses of 28 fish species to a set of five environmental predictors, and we quantified the independent effect of each predictor. The spatial distribution of fish species was primarily determined by both mean temperature and position along the upstream-downstream gradient. However, responses to these environmental factors varied according to the species considered. Fish species with strong thermal requirements (e.g., common carp, black bullhead, Atlantic salmon) were mainly sensitive to temperature whereas longitudinal gradient was of primary importance for downstream species (e.g., common bream, largemouth bass, pike perch). Both the statistical methods used gave concordant results and appeared complementary. This dual-approach, quantifying the relative contribution of each environmental factor, appears particularly useful to understand the spatial distribution of stream fish species. Separating the effects of temperature versus habitat factors is crucial to accurately predict species distribution modifications in the current context of global change.

AB The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts an increase in global temperatures of between 1.4 degrees C and 5.8 degrees C during the 21st century, as a result of elevated CO2 levels. Using bioclimatic envelope models, we evaluate the potential impact of climate change on the distributions and species richness of 120 native terrestrial non-volant European mammals under two of IPCC's future climatic scenarios. Assuming unlimited and no migration, respectively, our model predicts that 1% or 5-9% of European mammals risk extinction, while 32-46% or 70-78% may be severely threatened (lose > 30% of their current distribution) under the two scenarios. Under the no migration assumption endemic species were predicted to be strongly negatively affected by future climatic changes, while widely distributed species would be more mildly affected. Finally, potential mammalian species richness is predicted to become dramatically reduced in the Mediterranean region but increase towards the northeast and for higher elevations. Bioclimatic envelope models do not account for non-climatic factors such as land-use, biotic interactions, human interference, dispersal or history, and our results should therefore be seen as first approximations of the potential magnitude of future climatic changes.

AB The estimation of the road edge effect is useful to understand changes induced by the road network on ecosystems. Road networks on islands may break ecosystem integrity through microclimate edge effects, which are known to be associated with disturbances to animal and plant communities. Road edge effects have been scarcely studied on oceanic islands. In this paper we studied road edge effects on microclimate and canopy structure in laurel and pine forests in Tenerife (Canary Islands). We assessed depth of road edge effect for temperature at four vertical layers (soil, litter and air at 5 cm and 1.3 m above ground), light intensity, canopy cover and height, in transects running from narrow (6-7 m width) asphalt roads and dust trails to 100 m to the interior of both forests. We used an ANOVA procedure with Helmert difference contrasts to identify the distances along transects over which edge effects were significant. We detected significant gradients for most parameters but they were consistently narrow both within and between forests. In the laurel forest, we detected highly significant gradients for soil temperature, light, and canopy cover and height in both asphalt and unpaved roads. In the pine forest, we detected a highly significant gradient for soil temperature at asphalt roads, and a significant light gradient for both asphalt and unpaved roads. From the road edge to the forest interior, significant temperature changes persisted for only 3 m, light variation persisted for 6 m, and canopy cover and height changed significantly within the first 10 m. Asphalt roads and dust trails revealed different patterns of variation for temperature between edge and interior. No differences were found between the two types of roads in edge-interior trends for light or canopy structure. The abruptness of microclimate and canopy gradients was slightly higher in the laurel forest than in the pine forest, caused by a higher edge contrast in the former. The depth of the road edge effect found in laurel and pine forests was small, but it could have cumulative effects on forest microclimate and forest associated biota at the island scale. Such changes deserve attention by local road managers for planning and design purposes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

AB Reef fishes are significant socially, nutritionally and economically, yet biologically they are vulnerable to both over-exploitation and degradation of their habitat. Their importance in the tropics for living conditions, human health, food security and economic development is enormous, with millions of people and hundreds of thousands of communities directly dependent, and many more indirectly so. Reef fish fisheries are also critical safety valves in times of economic or social hardship or disturbance, and are more efficient, less wasteful and support far more livelihoods per tonne produced than industrial scale fisheries. Yet, relative to other fisheries globally, those associated with coral reefs are under-managed, under-funded, under-monitored, and as a consequence, poorly understood or little regarded by national governments. Even among non-governmental organizations, which are increasingly active in tropical marine issues, there is typically little focus on reef-associated resources, the interest being more on biodiversity per se or protection of coral reef habitat. This essay explores the background and history to this situation, examines fishery trends over the last 3 0 years, and charts a possible way forward given the current realities of funding, capacity, development patterns and scientific understanding of coral reef ecosystems. The luxury live reef food-fish trade is used throughout as a case study because it exemplifies many of the problems and challenges of attaining sustainable use of coral reef-associated resources. The thesis developed is that sustaining reef fish fisheries and conserving biodiversity can be complementary, rather than contradictory, in terms of yield from reef systems. I identify changes in perspectives needed to move forward, suggest that we must be cautious of 'fashionable' solutions or apparent 'quick fixes', and argue that fundamental decisions must be made concerning the short and long-term values of coral reef-associated resources, particularly fish, for food and cash and regarding alternative sources of protein. Not to address the problems will inevitably lead to growing poverty, hardship and social unrest in many areas.

AB Human activities in the past few hundred years have caused enormous impacts on many ecosystems, greatly accelerating the rate of population decline and extinction. In addition to habitat alteration and destruction, the loss of genetic diversity due to reduced population size has become a major conservation issue for many imperiled species. However, the genetic effects of persistent population bottlenecks can be very different for long-lived and short-lived species when considering the time scale of centuries. To investigate the genetic effects of persistent population bottlenecks on long-lived species, we use microsatellite markers to assess the level of genetic diversity of a small ornate box turtle population that has experienced a persistent bottleneck in the past century, and compare it to a large relatively undisturbed population. The genetic signature of a recent bottleneck is detected by examining the deviation from mutation-drift equilibrium in the small population, but the bottleneck had little effect on its level of genetic diversity. Computer simulations combined with information on population structure suggest that an effective population size of 300, which results in a census population size of 700, would be required for the small population to maintain 90% of the average number of alleles per locus in the next 200 years. The life history of long-lived species could mask the accelerated rate of genetic drift, making population recovery a relatively slow process. Statistical analysis of genetic data and empirical-based computer simulations can be important tools to facilitate conservation planning.

AB 1. Species extinction in fragmented habitats is a non-random process described by transient, rather than equilibrium dynamics. Therefore, 'static' approaches focusing on experimentally established spatial gradients of diversity may fail to capture essential aspects of ecosystem responses to species loss.
   2. Here we document temporal changes in microarthropod species abundance, biomass and richness during a community disassembly trajectory following experimental habitat fragmentation of a moss-based microecosystem.
   3. Habitat fragmentation reduced heterotrophic species richness and community biomass in remnant moss fragments. Extinction was biased towards rare species, and thus occurred initially without significant changes in total community abundance and biomass. Eventual reductions in abundance and biomass were found to lag behind observed declines in species richness.
   4. The presence of moss-habitat corridors connecting fragments to a large 'mainland' area coupled with an immigration rescue effect maintained microarthropod richness, abundance and biomass within remnant fragments.
   5. Our results indicate that both the order of species loss and the dynamics of remnant populations influence the magnitude and timing of ecosystem-level responses to habitat destruction and isolation.

AB Lateral gene transfers are frequent among prokaryotes, although their detection remains difficult. If all genes are equally affected, this questions the very existence of an organismal phylogeny. The complexity hypothesis postulates the existence of a core of genes (those involved in numerous interactions) that are unaffected by transfers. To test the hypothesis, we studied all the proteins involved in translation from 45 eubacterial taxa, and developed a new phylogenetic method to detect transfers. Few of the genes studied show evidence for transfer. The phylogeny based on the genes devoid of transfer is very consistent with the ribosomal RNA tree, suggesting that an eubacterial phylogeny does exist.

AB Effects of leaf age, nitrogen nutrition and photon flux density (PFD) on the organization of the photosynthetic apparatus in leaves were investigated in a vine, Ipomoea tricolor Cav., which was grown horizontally so as to avoid mutual shading of leaves. The plants were grown hydroponically at two nitrate levels under two growth light treatments. For one group of the plants, leaves were exposed to full sunlight. For another group, respective leaves were artificially shaded in a manner that simulated changes in the light gradient with the development of an erect herbaceous canopy: old leaves were placed under progressively shadier conditions with growth of the plants (canopy-type shading). In all the treatments, chlorophyll (Chi) content gradually decreased with leaf age. Photosystem I (PSI) per Chl was constant, independent of leaf age, nitrogen nutrition and/or PFD. Photosystem II (PSII) and cytochrome f per Chi, and Chl alb ratio were independent of leaf age and/or nitrogen nutrition but decreased with the decrease in growth PFD. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39, RuBPCase) per Chi steeply decreased with decrease in PFD. When leaves grown at the same PFD were compared, RuBPCase/Chl was lower in the plants grown under lower nitrogen availability and also decreased with leaf age in the plants grown without shading. These decreases were attributed to the curvilinear relationship between RuBPCase and Chi in leaves grown at full sunlight, that was independent of nitrogen availability and leaf age. From these results, it is concluded that the composition of the photosynthetic apparatus is independent of leaf age but changes depending on the light environment and total amount of photosynthetic components of the leaf.
