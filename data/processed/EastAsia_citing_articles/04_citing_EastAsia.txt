AB The plastid-bearing members of the Cryptophyta contain two functional eukaryotic genomes of different phylogenetic origin, residing in the nucleus and in the nucleomorph, respectively. These widespread and diverse protists thus offer a unique opportunity to study the coevolution of two different eukaryotic genomes within one group of organisms. In this study, the SSU rRNA genes of both genomes were PCR-amplified with specific primers and phylogenetic analyses were performed on different data sets using different evolutionary models. The results show that the composition of the principal clades obtained from the phylogenetic analyses of both genes was largely congruent, but striking differences in evolutionary rates were observed. These affected the topologies of the nuclear and nucleomorph phylogenies differently, resulting in long-branch attraction artifacts when simple evolutionary models were applied. Deletion of long-branch taxa stabilized the internal branching order in both phylogenies and resulted in a completely resolved topology in the nucleomorph phylogeny. A comparison of the tree topologies derived from SSU rDNA sequences with characters previously used in cryptophyte systematics revealed that the biliprotein type was congruent, but the type of inner periplast component incongruent, with the molecular trees. The latter is indicative of a hidden cellular dimorphism (cells with two periplast types present in a single clonal strain) of presumably widespread occurrence throughout cryptophyte diversity, which, in consequence, has far-reaching implications for cryptophyte systematics as it is practiced today.

AB The scientific foundations of conservation policy are the subject of a recent tripolar debate, with systematists arguing for the primacy of phylogenetic rankings, ecologists arguing for protection at the level of populations or ecosystems, and evolutionary biologists urging more attention for the factors that enhance adaptation and biodiversity. In the field of conservation genetics, this controversy is manifested in the diverse viewpoints of molecular systematists, population biologists, and evolutionary (and quantitative) geneticists. A resolution of these viewpoints is proposed here, based on the premise that preserving particular objects (genes, species, or ecosystems) is not the ultimate goal of conservation. In order to be successful, conservation efforts must preserve the processes of life. This task requires the identification and protection of diverse branches in the tree of life (phylogenetics), the maintenance of life-support systems for organisms (ecology), and the continued adaptation of organisms to changing environments (evolution). None of these objectives alone is sufficient to preserve the threads of life across time. Under this temporal perspective, molecular genetic technologies have applications in all three conservation agendas; DNA sequence comparisons serve the phylogenetic goals, population genetic markers serve the ecological goals, quantitative genetics and genome explorations serve the evolutionary goals.

AB The abundance of reef fishes is often influenced by the availability of potential shelter sites. The most prevalent hypothesis explaining this relationship between fish density and shelter is that post-settlement predation causes greater mortality in areas with little shelter vs, areas with abundant shelter. This hypothesis was tested with a set of field experiments, in which the availability of shelter and exposure to predators were manipulated orthogonally. The effects of shelter and predators were measured for recruitment and survival of two temperate reef fishes: the bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli Gilbert) and the blackeye goby (Coryphopterus nicholsii Bean). Shelter was manipulated by creating isolated l-mz reefs that were composed of three densities of rocks (16, 32 and 64 rocks/m(2)), which both species of goby used for shelter. A preliminary set of experiments done on reefs exposed to predators revealed that recruitment and survival of both fishes were positively affected by the density of rocks. The main set of experiments revealed the proximate causes of these effects of shelter. Replicate reefs of all three shelter treatments were either kept free of predators (enclosed in predator-exclosure cages) or exposed to predators (enclosed in partial cages). In Coryphopterus, survival and recruitment varied among shelter treatments on reefs exposed to predators, but not on reefs free of predators. This result indicates that shelter influenced the density of Coryphopterus by altering the impact of predators, thus supporting the prevailing hypothesis. In contrast, the effects of shelter on Lythrypnus were not caused solely by altering the impact of predation: survival and recruitment both varied among shelter treatments even when predators were absent. For survival of Lythrypnus, differences among shelter treatments were larger on reefs exposed to predators than on reefs free of predators, indicating that shelter did also modify the impact of predation. However, recruitment of Lythrypnus was affected similarly by shelter treatments regardless of whether predators were present or absent. Therefore, the effects of shelter were not caused by altering the impact of predators, and instead, it appeared that recruits responded directly to the abundance of shelter. These results indicate that for some reef fishes, positive relationships between abundance and shelter may not be caused by lower rates of predation in areas with abundant shelter. Instead, such relationships between abundance and shelter may be driven by prey preferences (exerted at or after the time of settlement) for areas with abundant shelter, or by use of shelter sites for purposes other than refuge from predators. Therefore, in the absence of any other evidence supporting a role of predation, positive relationships between the density of reef fishes and the abundance of shelter should not be construed as proof of the importance of predation in determining the abundance of reef fishes.

AB The effect of the host plant on the efficacy of Verticillium chlamydosporium as a biological control agent for root-knot nematodes was investigated in four experiments. The growth of the fungus in the rhizosphere differed significantly with different plant species, the brassicas (kale and cabbage) supporting the most extensive colonization. The presence of nematodes in roots increased the growth of the fungus on most plants, and this effect was associated with the emergence of egg masses on the root surface; the presence of Meloidogyne incognita did not stimulate growth of the fungus in the rhizosphere until 5 weeks after the addition of infective juveniles to soil. The susceptibility of the plant host to M. incognita attack influenced the numbers of nematode eggs parasitized by the fungus. The control of the nematode was less effective on tomato roots, which produced large galls as a result of nematode infection compared with control on potato roots where galls were smaller, despite the greater abundance of the fungus in the rhizosphere of tomato plants. In large galls, a significant proportion of the egg masses remained embedded in the roots and was isolated from the fungus which was confined to the rhizosphere. Hence, the plant species has a marked effect on the efficacy of V. chlamydosporium as a biological control agent.

AB 1. Fluctuating asymmetry, which represents small, random deviations from bilateral symmetry, arises as a result of an inability to control development under genetically and environmentally stressful conditions. Herbivory is also particularly common in plants growing under stressful conditions. It was hypothesized that herbivory would be particularly prevalent in plants with leaves demonstrating high degrees of fluctuating asymmetry. This prediction was tested for the leaf-mining insect, Rhynchaenus rufus, which commonly attacks elm Ulmus glabra.
   2. Leaves with mines were significantly more asymmetrical in the width of their two halves and the distance between side-ribs, than the nearest neighbouring leaf without a mine. Elm trees with a high incidence of leaf mines had significantly more asymmetric leaves than the nearest neighbouring elm tree with a low incidence of leaf mines. This was the case regardless of whether affected or unaffected leaves were compared.
   3. The incidence of leaf mines across trees was positively related to the degree of leaf asymmetry of the tree. Developmental stability of leaves, as measured by fluctuating asymmetry, was therefore associated with susceptibility to one kind of herbivory in elm trees.
   4. Leaves of elm trees watered with a large amount of fertilizer were more asymmetric than leaves of trees just provided with water, suggesting that one kind of stress increased the level of leaf asymmetry. The relationship between foliar asymmetry and herbivory appeared to be causal since increased asymmetry caused by the fertilizer treatment gave rise to an increased abundance of leaf miners.

AB Sugar beets (Beta vulgaris L. cv F58-554H1) were grown hydroponically in a 16-h light, 8-h dark period (photosynthetic photon flux density of 0.5 mmol m(-2) s(-1)) for 4 weeks from sowing in half-strength Hoagland nutrient solution containing 7.5 mM nitrate. Half of the plants were then transferred to 7.5 mM ammonium N; the rest remained in solution with 7.5 mM nitrate N. Upon transfer from nitrate to ammonium, the total N concentration decreased sharply in the fibrous roots and petiole/midribs and increased substantially in the leaf blades. This was because of the decreased nitrate concentrations in fibrous roots and petioles and a concomitant increase in amino acid/amide-N and protein N in leaf blades, Sugar beets acclimated to ammonium partly by a 2.5-fold increase in glutamine synthase activity in fibrous roots and a 1.7-fold increase in leaf blades. Rapid ammonium assimilation into glutamine consumed carbon skeletons, leading to a depletion of foliar starch, sucrose, and maltose. Ammonium treatment stimulated activities of some glycolytic/krebs cycle enzymes, e.g. pyruvate dehydrogenase. Nitrate-fed leaf blades contained substantially larger concentrations of osmolytes (i.e. nitrate, cations, and sucrose), which may have contributed to the faster rates of leaf expansion in nitrate-fed compared to ammonium-fed plants.

AB Sustainable cotton production requires pest management systems that enhance the role of natural regulatory mechanisms. One such mechanism is compensatory growth, the subject of this review. Current hypotheses to explain compensatory growth of cotton after the loss of reproductive structures place emphasis on yield components and consider only to limited extent source/sink relationships for carbon. The aim of this review is to integrate into these hypotheses, mechanisms accounting for other physiological and morphological changes induced by loss of reproductive-structures.
   This paper (a) summarises the current hypotheses to explain cotton yield compensation for pest damage affecting reproductive organs, (b) analyses the nutritional and hormonal hypotheses of coordination of growth on the grounds that fruit loss strongly affects the economies of carbon and nitrogen as well as the balance of plant-growth regulators, (c) presents the hypothesis that actual yield responses will depend on the combined effects of fruit loss on yield potential (as affected by changes in acquisition and partitioning of carbon and nitrogen), and on growing conditions (as affected by changes in the spatial pattern on the plant and seasonal timing of fruiting). This hypothesis could provide a framework for experimental and simulation studies on yield compensation in cotton.

AB The growth rates of woody plants depend on both the rate of photosynthetic carbon gain and the availability of essential nutrients. Instantaneous carbon gain is known to increase in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, but it is uncertain whether this will translate into increased growth in the longer term under nutrient-limited conditions. An analytical model to address this question was developed by Comins and McMurtrie (1993, Ecological Applications 3, 666-681). Their model was further tested and analysed. Manipulation of various assumptions in the model revealed its key assumptions and allowed a more confident prediction of expected growth responses to CO2 enrichment under nutrient-limited conditions.
   The analysis indicated that conclusions about the CO2 sensitivity of production were strongly influenced by assumptions about the relationship between foliar and heartwood nitrogen concentrations. With heartwood nitrogen concentration proportional to foliar nitrogen concentration, the model predicted a strong response of plant productivity to increasing CO2 concentration, whereas with heartwood nitrogen concentration set constant, the model predicted only a very slight growth response to changing CO2 concentration. On the other hand, predictions were only slightly affected by: (1) assumptions about the extent of nitrogen retranslocation out of senescing roots and foliage or wood during heartwood formation; (2) the effects of nitrogen status on specific Leaf area or (3) leaf longevity; (4) carbon allocation between different plant parts; or (5) changes in the N:C ratio of organic matter sequestered in the passive pool of soil organic matter. Modification of the effect of foliar nitrogen concentration on the light utilization coefficient had only a small effect on the CO2 sensitivity for pines. However, this conclusion was strongly dependent on the chosen relationship between single-leaf photosynthesis and leaf nitrogen concentration. Overall, the analysis suggested that trees growing under nitrogen-limited conditions can respond to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration with considerable increases in growth.

AB Mycorrhizal fungi are critical members of the plant microbiome, forming a symbiosis with the roots of most plants on Earth. Most plant species partner with either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi, and these symbioses are thought to represent plant adaptations to fast and slow soil nutrient cycling rates. This generates a second hypothesis, that arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal plant species traits complement and reinforce these fungal strategies, resulting in nutrient acquisitive vs. conservative plant trait profiles. Here we analyzed 17,764 species level trait observations from 2,940 woody plant species to show that mycorrhizal plants differ systematically in nitrogen and phosphorus economic traits. Differences were clearest in temperate latitudes, where ectomycorrhizal plant species are more nitrogen use- and phosphorus use-conservative than arbuscular mycorrhizal species. This difference is reflected in both aboveground and belowground plant traits and is robust to controlling for evolutionary history, nitrogen fixation ability, deciduousness, latitude, and species climate niche. Furthermore, mycorrhizal effects are large and frequently similar to or greater in magnitude than the influence of plant nitrogen fixation ability or deciduous vs. evergreen leaf habit. Ectomycorrhizal plants are also more nitrogen conservative than arbuscular plants in boreal and tropical ecosystems, although differences in phosphorus use are less apparent outside temperate latitudes. Our findings bolster current theories of ecosystems rooted in mycorrhizal ecology and support the hypothesis that plant mycorrhizal association is linked to the evolution of plant nutrient economic strategies.

AB 1. Intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES) are watercourses that cease flow at some point in time and space. Arguably Earth's most widespread type of flowing water, IRES are expanding where Anthropocenic climates grow drier and human demands for water escalate.
   2. However, IRES have attracted far less research than perennial rivers and are undervalued by society, jeopardizing their restoration or protection. Provision of ecosystem services by IRES is especially poorly understood, hindering their integration into management plans in most countries.
   3. We conceptualize how flow intermittence governs ecosystem service provision and transfers at local and river-basin scales during flowing, non-flowing and dry phases. Even when dry or not flowing, IRES perform multiple ecosystem services that complement those of nearby perennial rivers.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Conceptualizing how flow intermittence in rivers and streams governs ecosystem services has applied a socio-ecological perspective for validating the ecosystem services of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams. This can be applied at all flow phases and in assessing impacts of altered flow intermittence on rivers and their ecosystem services in the Anthropocene.

AB High-throughput sequencing metabarcoding studies in marine biosecurity have largely focused on targeting environmental DNA (eDNA). DNA can persist extracellularly in the environment, making discrimination of living organisms difficult. In this study, bilge water samples (i.e., water accumulating on-board a vessel during transit) were collected from 15 small recreational and commercial vessels. eDNA and eRNA molecules were co-extracted and the V4 region of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene targeted for metabarcoding. In total, 62.7% of the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were identified at least once in the corresponding eDNA and eRNA reads, with 19.5% unique to eDNA and 17.7% to eRNA. There were substantial differences in diversity between molecular compartments; 57% of sequences from eDNA-only OTUs belonged to fungi, likely originating from legacy DNA. In contrast, there was a higher percentage of metazoan (50.2%) and ciliate (31.7%) sequences in the eRNA-only OTUs. Our data suggest that the presence of eRNA-only OTUs could be due to increased cellular activities of some rare taxa that were not identified in the eDNA datasets, unusually high numbers of rRNA transcripts in ciliates, and/or artefacts produced during the reverse transcriptase, PCR and sequencing steps. The proportions of eDNA/eRNA shared and unshared OTUs were highly heterogeneous within individual bilge water samples. Multiple factors including boat type and the activities performed on-board, such as washing of scientific equipment, may play a major role in contributing to this variability. For some marine biosecurity applications analysis, eDNA-only data may be sufficient, however there are an increasing number of instances where distinguishing the living portion of a community is essential. For these circumstances, we suggest only including OTUs that are present in both eDNA and eRNA data. OTUs found only in the eRNA data need to be interpreted with caution until further research provides conclusive evidence for their origin.

AB Future genetic progress in wheat grain yield will depend on increasing above-ground biomass and this must be achieved without commensurate increases in N fertilizer inputs to minimise environmental impacts. Our objective was to quantify variation in grain yield, above-ground biomass and N-use efficiency (NUE) and associated traits in a panel of diverse hexaploid wheat germplasm comprising: (i) landraces from the AE Watkins collection, (ii) synthetic-derived hexaploid lines in a cv. Paragon spring wheat background and (iii) UK modern cultivars including cv. Paragon under low N and high N conditions. A field experiment was carried out in two seasons examining 15 genotypes (five landraces, five synthetic-derived (SD) hexaploid lines and five UK modern cultivars) under low N and high N conditions at Nottingham University farm, UK. Machine-harvested grain yield, above-ground biomass and NUE were measured. Physiological traits were assessed including flag-leaf light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)) and relative chlorophyll content (SPAD) under HN conditions; and flag-leaf senescence duration and rate and Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) under LN and HN conditions. Under HN conditions, the modern cultivars overall produced higher grain yield than the SD lines (+9.7%) and the landraces (+60.4%); and the modern cultivars and SD lines also produced higher biomass than the landraces (30.3% and 28.4%, respectively). Under LN conditions, reduction in grain yield and biomass compared to HN conditions was least for the landraces (-1% and 8.6%, respectively), intermediate for the SD lines (-7.4 and -10.2%, respectively) and highest for the modern cultivars (-9.3 and -24.6%, respectively). As a result, the SD lines had higher biomass (+17%) than the modern cultivars under LN conditions. Under HN conditions the synthetic derivatives (23.8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and modern cultivars (241.1 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) had higher pre-anthesis A(max) than the landraces (19.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) (P < 0.001). Pre-anthesis A(max) was strongly positively linearly associated with above-ground biomass (R-2 = 0.63, P < 0.001) and grain yield (R-2 = 0.75, P < 0.001) amongst the 15 genotypes. Flag-leaf A(max) was also positively linearly associated with flag-leaf relative chlorophyll content at anthesis (R-2 = 0.74; P < 0.001). Comparing the SD lines to the recurrent parent Paragon, under HN conditions one line (SD 22) had higher pre-anthesis flag-leaf A(max) than Paragon (P < 0.05). Under LN conditions one line (SD 24, +27%) had higher yield than Paragon (P < 0.05) and two lines (SD 24 and SD 38, +32% and +31%, respectively) had more biomass than Paragon (P < 0.05). Our results indicated that introgressing traits from synthetic-derived wheat and landraces into UK modern wheat germplasm offers scope to raise above-ground biomass and grain yield in moderate-to-low N availability environments.

AB Aim To develop a standardized, quantitative method for mapping cumulative impacts of invasive alien species on marine ecosystems.
   Location The methodology is applied in the Mediterranean Sea but is widely applicable.
   Methods A conservative additive model was developed to account for the Cumulative IMPacts of invasive ALien species (CIMPAL) on marine ecosystems. According to this model, cumulative impact scores are estimated on the basis of the distributions of invasive species and ecosystems, and both the reported magnitude of ecological impacts and the strength of such evidence. In the Mediterranean Sea case study, the magnitude of impact was estimated for every combination of 60 invasive species and 13 habitats, for every 10 x 10 km cell of the basin. Invasive species were ranked based on their contribution to the cumulative impact score across the Mediterranean.
   Results The CIMPAL index showed strong spatial heterogeneity. Spatial patterns varied depending on the pathway of initial introduction of the invasive species in the Mediterranean Sea. Species introduced by shipping gave the highest impact scores and impacted a much larger area than those introduced by aquaculture and the Suez Canal. Overall, invasive macroalgae had the highest impact among all taxonomic groups. These results represent the current best estimate of the spatial variation in impacts of invasive alien species on ecosystems, in the Mediterranean Sea.
   Main Conclusions A framework for mapping cumulative impacts of invasive alien species was developed. The application of this framework in the Mediterranean Sea provided a baseline that can be built upon with future improved information. Such analysis allows the identification of hotspots of highly impacted areas, and prioritization of sites, pathways and species for management actions.

AB Short-term acceleration of soil organic matter decomposition by increasing temperature conflicts with the thermal adaptation observed in long-term studies. Here we used the altitudinal gradient on Mt. Kilimanjaro to demonstrate the mechanisms of thermal adaptation of extra-and intracellular enzymes that hydrolyze cellulose, chitin and phytate and oxidize monomers (C-14-glucose) in warm-and cold-climate soils. We revealed that no response of decomposition rate to temperature occurs because of a cancelling effect consisting in an increase in half-saturation constants (K-m), which counteracts the increase in maximal reaction rates (V-max with temperature). We used the parameters of enzyme kinetics to predict thresholds of substrate concentration (S-crit) below which decomposition rates will be insensitive to global warming. Increasing values of S-crit, and hence stronger canceling effects with increasing altitude on Mt. Kilimanjaro, explained the thermal adaptation of polymer decomposition. The reduction of the temperature sensitivity of V-max along the altitudinal gradient contributed to thermal adaptation of both polymer and monomer degradation. Extrapolating the altitudinal gradient to the large-scale latitudinal gradient, these results show that the soils of cold climates with stronger and more frequent temperature variation are less sensitive to global warming than soils adapted to high temperatures.

AB The rhythm of life on earth is shaped by seasonal changes in the environment. Plants and animals show profound annual cycles in physiology, health, morphology, behaviour and demography in response to environmental cues. Seasonal biology impacts ecosystems and agriculture, with consequences for humans and biodiversity. Human populations show robust annual rhythms in health and well-being, and the birth month can have lasting effects that persist throughout life. This review emphasizes the need for a better understanding of seasonal biology against the backdrop of its rapidly progressing disruption through climate change, human lifestyles and other anthropogenic impact. Climate change is modifying annual rhythms to which numerous organisms have adapted, with potential consequences for industries relating to health, ecosystems and food security. Disconcertingly, human lifestyles under artificial conditions of eternal summer provide the most extreme example for disconnect from natural seasons, making humans vulnerable to increased morbidity and mortality. In this review, we introduce scenarios of seasonal disruption, highlight key aspects of seasonal biology and summarize from biomedical, anthropological, veterinary, agricultural and environmental perspectives the recent evidence for seasonal desynchronization between environmental factors and internal rhythms. Because annual rhythms are pervasive across biological systems, they provide a common framework for transdisciplinary research.

AB The carbon storage potential of terrestrial ecosystems depends in part on how atmospheric conditions influence the type and amount of surface radiation available for photosynthesis. Diffuse light, resulting from interactions between incident solar radiation and atmospheric aerosols and clouds, has been postulated to increase carbon uptake in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the magnitude of the diffuse light effect is unclear because existing studies use different methods to derive above-canopy diffuse light conditions. We used site-based, above-canopy measurements of diffuse light and gross primary productivity (GPP) from 10 temperate ecosystems (including mixed conifer forests, deciduous broadleaf forests, and croplands) to quantify the GPP variation explained by diffuse photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and to calculate increases in GPP as a function of diffuse light. Our analyses show that diffuse PAR explained up to 41% of variation in GPP in croplands and up to 17% in forests, independent of direct light levels. Carbon enhancement rates in response to diffuse PAR (calculated after accounting for vapor pressure deficit and air temperature) were also higher in croplands (0.011-0.050 mu mol CO2 per kmol photons of diffuse PAR) than in forests (0.003-0.018 mu mol CO2 per kmol photons of diffuse PAR). The amount of variation in GPP and carbon enhancement rate both differed with solar zenith angle and across sites for the same plant functional type. At crop sites, diffuse PAR had the strongest influence and the largest carbon enhancement rate during early mornings and late afternoons when zenith angles were large, with greater enhancement in the afternoons. In forests, diffuse PAR had the strongest influence at small zenith angles, but the largest carbon enhancement rate at large zenith angles, with a trend in ecosystem-specific responses. These results highlight the influence of zenith angle and the role of plant community composition in modifying diffuse light enhancement in terrestrial ecosystems, which will be important in scaling this effect from individual sites to the globe.

AB Global change presents risks and opportunities for social-ecological systems worldwide. Key challenges for sustainability science are to identify plausible future changes in social-ecological systems and find ways to reach socially and environmentally desirable conditions. In this context, regional-scale studies are important, but to date, many such studies have focused on a narrow set of issues or applied a narrow set of tools. Here, we present a holistic approach to work through the complexity posed by cross-scale interactions, spatial heterogeneity, and multiple uncertainties facing regional social-ecological systems. Our approach is spatially explicit and involves assessments of social conditions and natural capital bundles, social-ecological system dynamics, and current development trends. The resulting understanding is used in combination with scenario planning to map how current development trends might be amplified or dampened in the future. We illustrate this approach via a detailed case study in southern Transylvania, Romania, one of Europe's most significant biocultural refugia. Our goal was to understand current social-ecological dynamics and assess risks and opportunities for sustainable development. Our findings show that historical events have strongly shaped current conditions and current development trends in southern Transylvania. Moreover, although external drivers (including EU policies) set the general direction of regional development trajectories, local factors, including education, leadership, and the presence of bridging organizations, can enhance or counteract their effects. Our holistic approach was useful for generating an in-depth understanding of a regional social-ecological system and could be transferred to other parts of the world.

   APOSPOROUS APOMIXIS
AB Apomixis is an alternative route of plant reproduction that produces individuals genetically identical to the mother plant through seeds. Apomixis is desirable in agriculture, because it guarantees the perpetuation of superior genotypes (i.e. heterotic hybrid seeds) by self-seeding without loss of hybrid vigour. The Paspalum genus, an archetypal model system for mining apomixis gene(s), is composed of about 370 species that have extremely diverse reproductive systems, including self-incompatibility, self-fertility, full sexual reproduction, and facultative or obligate apomixis. Barriers to interspecific hybridization are relaxed in this genus, allowing the production of new hybrids from many different parental combinations. Paspalum is also tolerant to various parental genome contributions to the endosperm, allowing analyses of how sexually reproducing crop species might escape from dosage effects in the endosperm.
   In this article, the available literature characterizing apomixis in Paspalum spp. and its use in breeding is critically reviewed. In particular, a comparison is made across species of the structure and function of the genomic region controlling apomixis in order to identify a common core region shared by all apomictic Paspalum species and where apomixis genes are likely to be localized. Candidate genes are discussed, either as possible genetic determinants (including homologs to signal transduction and RNA methylation genes) or as downstream factors (such as cell-to-cell signalling and auxin response genes) depending, respectively, on their co-segregation with apomixis or less. Strategies to validate the role of candidate genes in apomictic process are also discussed, with special emphasis on plant transformation in natural apomictic species.

AB Climate change poses significant threats to biodiversity, but some species may be able to escape its effects in small locations with unusual and stable climates (microrefugia). However, there are still great uncertainties about where microrefugia are located, and the exact role that moisture plays in buffering extreme temperatures. In this study we quantified the effects of moisture on the distribution and variability of near-surface soil and air temperatures. We collected hourly 1 cm soil and 5 cm air temperatures and humidities at 111 sites from May 2011 to March 2012. Sites were diverse in terms of elevation (2-1428 m), distance from coast (180 m-403 km), canopy cover (0-100%), topographic exposure, and susceptibility to cold air drainage. We found that variability (diurnal range) of both soil and air temperatures decreased under moister conditions. While air temperatures were related more strongly to humidity, soil temperatures were related more to vapour pressure deficit (VPD). That is, both high temperature and low humidity were required before the VPD was sufficient to dry out the soil and allow soil temperatures to vary. We then used a regional regression approach to model the spatial distribution of minimum and maximum air and soil temperatures for each day over the 10 months in terms of latitude, elevation, canopy cover, distance to coast, cold air drainage potential, and topographic exposure to the south and northwest. We found that elevation was the dominant factor explaining the distribution of soil and air temperatures under moist conditions. Other factors, such as canopy cover and topographic exposure, had a stronger influence on air temperatures whenever humidity was low. However, these factors only affected soil temperatures at times when higher temperatures combined with low humidity to produce higher VPD. Our results provide new insights into how moisture influences the spatial distribution of near-surface soil and air temperatures. Microrefugia will be more apparent under drier conditions, but climate change may affect refugia for soil and air temperatures differently. Higher temperatures will cause VPD to increase more than would be expected by any change in humidity, and refugia in terms of soil temperatures may therefore become increasingly apparent.

AB The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) estimated that two thirds of ecosystem services on the earth have degraded or are in decline due to the unprecedented scale of human activities during recent decades. These changes will have tremendous consequences for human well-being, and offer both risks and opportunities for a wide range of stakeholders. Yet these risks and opportunities have not been well managed due in part to the lack of quantitative understanding of human dependence on ecosystem services. Here, we propose an index of dependence on ecosystem services (IDES) system to quantify human dependence on ecosystem services. We demonstrate the construction of the IDES system using household survey data. We show that the overall index and sub-indices can reflect the general pattern of households' dependences on ecosystem services, and their variations across time, space, and different forms of capital (i.e., natural, human, financial, manufactured, and social capitals). We support the proposition that the poor are more dependent on ecosystem services and further generalize this proposition by arguing that those disadvantaged groups who possess low levels of any form of capital except for natural capital are more dependent on ecosystem services than those with greater control of capital. The higher value of the overall IDES or sub-index represents the higher dependence on the corresponding ecosystem services, and thus the higher vulnerability to the degradation or decline of corresponding ecosystem services. The IDES system improves our understanding of human dependence on ecosystem services. It also provides insights into strategies for alleviating poverty, for targeting priority groups of conservation programs, and for managing risks and opportunities due to changes of ecosystem services at multiple scales.

AB A detailed understanding of the influence of temperature on soil microbial activity is critical to predict future atmospheric CO2 concentrations and feedbacks to anthropogenic warming. We investigated soils exposed to 3-4 years of continuous 5 degrees C-warming in a field experiment in a temperate forest. We found that an index for the temperature adaptation of the microbial community, T-min for bacterial growth, increased by 0.19 degrees C per 1 degrees C rise in temperature, showing a community shift towards one adapted to higher temperature with a higher temperature sensitivity (Q(10(5-15 degrees C)) increased by 0.08 units per 1 degrees C). Using continuously measured temperature data from the field experiment we modelled in situ bacterial growth. Assuming that warming did not affect resource availability, bacterial growth was modelled to become 60% higher in warmed compared to the control plots, with the effect of temperature adaptation of the community only having a small effect on overall bacterial growth (<5%). However, 3 years of warming decreased bacterial growth, most likely due to substrate depletion because of the initially higher growth in warmed plots. When this was factored in, the result was similar rates of modelled in situ bacterial growth in warmed and control plots after 3 years, despite the temperature difference. We conclude that although temperature adaptation for bacterial growth to higher temperatures was detectable, its influence on annual bacterial growth was minor, and overshadowed by the direct temperature effect on growth rates.

AB Human evolution has clearly been shaped by geneculture interactions, and there is growing evidence that similar processes also act on populations of non-human animals. Recent theoretical studies have shown that culture can be an important evolutionary mechanism because of the ability of cultural traits to spread rapidly both vertically, obliquely, and horizontally, resulting in decreased within-group variance and increased between-group variance. Here, we collate the extensive literature on population divergence in killer whales (Orcinus orca), and argue that they are undergoing ecological speciation as a result of dietary specializations. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that cultural divergence pre-dates ecological divergence, we propose that cultural differences in the form of learned behaviours between ecologically divergent killer whale populations have resulted in sufficient reproductive isolation even in sympatry to lead to incipient speciation.

AB Ecosystem respiration is a primary component of the carbon cycle and understanding the mechanisms that determine its temperature dependence will be important for predicting how rates of carbon efflux might respond to global warming. We used a rare model system, comprising a network of geothermally heated streams ranging in temperature from 5 similar to degrees C to 25 similar to degrees C, to explore the nature of the relationship between respiration and temperature. Using this natural experiment, we tested whether the natal thermal regime of stream communities influenced the temperature dependence of respiration in the absence of other potentially confounding variables. An empirical survey of 13 streams across the thermal gradient revealed that the temperature dependence of whole-stream respiration was equivalent to the average activation energy of the respiratory complex (0.60.7 similar to eV). This observation was also consistent for in-situ benthic respiration. Laboratory experiments, incubating biofilms from four streams across the thermal gradient at a range of temperatures, revealed that the activation energy and Q10 of respiration were remarkably consistent across streams, despite marked differences in their thermal history and significant turnover in species composition. Furthermore, absolute rates of respiration at standardised temperature were also unrelated to ambient stream temperature, but strongly reflected differences in biofilm biomass. Together, our results suggest that the core biochemistry, which drives the kinetics of oxidative respiratory metabolism, may be well conserved among diverse taxa and environments, and that the intrinsic sensitivity of respiration to temperature is not influenced by ambient environmental temperature.

AB Temporary streams are those water courses that undergo the recurrent cessation of flow or the complete drying of their channel. The structure and composition of biological communities in temporary stream reaches are strongly dependent on the temporal changes of the aquatic habitats determined by the hydrological conditions. Therefore, the structural and functional characteristics of aquatic fauna to assess the ecological quality of a temporary stream reach cannot be used without taking into account the controls imposed by the hydrological regime. This paper develops methods for analysing temporary streams' aquatic regimes, based on the definition of six aquatic states that summarize the transient sets of mesohabitats occurring on a given reach at a particular moment, depending on the hydrological conditions: Hyperrheic, Eurheic, Oligorheic, Arheic, Hyporheic and Edaphic. When the hydrological conditions lead to a change in the aquatic state, the structure and composition of the aquatic community changes according to the new set of available habitats. We used the water discharge records from gauging stations or simulations with rainfall-runoff models to infer the temporal patterns of occurrence of these states in the Aquatic States Frequency Graph we developed. The visual analysis of this graph is complemented by the development of two metrics which describe the permanence of flow and the seasonal predictability of zero flow periods. Finally, a classification of temporary streams in four aquatic regimes in terms of their influence over the development of aquatic life is updated from the existing classifications, with stream aquatic regimes defined as Permanent, Temporary-pools, Temporary-dry and Episodic. While aquatic regimes describe the long-term overall variability of the hydrological conditions of the river section and have been used for many years by hydrologists and ecologists, aquatic states describe the availability of mesohabitats in given periods that determine the presence of different biotic assemblages. This novel concept links hydrological and ecological conditions in a unique way. All these methods were implemented with data from eight temporary streams around the Mediterranean within the MIRAGE project. Their application was a precondition to assessing the ecological quality of these streams.

AB Intentional or accidental introduction of species to new locations is predicted to result in loss of genetic variation and increase the likelihood of inbreeding, thus reducing population viability and evolutionary potential. However, multiple introductions and large founder numbers can prevent loss of genetic diversity and may therefore facilitate establishment success and range expansion. Based on a meta-analysis of 119 introductions of 85 species of plants and animals, we here show a quantitative effect of founding history on genetic diversity in introduced populations. Both introduction of large number of individuals and multiple introduction events significantly contribute to maintaining or even increasing genetic diversity in introduced populations. The most consistent loss of genetic diversity is seen in insects and mammals, whereas introduced plant populations tend to have higher genetic variation than native populations. However, loss or gain of genetic diversity does not explain variation in the extent to which plant or animal populations become invasive outside of their native range. These results provide strong support for predictions from population genetics theory with respect to patterns of genetic diversity in introduced populations, but suggest that invasiveness is not limited by genetic bottlenecks.

AB Background and aims. The application of DNA barcoding as a global standard for fish identification is probing diverse worldwide realms (Nearctic, Australian and the Neotropics) and environments (e. g. marine and freshwater). Comparing the patterns of sequence divergence among conspecific and congeneric taxa between realms can provide valuable information on recent evolutionary histories of lineages as barcode data accumulates. Materials and methods. Herein, we have analyzed over 100 species (around 50%) of the Neotropical fish fauna from the Sao Francisco River, in southeast Brazil. Our aims were to test the performance of DNA barcoding in this biodiversity-rich region, and to compare patterns of genetic divergence with previous studies. Results. The mean Kimura two-parameter distances within species, genera, families, orders, and classes were 0.5, 10.6, 21.0, 22.7, and 24.4%, respectively, with 100% of the species examined successfully differentiated by barcoding. With the exception of Astyanax bimaculatus lacustris, Piabina argentea, and Bryconamericus stramineus, all other species yield a single, cohesive cluster of barcode sequences. The average 'nearest-neighbor distance' was 11.12%, 21-fold higher than the mean within species distance of around 0.54%. In a few instances, deep lineage divergences among conspecifics (up to 10%) and congenerics (up to 22.9%) taxa were revealed. Conclusions. Reflecting possible cases of cryptic speciation and the deeper phylogeographic history of Sao Francisco fish fauna, with some higher clades extending back into the late Cretaceous and Cenozoic (90 mya), when much of the diversification of the Neotropical region apparently took place. In addition, barcodes also highlighted misidentifications and helped to document range extensions for known species.

AB Although the primary function of mating is gamete transfer, male ejaculates contain numerous other substances that are produced by accessory glands and transferred to females during mating. Studies with several model organisms have shown that these substances can exert diverse behavioural and physiological effects on females, including altered longevity and reproductive output, yet a comprehensive synthesis across taxa is lacking. Here we use a meta-analytic approach to synthesize quantitatively extensive experimental work examining how male ejaculate quantity affects different components of female fitness. We summarize effect sizes for female fecundity (partial and lifetime) and longevity from 84 studies conducted on 70 arthropod species that yielded a total of 130 comparisons of female fecundity and 61 comparisons of female longevity. In response to greater amounts of ejaculate, arthropod females demonstrate enhanced fecundity (both partial and lifetime) but reduced longevity, particularly for Diptera and Lepidoptera. Across taxa, multiply mated females show particularly large fecundity increases compared to singly mated females, indicating that single matings do not maximize female fitness. This fecundity increase is balanced by a slight negative effect on lifespan, with females that received more ejaculate through polyandrous matings showing greater reductions in lifespan compared with females that have mated repeatedly with the same male. We found no significant effect size differences for either female fecundity or longevity between taxa that transfer sperm packaged into spermatophores compared to taxa that transfer ejaculates containing free sperm. Furthermore, females that received relatively larger or more spermatophores demonstrated greater lifetime fecundity, indicating that these seminal nuptial gifts provide females with a net fitness benefit. These results contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary origin and maintenance of non-sperm ejaculate components, and provide insight into female mate choice and optimal mating patterns.

AB Advances in spring blooming of wildflowers have been associated with climate change; however, the majority of long-term community-level studies have been conducted in humid-temperate regions. Less is known about phenological changes in herbaceous, semi-arid plant communities. We recorded first-bloom date of common spring wildflowers in a semi-arid grassland in the Rocky Mountains, USA from 1995 through 2008 and analyzed these data along with mean monthly temperature and precipitation. Advanced flowering predominated; 75% of the 32 species displayed a negative linear regression slope, and this trend was strong for nine species (slope < 1.0,p < 0.10). Only one species showed a strong trend for later flowering. Mean advance for all 32 species was 0.61 days/year and mean advance for the nine species displaying a strong tendency to flower earlier was 1.6 days/year. Species flowering early showed stronger trends toward advanced flowering than later species. Average March temperature and January plus December precipitation, falling mainly as snow, were explanatory variables in the best multiple linear regression model for mean first-flowering date of strongly advanced species. Our results suggest that flowering phenology may be changing faster and precipitation may play a more important role in semi-arid grasslands than in humid-temperate systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Aim
   We perform a phylogeographical study of an endemic Patagonian herbaceous plant to assess whether geographical patterns of genetic variation correspond to in situ Pleistocene survival or to glacial retreat and post-glacial expansion. We also seek to determine the locations of potential glacial refugia and post-glacial colonization routes.
   Location
   Southern Andes and Patagonian steppe.
   Methods
   We used Calceolaria polyrhiza, a widely distributed Patagonian herbaceous plant that occurs mainly in the understorey of Nothofagus rain forests and in the arid Patagonian steppe, as our model system. The chloroplast intergenic spacer trnH-psbA was sequenced for 590 individuals from 68 populations. Sequence data were analysed using phylogenetic (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference) and population genetic (spatial analyses of molecular variance, mismatch distributions and neutrality tests) methods. Nested clade phylogeographic analyses, and divergence time estimates using a calibrated molecular clock, were also conducted.
   Results
   A total of 27 haplotypes identified in the present study clustered into four primary genealogical lineages, revealing three significant latitudinal phylogeographical breaks. The two high Andean lineages probably split first, during the late Miocene, and the Patagonian lineage split around 4 Ma, coincident with the establishment of the Patagonian steppe. Within each haplogroup, major diversification occurred in the Pleistocene. The Patagonian groups show a pattern consistent with a rapid post-glacial expansion and colonization of the Andean flanks, achieved independently by four lineages. The highest haplotype diversity was found along a longitudinal transect that is remarkably congruent with the limit of the ice-sheet extension during the Greatest Patagonian Glaciation. A north-east expansion is evident, which is probably associated with the 'Arid Diagonal' fluctuations.
   Main conclusions
   Glacial climate fluctuations had a substantial impact on the diversification, distribution and demography of the study species. A scenario of multiple periglacial Pleistocene refugia and subsequent multiple recolonization routes, from eastern Patagonia to the Andean flanks, may explain the phylogeographical patterns observed. However, current genetic structure also preserves the imprints of older events that probably occurred in the Miocene and Pliocene, providing evidence that multiple processes, operating at different spatial and temporal scales, have moulded biodiversity in Patagonia.

TI MetaPIGA v2.0: maximum likelihood large phylogeny estimation using the
   metapopulation genetic algorithm and other stochastic heuristics
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
ID ANCESTRAL PROTEIN RECONSTRUCTION; DNA-SEQUENCES; INFERENCE
AB Background: The development, in the last decade, of stochastic heuristics implemented in robust application softwares has made large phylogeny inference a key step in most comparative studies involving molecular sequences. Still, the choice of a phylogeny inference software is often dictated by a combination of parameters not related to the raw performance of the implemented algorithm(s) but rather by practical issues such as ergonomics and/or the availability of specific functionalities.
   Results: Here, we present MetaPIGA v2.0, a robust implementation of several stochastic heuristics for large phylogeny inference (under maximum likelihood), including a Simulated Annealing algorithm, a classical Genetic Algorithm, and the Metapopulation Genetic Algorithm (metaGA) together with complex substitution models, discrete Gamma rate heterogeneity, and the possibility to partition data. MetaPIGA v2.0 also implements the Likelihood Ratio Test, the Akaike Information Criterion, and the Bayesian Information Criterion for automated selection of substitution models that best fit the data. Heuristics and substitution models are highly customizable through manual batch files and command line processing. However, MetaPIGA v2.0 also offers an extensive graphical user interface for parameters setting, generating and running batch files, following run progress, and manipulating result trees. MetaPIGA v2.0 uses standard formats for data sets and trees, is platform independent, runs in 32 and 64-bits systems, and takes advantage of multiprocessor and multicore computers.
   Conclusions: The metaGA resolves the major problem inherent to classical Genetic Algorithms by maintaining high inter-population variation even under strong intra-population selection. Implementation of the metaGA together with additional stochastic heuristics into a single software will allow rigorous optimization of each heuristic as well as a meaningful comparison of performances among these algorithms. MetaPIGA v2.0 gives access both to high customization for the phylogeneticist, as well as to an ergonomic interface and functionalities assisting the non-specialist for sound inference of large phylogenetic trees using nucleotide sequences. MetaPIGA v2.0 and its extensive user-manual are freely available to academics at http://www.metapiga.org.

AB A massive decline of biodiversity is caused by land-use changes. Efforts must therefore be made to better understand the factors that govern organismal distribution, especially for countries where traditional management is about to be intensified such as in Romania. We here document the spatial distribution of amphibians from a Romanian rural landscape where land-use is still largely traditional. We related the occurrence of nine amphibian species and species richness to measures of composition and configuration of the landscape surrounding 54 ponds at three spatial scales: circular areas of 400, 600 and 800 m radii. Busy roads most severely impacted single species and amphibian richness whereas landscape composition measures, such as cover of urban areas, agricultural areas, pastures, forests and wetlands were of little importance. We suggest that the relative unimportance of landscape compositional measures on amphibians is a consequence of the traditional management of these landscapes that keep the environmental conditions favorable for most species.

AB Evolutionary biologists have long endeavored to document how many species exist on Earth, to understand the processes by which biodiversity waxes and wanes, to document and interpret spatial patterns of biodiversity, and to infer evolutionary relationships. Despite the great potential of this knowledge to improve biodiversity science, conservation, and policy, evolutionary biologists have generally devoted limited attention to these broader implications. Likewise, many workers in biodiversity science have underappreciated the fundamental relevance of evolutionary biology. The aim of this article is to summarize and illustrate some ways in which evolutionary biology is directly relevant We do so in the context of four broad areas: (1) discovering and documenting biodiversity, (2) understanding the causes of diversification, (3) evaluating evolutionary responses to human disturbances, and (4) implications for ecological communities, ecosystems, and humans We also introduce bioGENESIS, a new project within DIVERSITAS launched to explore the potential practical contributions of evolutionary biology In addition to fostering the integration of evolutionary thinking into biodiversity science, bioGENESIS provides practical recommendations to policy makers for incorporating evolutionary perspectives into biodiversity agendas and conservation. We solicit your involvement in developing innovative ways of using evolutionary biology to better comprehend and stem the loss of biodiversity.

AB Our understanding of broad taxonomic patterns of plant naturalizations is based entirely on observations of successful naturalizations. Omission of the failures, however, can introduce bias by conflating the probabilities of introduction and naturalization. Here, we use two comprehensive datasets of successful and failed plant naturalizations in New Zealand and Australia for a unique, flora-wide comparative test of several major invasion hypotheses. First, we show that some taxa are consistently more successful at naturalizing in these two countries, despite their environmental differences. Broad climatic origins helped to explain some of the differences in success rates in the two countries. We further show that species with native relatives were generally more successful in both countries, contrary to Darwin's naturalization hypothesis, but this effect was inconsistent among families across the two countries. Finally, we show that contrary to studies based on successful naturalizations only, islands need not be inherently more invasible than continents.

AB Species conservation largely depends on knowledge of habitat needs of target species. GIS-models are increasingly used to assess habitat preferences and distribution of target species, but their accuracy is constrained by availability of digital data layers. We developed a two-steps approach aiming at showing pros and cons of landscape (GIS)- and site-level habitat models, identifying key habitat factors for conservation of a threatened bird species, the red-backed shrike Lanius collurio. A spatially explicit GIS-model was generated using landscape variables, and a second model at site level was developed using fine-scale variables measured on the ground. The GIS-based model was then extrapolated to the entire region to obtain a map of distribution of suitable habitats. Positive associations between shrike occurrence and both hedgerow length and partial shrub cover were detected at both scales. Shrikes were also positively associated with grassland cover at landscape level and with partial cover of untilled herbaceous vegetation at the finer scale, and negatively affected by lucerne cover. The GIS-model led to an affordable map of predicted habitat suitability which should help conservationists to focus on different local priorities, but was unable to identify effects of untilled and lucerne cover. Site-level model gave fine details for habitat management, but its application elsewhere requires ground-measurements of factors. Combining the multiscale models could indicate more urgent actions at large scales (e.g. maintaining suitable habitats, or improving connectivity among isolated patches) and draw a detailed figure of the most suitable habitat for the species. Shrike occurrence was associated with a higher number of shrub and tree species: the indicator value of the species should ensure general benefits for biodiversity from dedicated management.

ID CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT
AB In this article, we draw on research among fisherfolk of Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands, to examine certain epistemological assumptions of the "indigenous knowledge" concept. We describe how approaches to knowledge in Roviana differ from prevailing models of knowledge that distinguish between cognitive aspects and other modalities of knowing. For many Roviana fishers, ecological knowledge is not analytically separated from the changing contexts of everyday activities such as navigating and fishing. Inspired by Roviana epistemologies, we argue that a practice-oriented approach provides a more sympathetic and informative theoretical framework for understanding knowledge and its role in contemporary marine-resource conservation efforts. The theoretical and methodological implications of the perspective are illustrated with examples from an ongoing marine conservation project in the western Solomon Islands that integrates indigenous knowledge, remote-sensing techniques, and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies.

AB Scavengers may benefit from the availability of dead animals along roads that result from collisions with vehicles. However, roads are also considered risky places for many species. Animal habitat selection patterns usually balance energy intake with mortality risk. In this work we analyzed the foraging space use of an assemblage of diurnal scavenging raptors in relation to distance from roads in northwest Patagonia. We selected patches at different distances from roads, and placed a sheep carcass in each patch during the night (n = 18 carcasses in total). In general, carcasses near roads were detected by diurnal scavenging raptors much faster than those far from roads. Smaller raptors such as southern caracaras (Caracara plancus), chimango caracaras (Milvago chimango), and black vultures (Coragyps atratus), were commonly associated with roads both in terms of overall detections and scavenging activities. Southern and chimango caracaras proved to be very good at detecting carcasses, were faster to land in order to feed from them, and were found in greater numbers near roads than far from them. Even though Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) and black-chested buzzard-eagles (Geranoaetus melanoleucus) flew all over the area, they chose to feed far from roads. Our work emphasizes that some scavengers have taken advantage of the novel food resources provided by roads whereas others are reluctant to feed near them. Within a scenario of an increasing number of roads, some species can extend their distributions favoring competition and biotic homogenization processes within original communities. We highlight the importance of taking into account large flying scavengers in land-use planning.

AB Methods for assessing habitat sensitivity to human impacts are needed to gauge the sustainability of existing impacts, develop spatial management plans and support meaningful environmental impact assessments. These methods should be quantitative, validated, repeatable and applicable at the scales of impact and management.
   Existing methods for assessing the sensitivity of marine habitats to human impacts have tended to rely on expert judgement and/or scoring systems. They are neither validated, quantitative nor repeatable.
   We have developed a method that meets the criteria for assessing the sensitivity of seabed habitats to physical disturbance, and delineating and mapping habitat sensitivity at large spatial scales (> 10(5) km(2)). The method assumes that sensitivity is related to the recovery time of production or biomass, as predicted using a size-based model that takes account of the effects of natural disturbance.
   As trawling disturbance is a major and widespread direct human impact on shelf seas, this was used as an example of anthropogenic physical disturbance. We mapped habitat sensitivity to trawling in 9-km(2) boxes across an area of 125 000 km(2) in the North Sea.
   Habitat sensitivities varied widely, and a trawling frequency of 5 year(-1) in the least-sensitive habitat had the same ecological effect as a trawling frequency of 0.3 year(-1) in the most-sensitive habitat (based on production). When trawling effort was held constant but redirected to the least-sensitive habitats, the existing impacts on production and biomass were reduced by 36% and 25%, respectively.
   Synthesis and applications. The method described in this paper enables managers to predict the implications of changing patterns of human impact on seabed habitats when establishing spatial management plans. In the context of fisheries management, this will support the identification and selection of fishing grounds that minimize the adverse ecological effects of fishing; the selection of closed areas (both representative and highly sensitive); the comparison of management options that might reduce the overall environmental impacts of fishing; and any future steps towards the application of environmental impact assessment in advance of fishery development.

AB Biodiversity provides insurance against the uncertain provision of ecosystem services which are being used by risk-averse economic agents. I present a conceptual ecological-economic model that combines (i) current results from ecology about the relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and the provision of ecosystem services with (ii) economic methods to study decision-making under uncertainty. In this framework I (1) determine the insurance value of biodiversity, (2) study the optimal allocation of funds in the trade-off between investing into biodiversity protection and the purchase of financial insurance, and (3) analyze the effect of different institutional regimes in the market for financial insurance on biodiversity protection. I conclude that biodiversity acts as a form of natural insurance for risk-averse ecosystem managers against the over- or under-provision with ecosystem services. Therefore, biodiversity has an insurance value, which is a value component in addition to the usual value arguments, such as direct or indirect use or non-use values. In this respect, biodiversity and financial insurance are substitutes. Hence, the availability, and exact institutional design; of financial insurance influence the level of biodiversity protection.

AB 1. Hypoxic conditions occur frequently during hot, dry summers in the small lentic waterbodies (billabongs) that occur on the floodplains of the Murray-Darling River system of Australia. Behavioural responses to progressive hypoxia were examined for the native and introduced floodplain fish of the Ovens River, an unregulated tributary of the Murray River in south-east Australia.
   2. Given the high frequency of hypoxic episodes in billabongs on the Ovens River floodplain, it was hypothesised that all species would exhibit behaviours that would confer a degree of hypoxia-tolerance. Specifically, it was hypothesised that as hypoxia progressed, gill ventilation rates (GVRs) would increase and aquatic surface respiration (ASR) would become increasingly frequent. Fish were subjected to rapid, progressive hypoxia from normoxia to anoxia in open tanks.
   3. All tested species exhibited behaviours consistent with their use of potentially hypoxic habitats. As hypoxia progressed, GVRs increased and all species, with the exception of oriental weatherloach, began to switch increasingly to ASR with 90% of individuals using ASR at various oxygen concentrations below 1.0 mg O-2 L-1. Australian smelt, redfin perch and flat-headed galaxias were the first three species to rise to ASR, with 10% of individuals using ASR by 2.55, 2.29 and 2.21 mg O-2 L-1 respectively. Goldfish and common carp were the last two species to rise to ASR, with 10% of individuals using ASR by 0.84 and 0.75 mg O-2 L-1 respectively. In contrast to other species, oriental weatherloach largely ceased gill ventilation and used air-gulping as their primary means of respiration during severe hypoxia and anoxia.
   4. Australian smelt, redfin perch and flat-headed galaxias were unable to maintain ASR under severe hypoxia, and began exhibiting erratic movements, termed terminal avoidance behaviour, and loss of equilibrium. All other species continued to use ASR through severe hypoxia and into anoxia. Following a rise to ASR, GVRs either remained steady or decreased slightly indicating partial or significant relief from hypoxic stress for these hypoxia-tolerant species.
   5. Behavioural responses to progressive hypoxia amongst the fish species of the Ovens River floodplain indicate a generally high level of tolerance to periodic hypoxia. However, species-specific variation in hypoxia-tolerance may have implications for community structure of billabong fish communities following hypoxic events.

AB 1. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis states that the more complex the habitat, the higher the species richness. The present study analyzes the effect of local factors on regional spider (Araneidae and Thomisidae) richness. The main objective is to disentangle the relative importance of habitat structure and other environmental variables.
   2. Fifteen territorial units of 1 km(2) were sampled to obtain reliable and comparable inventories of the two spider families. Richness values were modelled using general regression models and a set of climate, topographic and vegetation structure variables. Pure and joint effects were computed via variation partitioning.
   3. The results highlight the great importance of vegetation complexity, especially of grass and sub-shrub cover, in determining spider species richness.
   4. The maximum temperature is the only climate variable significantly related to species richness, although its effect is combined with that of spatial and vegetation structure variables.
   5. These results support the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis, and highlight the importance of taking vegetation complexity into account when managing habitats and where spider conservation is desired.

AB Recent research has documented the importance of edaphic factors in determining the habitat associations of tree species in many tropical rain forests, but the underlying mechanisms for edaphic associations are unclear. At Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, two main soil types derived from sandstone (ridges) and alluvium (valleys) differ in nutrient and water availability and are characterized by forests differing markedly in species composition, structure, and understory light availability. We use both survey and reciprocal transplants to examine physiological adaptations to differences in light, nutrient, and water availability between these soil types, and test for the importance of resource-use efficiency in determining edaphic specialization. Photosynthetic surveys for congeneric and confamilial pairs (one species per soil type) of edaphic specialists and for generalists common to both soil types show that species specializing on sandstone-derived soil had lower stomatal conductance at a given assimilation rate than those occurring on alluvial soil and also had greater instantaneous and integrated water-use efficiencies. Foliar dark respiration rates per unit photosynthesis were higher for sandstone ridge than alluvial lowland specialists. We suggest that these higher respiration rates are likely due to increases in photosynthetic enzyme concentrations to compensate for lower internal CO2 concentrations resulting from increased stomatal closure. This is supported by lower photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiencies in the sandstone ridge specialists. Generalist species had lower water-use efficiencies than sandstone ridge specialists when growing on the drier, sandy ridgetops, but their nitrogen-use efficiencies did not differ from the species specialized to the more resource-rich alluvial valleys. We varied light environment and soil nutrient availability in a reciprocal transplant experiment involving two specialist species from each soil type. Edaphic specialist species, when grown on the soil type for which they were not specialized, were not capable of acclimatory shifts to achieve similar resource-use efficiencies as species specialized to that soil type. We conclude that divergent water-use strategies are an important mechanism underlying differences in edaphic associations and thus contributing to maintenance of high local tree species diversity in Bornean rain forests.

AB Motivation: Variation of substitution rates across nucleotide and amino acid sites has long been recognized as a characteristic of molecular sequence evolution. Evolutionary models that account for this rate heterogeneity usually use a gamma density function to model the rate distribution across sites. This density function, however, may not fit real datasets, especially when there is a multimodal distribution of rates. Here, we present a novel evolutionary model based on a mixture of gamma density functions. This model better describes the among-site rate variation characteristic of molecular sequence evolution. The use of this model may improve the accuracy of various phylogenetic methods, such as reconstructing phylogenetic trees, dating divergence events, inferring ancestral sequences and detecting conserved sites in proteins.
   Results: Using diverse sets of protein sequences we show that the gamma mixture model better describes the stochastic process underlying protein evolution. We show that the proposed gamma mixture model fits protein datasets significantly better than the single-gamma model in 9 out of 10 datasets tested. We further show that using the gamma mixture model improves the accuracy of model-based prediction of conserved residues in proteins.

AB We examined delta(13) C and delta(15) N in needle (current and 1-year-old) and soil samples collected on two occasions (July and September 1999) from a 15-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stand in an irrigation and fertilization experiment to investigate whether these treatments leave specific isotope signals in the samples and thus to infer the effects of treatments on C and N cycling. hTespective of foliar age or sampling date, carbon isotope discrimination (,) was increased by irrigation, and decreased by fertilization. The carbon isotope discrimination model suggested that increased A by irrigation was due to decreased water use efficiency (WUE) through increased stomatal and/or mesophyll conductance. The decreased A by fertilization and published gas exchange measurements at the same site suggest that water stress resulting from increased water demand in the fertilized plots improved WUE through increased stomatal control of water loss. Foliar delta(15) N values were not affected by irrigation, but were increased by fertilization. The delta N-15 value of soil NH4+ were higher than those of NO3- and were positively correlated with foliar delta N-15, suggesting that tree uptake of NH4+ was one of the factors affecting foliar delta N-15. We conclude that irrigation and fertilization affected 613 C and 615 N values in plant and soil samples, reflecting changed C and N cycling patterns and water use efficiency in the studied loblolly pine stand.

AB Marine environments have suffered from a lack of quantitative methods for delineating areas that are sensitive or vulnerable to particular stresses, natural and anthropogenic. We define sensitivity as the degree to which marine features respond to stresses, which are deviations of environmental conditions beyond the expected range. Vulnerability can then be defined as the probability that a feature will be exposed to a stress to which it is sensitive. Using these definitions, we provide a quantitative methodology for identifying vulnerable marine areas based on valued ecological features, defined as biological or physical features, processes, or structures deemed by humans to have environmental, social, cultural, or economic significance. The vulnerability of the valued ecological features is a function of their sensitivity to particular stresses and their vulnerability to those stresses. We used the methodology to demonstrate how vulnerable marine areas for two groups of endangered whale species (inshore and offshore) could be identified with a predictive habitat model and acoustic stress surfaces. Acoustic stress surfaces were produced for ferry traffic, commercial shipping traffic, potential offshore oil production, and small-boat traffic. The vulnerabilities of the two whale groups to the four stressors considered in this example were relatively similar; however, inshore species were more sensitive to on-shelf, coastal activities such as offshore hydrocarbon production, ferry traffic, and small-boat traffic. Our approach demonstrates how valued features can be associated with stresses and the likelihood of encountering these stresses (vulnerability) in order to identify geographic areas for management and conservation purposes. The method can be applied to any combination of valued ecological features and stressors.

AB A nucleotide sequence analysis of a portion of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit was performed to define the phylogeography of the threatened crayfish Austropotamobius (Decapoda; Astacidae) in Italy. We collected 61 specimens from 31 localities across the Italian peninsula. For the phylogenetic inference, we combined the 61 Austropotamobius spp sequences obtained from this study with 18 sequences deposited in GenBank and corresponding to Italian, French, Irish, Swiss, and Slovenian locations. Among the analysed sequences, 34 distinct haplotypes were detected. Our results confirmed the presence of both A. pallipes and A. italicus in the Italian peninsula and the existence within the latter species of a strong intraspecific genetic variation, due to the occurrence of four subspecies with a well-defined geographic distribution. From a conservation viewpoint, Italy, with its high haplotype variability, may be considered a 'hot spot' for the genetic diversity of the European native crayfish Austropotamobius. We suggest that re-introduction programs should be conducted with extreme caution in Italy, since not only the two Austropotamobius species but also the four A. italicus subspecies are genetically and taxonomically separate units and require independent conservation plans.

AB The deleterious effects of inbreeding can be substantial in wild populations and mechanisms to avoid such matings have evolved in many organisms. In situations where social mate choice is restricted, extrapair paternity may be a strategy used by females to avoid inbreeding and increase offspring heterozygosity. In the cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler, Acrocephalus sechellensis, neither social nor extrapair mate choice was used to avoid inbreeding facultatively, and close inbreeding occurred in approximately 5% of matings. However, a higher frequency of extra-group paternity may be selected for in female subordinates because this did reduce the frequency of mating between close relatives. Inbreeding resulted in reduced individual heterozygosity, which, against expectation, had an almost significant (P = 0.052). positive effect on survival. Conversely, low heterozygosity in the genetic mother was linked to reduced offspring survival, and the magnitude of this intergenerational inbreeding depression effect was environment-dependent. Because we controlled for genetic effects and most environmental effects (through the experimental cross-fostering of nestlings), we conclude that the reduced survival was a result of maternal effects. Our results show that inbreeding can have complicated effects even within a genetic bottlenecked population where the "purging'' of recessive alleles is expected to reduce the effects of inbreeding depression.

AB The roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) is the second largest African antelope, distributed throughout the continent in sub-Saharan savannah habitat. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequencing (401 bp, n=137) and microsatellite genotyping (eight loci, n=137) were used to quantify the genetic variability within and among 18 populations of this species. The within-population diversity was low to moderate with an average mtDNA nucleotide diversity of 1.9% and average expected heterozygosity with the microsatellites of 46%, but significant differences were found among populations with both the mtDNA and microsatellite data. Different levels of genetic resolution were found using the two marker sets, but both lent strong support for the separation of West African populations (samples from Benin, Senegal and Ghana) from the remainder of the populations studied across the African continent. Mismatch distribution analyses revealed possible past refugia for roan in the west and east of Africa. The West African populations could be recognized together as an evolutionarily significant unit (ESU), referable to the subspecies H. e. koba. Samples from the rest of the continent constituted a geographically more diverse assemblage with genetic associations not strictly corresponding to the other recognized subspecies.

AB Increasingly, whales and dolphins are the focus of tourism activities in many coastal locations. Although these activities can affect individuals and populations of cetaceans, the biological significance and hence the cost of these impacts are as yet largely unknown. This study assessed the effects of boat interactions on the behavioral budget of two populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tersiops truncatus) living in similar fjords but exposed to different levels of tourism activities. This comparison makes it possible to assess the costs of short-term avoidance strategies and the threshold at which those strategies are no longer effective. The effects of boat interactions were the same in both fjords. The resting state was the most sensitive to interactions; socializing was less sensitive. Short-term displacement was a typical response to boat exposure: dolphins were more likely to travel after an interaction with a vessel. Although the behavioral budgets of these populations were significantly altered during interactions with boats, their overall behavioral budgets were unchanged. Dolphins in Milford Sound actively avoided boat interactions, possibly to maintain their overall behavioral budget unchanged. This active avoidance led to avoidance of the area. Characteristics of dolphin-boat interactions in Milford Sound suggest that the advantages gained by short-term avoidance are lost if, on average, fewer than 68 min elapse between successive interactions with boats. If dolphin-boat interactions were more frequent than this, the dolphins switched to a longer-term response: area avoidance.

AB Measurements of photosynthesis and respiration were made on leaves in summer in a Quercus rubra L. canopy at approximately hourly intervals throughout 5 days and nights. Leaves were selected in the upper canopy in fully sunlit conditions (upper) and in the lower canopy (lower). In addition, leaves in the upper canopy were shaded (upper shaded) to decrease photosynthesis rates. The data were used to test the hypothesis that total night-time respiration is dependent on total photosynthesis during the previous day and that the response is mediated through changes in storage in carbohydrate pools. Measurements were made on clear sunny days with similar solar irradiance and air temperature, except for the last day when temperature, especially at night, was lower than that for the previous days. Maximum rates of photosynthesis in the upper leaves (18.7 mumol m(-2) s(-1)) were approximately four times higher than those in the lower leaves (4.3 mumol m(-2) s(-1)) and maximum photosynthesis rates in the upper shaded leaves (8.0 mumol m(-2) s(-1)) were about half those in the upper leaves. There was a strong linear relationship between total night-time respiration and total photosynthesis during the previous day when rates of respiration were normalized to a fixed temperature of 20degreesC, removing the effects of temperature from this relationship. Measurements of specific leaf area, nitrogen and chlorophyll concentration and calculations of the maximum rate of carboxylation activity, V-cmax, were not significantly different between upper and upper shaded leaves 5 days after the shading treatment was started. There were small, but significant decreases in the rate of apparent maximum electron transport at saturating irradiance, J(max) (P>0.05), and light use efficiency, epsilon (P<0.05), for upper shaded leaves compared with those for upper leaves. This suggests that the duration of shading in the experiment was sufficient to initiate changes in the electron transport, but not the carboxylation processes of photosynthesis. Support for the hypothesis was provided from analysis of soluble sugar and starch concentrations in leaves. Respiration rates in the upper shaded leaves were lower than those expected from a relationship between respiration and soluble sugar concentration for fully exposed upper and lower leaves. However, there was no similar difference in starch concentrations. This suggests that shading for the duration of several days did not affect sugar concentrations but reduced starch concentrations in leaves, leading to lower rates of respiration at night. A model was used to quantify the significance of the findings on estimated canopy CO2 exchange for the full growing season. Introducing respiration as a function of total photosynthesis on the previous day resulted in a decrease in growing season night-time respiration by 23% compared with the value when respiration was held constant. This highlights the need for a process-based approach linking respiration to photosynthesis when modelling long-term carbon exchange in forest ecosystems.

AB 1. Predictions about how species will respond to climate warming are based commonly on eco-physiological models or niche models. One critique of this practice is that it ignores interspecific interactions.
   2. We examined how resource competition affects the responses of two ciliate species, Colpidium striatum Stein and Paramecium tetraurelia Sonneborn, to warming in laboratory microcosms.
   3. We found that warming had a negative effect on Colpidium abundance and a negligible effect on Paramecium abundance in the absence of interspecific competition. When Colpidium and Paramecium competed, however, Paramecium coexisted with Colpidium at low and high temperatures, and was competitively excluded at intermediate temperatures.
   4. Temperature-dependent strength of the interaction between Colpidium and Paramecium may explain the unexpected responses of Paramecium, which were inconsistent with its response to temperature in the absence of Colpidium.
   5. Our results provide further support for the important role of species interactions in understanding how species respond to environmental warming, and suggest that the complex interplay between species interactions and climate may make it extremely difficult to predict accurately how species embedded in complex communities will respond to climate warming.

AB Temperature and light responses of CO2 efflux of Fagus sylvatica (beech) current-year stems were measured for 1 yr to estimate their annual carbon balance.
   Gas exchanges were determined using infrared gas analysis. Seasonal patterns of a fluorescence parameter ((F-v/F-m)(max)), nitrogen and chlorophyll contents were also assessed in stems and leaves, using standard techniques.
   Basal respiration rates at 20degreesC (R-20) were very high during the growing season, reaching a maximum of 17 170 mumol m(-3) s(-1). Light-saturated assimilation followed the same seasonal pattern as R-20 . During the winter, chlorophyll content was undiminished compared with the summer, N content was slightly increased, and despite low (F-v/F-m)(max) values, instantaneous maximum assimilation could account for 80-110% of the respiration.
   For an average-size stem (4 mm diameter), the estimated annual respiration was 0.5 g carbon with 55% of this amount attributed to maintenance respiration. The potential assimilation contributed 0.2 g carbon and approximately compensated for the growth respiration. Information on older branches and trunks is now needed for estimations at the tree and stand levels.

AB Image analysis has greatly simplified the measurement of root systems, allowing more detailed and accurate assessment of standard root variables. However, maize (Zea mays L.) root morphology has primarily been studied in conventional hybrids. We tested the hypothesis that genotypes carrying the leafy trait (taller plants with more leaves and greater leaf area development) would have root morphologies differing from those of conventional maize hybrids. A 3 X 3 factorial experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three blocks, three fertilization levels (0, 127.5, and 255 kg N ha(-1) as NH4NO3), and three maize genotypes [leafy reduced stature (LRS), leafy normal stature (LNS), and a conventional commercial hybrid Pioneer 3905 (P3905)]. The genotypes were selected for their contrasting canopy and root architectures. Plants were grown in 63-L plastic containers, and the roots were measured at the silking stage (80 d from emergence) by scanner-based image analysis. In general, greater root length and root surface areas were obtained at an N fertilization rate of 127.5 kg N ha(-1) compared with either the absence of fertilizer N or the higher rate of 255 kg N ha(-1). For all genotypes 95% of root length was comprised of roots ranging from 0.20 to 0.40 rum in diameter. Total root length (4 kin) and total root surface area (3.2 m(2)) were similar for LNS and LRS genotypes and were greater than those of P3905 (1.4 km total root length and 1.1 m(2) surface area). Root diameter did not differ among genotypes.

AB DNA sequences of the first ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) were isolated from 10 ladybird beetle species (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) representing four subfamilies (Coccinellinae, Chilocorinae, Scymninae, and Coccidulinae). The spacers ranged in length from 791 to 2,572 bp, thereby including one of the longest ITS1s and exhibiting one of the most extreme cases of ITS1 size variation in eukaryotes recorded to date. The causes of length variation were therefore analyzed. Almost no putatively homologous sequence similarities were identified for the taxa included. The only exception was for the subfamily Coccinellinae, which yielded sequence similarities in six regions of approximately 550 nucleotide positions, primarily at the 5' and 3' ends of ITS1. The majority of differences in ITS1 length between taxa could be attributed to the presence of repetitive elements with comparatively long repeat units. Repetition arose several times independently and was confined to the middle of the spacer which, in contrast to the 5' and 3' ends. had not been inferred in previous studies to be subject to functional constraints. These elements were characterized by high rates of evolutionary change, most likely as a result of high substitution rates in combination with inefficient homogenization across repeats. The repeated origin and subsequent divergence of "long" repetitive elements should thus be assumed to be an important factor in the evolution of coccinellid ITS1.

ID EVOLUTION; SERPENTES; GENE; TREES
AB Published molecular phylogenetic studies of elapid snakes agree that the marine and Australo-Melanesian forms are collectively monophyletic. Recent studies, however, disagree on the relationships of the African, American, and Asian forms. To resolve the relationships of the African, American, and Asian species to each other and to the marine/Australo-Melanesian clade, we sequenced the entire cytochrome b gene for 28 elapids; 2 additional elapid sequences from Gen-Bank were also included. This sample includes all African, American, and Asian genera (except for the rare African Pseudohaje), as well as a representative sample of marine/Australo-Melanesian genera. The data were analyzed by the methods of maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood. Both types of analyses yielded similar trees, from which the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Homoroselaps falls outside a clade formed by the remaining elapids; (2) the remaining elapids are divisible into two broad sister clades, the marine/Australo-Melanesian species vs the African, American, and Asian species; (3) American coral snakes cluster with Asian coral snakes; and (4) the "true" cobra genus Naja is probably not monophyletic as the result of excluding such genera as Boulengerina and Paranaja.

AB Marking reef fish with small, subcutaneous tags has proven to be a useful technique in ecological studies in both temperate and tropical systems. However, such tags may have adverse impacts on tagged individuals, possibly biasing estimates of demographic rates. We used field experiments on natural and artificial patch reefs to test for effects of subcutaneous acrylic paint and visual implant (VI) tags on the growth and mortality of the tropical goby Coryphopterus glaucofraenum (Gill). Growth of small (< similar to 35 mm TL) C. glaucofraenum marked with acrylic paint was slower than that of similarly sized fish marked with VI tags, but growth of larger (> similar to 35 mm TL) fish was unaffected by tagging method. Neither acrylic paint, nor VI tags, influenced the mortality of C. glaucofraenum. We also conducted experiments in large outdoor tanks to test whether visual implant fluorescent elastomer (VIE) tags increased the susceptibility to predation of two temperate gobies, Coryphopterus nicholsii (Bean) and Lythrypnus dalli (Gilbert). For both goby species, tagged fish were no more susceptible to predatory kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus (Girard) than untagged fish. Overall, with the exception of the slight reduction in growth of small C. glaucofraenum caused by acrylic paint tags, our results indicate that internal microtags can provide an effective means of marking small reef fish without introducing significant artifacts.

AB Even though plastid aldolase catalyses a reversible reaction, does not possess properties allowing it to contribute to 'fine' regulation, and would therefore be considered unimportant for the control of metabolism and growth, antisense transformants with a 50-70% decrease in aldolase activity showed an inhibition of photosynthesis and growth. We now show that acclimation of photosynthesis to growth conditions includes and requires changes in plastid aldolase activity. Wild-type potato plants and transformants were grown at low irradiance (70 mu mol m(-2) sec(-1)), and at high irradiance (390 mu mol m(-2) sec(-1)) at 400 or 800 p.p.m, carbon dioxide. (i) Ambient photosynthesis was always inhibited by a 30-40% decrease of aldolase activity, the strongest inhibition being observed when plants were growing in high irradiance and elevated carbon dioxide. (ii) The inhibition was due to a low rate of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate regeneration in low light, exacerbated by an inadequate rate of starch synthesis in high light and elevated carbon dioxide. Decreased expression of aldolase in antisense transformants was also accompanied by a decrease of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase protein and activity, and Rubisco activity. Transcript levels for the plastid fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and the small subunit of Rubisco did not decrease. (iii) In wild-type plants, increasing the growth irradiance from 70 to 390 mu mol m(-2) sec(-1) led to a 15-95% increase of the activity of eight Calvin cycle enzymes, and increasing the carbon dioxide concentration from 400 to 800 p.p.m, led to a 5-35% decrease of these enzyme activities. The largest changes occurred for aldolase, and for transketolase which also catalyses a reversible reaction and is not subject to 'fine' regulation.

AB Canopy gaps are a fairly well-studied phenomenon in tropical forests, but less well known are their belowground effects on patterns of root length and biomass and the consequences of such changes on regeneration and community structure. I examined canopy gaps and adjacent understory sites on two soil types of contrasting fertility in a lowland rain forest in Costa Rica to determine (1) whether canopy gaps create root gaps beneath the canopy opening, and (2) whether the effects of such root gaps on root ingrowth rates, root competition, and root responses to nutrient heterogeneity are related to soil type. Based on soil coring, canopy gaps had less fine (<2 mm) root length and biomass than comparable closed canopy sites. Reductions in root length and biomass were greater on the infertile (residual) soil type than the fertile (alluvial) type but were unrelated to gap size, age, or percentage canopy openness. Additionally, I measured root competition in a trenching experiment using the pioneer tree Hampea appendiculata as a bioassay species. Light appeared to be the only factor limiting relative growth rate, as seedlings grew faster in the canopy gaps than in the understory, regardless of soil type or trenching treatment (trench lined with root restriction cloth, trench open to colonization by neighboring roots, or no trench). The accumulation rate of live fine roots was unaffected by soil or light conditions. Finally, I altered nutrient heterogeneity of the gap and understory sites through the creation of fertilized microsites. Root proliferation into these microsites was enhanced only in the canopy gaps on the infertile soil. The differences between the two soil types in the amount of root length and biomass and in root proliferation responses suggest that the consequences of canopy gap formation may be dependent on background levels of soil fertility.

We used tomato plants to examine the consequences of drought stress intensity on plant chemistry potentially important to insect herbivores in order to gain insights into resolving these conflicting results. In a series of experiments conducted out-of-doors, we measured the concentration of five chemicals previously shown to act as growth reducers against herbivores (2 oxidative enzymes, 2 phenolics, proteinase inhibitor) in control plants and drought-stressed plants over a period of about 14 d. Three of the five defenses increased in response to increasing drought (polyphenol oxidase, rutin, chlorogenic acid), one showed no response (peroxidase) and one was inconsistent in its response (proteinase inhibitor). Simultaneously, we measured three chemicals thought to be important nutrients for insect herbivores (water content, total nitrogen, and soluble carbohydrates). Water content declined with increasing drought stress intensity, total nitrogen increased at severe stress in one experiment and did not respond in a second, and soluble carbohydrates showed a convex response to drought stress. In one experiment we also fed leaf tissue, incorporated into non-nutritive agar, from control and drought-stressed plants to neonate Spodoptera exigua larvae. Growth of these larvae over a 7-d period was negatively affected by drought stress while survival was not significantly affected.
   This study represents one of the first to assess both chemical defenses and nutrients in plants subjected to drought as it develops from slight stress to a very severe condition. Depending on the direction and shape of response curves for nutrients and defenses, many possible effects on herbivores are predicted, some of them complex and nonlinear. By studying the particular kinetics of defenses and nutrients in plants we may be in a better position to understand why insect herbivores show such variable responses to drought-stressed plants.

AB Models of plant water fluxes have evolved from studies focussed on understanding the detailed structure and functioning of specific components of the soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) continuum to architectures often incorporated inside eco-hydrological and terrestrial biosphere (TB) model schemes. We review here the historical evolution of this field, examine the basic structure of a simplified individual-based model of plant water transport, highlight selected applications for specific ecological problems and conclude by examining outstanding issues requiring further improvements in modelling vegetation water fluxes. We particularly emphasise issues related to the scaling from tissue-level traits to individual-based predictions of water transport, the representation of nonlinear and hysteretic behaviour in soil-xylem hydraulics and the need to incorporate knowledge of hydraulics within broader frameworks of plant ecological strategies and their consequences for predicting community demography and dynamics.

AB Macroecology and biogeography are concerned with understanding biodiversity patterns across space and time. In the past, the two disciplines have addressed this question mainly with correlative approaches, despite frequent calls for more mechanistic explanations. Recent advances in computational power, theoretical understanding, and statistical tools are, however, currently facilitating the development of more system-oriented, mechanistic models. We review these models, identify different model types and theoretical frameworks, compare their processes and properties, and summarize emergent findings. We show that ecological (physiology, demographics, dispersal, biotic interactions) and evolutionary processes, as well as environmental and human-induced drivers, are increasingly modelled mechanistically; and that new insights into biodiversity dynamics emerge from these models. Yet, substantial challenges still lie ahead for this young research field. Among these, we identify scaling, calibration, validation, and balancing complexity as pressing issues. Moreover, particular process combinations are still understudied, and so far models tend to be developed for specific applications. Future work should aim at developing more flexible and modular models that not only allow different ecological theories to be expressed and contrasted, but which are also built for tight integration with all macroecological data sources. Moving the field towards such a systems macroecology' will test and improve our understanding of the causal pathways through which eco-evolutionary processes create diversity patterns across spatial and temporal scales.

AB The alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), which is sensitive to global climate change and human activities, is subjected to addition of nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the soil. The impacts of N or P on ecosystem structure and function depend at least partly on the response of soil fungal communities, although few studies have compared the effects of N and P addition, both separately and together. We examined the responses of composition of the soil fungal community to 3-year experimental nutrient additions (control, N, N plus P, and P) in a typical alpine meadow of the QTP. We found that P addition, regardless of N addition, significantly reduced fungal species richness and changed fungal community composition, while the effect of N was undetectable. Nitrogen plus phosphorus caused a more distinct community than either N or P addition alone. Multivariate regression tree, canonical correspondence analysis, and distance-based multivariate linear model analyses all suggested available P was a key parameter determining the diversity and composition of the fungal community. Other parameters such as dissolved organic N, aboveground net primary productivity of forbs, and dissolved organic C played important but secondary roles. The results indicated an important role of P in structuring soil fungal communities in the alpine meadow. Our results suggest that fungal diversity loss and long-term changes in ecosystem stability can result from fertilization management in the fragile alpine environment.

AB Fire and herbivory are the two consumers of above-ground biomass globally. They have contrasting impacts as they differ in terms of selectivity and temporal occurrence. Here, we integrate continental-scale data on fire and herbivory in Africa to explore (i) how environmental drivers constrain these two consumers and (ii) the degree to which each consumer affects the other. Environments conducive to mammalian herbivory are not necessarily the same as those conducive to fire, although their spheres of influence do overlap-especially in grassy ecosystems which are known for their frequent fires and abundance of large mammalian herbivores. Interactions between fire and herbivory can be competitive, facultative or antagonistic, and we explore this with reference to the potential for alternative ecosystem states. Although fire removes orders of magnitude more biomass than herbivory their methane emissions are very similar, and in the past, herbivores probably emitted more methane than fire. We contrast the type of herbivory and fire in different ecosystems to define 'consumer-realms'.

AB Context Hill stations are known for their favorable cool climate and natural environments which generate valuable ecosystem services that benefit the local population, tourists and visitors. However, rapid urbanization threatens the sustainability of these highly valued fragile landscapes.
   Objectives We aim to characterize and quantify the changes in the landscape patterns and ecosystem service values (ESVs) of Baguio (Philippines), Bogor (Indonesia), Dalat (Vietnam), and Pyin Oo Lwin (Myanmar), and discuss their implications to landscape sustainability.
   Methods We used remote sensing imagery to map land-use/cover (2001 and 2014), and spatial metrics and gradient analysis to characterize the changes in landscape pattern. We employed a benefit transfer method to estimate the changes in ESV and human-to-ESV ratio. A land-change model was used to simulate different scenarios of future built-up expansions (2014-2030).
   Results The landscapes of Dalat and Pyin Oo Lwin are becoming more fragmented, while those of Baguio and Bogor are getting more aggregated. Dalat had the highest decrease (absolute change) in ESV and H-ESV ratio, while Bogor had the highest percentage decrease (2001-2014).
   Conclusions Rapid urbanization has been a major factor in the landscape transformation of Baguio, Bogor, Dalat and Pyin Oo Lwin. If the current built-up expansion rate will speed up, the decline in future ESV and H-ESV ratio (2014-2030) will be higher than if the rate will continue or slow down. Unless the concept of landscape sustainability is taken seriously in landscape and urban planning, the respective 'values' of these precious hill stations will become less and less.

AB Agroforestry offers proven strategies as an environmentally benign and ecologically sustainable land management practice to promote ecosystem services. In this literature review, we systematically consider the agroforestry and ecosystem services literature with the aim to identify and catalogue the knowledge field and provide the first systematic synthesis of ecosystem services research in relation to European agroforestry. We reviewed 71 scientific publications from studies conducted in farmland and forest ecosystems with various types of agroforestry management. Each publication was systematically characterized and classified by agroforestry practice and research approach in order to provide an insight into the current research state in addressing ecosystem services (including methods, indicators, and approaches). Spatial distribution of the case study sites in Europe was also explored. In addition, typical clusters of similar research approaches were identified.
   The results show that ecosystem service assessment of European agroforestry is currently focused on the spatially extensive wood pastures in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Continental agricultural mosaic landscapes. A specific emphasis has been on regulating, supporting, and provisioning services, such as provision of habitat and biodiversity, food, climate regulation, fibre, and fuel, and the consideration of cultural services has been largely limited to aesthetic value. There is a bias to biophysical and monetary research approaches. The majority of the studies focus on quantitative methods and biophysical field measurements addressing the assessment of only one or two services. Monetary approaches have been applied in less than one fifth of the studies but form a distinctive group.
   Our results highlight gaps and biases in the ecosystem service research agenda within agroforestry based on which we conclude that research should aim to diversify from the biophysical and monetary approaches, towards a wider variety of approaches, especially socio-cultural, and a wider coverage of ecosystem services, Stronger consideration of stakeholder participation and introduction of spatially explicit mapping are also important key actions. We make suggestions to advance the promise of ecosystem services provision from European agroforestry in decision making including various actors, stakeholders, and institutions, with strong links to policy processes, such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy and Common Agricultural Policy.

AB Background and Aims Extreme climatic events such as severe droughts are expected to increase with climate change and to limit grassland perennity. The present study aimed to characterize the adaptive responses by which temperate herbaceous grassland species resist, survive and recover from a severe drought and to explore the relationships between plant resource use and drought resistance strategies.
   Methods Monocultures of six native perennial species from upland grasslands and one Mediterranean drought-resistant cultivar were compared under semi-controlled and non-limiting rooting depth conditions. Above- and below-ground traits were measured under irrigation in spring and during drought in summer (50 d of withholding water) in order to characterize resource use and drought resistance strategies. Plants were then rehydrated and assessed for survival (after 15 d) and recovery (after 1 year).
   Key Results Dehydration avoidance through water uptake was associated with species that had deep roots (> 1 center dot 2 m) and high root mass (> 4 kg m(-3)). Cell membrane stability ensuring dehydration tolerance of roots and meristems was positively correlated with fructan content and negatively correlated with sucrose content. Species that survived and recovered best combined high resource acquisition in spring (leaf elongation rate > 9 mm d(-1) and rooting depth > 1 center dot 2 m) with both high dehydration avoidance and tolerance strategies.
   Conclusions Most of the native forage species, dominant in upland grassland, were able to survive and recover from extreme drought, but with various time lags. Overall the results suggest that the wide range of interspecific functional strategies for coping with drought may enhance the resilience of upland grassland plant communities under extreme drought events.

AB Pest control through integrated pest management systems stands as a very convenient sustainable hazard-free alternative to pesticides, which are a growing global concern if overused. The ability of the soprano pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus pygmaeus) to control the rice borer moth (Chilo supressalis), which constitutes a major pest of rice around the world, was studied in the Ebre Delta, Northeastern Iberia. Evidence was found on the ability of this particular bat species to control borer infestations: (a) the moth was consumed during at least the last two peaks of the moth activity, when most crop damage is done; (b) the activity of bats significantly increased with moth abundance in the rice paddies; (c) the pest levels have declined in the study area (Buda Island, Eastern Ebre Delta) after the deployment of bat boxes and their subsequent occupation by soprano pipistrelles. The value of the ecosystem service provided by bats was estimated at a minimum of 21 per hectare, equivalent to the avoided pesticide expenditure alone. We suggest that this natural service can be enhanced by providing bat populations with artificial roosts in rice paddies were some key ecosystem features are present.

AB User profiling is crucial to many online services. Several recent studies suggest that demographic attributes are predictable from different online behavioral data, such as users' "Likes" on Facebook, friendship relations, and the linguistic characteristics of tweets. But location check-ins, as a bridge of users' offline and online lives, have by and large been overlooked in inferring user profiles.
   In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of location check-ins for inferring users' demographics and propose a simple yet general location to profile (L2P) framework. More specifically, we extract rich semantics of users' check-ins in terms of spatiality, temporality, and location knowledge, where the location knowledge is enriched with semantics mined from heterogeneous domains including both online customer review sites and social networks. Additionally, tensor factorization is employed to draw out low dimensional representations of users' intrinsic check-in preferences considering the above factors. Meanwhile, the extracted features are used to train predictive models for inferring various demographic attributes.
   We collect a large dataset consisting of profiles of 159, 530 verified users from an online social network. Extensive experimental results based upon this dataset validate that: 1) Location check-ins are diagnostic representations of a variety of demographic attributes, such as gender, age, education background, and marital status; 2) The proposed framework substantially outperforms compared models for profile inference in terms of various evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, F-measure, and AUC.

AB Anadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a species of major conservation and management concern in North America, where population abundance has been declining over the past 30years. Effective conservation actions require the delineation of conservation units to appropriately reflect the spatial scale of intraspecific variation and local adaptation. Towards this goal, we used the most comprehensive genetic and genomic database for Atlantic salmon to date, covering the entire North American range of the species. The database included microsatellite data from 9142 individuals from 149 sampling locations and data from a medium-density SNP array providing genotypes for >3000 SNPs for 50 sampling locations. We used neutral and putatively selected loci to integrate adaptive information in the definition of conservation units. Bayesian clustering with the microsatellite data set and with neutral SNPs identified regional groupings largely consistent with previously published regional assessments. The use of outlier SNPs did not result in major differences in the regional groupings, suggesting that neutral markers can reflect the geographic scale of local adaptation despite not being under selection. We also performed assignment tests to compare power obtained from microsatellites, neutral SNPs and outlier SNPs. Using SNP data substantially improved power compared to microsatellites, and an assignment success of 97% to the population of origin and of 100% to the region of origin was achieved when all SNP loci were used. Using outlier SNPs only resulted in minor improvements to assignment success to the population of origin but improved regional assignment. We discuss the implications of these new genetic resources for the conservation and management of Atlantic salmon in North America.

AB Various nucleotide substitution models have been developed to accommodate among lineage rate heterogeneity, thereby relaxing the assumptions of the strict molecular clock. Recently developed "uncorrelated relaxed clock" and "random local clock" (RLC) models allow decoupling of nucleotide substitution rates between descendant lineages and are thus predicted to perform better in the presence of lineage-specific rate heterogeneity. However, it is uncertain how these models perform in the presence of punctuated shifts in substitution rate, especially between closely related clades. Using cetaceans (whales and dolphins) as a case study, we test the performance of these two substitution models in estimating both molecular rates and divergence times in the presence of substantial lineage-specific rate heterogeneity. Our RLC analyses of whole mitochondrial genome alignments find evidence for up to ten clade-specific nucleotide substitution rate shifts in cetaceans. We provide evidence that in the uncorrelated relaxed clock framework, a punctuated shift in the rate of molecular evolution within a subclade results in posterior rate estimates that are either misled or intermediate between the disparate rate classes present in baleen and toothed whales. Using simulations, we demonstrate abrupt changes in rate isolated to one or a few lineages in the phylogeny can mislead rate and age estimation, even when the node of interest is calibrated. We further demonstrate how increasing prior age uncertainty can bias rate and age estimates, even while the 95% highest posterior density around age estimates decreases; in other words, increased precision for an inaccurate estimate. We interpret the use of external calibrations in divergence time studies in light of these results, suggesting that rate shifts at deep time scales may mislead inferences of absolute molecular rates and ages.

AB Tardigrades constitute a phylum of miniaturized metazoans with ca. 1030 living species, a fossil record that probably dates back to the Cambrian, and physiological properties that allow them to live in almost any environment known to host life on Earththey can also survive in space. Despite broad consensus regarding their membership of the superclade Ecdysozoa, the exact position of the phylum remains contested (some analyses suggest onychophorans and arthropods as their closest relatives, while others suggest a relationship to nematodes and nematomorphs) and the internal relationships of the phylum are still poorly understood. In the present study, we present a hypothesis of tardigrade relationships by examining more taxa and more markers than any previously published phylogeny of the group. We generated novel data for three markers (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, COI) for 42 individuals of 16 carefully identified species, comprising 12 genera and five families from the classes Heterotardigrada and Eutardigrada, and analysed them in conjunction with nearly all data available from GenBank. Our results show certain disagreement with current taxonomy both at higher ranks (families, orders, classes) and at low (generic) taxonomic levels. When studying the sensitivity to outgroup choice, the class Eutardigrada was monophyletic under only one combination of outgroups; all other combinations placed the eutardigrade order Apochela as sister to the class Heterotardigrada. Phylogenetic relationships within the other eutardigrade order, Parachela, were stable to outgroup choice. Eutardigrade superfamilies recently proposed by Sands and collaborators in the order Parachela were tested with the introduction of new sequences from additional genera, and the possible morphological synapomorphies supporting those superfamilies are discussed.

AB Determining how species' geographic ranges are governed by current climates and how they will respond to rapid climatic change poses a major biological challenge. Geographic ranges are often spatially fragmented and composed of genetically differentiated populations that are locally adapted to different thermal regimes. Tradeoffs between different aspects of thermal performance, such as between tolerance to high temperature and tolerance to low temperature or between maximal performance and breadth of performance, suggest that the performance of a given population will be a subset of that of the species. Therefore, species-level projections of distribution might overestimate the species' ability to persist at any given location. However, current approaches to modeling distributions often do not consider variation among populations. Here, we estimated genetically-based differences in thermal performance curves for growth among 12 populations of the scarlet monkeyflower, Mimulus cardinalis, a perennial herb of western North America. We inferred the maximum relative growth rate (RGR(max)), temperature optimum (T-opt), and temperature breadth (T-breadth) for each population. We used these data to test for tradeoffs in thermal performance, generate mechanistic population-level projections of distribution under current and future climates, and examine how variation in aspects of thermal performance influences forecasts of range shifts. Populations differed significantly in RGR(max) and had variable, but overlapping, estimates of T-opt and T-breadth. T-opt declined with latitude and increased with temperature of origin, consistent with tradeoffs between performances at low temperatures versus those at high temperatures. Further, T-breadth was negatively related to RGR(max), as expected for a specialist-generalist tradeoff. Parameters of the thermal performance curve influenced properties of projected distributions. For both current and future climates, T-opt was negatively related to latitudinal position, while T-breadth was positively related to projected range size. The magnitude and direction of range shifts also varied with T-opt and T-breadth, but sometimes in unexpected ways. For example, the fraction of habitat remaining suitable increased with T-opt but decreased with T-breadth. Northern limits of all populations were projected to shift north, but the magnitude of shift decreased with T-opt and increased with T-breadth. Median latitude was projected to shift north for populations with high T-breadth and low T-opt, but south for populations with low T-breadth and high T-opt. Distributions inferred by integrating population-level projections did not differ from a species-level projection that ignored variation among populations. However, the species-level approach masked the potential array of divergent responses by populations that might lead to genotypic sorting within the species' range. Thermal performance tradeoffs among populations within the species' range had important, but sometimes counterintuitive, effects on projected responses to climatic change.

AB Aphid feeding induces various defense signaling mechanisms in plants. The recognition of feeding activities by plants occurs through the use of transmembrane pattern recognition receptors (PRRS) or, acting largely inside the cell, polymorphic nucleotide-binding leucine-rich-repeat (NB-LRR) protein products, encoded by most R genes. Activation may induce defensive reactions which are the result of highly coordinated sequential changes at the cellular level comprising, among other changes, the synthesis of signaling molecules. The ensuing plant responses are followed by the transmission of defense response signal cascades. Signals are mediated by bioactive endogenous molecules, i.e. phytohormones, such as jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ET), abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellic acid (GA) and free radicals such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) which independently provide direct chemical resistance. Plant-induced defenses are also regulated by a network of inter-connecting signaling pathways, in which JA, SA, and ET play dominant roles. Both synergistic and inhibitory aspects of the cross-talk among these pathways have been reported. This paper presents molecular mechanisms of plant response to aphid feeding, the precise activation of various endogenous bioactive molecules signaling in the response of many plant species and their participation in the regulation of numerous defense genes, which lead to a specific metabolic effect. Selected important points in signal transduction pathways were also discussed in studies on plant response to aphid feeding.

AB The complexity inherent in variable, or mixed-severity fire regimes makes quantitative characterization of important fire regime attributes (e.g., proportion of landscape burned at different severities, size and distribution of stand-replacing patches) difficult. As a result, there is ambiguity associated with the term 'mixed-severity'. We address this ambiguity through spatial analysis of two recent wildland fires in upper elevation mixed-conifer forests that occurred in an area with over 30 years of relatively freely-burning natural fires. We take advantage of robust estimates of fire severity and detailed spatial datasets to investigate patterns and controls on stand-replacing patches within these fires. Stand-replacing patches made up 15% of the total burned area between the two fires, which consisted of many small patches (< 4 ha) and few large patches (> 60 ha). Smaller stand-replacing patches were generally associated with shrub-dominated (Arctostaphylos spp. and Ceanothus spp.) and pine-dominated vegetation types, while larger stand-replacing patches tended to occur in more shade-tolerant, fir-dominated types. Additionally, in shrub-dominated types stand-replacing patches were often constrained to the underlying patch of vegetation, which for the shrub type were smaller across the two fire areas than vegetation patches for all other dominant vegetation types. For white and red fir forest types we found little evidence of vegetation patch constraint on the extent of stand-replacing patches. The patch dynamics we identified can be used to inform management strategies for landscapes in similar forest types.

AB The first large systematic collection of benthic invertebrate megafauna from the Australian continental margin (depths > 100 m) revealed high species richness and novelty on the south-western continental slope (similar to 100-1100 m depth; similar to 18 degrees S-35 degrees S). A total of 1979 morphologically defined species was discriminated in seven taxa across all samples: Demospongiae, Decapoda, corals (Octocorallia and Antipatharia), Mollusca, Echinodermata, Ascidiacea, and Pycnogonida. Collectively, 59% were estimated to be new or unnamed species. The distribution pattern of megafaunal communities, analysed with a suite of 17 physical covariates, was most influenced at large spatial scales (>100s km) by bottom temperature, oxygen concentration and latitude, whereas at smaller scales (10s of km), seabed type was most influential. Many covariates are driven by the same physical processes and are correlated (e.g. to depth or latitude), thus it is not possible to ascribe causal relationships to fauna distributions. However, their identification highlights the spatial scales that determine the composition of megafaunal communities. Regional-scale transitions in bottom temperature and oxygen concentration are determined by water masses and currents that interact with the south-western margin seabed in different ways depending on location. The nested, smaller-scale heterogeneity of seabed type, classified simply as 'hard' or 'soft' terrain, differentiates consolidated attachment sites for sessile fauna from sediments suited to mobile and burrowing fauna. Different physical factors affect the distribution of benthic fauna at different scales. Collectively, these patterns of heterogeneity can be represented in a hierarchical framework that consists of biogeographic provinces, biomes, biogeomorphic features, terrains, and finer scales. The Australian government is using a hierarchical approach to identify bioregions for management purposes; a key aim is to ensure that a National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas (NRSMPA) will meet the requirement of comprehensiveness, adequacy and representativeness. Important findings from this study are that the provincial structure of invertebrate megabenthos broadly aligns with the provincial structure derived earlier from the distribution of fishes, but there are differences in the distribution of individual major taxa at both provincial and megahabitat scales. Representative coverage of rarer taxa or narrowly distributed taxa. might not be feasible at the same time as ensuring main fauna groups are adequately represented. The hierarchical scales of heterogeneity of the megabenthos in this area, the differences between taxa, and the high proportion of apparently rare species make it clear that it win be as important to manage the area outside the NRSMPA as to manage the NRSMPA itself. Management will be required at different scales that correspond to the multi-scale spatial heterogeneity of continental margin fauna.

AB Studies investigating the consequences of future climate changes on species distributions usually start with the assumption that species respond to climate changes in an individualistic fashion. This assumption has led researchers to use bioclimate envelope models that use present climate-range relationships to characterize species' limits of tolerance to climate, and then apply climate-change scenarios to enable projections of altered species distributions. However, there are techniques that combine climate variables together with information on the composition of assemblages to enable projections that are expected to mimic community dynamics. Here, we compare, for the first time, the performance of GLM (generalized linear model) and CQO (canonical quadratic ordination; a type of community-based GLM) for projecting distributions of species under climate change scenarios. We found that projections from these two methods varied both in terms of accuracy (GLM providing generally more accurate projections than CQO) and in the broad diversity patterns yielded (higher species richness values projected with CQO). Model outputs were also affected by species-specific traits, such as species range size and species geographical positions, supporting the view that methods are sensitive to different degrees of equilibrium of species distributions with climate. This study reveals differences in projections between individual- and community-based approaches that require further scrutiny, but it does not find support for unsupervised use community-based models for investigating climate change impacts on species distributions. Reasons for this lack of support are discussed.

AB Ticks spend most of their life cycle in the environment, and all tick life cycle stages are dependent on a complex combination of climate variables. Furthermore, host availability and vegetation significantly modulate the dynamics of tick populations. Tick recruitment is dependent oil successful reproduction, which in turn requires sufficient adult tick densities, available blood meal sources, and egg survival. Though many animals can serve as hosts, there are several determinants of host suitability. For example, host availability in time and space is an important determinant of tick bionomics. Shelter and protection from environmental extremes are critical to tick survival. Questing and diapausing ticks are vulnerable to extremes of temperature and humidity. There are concerns about]low predicted climate change may alter several critical features of host-parasite relationships of ticks, the potential for invasion of new areas or alteration of patterns of pathogen transmission in particular. However, modeling approaches that relate known occurrences of tick species to climate (and/or landscape) features and predict geographic occurrences are not completely fulfilling our needs to understand how the "tick panorama" can change as a consequence of these climate trends. This is a short review about the concept of ecological niche as applied to ticks, as well as some raised concerns about its evaluation and strict definition, and its usefulness to map geographical suitability for ticks. Comments about how climate, hosts, and landscape configuration are briefly discussed regarding its applicability to tick mapping and with reference about their impact on tick abundance. I will further comment on already published observations about observed changes in the geographical range of ticks in parts of Europe.

AB In a compartmented cultivation system. white clover (Trifolium repens Linn.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). with their roots freely intermingled, or separated by 37 mu m nylon mesh or plastic board. were grown together in an arsenic (As) contaminated soil. The influence of AM inoculation on plant growth, As uptake, phosphorus (P) nutrition, and plant competitions were investigated. Results showed that both plant species highly depended on mycorrhizas for surviving the As contamination. Mycorrhizal inoculation Substantially improved plant P nutrition, and in contrast markedly decreased root to shoot As translocation and shoot As concentrations. It also showed that mycorrhizas affected the competition between the two co-existing plant species, preferentially benefiting the clover plants in term of nutrient acquisition and biomass production. Based on the present study, the role of AM fungi in plant adaptation to As contamination. and their potential use for ecological restoration of As contaminated soils are discussed.

AB Species with strong preferences for early or late successional stages after fire may be extinction prone under current fire regimes. However, the extent of specialisation to time since fire is poorly understood, and, for reptiles, succession models for predicting responses are in the development phase. In this study we tested predictions of a reptile succession model, and identified species that may be fire specialists. Reptiles were sampled in five burnt and unburnt mallee Eucalyptus woodlands, Australia. Two, 400 m transects within each burn treatment were sampled using 11 pairs of pitfall-traps that were opened for five weeks over two summers. A habitat accommodation model of succession that was previously developed for mallee reptiles correctly predicted the observed responses of three of 16 common reptile species. A further four species showed non-significant trends in the predicted direction. However, eight other species showed unexpected responses. One species showed a strong interaction between burn age and location, requiring a two-dimensional successional model in contrast with the usual linear models explaining reptile responses to fire. one third of common species were not affected by fire and so may not have increased risks of extinction due to the fire suppression/incineration cycle. However, approximately half to two-thirds of common reptiles did have a fire response, so the risk of deterministic extinction in small fragments may be substantial. Further model development is needed to better predict fire responses and to assist the design of fire mosaics that can accommodate early and late successional fire specialists. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study we determine favourable areas for the monk parakeet, Myiopsitta monachus, in peninsular Spain to account for its current distribution and predict its future course according to its potential range. We applied a favourability function based on generalized linear models using the presence/absence of breeding colonies of the species and the values of a set of variables on the 5167 UTM 10 x 10 km squares comprising the study area. We calculated the factor of distribution change in presences predicted by the model, and grouped the variables into explanatory factors performing a variation partitioning to assess the explanatory power of each factor. Our model included six predictors to explain the presence and absence of the species. These predictors were grouped into three factors: human activity, climate, and topography. Purely human influences accounted for 63.8% of the variation of the final model, while topographical variables explained 15.2% and climate only 5.7%. We obtained a high distribution change factor in which the presences of the species were predicted to increase between two- and sevenfold. Taking into account highly favourable squares, we conclude that the species is still absent in more than 72% of potential settlement areas, and thus we expect a continuous increase in the distribution of the species. Human activity is the main force moulding the distribution of the species, and lies behind its fast expansion, which is not only active, but is also passive via releases and escapes. We identified the areas of likely future expansion of the exotic monk parakeet in Spain. The pest status of the species in its native range, together to its distribution trend, should be taken into account by wildlife agencies to consider options for management.

AB Doubtful Sound is home to one of the southernmost resident populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.). This population regularly interacts with scenic cruises. During these interactions, dolphins tend to horizontally and vertically avoid vessels, especially when the behavior of these vessels is intrusive. This study aimed at understanding the behavioral reactions of individuals to these interactions that lead to the disruption of the school's behavioral state. Observing the behavioral events performed by individuals during an interaction can help define the short-term reactions elicited by the boat presence. I recorded the behavioral events performed by all individuals of focal schools. The frequency of occurrence of all events was compared depending on the presence of vessels, their behavior, and the behavioral state of the focal school. Dolphins tended to perform more side flops while interacting with powerboats, a behavior which may be used as a non-vocal communication tool. Moreover, the movement of dolphins became more erratic during interactions with all types of vessels. These effects increased when the boats were more intrusive while interacting. This study shows that the impact of interaction with boats can be minimized if the vessels respect the guidelines in place.

AB Ecosystems and populations are known to be influenced not only by long-term climatic trends, but also by other short-term climatic modes, such as interannual and decadal-scale variabilities. Because interactions between climatic forcing, biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems are subtle and complex, analysis of long-term series of both biological and physical factors is essential to understanding these interactions. Here, we apply a wavelet analysis simultaneously to long-term datasets on the environment and on the populations and breeding success of three Antarctic seabirds (southern fulmar, snow petrel, emperor penguin) breeding in Terre Adelie, to study the effects of climate fluctuations on Antarctic marine ecosystems. We show that over the past 40 years, populations and demographic parameters of the three species fluctuate with a periodicity of 3-5 years that was also detected in sea-ice extent and the Southern Oscillation Index. Although the major periodicity of these interannual fluctuations is not common to different species and environmental variables, their cyclic characteristics reveal a significant change since 1980. Moreover, sliding-correlation analysis highlighted the relationships between environmental variables and the demography of the three species, with important change of correlation occurring between the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. These results suggest that a regime shift has probably occurred during this period, significantly affecting the Antarctic ecosystem, but with contrasted effects on the three species.

AB Human-induced erosion regularly delivers massive quantities of fine sediments into streams and rivers forming large static bodies of sediment known as sand slugs, which smother in-stream habitat, alter community structure, and decrease biodiversity. Sand slugs are widespread in parts of southeastern Australia as well as in many other parts of the world, and there is now considerable interest in restoring such affected streams. The reintroduction of large timber is widely suggested as a strategy for restoring habitat complexity, but this has rarely been tested in sand slug-affected streams. We examined the response of fish populations to wood addition to two streams in southeastern Australia that have been impacted by sand slugs. Manipulated sites (three per treatment) had either one or four timber structures added, and these sites were compared with (three) unmanipulated (control) sites before and after the manipulation occurred. Despite a supraseasonal drought during the study, we observed short-term increases in the abundance of Mountain galaxias (Galaxias olidus) at the four-structure sites, while both the four-structure and the one-structure treatments appeared to buffer against drought-induced declines in two other species, River blackfish (Gadopsis marmoratus) and Southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis), relative to controls. However, drought eventually caused the complete loss of surface water from these streams and the loss of fish from both manipulated and unmanipulated sites. Thus, although the study supports the use of timber structures as a means of increasing local fish abundances, these beneficial effects were, in these streams, contingent upon permanency of flow. Because sedimentation has depleted the number of permanent refuge pools in these creeks, recovery rates of the fauna (i.e., resilience) are likely to be slow. We therefore conclude that in streams subjected to frequent disturbance, restoring refugia may be as, if not more, important as restoring what we term residential habitat.

AB Knorr et al. (2005) concluded that soil organic carbon pools with longer turnover times are more sensitive to temperature. We show that this conclusion is equivocal, largely dependent on their specific selection of data and does not persist when the data set of Katterer et al. (1998) is analysed in a more appropriate way. Further, we analyse how statistical properties of the model parameters may interfere with correlative analyses that relate the Q(10) of soil respiration with the basal rate, where the latter is taken as a proxy for soil organic matter quality. We demonstrate that negative parameter correlations between Q(10)-values and base respiration rates are statistically expected and not necessarily provide evidence for a higher temperature sensitivity of low quality soil organic matter. Consequently, we propose it is premature to conclude that stable soil carbon is more sensitive to temperature than labile carbon.

AB Understanding how "control" is exercised in ecological systems, even giving a more appropriate definition or meaning to the word "control" in this context, is an important theoretical issue and would increase our ability to manage ecosystems. Conventionally, in food web ecology, the distinction is drawn between bottom-up and top-down control. In that literature, the bottom-up hypothesis asserts that the primary producers are the source of system regulation and the top-down hypothesis states that keystone species at a higher trophic level can regulate the system. However, we know that in reality control of system behavior is much more complex and distributed than this dichotomy would suggest. Indeed, there is an urgent need for a succinct, yet more complete and comprehensive conceptual framework for thinking about control and for deriving insights into what governs ecosystem organization. In an ecosystem, each element contributes to the overall flow-storage pattern observed in the system through its interactions with the other elements; in this sense, control is distributed among the system elements. Those pair-wise system interactions can be identified and quantified using network analysis. Since the network analysis methodology accounts for both the input (recipient-oriented) and output (donor-oriented) influences from each element, it is possible to use this methodology to move beyond the simple top-down and bottom-up perspective of control. Here, I connect the network analysis methodology to traditional control theory, reintroduce a network-based control parameter using flow analysis and extend the methodology to network storage analysis. Model ecosystems are constructed and used to investigate these properties. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aphid life cycles can encompass cyclical parthenogenesis, obligate parthenogenesis, obligate parthenogenesis with male production and an intermediate 'bet-hedging' strategy where an aphid genotype will over-winter by continuing to reproduce by parthenogenesis and by investment in sexually produced eggs. In this paper, we focus on aphid lineages that reproduce entirely parthenogenetically (asexual aphids), in contrast to those that have any sexual forms in the annual cycle. Using modern molecular techniques, aphid biologists have made many empirical observations showing that asexual lineages are widespread both geographically and temporally. Indeed, we are collectively beginning to gather data on the evolution and persistence of these lineages through time. Here we review aphid karyology and parthenogenesis, both essential for interpretation of the molecular and ecological evolution of aphid asexual lineages. We describe the growing list of studies that have identified aphid genotypes that are both temporally and geographically widespread. We then collate examples of molecular and chromosomal evolution in asexual aphids and review the literature pertaining to phenotypic evolution and ecological diversification of asexual aphid lineages. In addition, we briefly discuss the potential of bacterial endosymbionts and epigenetic effects to influence the evolution of asexual aphid lineages. Lastly we provide a list of aphid taxa believed to be obligately asexual. This will be a useful resource for those seeking parthenogenetic animals as study systems. In conclusion, we present guidelines for the use of the term clone in aphid biology and stress the need for well-designed and well-executed studies examining the potential of asexual aphid lineages for adaptive evolution.

AB Larvae of marine reef organisms settling into benthic habitats may vary greatly in individual quality. We evaluated potential effects of variation in larval growth rate (1 metric of quality) on larval duration, size-at-settlement, an post-settlement survival of recently settled kelp bass Paralabrax clathratus. We sampled kelp bass daily and weekly from standardized collectors located near the Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies, Santa Catalina Island, to characterize larval traits of settlers and surviving recruits. Using growth models to fit trajectories of larval otolith growth, we estimated instantaneous larval growth rates and found that these values were good predictors of larval duration and juvenile survival. Kelp bass that grew rapidly as larvae settled similar to8.5 d sooner than the slowest growing individuals; both groups had similar sized individuals at settlement, but fast growing larvae experienced enhanced survival during the first 5 d after settlement relative to slower growing larvae. There is growing evidence suggesting that larval experience continues to exert demographic consequences on subsequent life stages. This helps to explain some of the spatial and temporal variability that characterizes recruitment in marine systems.

AB An analysis using an artificial neural network model suggests that the tropical forests of north Queensland are highly sensitive to climate change within the range that is likely to occur in the next 50-100 years. The distribution and extent of environments suitable for 15 structural forest types were estimated, using the model, in 10 climate scenarios that include warming up to 1degreesC and altered precipitation from -10% to +20%. Large changes in the distribution of forest environments are predicted with even minor climate change. Increased precipitation favours some rainforest types, whereas decreased rainfall increases the area suitable for forests dominated by sclerophyllous genera such as Eucalyptus and Allocasuarina. Rainforest environments respond differentially to increased temperature. The area of lowland mesophyll vine forest environments increases with warming, whereas upland complex notophyll vine forest environments respond either positively or negatively to temperature, depending on precipitation. Highland rainforest environments (simple notophyll and simple microphyll vine fern forests and thickets), the habitat for many of the region's endemic vertebrates, decrease by 50% with only a 1degreesC warming. Estimates of the stress to present forests resulting from spatial shifts of forest environments (assuming no change in the present forest distributions) indicate that several forest types would be highly stressed by a 1degreesC warming and most are sensitive to any change in rainfall. Most forests will experience climates in the near future that are more appropriate to some other structural forest type. Thus, the propensity for ecological change in the region is high and, in the long term, significant shifts in the extent and spatial distribution of forests are likely. A detailed spatial analysis of the sensitivity to climate change indicates that the strongest effects of climate change will be experienced at boundaries between forest classes and in ecotonal communities between rainforest and open woodland.

AB Conservation plans for the North Pacific Coast are beginning to acknowledge that the old-growth forests remaining on the extensive archipelagos of the region may require a new management paradigm. Extensive timber harvesting activities on these islands may impact wildlife populations and be particularly detrimental to the large number of endemics. Because insular biotas have suffered a disproportionate number of documented extinctions worldwide, the documentation of taxonomic validity and spatial distribution of endemics should be a priority for management efforts. To date, few North Pacific coastal endemics have been reevaluated since their original descriptions. This study provides an independent view of endemism in the Alexander Archipelago of southeast Alaska through a phylogeographic assessment of eight species of mammals (Sorex monticolus, Glaucomys sabrinus, Microtus longicaudus, Clethrionomys rutilus, Clethrionomys gapperi, Martes americana, Mustela erminea, Ursus americanus). The molecular data (mitochondrial sequence variation of the cytochrome b gene) suggest a dynamic history of faunal interchange in the region. While some purported endemics show minimal levels of genetic divergence from other conspecific populations, other taxa appear to be more divergent than recognized by current taxonomy. Some species in the region are comprised of multiple clades or evolutionarily significant units. These reciprocally monophyletic lineages may be the result of multiple Holocene invasions (neoendemics) or they may have persisted in refugia (paleoendemics) in the region during Pleistocene glacial advances. This emerging historical perspective should have direct implications for the management of these endemic taxa. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The divergent evolution of protein sequences from genomic databases can be analyzed by the use of different mathematical models. The most common treat all sites in a protein sequence as equally variable. More sophisticated models acknowledge the fact that purifying selection generally tolerates variable amounts of amino acid replacement at different positions in a protein sequence. In their "stationary" versions, such models assume that the replacement rate at individual positions remains constant throughout evolutionary history. "Nonstationary" covarion versions, however, allow the replacement rate at a position to vary in different branches of the evolutionary tree. Recently, statistical methods have been developed that highlight this type of variation in replacement rates. Here, we show how positions that have variable rates of divergence in different regions of a tree ("covarion behavior"), coupled with analyses of experimental three-dimensional structures, can provide experimentally testable hypotheses that relate individual amino acid residues to specific functional differences in those branches. We illustrate this in the elongation factor family of proteins as a paradigm for applications of this type of analysis in functional genomics generally.

AB We present a comprehensive survey of genetic variation across the range of the narrowly distributed endemic Yosemite toad Bufo canorus, a declining amphibian restricted to the Sierra Nevada of California. Based on 322 bp of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence data, we found limited support for the monophyly of B. canorus and its closely related congener B. exsul to the exclusion of the widespread western toad B. boreas. However, B. exsul was always phylogenetically nested within B. canorus, suggesting that the latter may not be monophyletic. SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism) analysis of 372 individual B. canorus from 28 localities in Yosemite and Kings Canyon National Parks revealed no shared haplotypes among these two regions and lead us to interpret these two parks as distinct management units for B. canorus. Within Yosemite, we found significant genetic substructure both at the level of major drainages and among breeding ponds. Kings Canyon samples show a different pattern, with substantial variation among breeding sites, but no substructure among drainages. Across the range of B. canorus as well as among Yosemite ponds, we found an isolation-by-distance pattern suggestive of a stepping stone model of migration. However, in Kings Canyon we found no hint of such a pattern, suggesting that movement patterns of toads may be quite different in these nearby parklands. Our data imply that management for B. canorus should focus at the individual pond level, and effective management may necessitate reintroductions if local extirpations occur. A brief review of other pond-breeding anurans suggests that highly structured populations are often the case, and thus that our results for B. canorus may be general for other species of frogs and toads.

AB Mineral nutrition of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) was investigated along a transect extending from northern Sweden to central Italy. Nitrogen (N) concentrations of needles and leaves in stands growing on acid soils did not differ significantly between central Italy and southern Sweden(1.0+/-0.1 mmol N g(-1) for needles and 1.9+/-0.14 mmol N g(-1) for leaves). In both species, foliar N concentrations were highest in Germany (1.2 mmol N g(-1) for needles and 2.0 mmol N g(-1) for leaves) and decreased by 50% toward northern Sweden (0.5 mmol N g(-1)). Both species showed constant S/N and P/N ratios along the transect. Calcium, K and Mg concentrations generally reflected local soil conditions; however, Mg concentrations reached deficiency values in Germany. Leaf area per unit dry weight varied significantly along the transect with lowest values for Norway spruce recorded in northern Sweden and Italy (3.4 m(2) kg(-1)) and a maximum in central Europe (4.7 m(2) kg(-1)). A similar pattern was observed for beech.
   Despite the low variation in foliar N concentrations on the large geographic scale, local and regional variations in N concentrations equalled or exceeded the variation along the entire continental transect. Furthermore, nutrient contents (i.e., nutrient concentration x dry weight per needle or leaf) showed a greater variation than nutrient concentrations along the transect. Nitrogen contents of Norway spruce needles reached minimum values in northern Sweden (2.4 mu mol N needle(-1)) and maximum values in Denmark (5.0 mu mol N needle(-1)). The N content of beech leaves was highest in Denmark (242 mu mol N leaf(-1)).
   At the German site, foliar N content rather than N concentration reflected the seasonal dynamics of foliar growth and N storage of the two species. During foliage expansion, there was an initial rapid increase in N content and a decrease in N concentration. This pattern lasted for about 2 weeks after bud break and was followed by 6 weeks during which dry weight and N content of the foliage increased, resulting in a further decrease in N concentration. During summer, dry weight and N content of mature needles of Norway spruce increased further to reach a maximum in autumn, whereas N concentration remained constant. In spring, reallocation of N from 1- and 2-year-old needles was 1.5 and 1.0 mu mol N needle(-1), respectively. This remobilized N was a major source of N for the development of new needles, which had an N content of 1.5 mu mol N needle(-1) after bud break. The seasonal remobilization of N from old foliage decreased with increasing needle age. Needle N content and dry weight decreased progressively with age (1 mu mol N needle(-1) between age classes 2 and 5), whereas N concentrations remained constant.
   For Norway spruce, annual stemwood production was correlated with needle N content but not with foliar N concentration or with the total amount of N in the canopy. Interspecific and geographical differences in plant nutrition are discussed on the basis of competitive demands for C and N between growth of foliage and wood.

AB Within the same forest, photosynthesis can vary greatly among species and within an individual tree. Quantifying the magnitude of variation in leaf-level photosynthesis in a forest canopy will improve our understanding of and ability to model forest carbon cycling. This information requires extensive sampling of photosynthesis in the canopy. We used a 22-m-tall, four-wheel-drive aerial lift to reach five to ten leaves from the tops of numerous individuals of several species of temperate deciduous trees in central Massachusetts. The goals of this study were to measure light-saturated photosynthesis in co-occurring canopy tree species under field conditions, and to identify sampling schemes appropriate for canopy tree studies with challenging logistics. Photosynthesis differed significantly among species. Even though all leaves measured were canopy-top, sun-acclimated foliage, the more shade-tolerant species tended to have lower light-saturated photosynthetic rates (P-max) than the shade-intolerant species. Likewise, leaf mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen content (N) varied significantly between species. With only one exception, the shade-tolerant species tended to have lower nitrogen content on an area basis than the intolerant species, although the LMA did not differ systematically between these ecological types. Light-saturated P-max rates and nitrogen content, both calculated on either an area or a mass basis, and the leaf mass to area ratio, significantly differed not only among species, but also among individuals within species (P<0.0001 for both). Differences among species accounted for a greater proportion of variance in the P-max rates and the nitrogen content than the differences among individuals within a species (58.5-78.8% of the total variance for the measured parameters was attributed to species-level differences versus 5.5-17.4% of the variance was attributed to differences between individual trees of a given species). Furthermore, more variation is accounted for by differences among leaves in a single individual tree, than by differences among individual trees of a given species (10.7-30.4% versus 5.5-17.4%). This result allows us to compare species-level photosynthesis, even if the sample size of the number of trees is low. This is important because studies of canopy-level photosynthesis are often limited by the difficulty of canopy access. As an alternative to direct canopy access measurements of photosynthesis, it would be useful to find an ''easy-to-measure'' proxy for light-saturated photosynthetic rates to facilitate modeling forest carbon cycling. Across all species in this study, the strongest correlation was between nitrogen content expressed on an area basis (mmol m(-2), N-area) and light-saturated P-max rate (mu mol m(-2) s(-1), P-maxarea) (r(2)=0.511). However, within a given species, leaf nitrogen was not tightly correlated with photosynthesis. Our sampling design minimized intra-specific leaf-level variation (i.e., leaves were taken only from the top of the canopy and at only one point in the season). This implies that easy-to-measure trends in nitrogen con tent of leaves may be used to predict the species-specific light-saturated P-max rates.

AB We studied the effect of nitrogen supply (3.3 and 20.0 g.m(-2).yr(-1)) on the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of three Carer species that differ in maximum growth rate. The rank order of maximum growth rate of these species is: Carex diandra less than or equal to Carex rostrata < Carer acutiformis;. We distinguished two components of NUE: the mean residence time of nitrogen (MRT) in the plant and the nitrogen productivity (A). In this concept, NUE equals the product of MRT and A, and thus equals total productivity divided by the total N loss in litter.
   The N productivity (A) of C. diandra was significantly higher than that of C. rostrata and C. acutiformis. In each species A decreased strongly at enhanced N supply. The MRT of N differed substantially between species, but was not significantly affected by N supply. Contrary to what is generally found, the species with the lowest maximum growth rate (C. diandra) had the highest N turnover rate (lowest MRT), while the species with the highest maximum growth rate (C. acutiformis) had the lowest N turnover rate (highest MRT). In all species, the NUE decreased with increasing N supply. As a result of the observed patterns in N productivity and mean residence time, the species with the lowest maximum growth rate (C. diandra) had the lowest nitrogen use efficiency, while the species with the highest maximum growth rate (C. acutiformis) had the highest NUE. These results are not in agreement with the generally observed patterns in NUE along gradients of primary productivity.
   Comparisons of the results of this study with those of other studies show that generalizations of patterns of NUE along gradients of primary productivity should explicitly take into account which growth forms are compared (evergreen species vs. deciduous species, or [congeneric] species with the same growth form). Moreover, this study shows that factoring NUE into its components is a useful tool in the analysis of the adaptive significance of the N economy of plants.

AB The extent to which the parasitic angiosperm Striga hermonthica reduces the growth of its sorghum host is dependent on the concentration of nitrogen (as NH4NO3 in 40% Long Ashton Solution) supplied to the plants. The biomass of 0.5, 1 and 2 mol m-3 N-grown infected plants was 22, 30 and 66%, respectively, of uninfected plants after 140 d growth. The biomass of 3 and 4 mol m-3 N-grown infected plants differed little from uninfected plants. No grain was set in 0.5 and 1 mol m-3 N-grown infected plants, grain yield reached 42 and 73% of controls in 2 and 3 mol m-3 N-grown plants, and was unaffected in 4 mol m-3 N-grown plants. Striga hermonthica also altered the allometry and architecture of the host, at all but the highest N concentration. Higher N concentration (3 and 4 mol m-3 N) reduced the growth of S. hermonthica. Foliar N concentrations in sorghum ranged from 11 mg g-1 dwt. in 0.5 mol m-3 N-grown plants, to 28 mg g-1 dwt. in 4 mol m-3 N-grown plants, and were not affected by S. hermonthica. Higher N concentrations were measured in S. hermonthica, and ranged from 18 to 45 mg g-1 dwt. in 0.5 and 3 mol m-3 N-grown plants, respectively. The relationship between photosynthesiS (CO2 flux) and N concentration differed between uninfected and infected sorghum. This was most apparent in 0.5 mol m-3 N-grown plants, with rates of 16 and 11 mumol m-2 s-1 in uninfected and infected plants, respectively (at 1500-1800 mumol m-2 s-1 photosynthetic photon flux density). At higher N concentrations, this difference was smaller, with both sets of plants reaching 26 mumol m-2 s-1 at 4 mol m-3 N. Varying the level of S. hermonthica infection showed that the effect of N on host photosynthesis cannot be explained by differences in the mass or number of parasites supported by the host. At low levels of infection in 1 mol m-3 N-grown plants, the negative effect of the parasite was reversed, and photosynthesis in infected plants exceeded that in uninfected plants by 20%. Photosynthesis in S. hermonthica at 3 mol m-3 N (8 mumol m-2  s-1) was double that in 0.5 mol m-3 N-grown plants. Stable carbon isotope and gas exchange measurements data demonstrated that this higher level of autotrophic carbon fixation was accompanied by a lower dependency on heterotrophic carbon. The latter ranged from 27 to 6% in 0.5 mol m-3 and 3 mol m-3  N-grown plants, respectively.

AB The atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) level is rising and is expected to double during the next century. This paper reviews information on the responses of pasture species and communities to elevated CO2. Data for some further non-arable species are included where relevant. The effect of CO2 on yield and on morphological and physiological characteristics are considered together with aspects of particular relevance to pasture, for example, herbivory, plant community relationships, and experimental methods for the exposure of pasture to elevated CO2. At the plant level, physiological responses to CO2 include enhanced net photosynthesis and reduced stomatal conductance; morphological changes include greater leaf areas, shoot production, and root: shoot ratios. Little is known about community responses or about plant-herbivore dynamics at elevated CO2. Changes in herbage quality, tissue turnover, and botanical composition may be expected but confirmation of these responses will only be possible when data are available from long-term studies of grazed pasture at elevated CO2.

AB Urbanization and climate change are together exacerbating water scarcity-where water demand exceeds availability-for the world's cities. We quantify global urban water scarcity in 2016 and 2050 under four socioeconomic and climate change scenarios, and explored potential solutions. Here we show the global urban population facing water scarcity is projected to increase from 933 million (one third of global urban population) in 2016 to 1.693-2.373 billion people (one third to nearly half of global urban population) in 2050, with India projected to be most severely affected in terms of growth in water-scarce urban population (increase of 153-422 million people). The number of large cities exposed to water scarcity is projected to increase from 193 to 193-284, including 10-20 megacities. More than two thirds of water-scarce cities can relieve water scarcity by infrastructure investment, but the potentially significant environmental trade-offs associated with large-scale water scarcity solutions must be guarded against.

AB China exemplifies the serious and widespread soil heavy metal pollution generated by mining activities. A total of 420 soil samples from 58 metal mines was collected across Eastern China. Total and available heavy metal concentrations, soil physico-chemical properties and geological indices were determined and collected. Risk assessments were applied, and a successive multivariate statistical analysis was carried out to provide insights into the heavy metal contamination characteristics and environmental drivers of heavy metal availability. The results suggested that although the degrees of pollution varied between different mine types, in general they had similar contamination characteristics in different regions. The major pollutants for total concentrations were found to be Cd and As in south and northeast China. The availability of Zn and Cd is relatively higher in south China. Soil physico-chemical properties had major effect on metal availability where soil pH was the most important factor. On a continental scale, soil pH and EC were influenced by the local climate patterns which could further impact on heavy metal availability. Enlightened by this study, future remediation strategies should be focused on steadily increasing soil pH, and building adaptable and sustainable ecological system to maintain low metal availabilities in mine site soils.

AB Biodiversity is under threat worldwide. Over the past decade, the field of population genomics has developed across nonmodel organisms, and the results of this research have begun to be applied in conservation and management of wildlife species. Genomics tools can provide precise estimates of basic features of wildlife populations, such as effective population size, inbreeding, demographic history and population structure, that are critical for conservation efforts. Moreover, population genomics studies can identify particular genetic loci and variants responsible for inbreeding depression or adaptation to changing environments, allowing for conservation efforts to estimate the capacity of populations to evolve and adapt in response to environmental change and to manage for adaptive variation. While connections from basic research to applied wildlife conservation have been slow to develop, these connections are increasingly strengthening. Here we review the primary areas in which population genomics approaches can be applied to wildlife conservation and management, highlight examples of how they have been used, and provide recommendations for building on the progress that has been made in this field.

AB Tropical forests are converted at an alarming rate for agricultural use and pastureland, but also regrow naturally through secondary succession. For successful forest restoration, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of secondary succession. These mechanisms may vary across forest types, but analyses across broad spatial scales are lacking. Here, we analyse forest recovery using 1,403 plots that differ in age since agricultural abandonment from 50 sites across the Neotropics. We analyse changes in community composition using species-specific stem wood density (WD), which is a key trait for plant growth, survival and forest carbon storage. In wet forest, succession proceeds from low towards high community WD (acquisitive towards conservative trait values), in line with standard successional theory. However, in dry forest, succession proceeds from high towards low community WD (conservative towards acquisitive trait values), probably because high WD reflects drought tolerance in harsh early successional environments. Dry season intensity drives WD recovery by influencing the start and trajectory of succession, resulting in convergence of the community WD over time as vegetation cover builds up. These ecological insights can be used to improve species selection for reforestation. Reforestation species selected to establish a first protective canopy layer should, among other criteria, ideally have a similar WD to the early successional communities that dominate under the prevailing macroclimatic conditions.

AB Globally, the allocation of root-shoot biomass is a key plant-adaptive strategy for terrestrial ecosystems to enhance carbon-sequestration capacity. However, the deep mechanisms of above-/below-ground biomass distribution remain unclear, partly due to the multiple influencing factors. We thus aim to clarify the role of various factors in biomass allocation across diverse terrestrial biomes in the paper. A key indicator named root/shoot ratio (RSR) was established, and 7763 observational data-sets were collected from literature, including root biomass, shoot biomass, plant height, climate information and the geographical coordinates. Results highlighted the differences in RSR across terrestrial plants in biomes with a mean value of approximately 0.90. Grasses and boreal forest captured the highest and lowest mean RSR, respectively, while tree had a lower mean RSR than shrub and grass. Angiosperms and deciduous plants, on the other hand, have a higher mean RSR than gymnosperms and evergreen plants, respectively. Moreover, RSR is negatively correlated with mean annual temperature, precipitation, plant height and shoot biomass, but positively correlated with elevation and latitude. Redundancy analysis reflected that biotic and abiotic factors explained RSR variability similarly with a residual of 0.883. These findings support the optimal partitioning hypothesis that plants adjust their growth strategy according to different environments, and in particular, tend to partition more biomass to root systems under more stressful, low-nutrient and poor climatic conditions.

AB Much ecological research aims to explain how climate impacts biodiversity and ecosystem-level processes through functional traits that link environment with individual performance. However, the specific climatic drivers of functional diversity across space and time remain unclear due largely to limitations in the availability of paired trait and climate data. We compile and analyze a global forest dataset using a method based on abundance-weighted trait moments to assess how climate influences the shapes of whole-community trait distributions. Our approach combines abundance-weighted metrics with diverse climate factors to produce a comprehensive catalog of trait-climate relationships that differ dramatically-27% of significant results change in sign and 71% disagree on sign, significance, or both-from traditional species-weighted methods. We find that (i) functional diversity generally declines with increasing latitude and elevation, (ii) temperature variability and vapor pressure are the strongest drivers of geographic shifts in functional composition and ecological strategies, and (iii) functional composition may currently be shifting over time due to rapid climate warming. Our analysis demonstrates that climate strongly governs functional diversity and provides essential information needed to predict how biodiversity and ecosystem function will respond to climate change.

AB One of the most common approaches to reducing the environmental impact of nitrogen (N) fertilisation in intensive agrosystems is to adjust the N input of the crop requirement. This adjustment is frequently related to the nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) based on the concepts of the critical and actual N absorbed (kg/ha) in the crop canopy (respectively, N-c and CNC). Accurate estimation of the N-c and CNC at the field scale over large areas based on freely available satellite imagery is thus a key issue to address. Relying on a large dataset of farmers' fields, this study highlights the high correlation (R-2 = 0.90) between the wheat CNC and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) retrieved from Sentinel-2 (S2) with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The estimation is related to errors of 4 and 21 kg/ha (depending on the growing stage), which is a promising result for evaluating the NNI. There are four major outcomes from this result: (i) the importance of working at the canopy level; (ii) the independence of the relationship to the considered cultivars; (iii) the dependence of the relationship on the growing stage; and (iv) the potential to use only the 10 m S2 bands, opening the way for precision agriculture. In parallel, estimation accuracies were investigated for the three biophysical variables (BV) related to the CNC and N-c, i.e., the green area index (GAI), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) and CCC. From this analysis, the added value of the red-edge bands for improving the estimation of the 3 BVs of interest was quantified as was the performance reduction related to the field heterogeneity.

AB This paper employs the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in studying the impact of energy consumption, economic growth, and urbanization on carbon emissions in developing economies. Data from twelve developing East Asian and Pacific countries for the period 1990 to 2014 has been used for analysis. The empirical results, estimated through application of the System Generalized Method of Moment (GMM), show that energy consumption, economic growth, and urbanization all significantly increase carbon emissions, thereby adding to serious environmental challenges in the region. Moreover, public policies designed to shift economies from non-renewable to renewable energy resources have been taken into account, and their impact was found to have been insignificant in the sampled countries. However, the results depict an inverted U-shaped relationship between per capita economic growth and carbon emissions, confirming the existence of an EKC in the region. The empirical findings suggest that energy conservation and policies fostering use of renewables helped to improve economic growth, control carbon emissions, and support the rising energy demand resulting from increased urban sprawl. In order to improve the influence of public policies in controlling carbon emissions, our analysis finds a need for stronger initiative to be taken in regional dialogues and policy frameworks, and for greater collaboration among diverse stakeholders often characterized by differing values, interests, and objectives.

AB Optimal nitrogen (N) management is essential for profitable vegetable crop production and to minimize N losses to the environment that are a consequence of an excessive N supply. Proximal optical sensors placed in contact with or close to the crop can provide a rapid assessment of a crop N status. Three types of proximal optical sensors (chlorophyll meters, canopy reflectance sensors, and fluorescence-based flavonols meters) for monitoring the crop N status of vegetable crops are reviewed, addressing practical caveats and sampling considerations and evaluating the practical use of these sensors for crop N management. Research over recent decades has shown strong relationships between optical sensor measurements, and different measures of crop N status and of yield of vegetable species. However, the availability of both: (a) Sufficiency values to assess crop N status and (b) algorithms to translate sensor measurements into N fertilizer recommendations are limited for vegetable crops. Optical sensors have potential for N management of vegetable crops. However, research should go beyond merely diagnosing crop N status. Research should now focus on the determination of practical fertilization recommendations. It is envisaged that the increasing environmental and societal pressure on sustainable crop N management will stimulate progress in this area.

AB Wildfires underpin the dynamics and diversity of many ecosystems worldwide, and plants show a plethora of adaptive traits for persisting recurrent fires. Many fire-prone ecosystems also harbor a rich fauna; however, knowledge about adaptive traits to fire in animals remains poorly explored. We review existing literature and suggest that fire is an important evolutionary driver for animal diversity because (1) many animals are present in fire-prone landscapes and may have structural and phenotypic characters that contribute to adaptation to these open landscapes; and (2) in some cases, animals from fire-prone ecosystems may show specific fire adaptations. While there is limited evidence on morphological fire adaptations in animals, there is evidence suggesting that different behaviors might provide a rich source of putative fire adaptations; this is because, in contrast to plants, most animals are mobile, unitary organisms, have reduced survival when directly burnt by fire and can move away from the fire. We call for research on fire adaptations (morphological, behavioral, and physiological) in animals, and emphasize that in the animal kingdom many fire adaptations are likely to be behavioral. While it may be difficult to discern these adaptations from other animal behaviors, making this distinction is fundamental if we want to understand the role of fire in shaping biodiversity. Developing this understanding is critical to how we view and manage our ecosystems in the face of current global and fire regime changes.

AB Although classical ecological theory (e.g., on ideal free consumers) recognizes the potential effect of population density on the spatial distribution of animals, empirical species distribution models assume that species-habitat relationships remain unchanged across a range of population sizes. Conversely, even though ecological models and experiments have demonstrated the importance of spatial heterogeneity for the rate of population change, we still have no practical method for making the connection between the makeup of real environments, the expected distribution and fitness of their occupants, and the long-termimplications of fitness for population growth. Here, we synthesize several conceptual advances into a mathematical framework using a measure of fitness to link habitat availability/selection to (density-dependent) population growth in mobile animal species. A key feature of this approach is that it distinguishes between apparent habitat suitability and the true, underlying contribution of a habitat to fitness, allowing the statistical coefficients of both to be estimated from multiple observation instances of the species in different environments and stages of numerical growth. Hence, it leverages data from both historical population time series and snapshots of species distribution to predict population performance under environmental change. We propose this framework as a foundation for building more realistic connections between a population's use of space and its subsequent dynamics (and hence a contribution to the ongoing efforts to estimate a species' critical habitat and fundamental niche). We therefore detail its associated definitions and simplifying assumptions, because they point to the framework's future extensions. We show how the model can be fit to data on species distributions and population dynamics, using standard statistical methods, and we illustrate its application with an individual-based simulation. When contrasted with nonspatial population models, our approach is better at fitting and predicting population growth rates and carrying capacities. Our approach can be generalized to include a diverse range of biological considerations. We discuss these possible extensions and applications to real data.

AB Environmental decision support intends to use the best available scientific knowledge to help decision makers find and evaluate management alternatives. The goal of this process is to achieve the best fulfillment of societal objectives. This requires a careful analysis of (i) how scientific knowledge can be represented and quantified, (ii) how societal preferences can be described and elicited, and (iii) how these concepts can best be used to support communication with authorities, politicians, and the public in environmental management. The goal of this paper is to discuss key requirements for a conceptual framework to address these issues and to suggest how these can best be met. We argue that a combination of probability theory and scenario planning with multi-attribute utility theory fulfills these requirements, and discuss adaptations and extensions of these theories to improve their application for supporting environmental decision making. With respect to (i) we suggest the use of intersubjective probabilities, if required extended to imprecise probabilities, to describe the current state of scientific knowledge. To address (ii), we emphasize the importance of value functions, in addition to utilities, to support decisions under risk. We discuss the need for testing "non-standard" value aggregation techniques, the usefulness of flexibility of value functions regarding attribute data availability, the elicitation of value functions for sub-objectives from experts, and the consideration of uncertainty in value and utility elicitation. With respect to (iii), we outline a well-structured procedure for transparent environmental decision support that is based on a clear separation of scientific prediction and societal valuation. We illustrate aspects of the suggested methodology by its application to river management in general and with a small, didactical case study on spatial river rehabilitation prioritization.

AB Capture-recapture (CR) techniques are commonly used to gain information about population dynamics, demography and life-history traits of populations. However, traditional CR models cannot separate mortality from emigration. Recently developed spatial-capture-recapture (SCR) models explicitly incorporate spatial information into traditional CR models, thus allowing for individuals' movements to be modelled explicitly. In this paper, we extend SCR models using robust-design data to allow for both processes in which individuals can disappear from the population, mortality and dispersal, to be estimated separately. We formulate a general robust-design spatial capture-recapture (RD-SCR) model, explore the properties of the model in a simulation study and compare the results to a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model and a non-spatial robust-design model with temporary emigration. In the case study, we fit several versions of the general model to data on field voles (Microtus agrestis) and compare the results with those from the non-spatial models fitted to the same data. We also evaluate assumptions of the fitted models with a series of simulation-based posterior predictive goodness-of-fit checks that are applicable to the SCR models in general and the RD-SCR model in particular. The simulation results show that the model preforms well under a wide range of dispersal distances. Our model outperforms the traditional CR models in terms of both accuracy and precision for survival. The case study showed that adult females have an c. 35 times higher mortality rate than adult males. Males have larger home ranges and disperse longer distances than females, but both males and females mostly move their activity centres within their previous home range between trapping sessions at 3-week intervals. Our RD-SCR model has several advantages compared to other approaches to estimate true' survival instead of only apparent' survival. Additionally, the model extracts information about space use and dispersal distributions that are relevant for behavioural studies as well as studies of life-history variation, population dynamics and management. The model can be widely applied due to the flexible framework, and other variations of the model could easily be implemented.

AB Lyme borreliosis is rapidly emerging in Canada, and climate change is likely a key driver of the northern spread of the disease in North America. We used field and modeling approaches to predict the risk of occurrence of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria causing Lyme disease in North America. We combined climatic and landscape variables to model the current and future (2050) potential distribution of the black-legged tick and the white-footed mouse at the northeastern range limit of Lyme disease and estimated a risk index for B.burgdorferi from these distributions. The risk index was mostly constrained by the distribution of the white-footed mouse, driven by winter climatic conditions. The next factor contributing to the risk index was the distribution of the black-legged tick, estimated from the temperature. Landscape variables such as forest habitat and connectivity contributed little to the risk index. We predict a further northern expansion of B.burgdorferi of approximately 250-500km by 2050 - a rate of 3.5-11km per year - and identify areas of rapid rise in the risk of occurrence of B.burgdorferi. Our results will improve understanding of the spread of Lyme disease and inform management strategies at the most northern limit of its distribution.

AB Proteaceae species in south-western Australia occur on phosphorus- (P) impoverished soils. Their leaves contain very low P levels, but have relatively high rates of photosynthesis. We measured ribosomal RNA (rRNA) abundance, soluble protein, activities of several enzymes and glucose 6-phosphate (Glc6P) levels in expanding and mature leaves of six Proteaceae species in their natural habitat. The results were compared with those for Arabidopsis thaliana. Compared with A.thaliana, immature leaves of Proteaceae species contained very low levels of rRNA, especially plastidic rRNA. Proteaceae species showed slow development of the photosynthetic apparatus (delayed greening'), with young leaves having very low levels of chlorophyll and Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes. In mature leaves, soluble protein and Calvin-Benson cycle enzyme activities were low, but Glc6P levels were similar to those in A.thaliana. We propose that low ribosome abundance contributes to the high P efficiency of these Proteaceae species in three ways: (1) less P is invested in ribosomes; (2) the rate of growth and, hence, demand for P is low; and (3) the especially low plastidic ribosome abundance in young leaves delays formation of the photosynthetic machinery, spreading investment of P in rRNA. Although Calvin-Benson cycle enzyme activities are low, Glc6P levels are maintained, allowing their effective use.
   Proteaceae species in south-western Australia occur on phosphorus- impoverished soils. Their leaves contain very low phosphorus levels, but have relatively high rates of photosynthesis and activities of enzymes involved in primary metabolism, suggesting they do not compromise their metabolic machinery in order to save P. In contrast, we show that low ribosome abundance contributes to the high phosphorus-use efficiency of these Proteaceae species in three ways: less ribosomes means less P investment; the rate of growth and, hence, demand for phosphorus is decreased; young leaves show a delay in the formation of the photosynthetic machinery, exhibiting very low plastidic ribosome abundance and spreading investment of phosphorus in ribosomes over a longer time.

AB The corallivorous crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), Acanthaster planci, is recognised as a major cause of coral reef degradation throughout much of the Pacific Ocean. However, the effects of COTS on the high diversity reefs in Indonesia have been largely overlooked. In 2007, high densities of COTS were observed in two regions of Indonesia: Aceh and Halmahera. Densities of COTS ranged from 0 to 52 starfish 2,000 m(2) across 24 sites in Aceh and from 0 to 18 starfish 2,000 m(2) at 10 sites in Halmahera. Mortality rates of Acropora spp. were very high at affected sites: over 50 % of colonies had been killed at seven of the 16 affected sites. A review of historical sources going back to 1969 suggests that COTS have damaged many reefs throughout Indonesia, including much activity within the Indonesian section of the Coral Triangle. Furthermore, the data suggest that COTS activity has increased rapidly since 2000. Very little of this activity has been reported in the primary literature, and there is a general lack of awareness in Indonesia of COTS as a potential cause of reef degradation. This lack of awareness, combined with limited monitoring efforts, means that damage caused by COTS is often attributed to other causes, such as destructive fishing, bleaching or tsunami. COTS are clearly a major source of coral mortality in Indonesia of which scientists and government need to be more cognizant.

AB Indicators of the environmental sustainability of biofuel production, distribution, and use should be selected, measured, and interpreted with respect to the context in which they are used. The context of a sustainability assessment includes the purpose, the particular biofuel production and distribution system, policy conditions, stakeholder values, location, temporal influences, spatial scale, baselines, and reference scenarios. We recommend that biofuel sustainability questions be formulated with respect to the context, that appropriate indicators of environmental sustainability be developed or selected from more generic suites, and that decision makers consider context in ascribing meaning to indicators. In addition, considerations such as technical objectives, varying values and perspectives of stakeholder groups, indicator cost, and availability and reliability of data need to be understood and considered. Sustainability indicators for biofuels are most useful if adequate historical data are available, information can be collected at appropriate spatial and temporal scales, organizations are committed to use indicator information in the decision-making process, and indicators can effectively guide behavior toward more sustainable practices.

AB Recognizing the location of climatically stable areas in the future is subjected to uncertainties from ecological niche models, climatic models, variation in species ranges responses, and from the climatic variation through time. Here, we proposed an approach based on hierarchical ANOVA to reduce uncertainties and to identify climatically stable areas, working with Cerrado tree species as a model organism. Ecological niche models were generated for 18 Cerrado tree species and their potential distributions were projected into past and future. Analyses of the sources of uncertainties in ensembles hindcasts/forecasts revealed that the time component was the most important source of variation, whereas the climatic models had the smallest effect. The species responses to climate changes do not showed marked differences within each time period. By comparing past and future predictions, a single continuous climatically stable area was identified, which should be considered as a potential improvement for spatial prioritization for conservation.

AB Tropical forests play a major role in regulating global carbon (C) fluxes and stocks, and even small changes to C cycling in this productive biome could dramatically affect atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Temperature is expected to increase over all land surfaces in the future, yet we have a surprisingly poor understanding of how tropical forests will respond to this significant climatic change. Here we present a contemporary synthesis of the existing data and what they suggest about how tropical forests will respond to increasing temperatures. Our goals were to: (i) determine whether there is enough evidence to support the conclusion that increased temperature will affect tropical forest C balance; (ii) if there is sufficient evidence, determine what direction this effect will take; and, (iii) establish what steps should to be taken to resolve the uncertainties surrounding tropical forest responses to increasing temperatures. We approach these questions from a mass-balance perspective and therefore focus primarily on the effects of temperature on inputs and outputs of C, spanning microbial- to ecosystem-scale responses. We found that, while there is the strong potential for temperature to affect processes related to C cycling and storage in tropical forests, a notable lack of data combined with the physical, biological and chemical diversity of the forests themselves make it difficult to resolve this issue with certainty. We suggest a variety of experimental approaches that could help elucidate how tropical forests will respond to warming, including large-scale in situ manipulation experiments, longer term field experiments, the incorporation of a range of scales in the investigation of warming effects (both spatial and temporal), as well as the inclusion of a diversity of tropical forest sites. Finally, we highlight areas of tropical forest research where notably few data are available, including temperature effects on: nutrient cycling, heterotrophic versus autotrophic respiration, thermal acclimation versus substrate limitation of plant and microbial communities, below-ground C allocation, species composition (plant and microbial), and the hydraulic architecture of roots. Whether or not tropical forests will become a source or a sink of C in a warmer world remains highly uncertain. Given the importance of these ecosystems to the global C budget, resolving this uncertainty is a primary research priority.

AB We investigated the biogeographic history of Kalopanax septemlobus, one of the most widespread temperate tree species in East Asia, using a combined phylogeographic and palaeodistribution modelling approach. Range-wide genetic differentiation at nuclear microsatellites (G'ST = 0.709; 2205 samples genotyped at five loci) and chloroplast DNA (GST = 0.697; 576 samples sequenced for 2055 bp at three fragments) was high. A major phylogeographic break in Central China corresponded with those of other temperate species and the spatial delineation of the two temperate forest subkingdoms of East Asia, consistent with the forests having been isolated within both East and West China for multiple glacialinterglacial cycles. Evidence for multiple glacial refugia was found in most of its current range in China, South Japan and the southernmost part of the Korean Peninsula. In contrast, lineage admixture and absence of private alleles and haplotypes in Hokkaido and the northern Korean Peninsula support a postglacial origin of northernmost populations. Although palaeodistribution modelling predicted suitable climate across a land-bridge extending from South Japan to East China during the Last Glacial Maximum, the genetic differentiation of regional populations indicated a limited role of the exposed sea floor as a dispersal corridor at that time. Overall, this study provides evidence that differential impacts of Quaternary climate oscillation associated with landscape heterogeneity have shaped the genetic structure of a wide-ranging temperate tree in East Asia.

AB Photosynthetic capacity is one of the most sensitive parameters in vegetation models and its relationship to leaf nitrogen content links the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Process understanding for reliably predicting photosynthetic capacity is still missing. To advance this understanding we have tested across C-3 plant species the coordination hypothesis, which assumes nitrogen allocation to photosynthetic processes such that photosynthesis tends to be co-limited by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation and regeneration. The coordination hypothesis yields an analytical solution to predict photosynthetic capacity and calculate area-based leaf nitrogen content (N-a). The resulting model linking leaf photosynthesis, stomata conductance and nitrogen investment provides testable hypotheses about the physiological regulation of these processes. Based on a dataset of 293 observations for 31 species grown under a range of environmental conditions, we confirm the coordination hypothesis: under mean environmental conditions experienced by leaves during the preceding month, RuBP carboxylation equals RuBP regeneration. We identify three key parameters for photosynthetic coordination: specific leaf area and two photosynthetic traits (k(3), which modulates N investment and is the ratio of RuBP carboxylation/oxygenation capacity (V-Cmax) to leaf photosynthetic N content (N-pa); and J(fac), which modulates photosynthesis for a given k(3) and is the ratio of RuBP regeneration capacity (J(max)) to V-Cmax). With species-specific parameter values of SLA, k(3) and J(fac), our leaf photosynthesis coordination model accounts for 93% of the total variance in N-a across species and environmental conditions. A calibration by plant functional type of k(3) and J(fac) still leads to accurate model prediction of N-a, while SLA calibration is essentially required at species level. Observed variations in k(3) and J(fac) are partly explained by environmental and phylogenetic constraints, while SLA variation is partly explained by phylogeny. These results open a new avenue for predicting photosynthetic capacity and leaf nitrogen content in vegetation models.

AB Humified soil organic matter storage in boreal forests is large, and its responses to warming over relatively long timescales is critical for predicting soil feedbacks to climate change. To derive information relevant across decades to centuries from manipulative short-term experiments, we conducted incubations of soils from two forested sites along the Newfoundland-Labrador Boreal Ecosystem Latitude Transect in eastern Canada and assessed linkages between incubation data and these sites' profile characteristics. The sites differ in mean annual temperature by 3.4 degrees C, but vegetation and soil types are similar. Organic soils (Oe + Oa) were incubated for 120 days at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C, with and without a replaced Oi subhorizon possessing a distinct delta C-13 signature. Laboratory warming induced significantly greater mineralization and leaching of humified SOM relative to replaced Oi, congruent with greater warming-induced increases in phenol oxidase activity relative to enzymes associated with labile C acquisition (percent increases of 101% versus 50%, respectively). These data suggest that warming can influence microbial communities and their enzymatic dynamics such that relative losses of humified SOM are disproportionately enhanced. This is consistent with stable isotopic, C:N, and radiocarbon profile differences between the two sites, which suggest a greater degree of microbial processing and greater relative losses of older SOC over the preceding decades at the warmer site, given our knowledge of organic inputs in these soils. This study is a first step toward linking the divergent timescales represented by soil profiles and laboratory manipulations, an important goal for biogeochemists assessing climate change impacts on SOM dynamics.

AB Modelling the spatial distributions of human parasite species is crucial to understanding the environmental determinants of infection as well as for guiding the planning of control programmes. Here, we use ecological niche modelling to map the current potential distribution of the macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis (LF), in Africa, and to estimate how future changes in climate and population could affect its spread and burden across the continent. We used 508 community-specific infection presence data collated from the published literature in conjunction with five predictive environmental/climatic and demographic variables, and a maximum entropy niche modelling method to construct the first ecological niche maps describing potential distribution and burden of LF in Africa. We also ran the best-fit model against climate projections made by the HADCM3 and CCCMA models for 2050 under A2a and B2a scenarios to simulate the likely distribution of LF under future climate and population changes. We predict a broad geographic distribution of LF in Africa extending from the west to the east across the middle region of the continent, with high probabilities of occurrence in the Western Africa compared to large areas of medium probability interspersed with smaller areas of high probability in Central and Eastern Africa and in Madagascar. We uncovered complex relationships between predictor ecological niche variables and the probability of LF occurrence. We show for the first time that predicted climate change and population growth will expand both the range and risk of LF infection (and ultimately disease) in an endemic region. We estimate that populations at risk to LF may range from 543 and 804 million currently, and that this could rise to between 1.65 to 1.86 billion in the future depending on the climate scenario used and thresholds applied to signify infection presence.

AB Studies of both vertebrates and invertebrates have suggested that specialists, as compared to generalists, are likely to suffer more serious declines in response to environmental change. Less is known about the effects of environmental conditions on specialist versus generalist parasites. Here, we study the evolutionary strategies of malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) among different bird host communities. We determined the parasite diversity and prevalence of avian malaria in three bird communities in the lowland forests in Cameroon, highland forests in East Africa and fynbos in South Africa. We calculated the host specificity index of parasites to examine the range of hosts parasitized as a function of the habitat and investigated the phylogenetic relationships of parasites. First, using phylogenetic and ancestral reconstruction analyses, we found an evolutionary tendency for generalist malaria parasites to become specialists. The transition rate at which generalists become specialists was nearly four times as great as the rate at which specialists become generalists. We also found more specialist parasites and greater parasite diversity in African lowland rainforests as compared to the more climatically variable habitats of the fynbos and the highland forests. Thus, with environmental changes, we anticipate a change in the distribution of both specialist and generalist parasites with potential impacts on bird communities.

AB We analyzed fishermen's local ecological knowledge (LEK) about the feeding habits, trophic interactions, habitats, fishing grounds, migration, and reproduction of nine coastal fishes in Buzios Island, southeastern Brazilian coast. We interviewed 39 fishermen using standardized questionnaires. Fishermen's LEK on habitat use and trophic interactions for the studied fishes agreed with the scientific literature, allowing the organization of reef and pelagic food webs. The interviewed fishermen mentioned that submerged rock formations would be important habitats for some large commercial fishes, such as Seriola spp., Caranx lams and Epinephelus marginatus. In some instances there was no scientific data to be compared with fishermen's LEK, and thus this kind of knowledge would be the only available source of information, such as for reproduction and migration of most of the studied fishes. We suggest herein ways to apply fishermen's LEK to develop and improve fisheries management measures, such as zoning of marine space, marine protected areas, and closed fishing seasons. Fishermen's LEK may be an important and feasible support to fisheries management and co-management.

AB Coral community shifts towards reefs dominated by stress-resistant corals have contributed to rapid declines in the architectural complexity of reefs throughout the Caribbean. Complex reef architecture provides important niches and refuges for many reef fishes and thus widespread declines in reef complexity could have important consequences for the structure and function of fish assemblages. We explore the influence of reef architecture on fish assemblages by comparing the size and trophic structure of reef fishes along a 20 km-long 15-reef gradient of coral cover, coral species dominance and architectural complexity in Cozumel, Mexico. Our results show that reefs with high architectural complexity, in particular those dominated by robust Montastraea corals, supported fish assemblages with larger numbers of individuals in the smallest size classes (<20 cm) and longer food chains (higher mean trophic levels). The association between coral complexity and fish communities is highly size-structured and is greatest for smallest size classes. The greater abundance of both small fish and the key early life stages of larger fishes on more complex reefs suggests that architectural complexity may influence entire reef fish assemblages, even though larger fish are less dependent on reef complexity. Key reef-building corals such as Montastraea are thus likely to be disproportionately important for maintaining reef fish communities, and shifts in Caribbean coral communities may compromise fish recruitment and truncate food chains, reducing resilience and inhibiting reef recovery from degradation.

AB Background: A long term research goal of venomics, of applied importance for improving current antivenom therapy, but also for drug discovery, is to understand the pharmacological potential of venoms. Individually or combined, proteomic and transcriptomic studies have demonstrated their feasibility to explore in depth the molecular diversity of venoms. In the absence of genome sequence, transcriptomes represent also valuable searchable databases for proteomic projects.
   Results: The venom gland transcriptomes of 8 Costa Rican taxa from 5 genera (Crotalus, Bothrops, Atropoides, Cerrophidion, and Bothriechis) of pitvipers were investigated using high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing. 100,394 out of 330,010 masked reads produced significant hits in the available databases. 5.165,220 nucleotides (8.27%) were masked by RepeatMasker, the vast majority of which corresponding to class I (retroelements) and class II (DNA transposons) mobile elements. BLAST hits included 79,991 matches to entries of the taxonomic suborder Serpentes, of which 62,433 displayed similarity to documented venom proteins. Strong discrepancies between the transcriptome-computed and the proteome-gathered toxin compositions were obvious at first sight. Although the reasons underlaying this discrepancy are elusive, since no clear trend within or between species is apparent, the data indicate that individual mRNA species may be translationally controlled in a species-dependent manner. The minimum number of genes from each toxin family transcribed into the venom gland transcriptome of each species was calculated from multiple alignments of reads matched to a full-length reference sequence of each toxin family. Reads encoding ORF regions of Kazal-type inhibitor-like proteins were uniquely found in Bothriechis schlegelii and B. lateralis transcriptomes, suggesting a genus-specific recruitment event during the early-Middle Miocene. A transcriptome-based cladogram supports the large divergence between A. mexicanus and A. picadoi, and a closer kinship between A. mexicanus and C. godmani.
   Conclusions: Our comparative next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis reveals taxon-specific trends governing the formulation of the venom arsenal. Knowledge of the venom proteome provides hints on the translation efficiency of toxin-coding transcripts, contributing thereby to a more accurate interpretation of the transcriptome. The application of NGS to the analysis of snake venom transcriptomes, may represent the tool for opening the door to systems venomics.

AB Recent declines in broadleaf-dominated, early-seral forest globally as a function of intensive forest management and/or fire suppression have raised concern about the viability of populations dependent on such forest types. However, quantitative information about the strength and direction of species associations with broadleaf cover at landscape scales are rare. Uncovering such habitat relationships is essential for understanding the demography of species and in developing sound conservation strategies. It is particularly important to detect points in habitat reduction where rates of population decline may accelerate or the likelihood of species occurrence drops rapidly (i.e., thresholds). Here, we use a large avian point-count data set (N = 4375) from southwestern and northwestern Oregon along with segmented logistic regression to test for thresholds in forest bird occurrence as a function of broadleaf forest and early-seral broadleaf forest at local (150-m radius) and landscape (500-2000-m radius) scales. All 12 bird species examined showed positive responses to either broadleaf forest in general, and/or early-seral broadleaf forest. However, regional variation in species response to these conditions was high. We found considerable evidence for landscape thresholds in bird species occurrence as a function of broadleaf cover; threshold models received substantially greater support than linear models for eight of 12 species. Landscape thresholds in broadleaf forest ranged broadly from 1.35% to 24.55% mean canopy cover. Early-seral broadleaf thresholds tended to be much lower (0.22-1.87%). We found a strong negative relationship between the strength of species association with early-seral broadleaf forest and 42-year bird population trends; species most associated with this forest type have declined at the greatest rates. Taken together, these results provide the first support for the hypothesis that reductions in broadleaf-dominated early-seral forest due to succession and intensive forest management have led to population declines of constituent species in the Pacific northwestern United States. Forest management treatments that maintain or restore even small amounts of broadleaf vegetation could mitigate further declines.

AB Global warming is one of the principal challenges facing insects worldwide. It affects individual species and interactions between species directly through effects on their physiology and indirectly through effects on their habitat. Aphids are particularly sensitive to temperature changes due to certain specific biological features of this group. Effects on individuals have repercussions for aphid diversity and population dynamics. At a pan-European scale, the EXAMINE observation network has provided evidence for an increase in the number of aphid species present over the last 30 years and for earlier spring flights. We review these results and provide a review of the principal effects of global warming on aphid communities. (C) 2010 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

   POTENTIAL IMPACT
AB The horticultural sector has seen much structural change both nationally and internationally over the last decades, but the implications for plant health have been neglected. We review in the context of the risk of emerging plant diseases recent developments including the movement towards a global horticultural market, the rise of the horticultural industry of many developing countries, and the economic integration of the European Union. North America is typically well ahead of other regions in economic developments, and in horticulture this is shown for example by the growing importance of Mexican growers. Asia is rapidly catching up also in horticulture, with China and India becoming key producers. Australia and New Zealand show the impact of change in horticulture extension services. The Eastern enlargement of the EU is having profound influences on fruit and vegetable growers both in the new and in the old member countries. Similar developments are taking place in South America and Africa. In all continents, there is a general trend towards fewer and larger horticultural growers, an increasing role of supermarkets and a concentration of the retail pathways. These developments have consequences for the control of plant pathogens and invasive species. Technical issues seem to be of lesser consequence in terms of structural change compared with labour and trade aspects. However, examples can be found where technical innovations have opened up new opportunities or provided solutions to pressing problems, as can be seen in the hardy nursery stock and ornamental industry in the UK. Future technical, economic and social impacts on the sector are likely to play a key role for securing a diverse and reliable food supply for the still expanding world's population. Recent advances in modelling disease spread in complex networks representing trade pathways should be used to target control of introductions of new plant pathogens. There is a need for more long-term research on how structural change in the horticultural sector will affect and be affected by climate change. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   RELATEDNESS; SIMILARITY; INFERENCE; MATES
AB Background: Inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity are expected to increase the extinction risk of small populations, but detailed tests in natural populations are scarce. We combine long-term population and fitness data with those from two types of molecular markers to examine the role of genetic effects in a declining metapopulation of southern dunlins Calidris alpina schinzii, an endangered shorebird.
   Results: The decline is associated with increased pairings between related individuals, including close inbreeding (as revealed by both field observations of parentage and molecular markers). Furthermore, reduced genetic diversity seems to affect individual fitness at several life stages. Higher genetic similarity between mates correlates negatively with the pair's hatching success. Moreover, offspring produced by related parents are more homozygous and suffer from increased mortality during embryonic development and possibly also after hatching.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate strong genetic effects in a rapidly declining population, emphasizing the importance of genetic factors for the persistence of small populations.

AB Pleistocene climate fluctuations have shaped the patterns of genetic diversity observed in extant species. In contrast to Europe and North America where the effects of recent glacial cycles on genetic diversity have been well studied, the genetic legacy of the Pleistocene for the Qinghai-Tibetan (Tibetan) plateau, a region where glaciation was not synchronous with the North Hemisphere ice sheet maxima, remains poorly understood. Here, we compared the phylogeographical patterns of five avian species on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau by three mitochondrial DNA fragments: the Tibetan snow finch (Montifringilla adamsi), the Blanford's snow finch (Pyrgilauda blanfordi), the horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), the twite (Carduelis flavirostris) and the black redstart (Phoenicurus ochruros). Our results revealed the three species mostly distributed on the platform region of the plateau that experienced population expansion following the retreat of the extensive glaciation period (0.5-0.175 Ma). These results are at odds with the results from avian species of Europe and North America, where population expansions occurred after Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 0.023-0.018 Ma). A single refugium was identified in a restricted semi-continuous area around the eastern margin of the plateau, instead of multiple independent refugia for European and North American species. For the other two species distributed on the edges of the plateau (the twite and black redstart), populations were maintained at stable levels. Edge areas are located on the eastern margin, which might have had little or no ice cover during the glaciation period. Thus, milder climate may have mitigated demographic stresses for edge species relative to the extremes experienced by platform counterparts, the present-day ranges of which were heavily ice covered during the glaciation period. Finally, various behavioural and ecological characteristics, including dispersal capacities, habitat preference and altitude specificity along with evolutionary history might have helped to shape different phylogeographical structures appearing in these five species.

AB A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to fishery-survey data to reveal the influences of environmental factors on the distribution patterns of Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus), sand lance (Ammodytes personatus), and krill (Euphausia pacifica). Echosounder and physical-oceanographic data were collected in Sendai Bay, Japan, in spring 2005. A hierarchical model was used with two spatial strata: (i) presence and absence of each species; and (ii) biomass density of each species, given its presence; and six environmental covariates (surface water temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll, and near-seabed water temperature, salinity, and depth). The results indicate non-linear responses of the two indices to the environmental covariates. In addition, the biomasses estimated by the GAMs were comparable with estimates based on conventional, stratified-random sampling for each species. GAMs are very useful for (i) investigating the effects of environmental factors on the distributions of biological organisms, and (ii) predicting the distributions of animal densities in unsurveyed areas.

AB The presence of estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) in sewage treatment work (STW) effluent pose a potential risk to aquatic ecosystem. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of vertical-flow wetland as polishing step of conventional wastewater treatment in the removal of estrogens and to examine the effect of sand depth. The highest removal efficiency of 67.8 +/- 28.0%, 84.0 +/- 15.4% and 75.3 +/- 17.6% for E1, E2 and EE2, respectively, was achieved by the shallowest wetland among three constructed wetlands with different filter layer depth (i.e. 7.5, 30 and 60 cm). Together with the result that the performance of wetlands when operating in unsaturated condition was superior to that when operating in water-saturated condition, it is suggested that maintaining sufficient aerobic circumstance in constructed wetlands was important for estrogens removal. Core sampling indicated that the highest efficiency achieved in extremely shallow wetland might be due partly to the highest root density, besides the superior condition for penetration of oxygen. The adsorbed estrogens in sand accounted for less than 12% of the removed estrogens irrespective of the depth, indicating biotic processes play a major role in the estrogens removal.

AB The northern Portuguese coast is a biogeographic transition zone where many macroalgal species have their distribution limits; it is thus a particularly interesting region for investigating species distribution shifts. An updated and complete list of species for this region is not available in spite of its baseline importance for comparative studies with past and present data. Based on new records, literature references, and herbarium data, we provide an updated checklist of the benthic marine algae of the northern Portuguese coast. This checklist includes 346 species: 26 Cyanobacteria, 200 Rhodophyta, 70 Ochrophyta, and 50 Chlorophyta. From these, 21 species are new records for the Portuguese coast (Lyngbya aestuarii, Lyngbya semiplena, Microcoleus acutirostris, Myxosarcina gloeocapsoides, Aiolocolax pulchella, Antithamnion densum, Antithamnion villosum, Antithamnionella spirographidis, Dasya sessilis, Furcellaria lumbricalis, Neosiphonia harveyi, Porphyrostromium boryanum, Chorda filum, Dictyopteris ambigua, Sphacelaria rigidula, Undaria pinnatifida, Vaucheria coronata, Vaucheria velutina, Ulothrix implexa, Ulva scandinavica, and Umbraulva olivascens) and 33 were recorded for the first time in the north of Portugal. Alien species have increased in number and extended their distribution range over the last 10 years in the study area. Distribution shifts of northern cold water species with southern distribution limit in the north of Portugal were not consistent among species.

AB Current theory expects that fungi, on the one hand, are spatially ubiquitous but, on the other, are more susceptible than bacteria to disturbance such as land use change due to dispersal limitations. This study examined the relative importance of location and land use effects in determining soil fungal community composition in south-eastern Australia. We use terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP; primer pair ITS1-F-ITS4) and multivariate statistical methods (NMDS ordinations, ANOSIM tests) to compare relative similarities of soil fungal communities from nine sites encompassing three locations (ca 50-200 km apart) and four land uses (native eucalypt forest, Pinus radiata plantation, Eucalyptus globulus plantation, and unimproved pasture). Location effects were generally weak (e.g. ANOSIM test statistic R <= 0.49) and were, in part, attributed to minor differences in soil texture. By contrast, we found clear and consistent evidence of land use effects on soil fungal community composition (R <= 0.95). That is, soils from sites of the same land use grouped together in NMDS ordinations of fungal composition despite geographic separations of up to ca 175 km (native eucalypt forests) and 215 km (P. radiata plantations). In addition, different land. uses from the same location were clearly separate in NMDS ordinations, despite, in one case, being just 180 m apart and having similar land use histories (i.e. P. radiata versus E. globulus plantation both established on pasture in the previous decade). Given negligible management of all sites beyond the early establishment phase, we attribute much of the land use effects to changes in dominant plant species based on consistent evidence elsewhere of strong specificity in pine and eucalypt mycorrhizal associations. In addition, weak to moderate correlations between soil fungal community composition and soil chemical variables (e.g. Spearman rank correlation coefficients for individual variables of 0.08-0.32), indicated a minor contributing role of vegetation-mediated changes in litter and soil chemistry. Our data provide evidence of considerable plasticity in soil fungal community composition over time spans as short as 6-11 years. This suggests that - at least within geographic zones characterised by more-or-less contiguous forest cover - soil fungal community composition depends most on availability of suitable habitat because dispersal propagules are readily available for colonisation after land use change.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Direct impacts of human land use and indirect impacts of anthropogenic climate change may alter land cover and associated ecosystem function, affecting ecological goods and services. Considerable work has been done to identify long-term global trends in vegetation greenness, which is associated with primary productivity, using remote sensing. Trend analysis of satellite observations is subject to error, and ecosystem change can be confused with interannual variability. However, the relative trends of land cover classes may hold clues about differential ecosystem response to environmental forcing. Our aim was to identify phenological variability and 10-year trends for the major land cover classes in the Great Basin. This case study involved two steps: a regional, phenology-based land cover classification and an identification of phenological variability and 10-year trends stratified by land cover class. The analysis used a 10-year time series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer satellite data to assess regional scale land cover variability and identify change. The phenology-based regional classification was more detailed and accurate than national or global products. Phenological variability over the 10-year period was high, with substantial shifts in timing of start of season of up to 9 weeks. The mean long-term trends of montane land cover classes were significantly different from valley land cover classes due to a poor response of montane shrubland and pinyon-juniper woodland to the early 1990s drought. The differential response during the 1990s suggests that valley ecosystems may be more resilient and montane ecosystems more susceptible to prolonged drought. This type of regional-scale land cover analysis is necessary to characterize current patterns of land cover phenology, distinguish between anthropogenically driven land cover change and interannual variability, and identify ecosystems potentially susceptible to regional and global change.

AB The circular, double-stranded 8-kb DNA genome of papillomaviruses (PVes) consists mainly of 4 large genes, E1, E2, L2, and L1. Approximately 150 papillomavirus genomes have been sequenced to date. We analyzed a representative sample of 53 PVes genomes using maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, maximum parsimony, and distance-based methods both on nucleotide (nt) and on amino acid (aa) alignments. When the 4 genes were analyzed separately, aa-inferred phylogenies contradicted each other less than nt-inferred trees (judged by partition homogeneity tests). In particular, gene combinations including the L2 gene generated significant incongruence (P < 0.001). Combined analyses of the remaining genes E1-E2-L1 produced a well-supported phylogeny including supertaxon beta + gamma + pi + xi-PVes (infecting Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Primates, and Rodentia) and supertaxon K + lambda + mu + nu + sigma-PVes (infecting Carnivora, Lagomorpha, Primates, and Rodentia). Based on the tree topology, host-linked evolution appears plausible at shallow, rather than deeper, taxonomic levels. Diversification within PVes may also involve adaptive radiation establishing different niches (within a single-host species) and recombination events (within single-host cells). Heterogeneous groups of closely related PVes infecting, for example, humans and domestic animals such as hamster, dog, and cattle suggest multiple infections across species borders. Additional evolutionary phenomena such as strong codon usage preferences, and computational biases including reconstruction artifacts and insufficient taxon sampling, may contribute to the incomplete resolution of deep phylogenetic nodes. The molecular data globally supports a complex evolutionary scenario for PVes, which is driven by multiple mechanisms but not exclusively by coevolution with corresponding hosts.

AB Knowledge of life-history traits is increasingly recognized as an important criterion for effective management and conservation. Understanding the link between physiology and life history is an important component of this knowledge and in our view is particularly relevant to understanding marine and freshwater fishes. Such linkages (i.e. the life-history/physiology nexus) have been recently advocated for avian systems and here we explore this concept for fish. This paper highlights the gap in fisheries literature with regard to understanding the relationship between physiology and life history, and proposes ways in which this integration could improve fisheries management and conservation. We use three case studies on different fishes (i.e. the Pacific salmon, the grouper complex and tuna) to explore these issues. The physiological structure and function of fish plays a central role in determining stock response to exploitation and changes in the environment. Physiological measures can provide simple indicators necessary for cost-effective monitoring in the evaluation of fisheries sustainability. The declining state of world fisheries and the need to develop and implement restoration strategies, such as hatchery production or protected areas, provides strong incentive to better understand the influence of physiology on population and reproductive dynamics and early life history. Physiology influences key population-level processes, particularly those dealing with reproduction, which must be incorporated into the design and successful implementation of specific and broadscale initiatives (e.g. aquatic protected areas and bycatch reduction). Suggestions are made for how to encourage wider application of the physiology/life-history link, in fisheries management and conservation, as well as more broadly in education and research.

AB The present study focuses on the sodium regulation mechanisms and the photosynthetic activity of the halophyte Cakile maritima, in response to 6 week-exposure to increasing salinity (0-500 mM NaCl). Relative growth rate (RGR) was transiently enhanced by the application of 100 mM NaCl and a further increase in salinity either had no effect or decreased RGR. Concomitant increase in shoot Na+ accumulation and leaf succulence in salt-treated plants suggested that this halophyte may use the inclusive strategy when dealing with salinity. This assumption was supported by the increase of the leaf vacuolar V H+-ATPase activity up to 300 mM NaCl and the absence of salt excretion structures at the leaf surface. Plasma membrane PM H+-ATPase activity was stimulated at the intense salinities, whereas that of mitochondrial/chloroplast F H+-ATPase declined progressively at supra-optimal salinites. Photosynthesis parameters (CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, sub-stomatal CO2 concentration, transpiration rate and Rubisco specific activity) were significantly increased at the optimal salinity (100 mM NaCl), as compared to the control. Higher salt levels impaired photosynthetic capacity of C. maritima mainly via a stomatal limitation, as stomatal conductance was the most reduced factor. Irrespective of salt treatment, PEPC specific activity was lower than that of Rubisco. Both nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) were significantly high at 100 MM NaCl. Further increase in salinity led to a substantial reduction of PNUE, which might have been mainly due to salt-induced leaf succulence. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon dioxide has been rapidly accumulating in the atmosphere and is expected to continue to do so. This accumulation is presumed to have important direct effects on plant growth. The interacting affects of a small increase in CO2 concentration (466 p.p.m., approximately 30% increase from current ambient conditions), nitrogen fertilization and fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium lolii) infection on the growth and chemical composition of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were investigated. It was found that dry mass production was approximately 50% greater under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2, but only in conditions of high soil N. High molecular weight carbohydrates and total carbohydrates (LMW + HMW CHO) depended on an interaction between CO2 and endophyte infection. Infected plants contained significantly more carbohydrate than endophyte-free plants, and the difference was greatest in ambient CO2 conditions. Protein concentrations were also influenced by the interaction between CO2 and endophyte-infection. Endophyte-free plants had 40% lower concentrations of soluble protein under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2, but this CO2 effect on soluble protein was largely absent in endophyte-infected plants. CO2, endophyte-infection and nitrogen interacted to influence the total chlorophyll concentration of the grass such that chlorophyll concentration was always lower in elevated CO2 but this decline was much greater in endophyte-free plants, particularly in conditions of high soil N. In the endophyte-infected plants, the concentrations of the pyrrolopyrazine alkaloid peramine depended on the interaction between CO2 and N fertilization such that peramine concentrations declined with increasing N at ambient CO2 but remained roughly constant across N levels at elevated CO2. A similar pattern was seen for the ergot alkaloid ergovaline. The biochemical responses of perennial ryegrass to elevated CO2 are clearly modified by the presence of endophytic fungi.

AB Feature selection is a valuable technique in data analysis for information-preserving data reduction. This paper describes Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Multivariate Regression Trees (MRT)-based approaches for both supervised and unsupervised feature selection. The well-known CART method allows to perform supervised feature selection by modeling one response variable (y) by some explanatory variables (x). The recently proposed CART extension, MRT can handle more than one response variable (y). This allows to perform a supervised feature selection in the presence of more than one response variable. For unsupervised feature selection, where no response variables are available, we propose Auto-Associative Multivariate Regression Trees (AAMRT) where the original variables (x) are not only used as explanatory variables (x), but also as response variables (y=x). Since (AA)MRT is grouping the objects into groups with similar response values by using explanatory variables, this means that the variables are found which are most responsible for the cluster structure in the data. We will demonstrate how these approaches can improve (the detection of) the cluster structure in data and bow they can be used for knowledge discovery. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Plant species and genotypes within the same species may differ in phosphorus efficiency. The objective of this research was to study phosphorus efficiency of cabbage (Brassica oleraceae L.), carrot (Daucus carota L.), and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and to quantify the contribution of morphological root characteristics to P uptake of the plant species. An experiment was conducted in a glasshouse with six P levels: 0, 12, 27, 73, 124 and 234 mg P kg(-1) soil, and with six replications. Cabbage attained 80% of its maximum yield already at the level of no P supply, whereas carrot and potato reached only 4 and 16% of their highest yields respectively at this level of P supply. This indicated that cabbage was P-efficient compared to carrot and potato. Root/shoot ratio (cm root g(-1) shoot d. m.) increased in the order of cabbage < carrot < potato, and was enhanced at lower P levels. Root hair length was not affected by P level, and averaged 0.22, 0.03 and 0.18 mm for cabbage, carrot, and potato, respectively. Predicting P uptake by a mechanistic simulation model revealed that root hairs contributed about 50% to the total P uptake of cabbage and potato, but only 0.3% to that of carrot. The relationship between the observed P uptake and the predicted P uptake of the plants revealed that model parameters explained nearly 4/5th of the total P uptake of carrot and potato, but only 2/5th of that of cabbage. This showed that the P uptake of cabbage was strongly under-predicted, whereas that of carrot and potato was predicted well. Therefore, it was hypothesised that cabbage may have the ability to mobilise and take up soil P additionally by other root mechanisms such as exudation of organic acids.

AB In a hypersaline mangrove scrub forest in northern Florida, coexisting trees of Laguncularia racemosa and Avicennia germinans were either fertilized with nitrogen or phosphorus, or not fertilized (controls). We aimed to test whether nutrient additions differentially altered photosynthetic performance and resource utilization in these two species. In control trees, photosynthetic rates were higher in L. racemosa than A. germinans. However, leaf nitrogen concentrations were higher in A. germinans than L. racemosa. Avicennia germinans responded to fertilization with nitrogen by increasing leaf nitrogen concentrations and rates of photosynthesis such that they were equivalent to photosynthesis in L. racemosa. Laguncularia racemosa did not show a response to nitrogen additions. Neither species showed strong responses to phosphorus fertilization. Avicennia germinans had high photosynthetic water-use efficiency (photosynthesis/transpiration), but low photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (photosynthesis/leaf nitrogen). In contrast, L. racemosa had comparatively low photosynthetic water use efficiency and high photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. Leaf level characteristics lead us to hypothesize that coexistence of A. germinans and L. racemosa should occur where nitrogen levels are low and salinity is moderate, or at least moderate for some period of the year.

AB 1 Alliaria petiolata, a European biennial herb, is an important pest in temperate North American deciduous forests. Habitat resource structure has probably been important for invasion and proliferation of this species.
   2 Alliaria was grown in an experimental garden at two densities (equivalent to 17 and 170 plants m(-2)), three nutrient levels (no, low, or high nutrient addition) and three light levels (ambient sunlight and two shading treatments) to determine the effects of environmental heterogeneity on growth, reproduction and resource allocation in both mature and rosette plants.
   3 Overall, rosette growth and allocation patterns were significantly affected by all three variables tested. Low plant density, nutrient addition and high light availability resulted in plants with more leaves and greater dry weight biomass. Biomass allocation to shoots was greatest for plants in high-density and low-light treatments. Leaf chlorophyll content was significantly greater for plants in the two shaded treatments.
   4 Mature plants also responded to environmental manipulation with significantly greater total dry weight biomass at low plant density, high light availability and with nutrient addition. Low density and high light availability resulted in significantly higher seed production. Plants in the lowest light treatment allocated significantly more biomass to shoot production and less to root production. Leaf chlorophyll content was lowest for plants in the highest light treatment and increased with nutrient addition at the two highest light treatments.
   5 Plants growing at high density responded to nutrient addition and light attenuation in the same direction but with greatly reduced magnitude compared with plants growing at low density. The effect of irradiance was the most important determinant of all facets of growth and allocation patterns in both rosettes and mature plants.
   6 Our results indicate that although density and site fertility may play important roles in Alliaria invasion and establishment, light availability may be the most important factor affecting subsequent growth and proliferation.

AB Several eukaryotic homologs of the Escherichia coli RecQ DNA helicase have been found, These include the human BLM gene, whose mutation results in Bloom syndrome, and the human WRN gene, whose mutation leads to Werner syndrome resembling premature aging. We cloned a Drosophila melanogaster homolog of die RECQ helicase family, Dmblm (Drosophila melanogaster Bloom), which encodes a putative 1487-amino-acid protein. Phylogenetic and dot plot analyses for the RECQ family, including 10 eukaryotic and 3 prokaryotic genes, indicate Dmblm is most closely related to the Homo sapiens BLM gene, suggesting functional similarity. Also, we found that Dmblm cDNA partially rescued the sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate of Saccharomyces cerevisiae sgs1 mutant, demonstrating the presence of a functional similarity between Dmblm and SGS1. Our analyses identify four possible subfamilies in the RECQ family: (1) the BLM I subgroup (H. sapiens Bloom, D. melanogaster Dmblm, and Caenorhabditis, elegans T04X11.6); (2) the yeast RECQ subgroup (S. cerevisiae SGS1 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe rqh1/rad12); (3) the RECQL/Q1 subgroup (II. sapiens RECQL/Q1 and C, elegans K02F3.1); and (4) the WRN subgroup (II. sapiens Werner and C. elegans F18C5.2). This result may indicate that metazoans hold at least three RECQ genes, each of which may have a different function, and that multiple RECQ genes diverged with the generation of multicellular organisms. We propose that invertebrates such as nematodes and insects are useful as model systems of human generic diseases.

AB The influence of rhizosphere microorganisms and vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhiza on manganese (Mn) uptake in maize (Zen mays L. cv. Tau) plants was studied in pot experiments under controlled environmental conditions. The plants were grown for 7 weeks in sterilized calcareous soil in pots having separate compartments for growth of roots and of VA mycorrhizal fungal hyphae. The soil was left either uninoculated (control) or prior to planting was inoculated with rhizosphere microorganisms only (MO-VA) or with rhizosphere microorganisms together with a VA mycorrhizal fungus [Glomus mosseae (Nicol and Gerd.) Gerdemann and Trappe] (MO+VA). Mycorrhiza treatment did not affect shoot dry weight, but root dry weight was slightly inhibited in the MO + VA and MO-VA treatments compared with the uninoculated control. Concentrations of Mn in shoots decreased in the order MO-VA>MO+VA>control. In the rhizosphere soil, the total microbial population was higher in mycorrhizal (MO+VA) than nonmycorrhizal (MO-VA) treatments, but the proportion of Mn-reducing microbial populations was fivefold higher in the nonmycorrhizal treatment, suggesting substantial qualitative changes in rhizosphere microbial populations upon root infection with the mycorrhizal fungi. The most important microbial group taking part in the reduction of Mn was fluorescent Pseudomonas. Mycorrhizal treatment decreased not only the number of Mn reducers but also the release of Mn-solubilizing root exudates, which were collected by percolation from maize plants cultivated in plastic tubes filled with gravel quartz sand. Compared with mycorrhizal plants, the root exudates of nonmycorrhizal plants had two fold higher capacity for reduction of Mn. Therefore, changes in both rhizosphere microbial population and root exudation are probably responsible for the lower acquisition of Mn in mycorrhizal plants.

AB Seedlings of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) were grown under varying conditions of soil nitrogen and atmospheric carbon dioxide availability to investigate the interactive effects of these resources on the energetic requirements for leaf growth. Increasing the ambient CO2 partial pressure from 35 to 65 Pa increased seedling growth only when soil nitrogen was high. Biomass increased by 55% and photosynthesis increased by 13% after 100 days of CO2 enrichment. Leaves from seedlings grown in high soil nitrogen were 7.0% more expensive on a g glucose g-1 dry mass basis to produce than those grown in low nitrogen, while elevated CO2 decreased leaf cost by 3.5%. Nitrogen and CO2 availability had an interactive effect on leaf construction cost expressed on an area basis, reflecting source-sink interactions. When both resources were abundant, leaf construction cost on an area basis was relatively high (81.8 +/- 3.0 g glucose m-2) compared to leaves from high nitrogen, low CO2 seedlings (56.3 +/- 3.0 g glucose m-2) and low nitrogen, low CO2 seedlings (67.1 +/- 2.7 g glucose m-2). Leaf construction cost appears to respond to alterations in the utilization of photoassimilates mediated by resource availability.

TI On optimal defence in plants
SO FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Herbivory defence; optimality; stress; theory; mathematical analysis
AB The optimal defence theory assumes that there is a cost associated with the production of defences against herbivores in plants and that plants evolve and allocate defences to maximize individual inclusive fitness. We analyse how a plant should allocate its resources between biomass production and production of defences in order to maximize net growth.
   In general it is optimal for a plant to have a defence, the intensity of which increases with grazing pressure. However, there is a threshold grazing intensity below which it is optimal not to have a defence. In addition, there is one threshold above which it is necessary (i.e. not only optimal) to have a defence and one defining the highest sustainable grazing level. A plant subjected to an increased level of stress should give priority to, rather than sacrifice, defence.
   On an evolutionary time scale the efficiency of a defence system seems to be important in a qualitative way. Only if the efficiency is initially above a certain critical value do we expect the defence system to evolve into a more efficient one. Therefore, different taxa, despite being subjected to similar selection pressures, might evolve in opposite directions depending on the initial conditions.

   GLOBAL TRADE; LIVE; ESTABLISHMENT; PATHWAYS; REPTILES; WATER
AB The annual trade in exotic vertebrates as pets is a multi-billion-dollar global business. Thousands of species, and tens of millions of individual animals, are shipped both internationally and within countries to satisfy this demand. Most research on the exotic pet trade has focused on its contribution to native biodiversity loss and disease spread. Here, we synthesize information across taxa and research disciplines to document the exotic pet trade's contribution to vertebrate biological invasions. We show recent and substantial worldwide growth in the number of non-native animal populations introduced via this invasion pathway, which demonstrates a strong potential to increase the number of invasive animals in the future. Key to addressing the invasion threat of exotic pets is learning more about the socioeconomic forces that drive the massive growth in the exotic pet market and the socioecological factors that underlie pet release by owners. These factors likely vary according to cultural pet-keeping traditions across regions and whether purchases were legal or illegal. These gaps in our understanding of the exotic pet trade must be addressed in order to implement effective policy solutions.

AB Studies on tree communities have demonstrated that species diversity can enhance forest productivity, but the driving mechanisms at the local neighbourhood level remain poorly understood. Here, we use data from a large-scale biodiversity experiment with 24 subtropical tree species to show that neighbourhood tree species richness generally promotes individual tree productivity. We found that the underlying mechanisms depend on a focal tree's functional traits: For species with a conservative resource-use strategy diversity effects were brought about by facilitation, and for species with acquisitive traits by competitive reduction. Moreover, positive diversity effects were strongest under low competition intensity (quantified as the total basal area of neighbours) for acquisitive species, and under high competition intensity for conservative species. Our findings demonstrate that net biodiversity effects in tree communities can vary over small spatial scales, emphasising the need to consider variation in local neighbourhood interactions to better understand effects at the community level.

AB Soil ecosystems worldwide are subjected to marked modifications caused by anthropogenic disturbances and global climate change, resulting in microbial diversity loss and alteration of ecosystem functions. Despite the paucity of studies, restoration ecology provides an appropriate framework for testing the potential of manipulating soil microbial communities for the recovery of ecosystem functioning. We used a reciprocal transplant design in experimentally altered microbial communities to investigate the effectiveness of introducing microbial communities in degraded soil ecosystems to restore N-cycle functioning. Microbial diversity loss resulted in alternative compositional states associated with impaired N-cycle functioning. Here, the addition of complex microbial communities to these altered communities revealed a pivotal role of deterministic community assembly processes. The diversity of some alternative compositional states was successfully increased but without significant restoration of soil N-cycle functioning. However, in the most degraded alternative state, the introduction of new microbial communities caused an overall decrease in phylogenetic diversity and richness. The successful soil colonization by newly introduced species for some compositional states indicates that priority effects could be overridden when attempting to manipulate microbial communities for soil restoration. Altogether, our result showed consistent patterns within restoration treatments with minor idiosyncratic effects. This suggests the predominance of deterministic processes and the predictability of restoration trajectories, which could be used to guide the effective management of microbial community assemblages for ecological restoration of soils.

AB The uncertainty of future climate change is placing pressure on cropping systems to continue to provide stable increases in productive yields. To mitigate future climates and the increasing threats against global food security, new solutions to manipulate photosynthesis are required. This review explores the current efforts available to improve carbon assimilation within plant chloroplasts by engineering Rubisco, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of CO2 fixation. Fixation of CO2 and subsequent cycling of 3-phosphoglycerate through the Calvin cycle provides the necessary carbohydrate building blocks for maintaining plant growth and yield, but has to compete with Rubisco oxygenation, which results in photorespiration that is energetically wasteful for plants. Engineering improvements in Rubisco is a complex challenge and requires an understanding of chloroplast gene regulatory pathways, and the intricate nature of Rubisco catalysis and biogenesis, to transplant more efficient forms of Rubisco into crops. In recent times, major advances in Rubisco engineering have been achieved through improvement of our knowledge of Rubisco synthesis and assembly, and identifying amino acid catalytic switches in the L-subunit responsible for improvements in catalysis. Improving the capacity of CO2 fixation in crops such as rice will require further advances in chloroplast bioengineering and Rubisco biogenesis.

AB Natural resource accounting plays a critical role in sustainable utilization and conservation of natural resources. This paper aims to review research progress on natural resource accounting for the period of 1995-2014. The main research methods for this study include bibliometric analysis and social network analysis, covering publications' performances, characteristics of related journals, countries, institutions, authors and keywords. The results show that the total amount of publications on natural resource accounting has increased rapidly since 2001. The most productive journal, country, institution, and author are Journal of Environmental Management, USA, University of California, and Dr. Chen, respectively. All of them have higher academic influence. Meanwhile, natural resources that attract most attentions are water and energy. The six main research methods in this field include mathematic modeling, emergy, exergy, ecological footprint (EF), life cycle assessment (LCA) and material flow analysis (MFA).Reasons for the prominent performance of key countries and institutions are then discussed and uncovered, as well as for six methods. Finally, suggestions on how to further promote the development of this research field are raised. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The environment ontology in 2016: bridging domains with increased scope,

AB Background: The Environment Ontology (ENVO; http://www.environmentontology.org/), first described in 2013, is a resource and research target for the semantically controlled description of environmental entities. The ontology's initial aim was the representation of the biomes, environmental features, and environmental materials pertinent to genomic and microbiome-related investigations. However, the need for environmental semantics is common to a multitude of fields, and ENVO's use has steadily grown since its initial description. We have thus expanded, enhanced, and generalised the ontology to support its increasingly diverse applications.
   Methods: We have updated our development suite to promote expressivity, consistency, and speed: we now develop ENVO in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and employ templating methods to accelerate class creation. We have also taken steps to better align ENVO with the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry principles and interoperate with existing OBO ontologies. Further, we applied text-mining approaches to extract habitat information from the Encyclopedia of Life and automatically create experimental habitat classes within ENVO.
   Results: Relative to its state in 2013, ENVO's content, scope, and implementation have been enhanced and much of its existing content revised for improved semantic representation. ENVO now offers representations of habitats, environmental processes, anthropogenic environments, and entities relevant to environmental health initiatives and the global Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030. Several branches of ENVO have been used to incubate and seed new ontologies in previously unrepresented domains such as food and agronomy. The current release version of the ontology, in OWL format, is available at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/envo.owl.
   Conclusions: ENVO has been shaped into an ontology which bridges multiple domains including biomedicine, natural and anthropogenic ecology, 'omics, and socioeconomic development. Through continued interactions with our users and partners, particularly those performing data archiving and sythesis, we anticipate that ENVO's growth will accelerate in 2017. As always, we invite further contributions and collaboration to advance the semantic representation of the environment, ranging from geographic features and environmental materials, across habitats and ecosystems, to everyday objects in household settings.

AB Wildland fire is an important disturbance agent in the western US and globally. However, the natural role of fire has been disrupted in many regions due to the influence of human activities, which have the potential to either exclude or promote fire, resulting in a "fire deficit'' or "fire surplus'', respectively. In this study, we developed a model of expected area burned for the western US as a function of climate from 1984 to 2012. We then quantified departures from expected area burned to identify geographic regions with fire deficit or surplus. We developed our model of area burned as a function of several climatic variables from reference areas with low human influence; the relationship between climate and fire is strong in these areas. We then quantified the degree of fire deficit or surplus for all areas of the western US as the difference between expected (as predicted with the model) and observed area burned from 1984 to 2012. Results indicate that many forested areas in the western US experienced a fire deficit from 1984 to 2012, likely due to fire exclusion by human activities. We also found that large expanses of non-forested regions experienced a fire surplus, presumably due to introduced annual grasses and the prevalence of anthropogenic ignitions. The heterogeneity in patterns of fire deficit and surplus among ecoregions emphasizes fundamentally different ecosystem sensitivities to human influences and suggests that large-scale adaptation and mitigation strategies will be necessary in order to restore and maintain resilient, healthy, and naturally functioning ecosystems.

AB Rising atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) and attendant increases in growing season temperature are expected to be the most important global change factors impacting production agriculture. Although maize is the most highly produced crop worldwide, few studies have evaluated the interactive effects of elevated [CO2] and temperature on its photosynthetic physiology, agronomic traits or biomass, and seed yield under open field conditions. This study investigates the effects of rising [CO2] and warmer temperature, independently and in combination, on maize grown in the field throughout a full growing season. Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology was used to target atmospheric [CO2] to 200 mu mol mol similar to 1 above ambient [CO2] and infrared heaters to target a plant canopy increase of 3.5 degrees C, with actual season mean heating of similar to 2.7 degrees C, mimicking conditions predicted by the second half of this century. Photosynthetic gas-exchange parameters, leaf nitrogen and carbon content, leaf water potential components, and developmental measurements were collected throughout the season, and biomass and yield were measured at the end of the growing season. As predicted for a C-4 plant, elevated [CO2] did not stimulate photosynthesis, biomass, or yield. Canopy warming caused a large shift in aboveground allocation by stimulating season-long vegetative biomass and decreasing reproductive biomass accumulation at both CO2 concentrations, resulting in decreased harvest index. Warming caused a reduction in photosynthesis due to down-regulation of photosynthetic biochemical parameters and the decrease in the electron transport rate. The reduction in seed yield with warming was driven by reduced photosynthetic capacity and by a shift in aboveground carbon allocation away from reproduction. This field study portends that future warming will reduce yield in maize, and this will not be mitigated by higher atmospheric [CO2] unless appropriate adaptation traits can be introduced into future cultivars.

AB Overfishing and human-induced climate change are putting severe pressure on marine ecosystems. In the southern Benguela, most of South Africa's commercial fisheries have a long history of exploitation and this, coupled with spatio-temporal changes in key species over the last three decades has severely impacted some of South Africa's fisheries and ecosystems. This review summarizes these spatio-temporal changes and investigates possible drivers thereof. It incorporates both past and current research, with a large portion of the latter having formed part of the University of Cape Town's Ma-Re BASICS (Marine Research in the Benguela and Agulhas Systems for supporting Interdisciplinary Climate-change Science) 2010-2013 program. Almost all described changes involve a temporal decline or a spatial shift in species. Fishing seems to have played a role in many of the observed stock declines, for example through geographically disproportionate catches in relation to stock distribution. In some cases, changes in the physical environment seem to have played an additional role, e.g., rock lobsters on the west coast have been affected by fishing as well as changes in the physical environment. In almost all cases these changes have taken place since the 1980s/1990s, except for one or two resources, which have experienced declines since at least the mid 20th century. Spatial shifts in species have either involved an eastward expansion of cool-water species, including kelps, rock lobster and pelagic fish, or a retraction of warm-water species such as the brown mussel, suggesting a cooling of inshore waters along the south-west coast since the 1980s. This suggested cooling is revealed in ocean temperature (SST Pathfinder), wind and upwelling data for the Cape Peninsula and south-west coast region during the same period. The absence or inconsistency of long-term data is problematic when trying to identify drivers of ecosystem change, and actual ecosystem change itself. We discuss this using ocean temperature in the southern Benguela as an example. In addition, the complex interplay between climate and anthropogenic (notably fishing) drivers makes identification of drivers difficult and disentangling these combined effects will require interdisciplinary collaboration, co-ordinated ecosystem projects, increased modelling effort and the continuation, but also establishment, of new, long-term monitoring studies.

TI Contemporary white-band disease in Caribbean corals driven by climate
   change
SO NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID ACROPORA-PALMATA
AB Over the past 40 years, two of the dominant reef-building corals in the Caribbean, Acropora palmata and Acropora cervicornis, have experienced unprecedented declines(1,2). That loss has been largely attributed to a syndrome commonly referred to as white-band disease(1,3). Climate change-driven increases in sea surface temperature (SST) have been linked to several coral diseases(4,5), yet, despite decades of research, the attribution of white-band disease to climate change remains unknown. Here we hindcasted the potential relationship between recent ocean warming and outbreaks of white-band disease on acroporid corals. We quantified eight SST metrics, including rates of change in SST and contemporary thermal anomalies, and compared them with records of white-band disease on A. palmata and A. cervicornis from 473 sites across the Caribbean, surveyed from 1997 to 2004. The results of our models suggest that decades-long climate-driven changes in SST, increases in thermal minima, and the breach of thermal maxima have all played significant roles in the spread of white-band disease. We conclude that white-band disease has been strongly coupled with thermal stresses associated with climate change, which has contributed to the regional decline of these once-dominant reef-building corals.

AB It is well established that agricultural practices alter the composition and diversity of soil microbial communities. However, the impact of changing soil microbial communities on the functioning of the agroecosystems is still poorly understood. Earlier work showed that soil tillage drastically altered microbial community composition. Here we tested, using an experimental grassland (Lolium, Trifolium, Plantago) as a model system, whether soil microbial communities from conventionally tilled (CT) and non-tilled (NT) soils have different influences on plant productivity and nutrient acquisition. We specifically focus on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), as they are a group of beneficial soil fungi that can promote plant productivity and ecosystem functioning and are also strongly affected by tillage management.
   Soil microbial communities from CT and NT soils varied greatly in their effects on the grassland communities. Communities from CT soil increased overall biomass production more than soil communities from NT soil. This effect was mainly due to a significant growth promotion of Trifolium by CT microorganisms. In contrast to CT soil inoculum, NT soil inoculum increased plant phosphorus concentration and total plant P content, demonstrating that the soil microbial communities from NT fields enhance P uptake. Differences in AM fungal community composition resulting, for instance, in twofold greater hyphal length in NT soil communities when compared to CT, are the most likely explanation for the different plant responses to CT and NT soil inocula.
   A range of field studies have shown that plant P uptake increases when farmers change to conservation tillage or direct seeding. Our results indicate that this enhanced P uptake results from enhanced hyphal length and an altered AM fungal community. Our results further demonstrate that agricultural management practices indirectly influence ecosystem services and plant community structure through effects on soil biota.

AB Decision support systems help physicians and also play an important role in medical decision-making. They are based on different models, and the best of them are providing an explanation together with an accurate, reliable and quick response. This paper presents a decision support tool for the detection of breast cancer based on three types of decision tree classifiers. They are single decision tree (SDT), boosted decision tree (BDT) and decision tree forest (DTF). Decision tree classification provides a rapid and effective method of categorizing data sets. Decision-making is performed in two stages: training the classifiers with features from Wisconsin breast cancer data set, and then testing. The performance of the proposed structure is evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results showed that the overall accuracies of SDT and BDT in the training phase achieved 97.07 % with 429 correct classifications and 98.83 % with 437 correct classifications, respectively. BDT performed better than SDT for all performance indices than SDT. Value of ROC and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for BDT in the training phase achieved 0.99971 and 0.9746, respectively, which was superior to SDT classifier. During validation phase, DTF achieved 97.51 %, which was superior to SDT (95.75 %) and BDT (97.07 %) classifiers. Value of ROC and MCC for DTF achieved 0.99382 and 0.9462, respectively. BDT showed the best performance in terms of sensitivity, and SDT was the best only considering speed.

AB Various attempts have been made to amalgamate the concepts of intrinsic value and ecosystem services, often with a stop-over at the economic concept of existence value. These attempts are based on a confusion of concepts, however. In this article, two types of non-use values are distinguished: warm glow value, related to the satisfaction people may derive from altruism towards nature, and existence value, related to the satisfaction people may derive from the mere knowledge that nature exists and originating in the human need for self-transcendence. As benefits to humans, warm glow and existence values can be considered ecosystem services. Neither warm glow value nor existence value represents benefits to nature itself, however. Intrinsic value lies outside the scope of the wide palette of ecosystem services.
   Although the concept of ecosystem services does not cover benefits to nature and the intrinsic value of such benefits, intrinsic value is not necessarily incompatible with economic valuation. Although a deontological ethics does not allow economic valuation of nature as an end in itself, consequentialism does. In consequentialism, however, intrinsic value is not attributed to nature itself, but to benefits to nature. These benefits can be economically valued on the basis of benefit transfer.

AB We performed population genetic analyses on the American eel (Anguilla rostrata) with three main objectives. First, we conducted the most comprehensive analysis of neutral genetic population structure to date to revisit the null hypothesis of panmixia in this species. Second, we used this data to provide the first estimates of contemporary effective population size (Ne) and to document temporal variation in effective number of breeders (Nb) in American eel. Third, we tested for statistical associations between temporal variation in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the effective number of breeders and two indices of recruit abundance. A total of 2142 eels from 32 sampling locations were genotyped with 18 microsatellite loci. All measures of differentiation were essentially zero, and no evidence for significant spatial or temporal genetic differentiation was found. The panmixia hypothesis should thus be accepted for this species. Nb estimates varied by a factor of 23 among 12 cohorts, from 473 to 10999. The effective population size Ne was estimated at 10532 (95% CI, 931211752). This study also showed that genetically based demographic indices, namely Nb and allelic richness (Ar), can be used as surrogates for the abundance of breeders and recruits, which were both shown to be positively influenced by variation during high (positive) NAO phases. Thus, long-term genetic monitoring of American glass eels at several sites along the North American Atlantic coast would represent a powerful and efficient complement to census monitoring to track demographic fluctuations and better understand their causes.

AB Although grassland and savanna occupy only a quarter of the world's vegetation, burning in these ecosystems accounts for roughly half the global carbon emissions from fire. However, the processes that govern changes in grassland burning are poorly understood, particularly on time scales beyond satellite records. We analyzed microcharcoal, sediments, and geochemistry in a high-resolution marine sediment core off Namibia to identify the processes that have controlled biomass burning in southern African grassland ecosystems under large, multimillennial-scale climate changes. Six fire cycles occurred during the past 170,000 y in southern Africa that correspond both in timing and magnitude to the precessional forcing of north-south shifts in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Contrary to the conventional expectation that fire increases with higher temperatures and increased drought, we found that wetter and cooler climates cause increased burning in the study region, owing to a shift in rainfall amount and seasonality (and thus vegetation flammability). We also show that charcoal morphology (i.e., the particle's length-to-width ratio) can be used to reconstruct changes in fire activity as well as biome shifts over time. Our results provide essential context for understanding current and future grassland-fire dynamics and their associated carbon emissions.

ID CLASSIFICATION; VALUATION; GOODS
AB Analyses used to value ecosystem services often confuse final ecosystem services with ecological functions that provide indirect benefit. Typologies of ecosystem services, such as that developed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, do not ameliorate these challenges. Among the causes of ambiguity in classifying values associated with intermediate versus final ecosystem services are (1) the lack of simple, broadly applicable guidelines to assist natural and social scientists in deriving consistent and replicable classifications, and (2) attempts to define universal typologies of final services that apply to all beneficiaries. This paper presents an operational mechanism for determining whether a biophysical feature, quantity, or quality represents a final ecosystem service for an inclusive suite of beneficiaries. It is designed for straightforward application by those without expertise in natural or social sciences, and can be used within existing typologies. Illustrations of the structure demonstrate how the resulting classifications avert double counting and other ambiguities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the last years a new tool has become widely used in ecological studies: species distribution models. These models analyze the spatial patterns of presence of organisms objectively, by means of statistical and cartographic procedures based on real data. They infer the presence of potentially suitable areas according to their environmental characteristics. Data stored in natural history collections can be used for this purpose, which gives new opportunities to use to these types of data. The models have evolved from the analysis of single species to the study of hundreds or thousands of taxa which are combined for the assessment of biodiversity and species richness. In this paper we review the variety of methods used, their potential and weaknesses, and the limiting factors that influence the interpretation of species distribution models.

AB Females should prefer to be fertilized by males that increase the genetic quality of their offspring. In vertebrates, genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a key role in the acquired immune response and have been shown to affect mating preferences. They are therefore important candidates for the link between mate choice and indirect genetic benefits. Higher MHC diversity may be advantageous because this allows a wider range of pathogens to be detected and combated. Furthermore, individuals harbouring rare MHC alleles might better resist pathogen variants that have evolved to evade common MHC alleles. In the Seychelles warbler, females paired with low MHC-diversity males elevate the MHC diversity of their offspring to levels comparable to the population mean by gaining extra-pair fertilizations. Here, we investigate whether increased MHC diversity results in higher life expectancy and whether there are any additional benefits of extra-pair fertilizations. Our 10-year study found a positive association between MHC diversity and juvenile survival, but no additional survival advantage of extra-pair fertilizations. In addition, offspring with a specific allele (Ase-ua4) had a fivefold longer life expectancy than offspring without this allele. Consequently, the interacting effects of sexual selection and pathogen-mediated viability selection appear to be important for maintaining MHC variation in the Seychelles warbler. Our study supports the prediction that MHC-dependent extra-pair fertilizations result in genetic benefits for offspring in natural populations. However, such genetic benefits might be hidden and not necessarily apparent in the widely used fitness comparison of extra- and within-pair offspring.

AB An extensive statistical 'downscaling' study is done to relate large-scale climate information from a general circulation model (GCM) to local-scale river flows in SW France for 51 gauging stations ranging from nival (snow-dominated) to pluvial (rainfall-dominated) river-systems. This study helps to select the appropriate statistical method at a given spatial and temporal scale to downscale hydrology for future climate change impact assessment of hydrological resources. The four proposed statistical downscaling models use large-scale predictors (derived from climate model outputs or reanalysis data) that characterize precipitation and evaporation processes in the hydrological cycle to estimate summary flow statistics. The four statistical models used are generalized linear (GLM) and additive (GAM) models, aggregated boosted trees (ABT) and multi-layer perceptron neural networks (ANN). These four models were each applied at two different spatial scales, namely at that of a single flow-gauging station (local downscaling) and that of a group of flow-gauging stations having the same hydrological behaviour (regional downscaling). For each statistical model and each spatial resolution, three temporal resolutions were considered, namely the daily mean flows, the summary statistics of fortnightly flows and a daily 'integrated approach'. The results show that flow sensitivity to atmospheric factors is significantly different between nival and pluvial hydrological systems which are mainly influenced, respectively, by shortwave solar radiations and atmospheric temperature. The non-linear models (i.e. GAM, ABT and ANN) performed better than the linear GLM when simulating fortnightly flow percentiles. The aggregated boosted trees method showed higher and less variable R-2 values to downscale the hydrological variability in both nival and pluvial regimes. Based on GCM cnrm-cm(3) and scenarios A2 and A1B, future relative changes of fortnightly median flows were projected based on the regional downscaling approach. The results suggest a global decrease of flow in both pluvial and nival regimes, especially in spring, summer and autumn, whatever the considered scenario. The discussion considers the performance of each statistical method for downscaling flow at different spatial and temporal scales as well as the relationship between atmospheric processes and flow variability.

   COMPETITION; OVERLAP; CLIMATE
AB The niche is one of the most important concepts in ecology. However, there has been a persistent controversy on how to define, measure, and predict the ecological niche of an organism. Here I argue that these problems arise in part because the niche is defined by the set of all possible environments, many of which do not exist in nature. A complete description of the niche would require knowledge of a large number of environments that do not exist in nature. Given this, I propose that ecologists should not focus on the niche itself but instead on determining if a particular environment is a part of the niche. I then demonstrate that such an analysis has a natural interpretation as an estimate of the probability that an environment is suitable and that either experimental investigations or analyses of presence data can estimate this quantity. Depending on the way that resources interact to shape environmental requirements, the probability that an environment is a part of the niche behaves like published descriptions of causal inferences and distribution models. However, in some cases the probability that an environment is suitable can be strongly influenced by unmeasured aspects of the environment. When this is true, experimental and distribution models have complimentary strengths and weaknesses.

AB Intraspecific latitudinal clines in the body size of terrestrial vertebrates, where members of the same species are larger at higher latitudes, are widely interpreted as evidence for natural selection and adaptation to local climate. These clines are predicted to shift in response to climate change. We used museum specimens to measure changes in the body size of eight passerine bird species from south-eastern Australia over approximately the last 100 years. Four species showed significant decreases in body size (1.8-3.6% of wing length) and a shift in latitudinal cline over that period, and a meta-analysis demonstrated a consistent trend across all eight species. Southern high-latitude populations now display the body sizes typical of more northern populations pre-1950, equivalent to a 78 shift in latitude. Using ptilochronology, we found no evidence that these morphological changes were a plastic response to changes in nutrition, a likely non-genetic mechanism for the pattern observed. Our results demonstrate a generalized response by eight avian species to some major environmental change over the last 100 years or so, probably global warming.

AB Mechanistic links between top terrestrial predators and biogeochemical processes remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that large carnivores configure landscape heterogeneity through prey carcass distribution. A 50-year record composed of >3600 moose carcasses from Isle Royale National Park, Michigan, USA, showed that wolves modulate heterogeneity in soil nutrients, soil microbes, and plant quality by clustering prey carcasses over space. Despite being well utilized by predators, moose carcasses resulted in elevated soil macronutrients and microbial biomass, shifts in soil microbial composition, and elevated leaf nitrogen for at least 2-3 years at kill sites. Wolf-killed moose were deposited in some regions of the study landscape at up to 12x the rate of deposition in other regions. Carcass density also varied temporally, changing as much as 19-fold in some locations during the 50-year study period. This variation arises, in part, directly from variation in wolf hunting behavior. This study identifies a top terrestrial predator as a mechanism generating landscape heterogeneity, demonstrating reciprocal links between large carnivore behavior and ecosystem function.

AB The distribution of predators in urban areas is overlooked by urban planners. Due to the homogenizing power of urbanization, towns are expected to favour the settlement of generalist predators. We compared the frequency of specialist and generalist predators along an urban gradient (centre, inner periphery, outer periphery, and scarcely built areas) in towns of different size (small, medium, large). We obtained data on specialist (diurnal and nocturnal raptors, Dendrocopos major) and generalist (Lotus michahellis, corvids) predators breeding in each square of the grid of 27 urban atlases. The number of species per square of specialist predators decreased in more urbanised sectors, whereas the number of generalist predators either did not change or increased in the same sectors. However, some specialist (nocturnal raptors except Athene noctua) and generalist (Garrulus glandarius, Pica pica) predators did not follow such a pattern of distribution. Town size may affect the distribution of predators. Some species (D. major, G. glandarius, P. pica) were more frequent in the more urbanised sectors in small towns. Data gathered in few towns on a limited number of predator species may not fully represent the complex response by predators to urban gradients. Urban planners should consider the distribution of predators in towns to limit risks for urban wildlife. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ongoing global warming will increase the frequency of soil freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) in cool-temperate and other high-latitude regions. The spatial relevance of seasonally frozen ground amounts to c. 55% of the total land area of the northern hemisphere. Evidence suggests that FTCs contribute to nutrient dynamics. Knowledge of their effects on plant communities is scarce, although plants may be the decisive factor in controlling ecosystem functions such as nutrient retention.
   Here, the effects are analysed of five additional FTCs in winter for the above- and below-ground productivity of experimental grassland communities and soil enzymatic activity over the following growing season.
   Freeze-thaw cycles increased the above-ground productivity but reduced root length over the whole subsequent growing season. In summer, no changes in soil enzymatic activities representing the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles were observed in the FTC-manipulated plots, except for an increased cellobiohydrolase activity.
   Changes in productivity resulting in an increased shoot-to-root ratio and shifts in timing are capable of altering ecosystem stability and ecosystem services, such as productivity and nutrient retention.

AB The invasion of North American tidal marshes by Phragmites australis, or common reed, is a large-scale ecological problem that has been primarily studied at small spatial scales. Previous local-scale studies have provided evidence that the expansion of Phragmites is facilitated by disturbance and increased nitrogen (N) associated with agricultural and urban-suburban (developed) land uses along wetland-upland borders. We tested the generality of previous findings across a larger spatial scale and wider range of environmental conditions in Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuarine ecosystem in the USA. We sampled 90 tidal wetlands nested within 30 distinct subestuarine watersheds and examined the relationship between land use and Phragmites abundance and foliar N, an indicator of nitrogen availability. We estimated land use adjacent to wetland borders and within subestuary watersheds and explored the importance of spatial proximity by weighting land use by its distance from the wetland border or subestuary shoreline, respectively. Regression tree and changepoint analyses revealed that Phragmites abundance sharply increased in almost every wetland where development adjacent to borders exceeded 15%. Where development was < 15% but natural land cover at the near the subestuary shoreline was low (< similar to 35%), Phragmites was abundant, suggesting that wetlands in highly modified watersheds also were susceptible to invasion, regardless of land use adjacent to wetlands. Phragmites foliar N was markedly elevated in watersheds with > 14-22% shoreline development, the same level of development that corresponded to high levels of invasion. Our results suggest that development near wetlands is at least partially responsible for patterns of invasion across Chesapeake Bay. Larger-scale phenomena, such as nitrogen pollution at the watershed-subestuary scale, also may be facilitating invasion. Urbanization near coastlines appears to play an important role in the invasion success of Phragmites in coastal wetlands of Chesapeake Bay and probably much of eastern North America.

AB Analysing invasive spread from a landscape ecological perspective forms an important challenge in plant invasion ecology. The present study examines the effects of landscape structure on the spatial and temporal dynamics of an expanding black cherry Prunus serotina population within a rural landscape in Flanders, Belgium, carrying a dense network of interconnected hedgerows. The study area, 251 ha in size, harboured a total of 2962 P serotina individuals. The population was characterised by a negative exponential age distribution, a high growth rate and an early and continuous reproduction throughout the species' life cycle. The historical rate of spread of the species through the hedgerow network progressively increased with time, especially during the last decade. Spatial point pattern analysis revealed that the individuals had a significantly clustered distribution pattern and were spatially aggregated around seed sources, hedgerow intersections and roosting trees. Logistic regression analysis confirmed the effect of landscape structure on P scrotina occurrence, suggesting directional long distance dispersal by avian dispersal vectors, resulting in a differential seed pressure throughout the hedgerow network due to the preference of dispersing birds for roosting in structurally rich hedgerow with large trees near hedgerow intersections. Hence, the distribution of P serotina in agricultural landscapes was strongly mediated by dispersal processes. Furthermore, decreasing spatial aggregation along the species life cycle, with especially seedlings and saplings being significantly aggregated while adult individuals were mostly distributed at random, and a relative outward shift of seedling recruitment curves with time indicate density dependent mortality, probably caused by intraspecific competition.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivation in no-till soil of a postrice harvest field utilizes residual soil moisture and reduces the time period from rice harvest to wheat seeding in intensive rice-wheat cropping systems. Some of the major constraints in no-till wheat production are high weed infestation, poor stand establishment due to rapid drying of topsoil and low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). A field experiment was conducted at the research farm of the Wheat Research Centre, Dinajpur, Bangladesh, for two consecutive years to overcome those constraints, to evaluate rice straw as mulch, and to determine the optimum application rate of nitrogen (N) for no-till wheat. The treatments included 12 factorial combinations of three levels of mulching: no mulch (MO), surface application of rice straw mulch at 4.0 Mg ha(-1) that was withdrawn at 20 days after sowing (M-1), the same level of mulch as M-1 but allowed to be retained on the soil surface (M-2) and four nitrogen levels (control 80, 120 and 160 kg ha(-1)). Rice straw mulching had a significant effect on conserving initial soil moisture and reducing weed growth. Root length density and root weight density of wheat were positively influenced both by straw mulching and N levels. N uptake and apparent nitrogen recovery of applied N fertilizer were higher in mulch treatments M-1 and M-2 as compared to M-0. Also mulch treatment of M-1 and M-2 were equally effective at conserving soil moisture, suppressing growth of weed flora, promoting root development and thereby improved grain yield of no-till wheat. N application of 120 kg ha(-1) with straw mulch was found to be suitable for no-till wheat in experimental field condition. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the last decade, greater than expected levels of genetic structure have been reported for many marine taxa with high dispersal capabilities. Although little-studied to date, it is predicted that taxa with poor dispersal abilities would exhibit even more genetic differentiation than high dispersal taxa. These systems may track biogeographical processes better than more dispersive taxa and, more critically, function as the 'lowest common denominators' in MPA design initiatives. We investigate phylogeographical patterns in the poorly dispersing, yet widely distributed Patelloida profunda group and related congeners across the Indo-west Pacific region. One hundred and twenty-five individuals were sequenced for COI mtDNA [593 base pairs (bp)] and 44 individuals were sequenced for 16S mtDNA (539 bp). Identified P. profunda group lineages are highly geographically structured, with 12 reciprocally monophyletic lineages reported from 13 localities. Divergences within Indian and Pacific basins range from d = 0.013 to 0.127 and between basins from d = 0.147 to 0.197. The latter split is ancient (> 15 Myr) and cannot be related to Plio-Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations, characteristic of previously reported divergences in the same region. Juxtaposed against this structure is genetic connectivity between two widely separated P. profunda populations that share a common haplotype (phi(ST) = 0.001). This finding contrasts with previous work in the same geographical region and cautions strongly against single taxon indicators for designing conservation priorities or marine protected areas (MPAs). Historical and/or biological factors may play more significant roles than oceanography alone in determining the genetic structuring of taxa. In light of these findings, we discuss the difficulty in deriving biogeographical process or directionality from phylogenetic trees in dispersal-driven systems. Even with a well-resolved, highly supported topology, many equally parsimonious scenarios are possible.

AB Urbanisation is a looming global threat to in-stream biodiversity, but the best approaches to mitigation are unclear. This paper asks if the protection of in-stream biota, in particular macroinvertebrate assemblages, is dependent on the sequestration of catchments from urbanisation, or if protection in urbanised catchments can be achieved through better drainage design. In-stream macroinvertebrate assemblage composition was assessed for 16 catchments spanning a rural - urban gradient. Catchment imperviousness and drainage connection ( the proportion of impervious area directly connected to streams by stormwater pipes), together with other possible driving factors, were assessed as explanatory variables of macroinvertebrate assemblage composition. The proportion of variance explained independently and jointly by each variable was assessed by hierarchical partitioning. Assemblage composition was strongly explained by the gradient of urban density (i.e. a large proportion of variance was jointly explained by variables correlated with the urban gradient; imperviousness, connection, longitude and elevation). However, drainage connection was the strongest independent correlate. Most sensitive taxa were absent from sites with > 20% connection. Thus the connection of impervious surfaces to streams by pipes is a more likely determinant of taxa loss than the impervious areas themselves. Low-impact urban design approaches that reduce drainage connection are postulated as the most effective management solution to the protection of stream biota in urban catchments.

AB Mycorrhizas are ubiquitous symbioses that may have an important role in the movement of C from air to soil. Studies on the effects of climate change factors on mycorrhizas have been concentrated on the effects of atmospheric [CO2] whereas temperature effects have been neglected. Based on previous results showing no effect of varying atmospheric [CO2] on the development and P uptake of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonizing plants growing in controlled conditions, we hypothesized that soil temperature would have a higher impact on AMF development and nutrient uptake than the effects of [CO2] on the host plant. Pea plants were grown in association with either a single isolate of Glomus caledonium or AMF from field soil in factorial combination with the corresponding current (10degreesC) or elevated (15degreesC) soil temperatures at current (350 p.p. m) or elevated (700 p.p.m) atmospheric [CO2]. P-33 uptake by extraradical AMF hyphae was measured independently from root P uptake in a root exclusion compartment. Intraradical colonization developed well at both soil temperatures and almost duplicated from 10 to 15degreesC. Extraradical mycelium developed only at 15degreesC in the root exclusion compartment and hyphal P uptake could therefore be studied at 15degreesC only. Hyphal P uptake differed markedly between inoculum types, but was not altered by growing the host plants at two atmospheric [CO2] levels. No significant [CO2] x soil temperature interactions were observed. The results suggested that, in the system tested, AMF development and function is likely more influenced by the temperature component of climate change than by its [CO2] component. We suggest that much more attention should be paid to temperature effects in future studies.

AB Detection of the genetic effects of recent habitat fragmentation in natural populations can be a difficult task, especially for high gene flow species. Previous analyses of mitochondrial DNA data from across the current range of Speyeria idalia indicated that the species exhibited high levels of gene flow among populations, with the exception of an isolated population in the eastern portion of its range. However, some populations. are found on isolated habitat patches, which were recently separated from one another by large expanses of uninhabitable terrain, in the form of row crop agriculture. The goal of this study was to compare levels of genetic differentiation and diversity among populations found in relatively continuous habitat to populations in both recently and historically isolated habitat. Four microsatellite loci were used to genotype over 300 individuals from five populations in continuous habitat, five populations in recently fragmented habitat, and one historically isolated population. Results from the historically isolated population were concordant with previous analyses and suggest significant differentiation. Also, microsatellite data were consistent with the genetic effects of habitat fragmentation for the recently isolated populations, in the form of increased differentiation and decreased genetic diversity when compared to nonfragmented populations. These results suggest that given the appropriate control populations, microsatellite markers can be used to detect the effects of recent habitat fragmentation in natural populations, even at a large geographical scale in high gene flow species.

AB The school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) resource off southern Australia is assessed by use of an assessment approach that takes account of the spatial structure of the population. The population dynamics model underlying the assessment considers the spatial as well as the age- specific characteristics of school shark. It allows for a series of fisheries (each based on a different gear type), explicitly models the pupping/recruitment process, and allows for multiple stocks. The values for the parameters of this model are determined by fitting it to catch-rate data and information from tagging studies. The point estimates of the pup production at the start of 1997 range from 12% to 18% of the pre-exploitation equilibrium size, depending on the specifications of the assessment. Allowing for spatial structure and incorporating tag release-recapture data lead to reduced uncertainty compared with earlier assessments. The status of the resource, as reflected by the ratio of present to virgin pup production and total (1+) biomass, is sensitive to the assumed level of movement between the stocks in New Zealand and those in Australia, with lower values corresponding to higher levels of movement.

AB Most of the major genetic concerns in conservation biology, including inbreeding depression, loss of evolutionary potential, genetic adaptation to captivity and outbreeding depression, involve quantitative genetics. Small population size leads to inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity and so increases extinction risk. Captive populations of endangered species are managed to maximize the retention of genetic diversity by minimizing kinship, with subsidiary efforts to minimize inbreeding. There is growing evidence that genetic adaptation to captivity is a major issue in the genetic management of captive populations of endangered species as it reduces reproductive fitness when captive populations are reintroduced into the wild. This problem is not currently addressed, but it can be alleviated by deliberately fragmenting captive populations, with occasional exchange of immigrants to avoid excessive inbreeding. The extent and importance of outbreeding depression is a matter of controversy. Currently, an extremely cautious approach is taken to mixing populations. However, this cannot continue if fragmented populations are to be adequately managed to minimize extinctions. Most genetic management recommendations for endangered species arise directly, or indirectly, from quantitative genetic considerations.

AB The understanding of the relationships between environmental factors and evolutionary forces is of importance to preserve opportunities for the continuation of dynamic evolutionary and ecological processes. This involves the identification and quantification of the relative importance of environmental factors that may influence these processes. Nevertheless, environmental factors are generally interpreted in terms of hypothetical inferences as relationships between environmental and genetic variables are often difficult to quantify. In this study, we used a statistical framework based on canonical correspondence analysis in order to determine the relative contribution of drainage pattern and environmental factors in structuring inter- and intrapopulational genetic diversity among brook charr populations as depicted by microsatellite analysis. These procedures simultaneously analyse several sets of variables and determine their relative contribution. The results revealed the influence of drainage pattern, altitude and human-induced factors on the pattern of genetic diversity and, particularly, the important role of historical events in explaining patterns of contemporary genetic diversity among populations. The statistical framework used in this study provides an efficient way to empirically relate variations of genetic diversity and descriptive variables in general.

AB To assist in the species-level identification of stranded and hunted beaked whales, we compiled a database of 'reference' sequences from the mitochondrial DNA control region for 15 of the 20 described ziphiid species. Reference samples for eight species were obtained from stranded animals in New Zealand and South Australia. Sequences for a further seven species were obtained from a previously published report. This database was used to identify 20 'test' samples obtained from incompletely documented strandings around New Zealand. Analyses showed that four of these 'test' specimens (20%) had initially been misidentified. These included two animals of particular interest: (i) a Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris), the first record of this species in New Zealand waters; and, (ii) a juvenile Andrews' beaked whale (Mesoplodon bowdoini), a species known from just over 20 strandings worldwide. A published sequence from a beaked whale product purchased in the Republic of Korea was identified as a Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris). Levels of intra- and interspecific variation were compared to determine the potential for misidentification when the database or taxonomy is incomplete. Intraspecific variation was generally <2%, and interspecific divergence was generally >4.7%. Exceptions were within-species variation in Hyperoodon planifrons, southern bottlenosed whale (4.12%), which exceeded the variation between the two species of Berardius (3.78%), and variation between the two specimens assigned to M. hectori, Hector's beaked whale (7.14%). The latter case appears to be an error in species identification, and could represent the discovery of a new species of beaked whale.

AB The ecological role of the sea urchins Paracentrotus Lividus and Arbacia lixula was examined in shallow subtidal reefs on the west coast of Italy from December 1994 to July 1996. The density of sea urchins was manipulated experimentally in patches of vertical substrata without erect algae. The following propositions were examined: (1) that sea urchins were responsible for the persistence of patches of bare rock and encrusting corallines in shallow subtidal habitats, (2) that their effects were density dependent, and (3) that these effects were consistent in time. The experimental manipulations consisted of 3 replicate patches randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: (1) Ox (total removals), (2) 0.5x (50% of the average density found in untouched patches), (3) Ix (untouched patches), and (4) 2x (200% of the average density found in the untouched patches). The removal of sea urchins significantly increased the coverage of the filamentous and fleshy algae in permanent plots, and these effects were consistent over time. In contrast, grazing had no effect on the encrusting corallines, Peyssonnelia spp. and invertebrates (barnacles, bryozoans and limpets). The response of the filamentous algae was proportional to the density of sea urchins, with percent cover values in the 0.5x treatment being intermediate to those observed in the 0x and 1x treatments. Conversely, the response of the fleshy algae was non-linear: only when sea urchins were totally removed did the coverage of these plants increase significantly. Doubling the density of sea urchins significantly increased the erosion of the margins of the patches, while their removal caused no change along the perimeter. In general, there was considerable variability from patch to patch in the abundance of most of the response variables analysed, while temporal changes were less important. The results show that sea urchins can have significant but variable effects on vertical patches of barren habitat; alternative explanations are suggested to account for the persistence of these patches despite the removal of grazers.

AB The chemical barrier to root development existing in the subsoils of acid soils is a subject of increasing interest. In order to better understand the factors involved in the amelioration of subsoil acidity, the effects of calcium sulphate, phosphogypsum and calcium carbonate on the properties of the solid and liquid phases of subsoil samples and on the growth and nutrient uptake by maize (Zea mays L.) were evaluated. The soils used were two alic red-yellow latosols, two acric dusky red latosols and one alic dark-red latosol from the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A vertical split-root technique was used in a greenhouse experiment, with the plants initially grown in a small pot with 130 g fertile soil, which was introduced in a larger pot containing 2 dm(3) of the subsoil samples. The treatments consisted of a control (C) and applications of calcium carbonate (CC), calcium sulphate (CS) and phosphogypsum (PG) at the rate of 10 mmol(c) Ca2+ dm(-3). CS and PG reduced soil acidity, but in a much smaller proportion than CC. Calcium carbonate reduced the activity of Al3+ because of the increase in pH. Total aluminum and calcium contents in the soil solution were much higher for the red-yellow latosols than for the other soils, indicating lower sorption of Ca2+ and SO42- in these soils. The activity of Al in the soil solution was decreased in different ways for the five soils, depending on the ionic strength and the formation of the ionic pair AlSO4+ and, in the case of PG, the formation of complexes of Al with F (AlF2+, AlF2+ and AlF3 degrees). The subsoil samples presented severe restrictions for maize root growth and all three treatments were equally effective in increasing root development, which could be attributed to the supply of calcium in one of the acric dusky red latosols and a combined effect of the amendment in reducing the activity of Al and increasing the activity of Ca in the soil solution in the other soils. As a consequence the three treatments increased in the same manner water, N and K uptake from the subsoil and the dry matter production of maize. It can be concluded that, for the soils considered in this research, phosphogypsum is an effective amendment for acid subsoils containing low calcium or toxic aluminum contents.

AB The current rate of species extinction is rapidly approaching unprecedented highs, and life on Earth presently faces a sixth mass extinction event driven by anthropogenic activity, climate change, and ecological collapse. The field of conservation genetics aims at preserving species by using their levels of genetic diversity, usually measured as neutral genome-wide diversity, as a barometer for evaluating population health and extinction risk. A fundamental assumption is that higher levels of genetic diversity lead to an increase in fitness and long-term survival of a species. Here, we argue against the perceived importance of neutral genetic diversity for the conservation of wild populations and species. We demonstrate that no simple general relationship exists between neutral genetic diversity and the risk of species extinction. Instead, a better understanding of the properties of functional genetic diversity, demographic history, and ecological relationships is necessary for developing and implementing effective conservation genetic strategies.

AB Biodiversity is defined by trait differences between organisms, and biologists have long sought to predict associations among ecologically important traits. Why do some traits trade off but others are coexpressed? Why might some trait associations hold across levels of organization, from individuals and genotypes to populations and species, whereas others only occur at one level? Understanding such scaling is a core biological problem, bearing on the evolution of ecological strategies as well as forecasting responses to environmental change. Explicitly considering the hierarchy of biodiversity and expectations at each scale (individual change, evolution within and among populations, and species turnover) is necessary as we work toward a predictive framework in evolutionary ecology. Within species, a trait may have an association with another trait because of phenotypic plasticity, genetic correlation, or population-level local adaptation. Plastic responses are often adaptive and yet individuals have a fixed pool of resources; thus, positive and negative trait associations can be generated by immediate environmental needs and energetic demands. Genetic variation and covariation for traits within a population are typically shaped by varying natural selection in space and time. Although genetic correlations are infrequently long-term constraints, they may indicate competing organismal demands. Traits are often quantitatively differentiated among populations (local adaptation), although selection rarely favors qualitatively different strategies until populations become reproductively isolated. Across species, niche specialization to particular habitats or biotic interactions may determine trait correlations, a subset of which are termed "strategic trade-offs" because they are a consequence of adaptive specialization. Across scales, constraints within species often do not apply as new species evolve, and conversely, trait correlations observed across populations or species may not be reflected within populations. I give examples of such scale-dependent trait associations and their causes across taxonomic groups and ecosystems, and in the final section of the paper, I specifically evaluate leaf economics spectrum traits and their associations with plant defense against herbivory. Scale-dependent predictions emerge for understanding plant ecology holistically, and this approach can be fruitfully applied more generally in evolutionary ecology. Adaptive specialization and community context are two of the primary drivers of trade-offs and syndromes across biological scales.

AB Ultraconserved (UCEs) are popular markers for phylogenomic studies. They are relatively simple to collect from distantly-related organisms, and contain sufficient information to infer relationships at almost all taxonomic levels. Most studies of UCEs use partitioning to account for variation in rates and patterns of molecular evolution among sites, for example by estimating an independent model of molecular evolution for each UCE. However, rates and patterns of molecular evolution vary substantially within as well as between UCEs, suggesting that there may be opportunities to improve how UCEs are partitioned for phylogenetic inference. We propose and evaluate new partitioning methods for phylogenomic studies of UCEs: Sliding-Window Site Characteristics (SWSC), and UCE Site Position (UCESP). The first method uses site characteristics such as entropy, multinomial likelihood, and GC content to generate partitions that account for heterogeneity in rates and patterns of molecular evolution within each UCE. The second method groups together nucleotides that are found in similar physical locations within the UCEs. We examined the new methods with seven published data sets from a variety of taxa. We demonstrate the UCESP method generates partitions that are worse than other strategies used to partition UCE data sets (e.g., one partition per UCE). The SWSC method, particularly when based on site entropies, generates partitions that account for within-UCE heterogeneity and leads to large increases in the model fit. All of the methods, code, and data used in this study, are available from https://github.com/Tagliacollo/ PartitionUCE. Simplified code for implementing the best method, the SWSC-EN, is available from https://github.com/ Tagliacollo/PFinderUCE-SWSC-EN.

AB The analysis of vulnerability of socio-ecological systems to threats of different types such as extreme climate events or change in land use draws attention to the factors and processes that determine whether the ecological, social and integrated socio-ecological systems are likely to experience harm due to exposure to the threat. During the last years there has been an increasing attention to the analysis of the vulnerability of socio-ecological systems when facing the lost or degradation of ecosystem services. However, despite the existence of conceptual frameworks and empirical applications to evaluate vulnerability of socio-ecological systems some open questions and challenges still remain. How to conceptually differentiate key concepts such as sensitivity, exposition, vulnerability and threat? How to consider the differences in socio-economic characteristics of the beneficiaries and in their capacity to adapt to new conditions of the ecological system? How to link ecological vulnerability with the social system analysis to obtain an integrated risk assessment of the socio-ecological system? This paper presents a conceptual framework for vulnerability assessment of socio-ecological systems that addresses the mentioned open questions based on a review of both theoretical and empirical literature related to vulnerability and socio-ecological systems. The paper identifies the attributes and indicators of the dimensions of vulnerability for understanding both the social vulnerability and ecological vulnerability separately and then jointly, in interaction with each other. The framework offers a way to communicate with practitioners and policy makers on identifying and improving the factors that reduce vulnerability. It can thus serve as a tool for targeting the implementation of policies and practices aimed at reducing vulnerability.

AB Scholarly journal publications on the topic of ecosystem services have substantially grown throughout the past decade, which is evidenced by an expanding world-wide research base. However, several challenges in the field of ecosystem services still remain, including conflicting approaches to ecosystem services terminology, classification schemes, research methods, and reporting requirements. We assess the development and disciplinary focus of ecosystem service research over the last decade using a of peer-reviewed journal publications. The journals of Shengtai Xuebao Acta Ecologica Sinica, Ecosystem Services, PLoS One, and Ecological Economics lead scholarly journals publishing ecosystem services- focused articles. The European Union leads ecosystem services publications (42%), while the United States is responsible for 30% of ecosystem services publications. This analysis is supplemented by a discussion on ecosystem services-focused research and policy to identify trends that encourage future study to resolve some of the current issues faced by the research community.

AB Nitrogen (N) plays a vital role in photosynthesis and crop productivity. Maize plants may be able to increase physiological N utilization efficiency (NUtE) under low-N stress by increasing photosynthetic rate (Pn) per unit leaf N, that is, photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE). In this study, we analyzed the relationship between PNUE and N allocation in maize ear-leaves during the grain-filling stage under low N (no N application) and high N (180 kg N ha(-1)) in a 2-year field experiment. Under low N, grain yield decreased while NUtE increased. Low-N treatment reduced the specific N content of ear leaves by 38% without significant influencing Pn, thereby increasing PNUE by 54%. Under low-N stress, maize plants tended to invest relatively more N into bioenergetics to sustain electron transport. In contrast, N allocated to chlorophyll and light-harvesting proteins was reduced to control excess electron production. Soluble proteins were reduced to shrink the N storage reservoir. We conclude that optimization of N allocation within leaves is a key adaptive mechanism to maximize Pn and crop productivity when N is limited during the grain-filling stage in maize under low-N conditions.

AB Fire regime characteristics in North America are expected to change over the next several decades as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Although some fire regime characteristics (e.g., area burned and fire season length) are relatively well-studied in the context of a changing climate, fire severity has received less attention. In this study, we used observed data from 1984 to 2012 for the western United States (US) to build a statistical model of fire severity as a function of climate. We then applied this model to several (n = 20) climate change projections representing mid-century (2040-2069) conditions under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Model predictions suggest widespread reduction in fire severity for large portions of the western US. However, our model implicitly incorporates climate-induced changes in vegetation type, fuel load, and fire frequency. As such, our predictions are best interpreted as a potential reduction in fire severity, a potential that may not be realized due human-induced disequilibrium between plant communities and climate. Consequently, to realize the reductions in fire severity predicted in this study, land managers in the western US could facilitate the transition of plant communities towards a state of equilibrium with the emerging climate through means such as active restoration treatments (e.g., mechanical thinning and prescribed fire) and passive restoration strategies like managed natural fire (under suitable weather conditions). Resisting changes in vegetation composition and fuel load via activities such as aggressive fire suppression will amplify disequilibrium conditions and will likely result in increased fire severity in future decades because fuel loads will increase as the climate warms and fire danger becomes more extreme. The results of our study provide insights to the pros and cons of resisting or facilitating change in vegetation composition and fuel load in the context of a changing climate.

AB Increasing attention to regime shifts, critical transitions, non-marginal changes, and systemic shocks calls for the development of models that are able to reproduce or grow structural changes that occur over time periods perceived as abrupt. This paper highlights specific modelling challenges to consider when exploring coupled socio-environmental systems experiencing regime shifts. We explore these challenges in the context of four modelling approaches that have been applied to the study of regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems: statistical, system dynamics, equilibrium and agent-based modelling. When reviewing these modelling approaches we reflect on a set of criteria including the ability of an approach (1) to capture feedbacks between social and environmental system, (2) to represent the sources of regime shifts, (3) to incorporate complexity aspects, and (4) to deal with regime shift identification. Many of the modelling examples considered do not provide information on all these criteria, which receive a lot of attention in empirical studies of registered regime shifts. This suggests a need to develop a common modelling terminology in the domain of modelling for resilience and regime shifts. When discussing strengths and weaknesses of various modelling paradigms we conclude that a hybrid approach is likely to provide most insights into the processes and consequences of regime shifts. Challenges and frontier directions of research for designing models to study regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems are outlined. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The use of trait-based approaches to detect effects of land use and climate change on terrestrial plant and aquatic phytoplankton communities is increasing, but such a framework is still needed for benthic stream algae. Here we present a conceptual framework of morphological, physiological, behavioural and life-history traits relating to resource acquisition and resistance to disturbance. We tested this approach by assessing the relationships between multiple anthropogenic stressors and algal traits at 43 stream sites. Our "natural experiment" was conducted along gradients of agricultural land-use intensity (0-95% of the catchment in high-producing pasture) and hydrological alteration (0-92% streamflow reduction resulting from water abstraction for irrigation) as well as related physicochemical variables (total nitrogen concentration and deposited fine sediment). Strategic choice of study sites meant that agricultural intensity and hydrological alteration were uncorrelated. We studied the relationships of seven traits (with 23 trait categories) to our environmental predictor variables using general linear models and an information-theoretic model-selection approach. Life form, nitrogen fixation and spore formation were key traits that showed the strongest relationships with environmental stressors. Overall, FI (farming intensity) exerted stronger effects on algal communities than hydrological alteration. The large-bodied, non-attached, filamentous algae that dominated under high farming intensities have limited dispersal abilities but may cope with unfavourable conditions through the formation of spores. Antagonistic interactions between FI and flow reduction were observed for some trait variables, whereas no interactions occurred for nitrogen concentration and fine sediment. Our conceptual framework was well supported by tests of ten specific hypotheses predicting effects of resource supply and disturbance on algal traits. Our study also shows that investigating a fairly comprehensive set of traits can help shed light on the drivers of algal community composition in situations where multiple stressors are operating. Further, to understand non-linear and non-additive effects of such drivers, communities need to be studied along multiple gradients of natural variation or anthropogenic stressors.

AB IUCN Red Lists are recognized worldwide as powerful instruments for the conservation of species. Quantitative criteria to standardize approaches for estimating population trends, geographic ranges and population sizes have been developed at global and sub-global levels. Little attention has been given to the data needed to estimate species trends and range sizes for IUCN Red List assessments. Few regions collect monitoring data in a structured way and usually only for a limited number of taxa. Therefore, opportunistic data are increasingly used for estimating trends and geographic range sizes. Trend calculations use a range of proxies: (i) monitoring sentinel populations, (ii) estimating changes in available habitat, or (iii) statistical models of change based on opportunistic records. Geographic ranges have been determined using: (i) marginal occurrences, (ii) habitat distributions, (iii) range-wide occurrences, (iv) species distribution modelling (including site-occupancy models), and (v) process-based modelling. Red List assessments differ strongly among regions (Europe, Britain and Flanders, north Belgium). Across different taxonomic groups, in European Red Lists IUCN criteria B and D resulted in the highest level of threat. In Britain, this was the case for criterion D and criterion A, while in Flanders criterion B and criterion A resulted in the highest threat level. Among taxonomic groups, however, large differences in the use of IUCN criteria were revealed. We give examples from Europe, Britain and Flemish Red List assessments using opportunistic data and give recommendations for a more uniform use of IUCN criteria among regions and among taxonomic groups.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London.

AB Nitrogen availability in dead wood is highly restricted and associations with N-fixing bacteria are thought to enable wood-decaying fungi to meet their nitrogen requirements for vegetative and generative growth. We assessed the diversity of nifH (dinitrogenase reductase) genes in dead wood of the common temperate tree species Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies from differently managed forest plots in Germany using molecular tools. By incorporating these genes into a large compilation of published nifH sequences and subsequent phylogenetic analyses of deduced proteins we verified the presence of diverse pools corresponding to functional nifH, almost all of which are new to science. The distribution of nifH genes strongly correlated with tree species and decay class, but not with forest management, while higher fungal fructification was correlated with decreasing nitrogen content of the dead wood and positively correlated with nifH diversity, especially during the intermediate stage of wood decay. Network analyses based on non-random species co-occurrence patterns revealed interactions among fungi and N-fixing bacteria in the dead wood and strongly indicate the occurrence of at least commensal relationships between these taxa.

AB Recent advances in remote sensing technologies have facilitated the generation of very high resolution (VHR) environmental data. Exploratory studies suggested that, if used in species distribution models (SDMs), these data should enable modelling species' micro-habitats and allow improving predictions for fine-scale biodiversity management. In the present study, we tested the influence, in SDMs, of predictors derived from a VHR digital elevation model (DEM) by comparing the predictive power of models for 239 plant species and their assemblages fitted at six different resolutions in the Swiss Alps. We also tested whether changes of the model quality for a species is related to its functional and ecological characteristics. Refining the resolution only contributed to slight improvement of the models for more than half of the examined species, with the best results obtained at 5 m, but no significant improvement was observed, on average, across all species. Contrary to our expectations, we could not consistently correlate the changes in model performance with species characteristics such as vegetation height. Temperature, the most important variable in the SDMs across the different resolutions, did not contribute any substantial improvement. Our results suggest that improving resolution of topographic data only is not sufficient to improve SDM predictions - and therefore local management - compared to previously used resolutions (here 25 and 100 m). More effort should be dedicated now to conduct finer-scale in-situ environmental measurements (e.g. for temperature, moisture, snow) to obtain improved environmental measurements for fine-scale species mapping and management.

AB Ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco) concentrations were quantified as a proportion of total protein in eight species of microalgae. This enzyme has been assumed to be a major fraction of total protein in phytoplankton, as has been demonstrated in plants, potentially constituting a large sink for cellular nitrogen. Representative microalgae were grown in batch and continuous cultures under nutrient-replete, nitrogen (N)-limited, or phosphorus (P)-limited conditions with varying CO2. Quantitative Western blots were performed using commercially available global antibodies and protein standards. Field incubations with natural populations of organisms from the coast of California were conducted under both nutrient-replete and N-limited conditions with varying CO2. In all experiments, Rubisco represented <6% of total protein. In nutrient-replete exponentially growing batch cultures, concentrations ranged from 2% to 6%, while in nutrient-limited laboratory and field cultures, concentrations were <2.5%. Rubisco generally decreased with increasing CO2 and with decreasing growth rates. Based on a calculation of maximum Rubisco activity, these results suggest that phytoplankton contain the minimum concentration of enzyme necessary to support observed growth rates. Unlike in plants, Rubisco does not account for a major fraction of cellular N in phytoplankton.

   the Pearl River Delta
ID GROWTH; FOREST
AB Road density (i.e., km/km2) is a useful broad index of the road network in a landscape and has been linked to several ecological effects of roads. However, previous studies have shown that road density, estimated by grid computing, has weak correlation with landscape fragmentation. In this article, we propose a new measure of road density, namely, kernel density estimation function (KDE) and quantify the relation between road density and landscape fragmentation. The results show that road density estimated by KDE (km/km2) elucidates the spatial pattern of the road network in the region. Areas with higher road density are dominated by a larger proportion of built-up landscape and less possession of forest and vice versa. Road networks segregated the landscape into smaller pieces and a greater number of patches. Furthermore, Spearman rank correlation model indicates that road density (km/km2) is positively related to landscape fragmentation. Our results suggest that road density, estimated by KDE, may be a better correlate with effects of the road on landscape fragmentation. Through KDE, the regional spatial pattern of road density and the prediction of the impact of the road on landscape fragmentation could be effectively acquired.

AB As the pace of urbanization accelerates, the conservation of urban biodiversity emerges as a rising concern. Urban ecological research has revealed that some green areas in cities can harbor a rich diversity of species that can be enhanced by certain landscape- and local-scale structural planning variables. However, while most studies have been conducted in large greenspaces (e.g., parks, remnants), less effort was made to understand which variables influence biodiversity within small green patches and the efficiency of management practices has been seldom investigated. Here, we explore how management practices interplayed with landscape and structural variables to influence the diversity of plants, birds, butterflies and other pollinating insects in small public gardens (0.5-2.0 ha) in the center of a large metropolis (Paris, France).
   Small public gardens hosted significant common biodiversity and the ones that employed a conservation program (i.e., differential management) supported a higher diversity of all taxa and less urbanophile communities of birds and butterflies. Local-scale and management variables were more important in enhancing biodiversity than landscape-scale variables. Specifically, lawns rich in wild plants attracted many pollinators and bird richness increased with tree cover. Pesticides had a negative effect on bird richness, while a higher diversity of habitats and soils (i.e. mulching, peat) increased the diversity of all four taxa. We also found that bird richness could serve as a reasonable surrogate for butterflies and other pollinators. Our results highlight how planning and managing public gardens in the center of a large metropolis can benefit biodiversity, regardless of spatial context. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mountain lions (Puma concolor) are often difficult to monitor because of their low capture probabilities, extensive movements, and large territories. Methods for estimating the abundance of this species are needed to assess population status, determine harvest levels, evaluate the impacts of management actions on populations, and derive conservation and management strategies. Traditional markrecapture methods do not explicitly account for differences in individual capture probabilities due to the spatial distribution of individuals in relation to survey effort (or trap locations). However, recent advances in the analysis of capturerecapture data have produced methods estimating abundance and density of animals from spatially explicit capturerecapture data that account for heterogeneity in capture probabilities due to the spatial organization of individuals and traps. We adapt recently developed spatial capturerecapture models to estimate density and abundance of mountain lions in western Montana. Volunteers and state agency personnel collected mountain lion DNA samples in portions of the Blackfoot drainage (7,908?km2) in west-central Montana using 2 methods: snow back-tracking mountain lion tracks to collect hair samples and biopsy darting treed mountain lions to obtain tissue samples. Overall, we recorded 72 individual capture events, including captures both with and without tissue sample collection and hair samples resulting in the identification of 50 individual mountain lions (30 females, 19 males, and 1 unknown sex individual). We estimated lion densities from 8 models containing effects of distance, sex, and survey effort on detection probability. Our population density estimates ranged from a minimum of 3.7 mountain lions/100?km2 (95% CI 2.35.7) under the distance only model (including only an effect of distance on detection probability) to 6.7 (95% CI 3.111.0) under the full model (including effects of distance, sex, survey effort, and distance?x?sex on detection probability). These numbers translate to a total estimate of 293 mountain lions (95% CI 182451) to 529 (95% CI 245870) within the Blackfoot drainage. Results from the distance model are similar to previous estimates of 3.6 mountain lions/100?km2 for the study area; however, results from all other models indicated greater numbers of mountain lions. Our results indicate that unstructured spatial sampling combined with spatial capturerecapture analysis can be an effective method for estimating large carnivore densities. Published 2012.

AB Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) provide an important tool for conservation of marine ecosystems. To be most effective, these areas should be strategically located in a manner that supports ecosystem function. To inform marine spatial planning and support strategic establishment of MPAs within the California Current System, we identified areas predicted to support multispecies aggregations of seabirds ("hotspots''). We developed habitat-association models for 16 species using information from at-sea observations collected over an 11-year period (1997-2008), bathymetric data, and remotely sensed oceanographic data for an area from north of Vancouver Island, Canada, to the USA/Mexico border and seaward 600 km from the coast. This approach enabled us to predict distribution and abundance of seabirds even in areas of few or no surveys. We developed single-species predictive models using a machine-learning algorithm: bagged decision trees. Single-species predictions were then combined to identify potential hotspots of seabird aggregation, using three criteria: (1) overall abundance among species, (2) importance of specific areas ("core areas'') to individual species, and (3) predicted persistence of hotspots across years. Model predictions were applied to the entire California Current for four seasons (represented by February, May, July, and October) in each of 11 years. Overall, bathymetric variables were often important predictive variables, whereas oceanographic variables derived from remotely sensed data were generally less important. Predicted hotspots often aligned with currently protected areas (e.g., National Marine Sanctuaries), but we also identified potential hotspots in Northern California/Southern Oregon (from Cape Mendocino to Heceta Bank), Southern California (adjacent to the Channel Islands), and adjacent to Vancouver Island, British Columbia, that are not currently included in protected areas. Prioritization and identification of multispecies hotspots will depend on which group of species is of highest management priority. Modeling hotspots at a broad spatial scale can contribute to MPA site selection, particularly if complemented by fine-scale information for focal areas.

AB In the Pacific northwestern (PNW) region of North America, climatic conditions have significantly warmed since a predominantly cool phase of the Pacific North American circulation patterns between 1950 and 1975. What are the implications of this shift in climate for the vulnerability of native tree species? To address this question, we combined mechanistic and statistical models to assess where a variety of native tree species might be more vulnerable within their recorded ranges and where they might potentially migrate. For long-lived species that are well adapted to compete, seasonal differences in photosynthesis and water use offer insights helpful in predicting their distributions. To evaluate the general response of conifers to climatic variation across the region, we previously applied a process-based model (3-PG), to simulate the growth and maximum leaf area index that Douglas-fir could attain within recognized forested areas. We then constructed automated decision tree models to define and map the ecological distributions of 15 tree species based on differences in how photosynthesis was constrained by drought, daytime temperatures, high evaporative demand, and the frequency of frost. For the baseline climate period (1950-1975), the decision tree models predicted presence and absence of each species at 23,000 observations with an average accuracy of 81%, with an average kappa statistic of 0.74. In this paper the same models were run annually for the period between 1976 and 2006 for each species, and the areas defined as remaining suitable or becoming vulnerable to disturbance were identified based on whether more or less than half of the years fell within the originally defined limits. Based on these criteria, 70% of the species recorded ranges remained suitable, with 30% deemed vulnerable. Results varied notably by species with western red cedar and western hemlock remaining highly adapted, with potential for range expansion in area of up to 50% relative to the baseline period. In contrast, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, grand, and noble fir were classified as vulnerable with potential net contractions in their ranges. The analysis was extended through the rest of the 21st century using climatic projections from the Canadian global circulation model with a high fossil fuel emission scenario (A2) and compared to other previously published species range predictions.

AB Although many studies have modeled the effects of climate change on future species distributions and extinctions, the theoretical approach most commonly used-climate envelope modeling-typically ignores the potential physiological capacity of animals to respond to climate change. We explore the consequences of the phenotypic plasticity available to animals, by examining physiological responses of free-living animals in their natural habitats and by applying integrative, mechanistic models of heat exchange in invertebrates and humans. Specifically, we explore how behavioral, autonomic, and morphological modifications such as nocturnal activity, selective brain cooling, and body color may potentially serve as buffers to the consequences of climate change. Although some species may adapt to climate change through phenotypic plasticity, there are significant limits to this strategy. Furthermore, predictions of the response of organisms to changes in climate can be erroneous when modeled at large scales using coarse spatial or temporal data. Environmental heterogeneity can provide habitats suitable for species even though large-scale changes in the climate might predict a species' extinction. A detailed understanding of physiology, combined with integrative biophysical modeling and ecological manipulation, provides a powerful tool for predicting future ecological patterns and managing their consequences.

AB Phenotypic plasticity has been studied intensively in experimental settings but infrequently in nature, and therefore the relevance of experimental findings is poorly known. This is especially true for morphological plasticity in amphibian larvae induced by predators and competitors. This paper describes a seven-year survey of head and tail shape in eight species of anuran and newt larvae in northern Switzerland, involving 6824 individual larvae and 59 ponds. I tested relationships between geometric measures of size and shape and five habitat gradients: pond permanence, cover by forest canopy and aquatic vegetation, and the densities of predators and competitors. Responses to competitors and predators were often similar to those reported in experiments. High competitor density was associated with small size and a large head in newt larvae, a long or deep head/body in anuran larvae, and a short or shallow tail in newts and some tadpoles. High predator density was correlated with a deep tail fin and tail muscle in many species. In anurans, the change in shape between low-and high-predator ponds in nature closely paralleled the plastic response to nonlethal predators in mesocosm experiments. The survey revealed many previously undescribed relationships between morphology and the other habitat features. Several species had relatively large tails in ponds that were shaded or thickly vegetated. Associations between year-to-year changes in shape and habitat within ponds implicated phenotypic plasticity rather than genetic population divergence, at least in anurans. These results inspire confidence in the relevance of experiments and highlight many new patterns that will merit further study.

TI Impact of naturally spawning captive-bred Atlantic salmon on wild

AB The assessment report of the 4th International Panel on Climate Change confirms that global warming is strongly affecting biological systems and that 20-30% of species risk extinction from projected future increases in temperature. It is essential that any measures taken to conserve individual species and their constituent populations against climate-mediated declines are appropriate. The release of captive bred animals to augment wild populations is a widespread management strategy for many species but has proven controversial. Using a regression model based on a 37-year study of wild and sea ranched Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) spawning together in the wild, we show that the escape of captive bred animals into the wild can substantially depress recruitment and more specifically disrupt the capacity of natural populations to adapt to higher winter water temperatures associated with climate variability. We speculate the mechanisms underlying this seasonal response and suggest that an explanation based on bio-energetic processes with physiological responses synchronized by photoperiod is plausible. Furthermore, we predict, by running the model forward using projected future climate scenarios, that these cultured fish substantially increase the risk of extinction for the studied population within 20 generations. In contrast, we show that positive outcomes to climate change are possible if captive bred animals are prevented from breeding in the wild. Rather than imposing an additional genetic load on wild populations by releasing maladapted captive bred animals, we propose that conservation efforts should focus on optimizing conditions for adaptation to occur by reducing exploitation and protecting critical habitats. Our findings are likely to hold true for most poikilothermic species where captive breeding programmes are used in population management.

AB Climate change is expected to drive species ranges towards the poles and to have a strong influence on species distributions. In this study, we focused on diadromous species that are of economical and ecological importance in the whole of Europe. We investigated the potential distribution of all diadromous fish regularly encountered in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East (28 species) under conditions predicted for twenty-first century climate change. To do so, we investigated the 1900 distribution of each species in 196 basins spread across all of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Four levels were used to semiquantitatively describe the abundance of species, that is missing, rare, common and abundant. We then selected five variables describing the prevailing climate in the basins, the physical nature of the basins and reflecting historical events known to have affected freshwater fish distribution. Logistic regressions with a four-level ordinal response variable were used to develop species-specific models. These predictive models related the observed distribution of these species in 1900 to the most explanatory combination of variables. Finally, we selected the A2 SRES scenario and the HadCM3 (Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3) global climate model (GCM) to obtain climate variables (temperature and precipitation) at the end of this century. We used these 2100 variables in our models and obtained maps of climatically suitable and unsuitable basins, percentages of contraction or expansion for each species. Twenty-two models were successfully built, that is there were five species for which no model could be established because their distribution range was too narrow and the Acipenser sturio model failed during calibration. All the models selected temperature or/and precipitation as explanatory variables. Responses to climate change were species-specific but could be classified into three categories: little or no change in the distribution (five species), expansion of the distribution range (three species gaining suitable basins mainly northward) and contraction of the distribution (14 species losing suitable basins). Shifting ranges were in accordance with those found in other studies and underlined the high sensitivity of diadromous fish to modifications in their environment.

AB For sediment yield estimation, intermittent measurements of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) have to be interpolated to derive a Continuous sedigraph. Traditionally, sediment rating Curves (SRCs) based Oil univariate linear regression of discharge and SSC (or the logarithms thereof) are used but alternative approaches (e.g. fuzzy logic. artificial neural networks, etc.) exist. This paper presents a comparison of the applicability of traditional SRCs. generalized linear models (GLMs) and nonparametric regression using Random Forests (RF) and Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) applied to a dataset of SSC obtained for four subcatchments (0.08, 41, 145 and 445 km(2)) in the Central Spanish Pyrenees. The observed SSCs are highly variable and range over six orders of magnitude. For these data, traditional SRCs performed inadequately due to the over-simplification of relating SSC solely to discharge. Instead, the multitude of acting processes required more flexibility to model these nonlinear relationships. Thus, alternative advanced machine learning techniques that have been successfully applied ill other disciplines were tested. GLMs provide the option of including other relevant process variables (e.g. rainfall intensities and temporal information) but require the selection of the most appropriate predictors. For the given datasets, the investigated variable selection methods produced inconsistent results. All proposed GLMs showed an interior performance, whereas RF and QRF proved to be very robust and performed favourably for reproducing sediment dynamics. QRF additionally provides estimates oil the accuracy of the predictions and thus allows the assessment of uncertainties in the estimated sediment yield that is not commonly found in other methods. The capabilities of RF and QRF concerning the interpretation of predictor effects are also Outlined. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Urbanization is one of the most extreme forms of land transformation. It is supposed to change the frequencies of species trait states in species assemblages. We hypothesize that the flora of urban and rural areas differs in the frequency of trait states and ask which traits enable a plant to cope with the urban environment. We tested our hypothesis in Germany, which was divided into grid-cells of ca 130 km(2). We distinguished urbanized (with more than 33% urban land use; n = 59), agricultural (with more than 50% agricultural land use; n = 1365) and semi-natural (with more than 50% forest and semi-natural land use; n = 312) grid-cells and calculated the proportions of plant species per trait state in each grid-cell. Multiple linear regressions explained the log-transformed ratio of one proportion to another with land use (urban, agricultural, semi-natural) and the environmental parameters (climate, topography, soils and geology). Additionally, linear mixed effect models accounted for the effects of land use and biogeography and differences in sample size of the three grid-cell types. Urbanized and rural areas showed clear differences in the proportion of trait states. Urbanized grid-cells had e.g., higher proportions of wind-pollinated plants, plants with scleromorphic leaves or plants dispersed by animals, and lower proportions of insect-pollinated plants, plants with hygromorphic leaves or plants dispersed by wind than other grid-cells. Our study shows that shifts in land use can change the trait state composition of plant assemblages. Far-reaching urbanization might consequently homogenize our flora with respect to trait state frequency.

AB Phylogenetic reconstructions may be hampered by multiple substitutions in nucleotide positions obliterating signal, a phenomenon called saturation. Traditionally, plotting ti/tv ratios against genetic distances has been used to reveal saturation by assessing when ti/tv stabilizes at 1. However, interpretation of results and assessment of comparability between different data sets or partitions are rather subjective. Herein, we present the new C factor, which quantifies convergence of ti/tv ratios, thus allowing comparability. Furthermore, we introduce a comparative value for homoplasy, the O/E ratio, based on alterations of tree length. Simulation studies and an empirical example, based on annelid rRNA-gene sequences, show that the C factor correlates with noise, tree length and genetic distance and therefore is a proxy for saturation. The O/E ratio correlates with the C factor, which does not provide an intrinsic threshold of exclusion, and thus both together can objectively guide decisions to exclude saturated nucleotide positions. However, analyses also showed that, for reconstructing annelid phylogeny using Maximum Likelihood, an increase in numbers of positions improves tree reconstruction more than does the exclusion of saturated positions.

AB Background and Aims Leaf mechanical properties, which are important to protect leaves against physical stresses, are thought to change with light and nutrient availabilities. This study aims to understand phenotypic changes of leaf mechanical properties with respect to dry mass allocation and anatomy.
   Methods Leaf lamina strength (maximum force per unit area to fracture), toughness (work to fracture) and stiffness (resistance against deformation) were measured by punch-and-die tests, and anatomical and physiological traits were determined in Plantago major plants grown at different light and nutrient availabilities. A conceptual approach was developed by which punch strength and related carbon costs can be quantitatively related to the underlying anatomical and morphological traits: leaf thickness, dry-mass allocation to cell walls and cell-wall-specific strength.
   Key Results Leaf lamina strength, toughness and stiffness (all expressed on a punch area basis) increased with light availability. By contrast, nutrient availability did not change strength or toughness, but stiffness was higher in low-nutrient plants. Punch strength (maximum force per unit punch area, F-max/area) was analysed as the product of leaf mass per area (LMA) and F-max/leaf mass (= punch strength/LMA, indicating mass-use efficiency for strength). The greater strength of sun leaves was mainly explained by their higher LMA. Shade leaves, by contrast, had a higher F-max/leaf mass. This greater efficiency in shade leaves was caused by a greater fraction of leaf mass in cell walls and by a greater specific strength of cell walls. These differences are probably because epidermis cells constitute a relatively large fraction of the leaf cross-section in shaded leaves. Although a larger percentage of intercellular spaces were found in shade leaves, this in itself did not reduce 'material' strength (punch strength/thickness); it might, however, be important for increasing distance between upper and lower epidermis per unit mass and thus maintaining flexural stiffness at minimal costs.
   Conclusions The consequences of a reduced LMA for punch strength in shaded leaves was partially compensated for by a mechanically more efficient design, which, it is suggested, contributes importantly to resisting mechanical stress under carbon-limited conditions.

AB The study of reproductive isolation between populations, combined with estimates of genetic divergence, provides important insights into mechanisms of speciation. In this study, sixteen morphologically heterogeneous sympatric clones of Eunotia bilunaris sensu lato (Bacillariophyta) were brought into culture to study their phylogenetic relationships and pre- and postzygotic reproductive barriers. An ITS rDNA phylogeny was congruent with morphology and divided the clones into three groups ('slender', 'robust' and 'labile'), pointing to the presence of several species in E. bilunaris. Whereas most strains had a heterothallic mating system, four 'labile' clones displayed apomictic behaviour. A further 'labile' clone had a heterothallic mating behaviour, however, suggesting a very recent origin for apomixis. Despite high sequence divergence, hybridization occurred between clones belonging to different groups, but was 20 - 400 times less frequent than in intra-group matings. F1 hybrids had an intermediate morphology and were almost completely sterile; gamete formation was generally arrested in the early stages of meiosis I. The ITS divergence of 11.5-12.3% between the 'robust' and 'slender' clones seems to represent an upper limit of divergence in which cell pairing, gamete formation and auxosporulation are still possible but heavily reduced, and where hybrid sterility has already evolved.

AB The federally endangered North American Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) and the closely related Melissa blue butterfly (L. m. melissa) can be distinguished based on life history and morphology. Western populations of L. m. samuelis share mitochondrial haplotypes with L. m. melissa populations, while eastern populations of L. m. samuelis have divergent haplotypes. Here we test two hypotheses concerning the presence of L. m. melissa mitochondrial haplotypes in western L. m. samuelis populations: (i) mitochondrial introgression has occurred from L. m. melissa populations into western L. m. samuelis populations, or (ii) western populations of the nominal L. m. samuelis are more closely related to L. m. melissa than to eastern L. m. samuelis populations, yet are phenotypically similar to the latter. A Bayesian algorithm was used to cluster 190 L. melissa individuals based on 143 informative amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci. This method clearly differentiated L. m. samuelis and L. m. melissa. Thus, genomic divergence was greater between western L. m. samuelis populations and L. m. melissa populations than it was between western and eastern populations of L. m. samuelis. This supports the hypothesis that the presence of L. m. melissa mitochondrial haplotypes in western L. m. samuelis populations is the result of mitochondrial introgression. These data provide valuable information for conservation and management plans for the endangered L. m. samuelis, and illustrate the risks of using data from a single locus for diagnosing significant units of biodiversity for conservation.

AB The phylogeographic structure of the brown hare (Lepus europaeus) was studied by analysing mtDNA control region sequences of 98 individuals from continental and insular Greece, Bulgaria, Cyprus and northern Israel, together with 44 published sequences from Italy and central Europe. We found two distinct clades separated by an average nucleotide divergence of 6.6%, which may correspond to a Balkan and to an Asia Minor refugium. The estimated time of separation of the two clades was dated back to 105,000490,000 years ago. These two clades coexist in the area of northeastern Greece and Bulgaria, most likely as a result of a post-glacial northward expansion. Within the southern Balkan refughium, network analyses showed geographical structuring, which supports the hypothesis of several isolated Late Pleistocene populations. The central European and Italian populations appear to have originated from a non-detected northern Balkan population that was genetically closely related to some northern Greek populations,as a result of postglacial expansion, translocations or a combination of both. Moreover, several cases of ancient and recent translocations by humans were detected, especially for some island populations, while the eastern Aegean islands off the Asia Minor coast were most likely colonized naturally through Late Pleistocene land bridge connection. The genetic analysis presented here provided a framework for designing proper conservation and management guidelines for this species. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The typical antbirds (Thamnophilidae) form a monophyletic and diverse family of suboscine passerines that inhabit neotropical forests. However, the phylogenetic relationships within this assemblage are poorly understood. Herein, we present a hypothesis of the generic relationships of this group based on Bayesian inference analyses of two nuclear introns and the mitochondrial cytochrome beta gene. The level of phylogenetic congruence between the individual genes has been investigated utilizing Bayes factors. We also explore how changes in the substitution models affected the observed incongruence between partitions of our data set.
   Results: The phylogenetic analysis supports both novel relationships, as well as traditional groupings. Among the more interesting novel relationship suggested is that the Terenura antwrens, the wing-banded antbird (Myrmornis torquata), the spot-winged antshrike (Pygiptila stellaris) and the russet antshrike (Thamnistes anabatinus) are sisters to all other typical antbirds. The remaining genera fall into two major clades. The first includes antshrikes, antvireos and the Herpsilochmus antwrens, while the second clade consists of most antwren genera, the Myrmeciza antbirds, the "professional" ant-following antbirds, and allied species. Our results also support previously suggested polyphyly of Myrmotherula antwrens and Myrmeciza antbirds. The tests of phylogenetic incongruence, using Bayes factors, clearly suggests that allowing the gene partitions to have separate topology parameters clearly increased the model likelihood. However, changing a component of the nucleotide substitution model had much higher impact on the model likelihood.
   Conclusions: The phylogenetic results are in broad agreement with traditional classification of the typical antbirds, but some relationships are unexpected based on external morphology. In these cases their true affinities may have been obscured by convergent evolution and morphological adaptations to new habitats or food sources, and genera like Myrmeciza antbirds and the Myrmotherula antwrens obviously need taxonomic revisions. Although, Bayes factors seem promising for evaluating the relative contribution of components to an evolutionary model, the results suggests that even if strong evidence for a model allowing separate topology parameters is found, this might not mean strong evidence for separate gene phylogenies, as long as vital components of the substitution model are still missing.

AB Metapopulations may be very sensitive to global climate change, particularly if temperature and precipitation change rapidly. We present an analysis of the role of climate and other factors in determining metapopulation structure based on presence and absence data. We compared existing and historical population distributions of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) to determine whether regional climate patterns were correlated with local extinction. To examine all mountain ranges known to hold or to have held desert bighorn populations in California and score for variables describing climate, metapopulation dynamics, human impacts, and other environmental factors, we used a geographic information system (GIS) and paper maps. We used logistic regression and hierarchical partitioning to assess the relationship among these variables and the current status of each population (extinct or extant). Parameters related to climate-elevation, precipitation, and presence of dependable springs-were strongly correlated with population persistence in the twentieth century. Populations inhabiting lower, drier mountain ranges were more likely to go extinct. The presence of domestic sheep grazing allotments was negatively correlated with population persistence. We used conditional extinction probabilities generated by the logistic-regression model to rank native, naturally recolonized, and reintroduced populations by vulnerability to extinction under several climate-change scenarios. Thus risk of extinction in metapopulations can be evaluated for global-climate-change scenarios even when few demographic data are available.

AB A model of dynamics of leaves and nitrogen is developed to predict the effect of environmental and ecophysiological factors on the structure and photosynthesis of a plant canopy. In the model, leaf area in the canopy increases by the production of new leaves, which is proportional to the canopy photosynthetic rate, with canopy nitrogen increasing with uptake of nitrogen from soil. Then the optimal leaf area index (LAI; leaf area per ground area) that maximizes canopy photosynthesis is calculated. If leaf area is produced in excess, old leaves are eliminated with their nitrogen as dead leaves. Consequently, a new canopy having an optimal LAI and an optimal amount of nitrogen is obtained. Repeating these processes gives canopy growth. The model provides predictions of optimal LAI, canopy photosynthetic rates, leaf life span, nitrogen use efficiency, and also the responses of these factors to changes in nitrogen and light availability. Canopies are predicted to have a larger LAI and a higher canopy photosynthetic rate at a steady state under higher nutrient and/or light availabilities. Effects of species characteristics, such as photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency and leaf mass per area, are also evaluated. The model predicts many empirically observed patterns for ecophysiological traits across species.

AB A field experiment was conducted on rice (Oryza sativa L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) during rainy and winter seasons of 1994-95 in a clay loam soil (Typic Ustochrept) at the experimental farm of Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, India. The objectives were to study the influence of different green manuring (Sesbania rostrata, Sesbania aculeata, green gram (Vigna radiata) residues) and in combination with different levels of nitrogen (0, 60, and 120 kg N ha(-1)) on physical properties, organic matter and total nitrogen contents of soil and on root growth and spectral response of rice and wheat crop. The organic matter and total soil nitrogen concentrations were found to be higher under green manuring treated plots than summer fallow. The magnitude of reduction in bulk density due to green manuring over fallow was 0.03-0.07 Mg m(-3) in 0-15 cm soil layer and 0.05-0.09 Mg m(-3) in 15-30 cm soil layer during the growth of rice and wheat. Green manuring improved the soil physical environments as was evident from higher values of mean weight diameter and saturated hydraulic conductivity than fallow. The better physical and chemical environment in Sesbania (S) and green gram residue incorporated plots influenced higher Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) than under fallow. The NDVI attained peak values at 62 days after transplanting of rice and 90 days after sowing of wheat. The root length density (RLD) and yields were higher in green manure plots than in fallow both in rice as well as in succeeding wheat crop. In all cases, in both rice and wheat the application of 120 kg N ha(-1) treatment resulted in higher RLD than 60 kg N ha(-1) and no nitrogen treatments. Poor soil conditions were mainly responsible for restricted root growth and its distribution in surface soil layer in summer fallow plots. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Salinity is a major problem in many regions of Australia, and is predicted to get considerably worse over the next 30 - 50 years. Most effort has focused on the terrestrial environment, and specifically on the loss of productive agricultural land. Increased salinity can also result in unwanted changes to aquatic ecosystems in rivers, streams and particularly wetlands.
   This paper first reviews the importance of assessing risks from salinity increases in a catchment context, and then introduces a disturbance - response conceptual model to assist with the understanding of such situations. Two factors are shown to be particularly important in assessing which freshwater systems will be most susceptible to increases in salinity - the location of the systems in the landscape, and the current ecological condition of the system. The resilience of an ecosystem to salinity disturbances is shown to be a useful concept which with further knowledge may be incorporated into risk- assessment approaches.
   The development of a new ecological risk assessment approach for assessing risks to aquatic systems in the Goulburn - Broken catchment from increases in salinity over the medium ( 20 years) and long ( 100 years) term is reported. The risks to the biota in Hughes Creek, a tributary of the Goulburn River, are assessed by using a probabilistic approach. Current salinity levels in the creek present a low risk to the biota.
   Finally, the paper addresses the challenge of making the ecological risk assessment method more quantitative by discussing the following two key aspects: how to better quantify the linkages between the key stressors and the biotic components, and how to better handle uncertainties.

AB Aim The study examined the potential for change in biome representation within Canada's national park system under multiple climate change scenarios and subsequent potential vulnerabilities in Parks Canada policy and planning frameworks.
   Location The study was conducted for Canada's 39 national parks.
   Methods The vegetation change scenarios were based on modelling results from the BIOME3 and MAPSS equilibrium process-based global vegetation models (GVM), run with multiple doubled-CO2 climate change scenarios. The six vegetation distribution scenarios were calculated at 0.5degrees latitude-longitude resolution and the boundaries of 39 national parks superimposed in a geographic information system (GIS). Park management plans and other planning documents were also reviewed as part of the analysis.
   Results The proportional distribution of biomes in Canada's national park system was very similar (within 3% of area for each biome) using BIOME3 and MAPSS under the current climate. Regardless of the GVM and climate change scenario used, the modelling results suggest the potential for substantial change in the biome representation in Canada's national park system. In five of six vegetation scenarios, a novel biome type appeared in more than half of the national parks and greater than 50% of all vegetation grid boxes changed biome type. The proportional representation of tundra and taiga/tundra in the national park system declined in each of the vegetation scenarios, while more southerly biomes (temperate forests and savanna/woodland) increased (in some scenarios doubling to quadrupling). Results for boreal forest varied among the climate change scenarios. A range of potential vulnerabilities in existing policy and planning frameworks were identified, including the national park system plan, individual park objectives, and fire and exotic species management plans.
   Conclusions Climate change represents an unprecedented challenge to Parks Canada and its ability to achieve its conservation mandate as presently legislated. Research is needed not only on ecosystem responses to climate change, but also on the capacity of conservation systems and agencies to adapt to climate change.

AB In the Linnaean system of classification, the generic status of a species is part of its binomial name, and it is therefore important that the classification at the level of genus is consistent at least in related groups of organisms. Using maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees constructed from a large number of complete or nearly complete mammalian cytochrome b sequences, I show that the distributions of intrageneric and intergeneric distances derived from these trees are clearly separated, which allows the limits for a more rational generic classification of mammals to be established. The analysis of genetic distances among hominids in this context provides strong support for the inclusion of humans and chimpanzees in the same genus. It is also of interest to decipher the main reasons for the possible biases in the mammalian classification. I found by correlation analysis that the classification of mammals of large body size tends to be oversplit, whereas that of small mammals has an excess of lumping, which may be a manifestation of the larger difficulty in finding diagnostic characters in the classification of small animals. In addition, and contrary to some previous observations, there is no correlation between body size and rate of cytochrome b evolution in mammals, which excludes the difference in evolutionary rates as the cause of the observed body size taxonomic bias.

AB Five-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings were grown in open-top chambers at ambient and elevated (ambient + 400 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2 concentrations. Net photosynthesis (A), specific leaf area (SLA) and concentrations of nitrogen (N), carbon (C), soluble sugars, starch and chlorophyll were measured in current-year and 1-year-old needles during the second year of CO2 enrichment. The elevated CO2 treatment stimulated photosynthetic rates when measured at the growth CO2 concentration, but decreased photosynthetic capacity compared with the ambient CO2 treatment. Acclimation to elevated CO2 involved decreases in carboxylation efficiency and RuBP regeneration capacity. Compared with the ambient CO2 treatment, elevated CO2 reduced light-saturated photosynthesis (when measured at 350 mu mol mol(-1) in both treatments) by 18 and 23% (averaged over the growing season) in current-year and 1-year-old needles, respectively. We observed significant interactive effects of CO2 treatment, needle age and time during the growing season on photosynthesis. Large seasonal variations in photosynthetic parameters were attributed to changes in needle chemistry, needle structure and feedbacks governed by whole-plant growth dynamics. Down-regulation of photosynthesis was probably a result of reduced N concentration on an area basis, although a downward shift in the relationship between photosynthetic parameters and N was also observed.

AB We tested whether the roe (gonads) of ''post-spawned'', green sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, from barren grounds could be enhanced in the field during summer. Experiments were initiated using a low roe-yielding (barren ground) population, which also served as a field control. Specifically, we determined the ability of naturally occurring macroalgae to increase roe yield and enhance roe color relative to field controls. Sixty experimental cages with algae and five test animals per cage (mean test diameter = 50.0 mm) were suspended along the seaward end of a commercial lobster impoundment on Beals Island, Maine, on 18 June 1996. Urchins were fed ad libitum all (mixed diet) or one of four species of macroalgae (Palmaria palmata, Alaria esculenta, Laminaria saccharina and Ulva lactuca). Four replicate cages of each algal treatment and 20 individuals from the control population were sampled (without replacement) every 3 weeks until 20 August. This design permitted the use of orthogonal contrasts in both one- and two-factor ANOVAs. These analyses revealed significant enhancement, relative to controls, of both color and roe yield (gonad index doubled or tripled within 3 months). Algal-fed animals attained a mean gonad index greater than 10%, the minimum commercial standard in Maine, while field populations ranged from 4% to 6%. These analyses revealed differential roe enhancement among palatable seaweeds. The red alga, P. palmata, induced the quickest and highest response. singly, among the four algae tested. Roe production on P. palmata was generally higher, but similar to that of the mixed dirt. The two kelp species. A. esculenta and L. saccharina, consistently produced the lowest yields. Roe yields were correlated with protein levels in the algae. Our study also provides some insight into seasonal allocation of energy and nutrients into gonadal tissue. These data show that off-season allocation to gonadal tissue is biologically feasible in the absence of photoperiodic manipulation and that summer enhancement could be used to meet the off-season (August) market demand Tol roe in Asia.

AB To test the hypothesis that in temperate deciduous trees acclimation to potentially damaging high irradiances occurs via long-term adjustments in foliar photosynthetic capacity, and short-term changes in xanthophyll cycle pool size in response to weather fluctuations, nitrogen concentration and pigment composition were examined along a canopy light gradient in three species - Betula pendula, Populus tremula and Tilia cordata (from most shade intolerant to tolerant), and foliage photosynthetic potentials in P. tremula and T. cordata. Integrated quantum flux density (Q(i)) incident on leaves was estimated with a method combining hemispherical photography and light measurements with quantum sensors made over the growing season. Long- and short-term light indices - average total seasonal daily integrated quantum flux density (T-s, mol m(-2) d(-1)) and that of the 3 d preceding foliage sampling (T-3d) - were calculated for each sampled leaf. In addition to total integrated quantum flux density, the part of ei attributable to direct flux was also computed. Strong linear relationships between the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport per area (J(max)(a)), estimated from in situ measurements of effective quantum yield of photosystem II (PS II), and ei averaged over the season and over the preceding 3 d were found for all studied species. However, the major determinant of J(max)(a), the product of electron transport capacity per leaf dry mass (J(max)(m)) and leaf dry mass per area (M-A), was M-A rather than J(max)(m), which was relatively constant along the light gradient. There was evidence that J(max)(a) is more tightly related to T-s, which characterizes the light climate during foliar development, than to short-term integrated light, possibly because there is little flexibility in adjustments in M-A after the completion of foliar growth, Leaf chlorophyll concentrations and the investment of leaf nitrogen in chlorophyll (Chl/N) were negatively related to Q(i) - an investment pattern which improves light harvesting in low light. Xanthophyll cycle pool size (VAZ, violaxanthin + antheraxanthin + zeaxanthin) either expressed per unit chlorophyll (VAZ/Chl) or as a fraction of total carotenoids (VAZ/Car) increased with increasing ei in all species. However, contrary to J(max)(a), if tended to correlate more strongly with short-term than with long-term average integrated light. There were few interspecific differences in J(max)(a), Chl/N, VAZ/Chl and VAZ/Car when the variability in light level incident to the leaves was accounted for, indicating that the foliage of both shade-intolerant and -tolerant temperate tree species possesses considerable phenotypic flexibility, Collectively these results support the view that rapid adjustment of the xanthophyll cycle pool size provides an important means for acclimation to light fluctuations in a time scale of days, during which the potential for photosynthetic quenching of excitation energy is not likely to change appreciably.

AB The genetic population structure of coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki) in Washington state was investigated by analysis of variation in allele frequencies at six highly polymorphic microsatellite loci for 13 anadromous populations, along with one outgroup population from the Yellowstone subspecies (O. clarki bouvieri) (mean heterozygosity = 67%; average number of alleles per locus = 24). Tests for genetic differentiation revealed highly significant differences in genotypic frequencies for pairwise comparisons between all populations within geographical regions and overall population subdivision was substantial (F-ST = 0.121, R-ST = 0.093), with 44.6% and 55.4% of the among-population diversity being attributable to differences between streams (F-SR = 0.054) and between regions (F-RT = 0.067), respectively. Analysis of genetic distances and geographical distances did not support a simple model of isolation by distance for these populations. With one exception, neighbour-joining dendrograms from the Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards' chord distances and maximum likelihood algorithms clustered populations by physiogeographic region, although overall bootstrap support was relatively low (53%). Our results suggest that coastal cutthroat trout populations are ultimately structured genetically at the level of individual streams. It appears that the dynamic balance between gene flow and genetic drift in the subspecies favours a high degree of genetic differentiation and population subdivision with the simultaneous maintenance of high heterozygosity levels within local populations. Results are discussed in terms of coastal cutthroat trout ecology along with implications for the designation of evolutionarily significant units pursuant to the US Endangered Species Act of 1973 and analogous conservation units.

SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY

DT Article
ID ORYZOMYS-ARGENTATUS; CONSERVATION
AB The U.S. Endangered Species Act grants protection to species, subspecies, and ''distinct population segments'' of vertebrate species. Historically, Congress included distinct population segments into endangered species legislation to to enable the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to implement a flexible and pragmatic approach in listing populations of vertebrate species. Recently the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service have proposed a policy that would narrowly define distinct population segments as evolutionarily significant units based on morphological and genetic distinctiveness between populations. Historically, the power to list species or populations as distinct population segments has been used to tailor management practices to unique circumstances; grant varied levels of protection in different parts of a species' range; protect species from extinction in significant portions of their ranges as well as to protect populations that are unique evolutionary entities. A strict redefinition of distinct population segments as evolutionarily significant units will compromise management efforts because the role of demographic and behavioral data will be reduced. Furthermore, strictly cultural, economic, or geographic justifications for listing populations as threatened or endangered will be greatly curtailed.

AB Grazers have been shown to affect assemblages of species in many habitats. Here we studied the effects of the gastropod grazers, Austrocochlea porcata and Bembicium auratum, on intertidal estuarine assemblages in a sheltered bay in New South Wales, Australia. We examined the effects of gastropods on individual species and on the assemblage as a whole. The multivariate response was compared with data on succession in these assemblages to estimate potential effects of grazers on succession. The experiment was repeated several times to determine the generality of grazer effects in the light of possible variation in the timing or intensity of recruitment. There were different responses of individual species to the presence of grazers. Grazers reduced the abundance of ephemeral algal species, bryozoans, copepods, insect larvae and Balanus spp, barnacles. They had a positive effect on oysters and spirorbids and no effect on the barnacles Elminius covertus and Hexaminius spp. These effects were consistent through time. Multivariate analyses confirmed that grazers caused significant changes to whole assemblages and that these effects were far-reaching and not only caused by changes to algal species. The removal of grazers appeared to neither speed up nor slow down succession, but rather caused a completely different assemblage to develop. Apparent important mechanisms affecting the composition of animal species when grazers were removed included accumulation of sediments and detritus and preemption of space by algae.

   RELATION TO BOREAL FOREST SUCCESSION
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Sympatric forest grouse in intensively managed conifer-dominated forests of the southern boreal zone in Sweden occupied different forest successional stages. Black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) selected forest stands 0 - 20 years old, hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia) selected those 20 - 50 years old, and capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) selected those greater-than-or-equal-to 90 years old. Moreover, hazel grouse also selected stands with 1 - 10% deciduous trees, whereas capercaillie selected stands with no deciduous trees. The relative numbers of each grouse species were similar in two areas of intensively managed industrial forest, but differed in an area where forestry was less intensive and where forests had old-growth characteristics, i.e., they were old and multilayered. Black grouse dominated in the intensively managed areas, whereas hazel grouse dominated in the less intensively managed area. We suggest that under natural conditions, black grouse inhabited the early-successional stages of forest following burns, hazel grouse inhabited the next, denser, successional stage and also old-growth spruce-dominated forests in fire refugia, and capercaillie inhabited stands of open, old, pine-dominated forest maintained by forest fire. The black grouse appears to be preadapted to the modern system of clearcut forest management. However, this system is clearly detrimental to the hazel grouse and capercaillie. To maintain all three species in a managed landscape, forest managers must strive to mimic more closely the natural variation in types and sizes of forest stands.

AB Climate-change adaptation focuses on conducting and translating research to minimize the dire impacts of anthropogenic climate change, including threats to biodiversity and human welfare. One adaptation strategy is to focus conservation on climate-change refugia (that is, areas relatively buffered from contemporary climate change over time that enable persistence of valued physical, ecological, and sociocultural resources). In this Special Issue, recent methodological and conceptual advances in refugia science will be highlighted. Advances in this emerging subdiscipline are improving scientific understanding and conservation in the face of climate change by considering scale and ecosystem dynamics, and looking beyond climate exposure to sensitivity and adaptive capacity. We propose considering refugia in the context of a multifaceted, long-term, network-based approach, as temporal and spatial gradients of ecological persistence that can act as "slow lanes" rather than areas of stasis. After years of discussion confined primarily to the scientific literature, researchers and resource managers are now working together to put refugia conservation into practice.

AB Temperate reefs from around the world are becoming tropicalised, as warm-water species shift their distribution towards the poles in response to warming. This is already causing profound shifts in dominant foundation species and associated ecological communities as canopy seaweeds such as kelp are replaced by tropical species. Here, we argue that the cascading consequences of tropicalisation for the ecosystem properties and functions of warming temperate reefs depend largely on the taxa that end up dominating the seafloor. We put forward three potential tropicalisation trajectories, that differ in whether seaweeds, turf or corals become dominant. We highlight potential gains to certain ecosystem functions for some tropicalisation endpoints. For example, local benthic fish productivity may increase in some tropicalised reefs as a higher proportion of primary production is directly consumed, but this will be at the expense of other functions such as carbon export. We argue that understanding these changes in flows of energy and materials is essential to formulate new conservation strategies and management approaches that minimise risks as well as capture potential opportunities. Regardless of which trajectory is followed, tropicalised systems represent largely novel ecosystem configurations. This poses major challenges to traditional conservation and environmental management approaches, which typically focus on maintaining or returning species to particular locations. We outline management practices that may either mitigate predicted structural and functional changes or make the most of potential new opportunities in tropicalised reefs. These include marine protected areas to increase resilience and connectivity, the development of new fisheries that target range-expanding invaders, and assisted evolution and migration strategies to facilitate the dominance of large habitat formers like corals or seaweeds. We highlight important ecological and ethical challenges associated with developing novel approaches to manage tropicalised reefs, which may need to become increasingly interventionist. As technological innovations continue to emerge, having clear goals and considering the ethics surrounding interventions among the broader community are essential steps to successfully develop novel management approaches. A plain language summary is available for this article.

AB 1. Rewilding, here defined as "the reorganisation of biota and ecosystem processes to set an identified social-ecological system on a preferred trajectory, leading to the self-sustaining provision of ecosystem services with minimal ongoing management," is increasingly considered as an environmental management option, with potential for enhancing both biodiversity and ecosystem services.
   2. Despite burgeoning interest in the concept, there are uncertainties and difficulties associated with the practical implementation of rewilding projects, while the evidence available for facilitating sound decision-making for rewilding initiatives remains elusive.
   3. We identify five key research areas to inform the implementation of future rewilding initiatives: increased understanding of the links between actions and impacts; improved risk assessment processes, through, for example, better definition and quantification of ecological risks; improved predictions of spatio-temporal variation in potential economic costs and associated benefits; better identification and characterisation of the likely social impacts of a given rewilding project; and facilitated emergence of a comprehensive and practical framework for the monitoring and evaluation of rewilding projects.
   4. Policy implications. Environmental legislation is commonly based on a "compositionalist" paradigm itself predicated on the preservation of historical conditions characterised by the presence of particular species assemblages and habitat types. However, global environmental change is driving some ecosystems beyond their limits so that restoration to historical benchmarks or modern likely equivalents may no longer be an option. This means that the current environmental policy context could present barriers to the broad implementation of rewilding projects. To progress the global rewilding agenda, a better appreciation of current policy opportunities and constraints is required. This, together with a clear definition of rewilding and a scientifically robust rationale for its local implementation, is a prerequisite to engage governments in revising legislation where required to facilitate the operationalisation of rewilding.

AB Leaf turgor loss point (pi(tlp)) indicates the capacity of a plant to maintain cell turgor pressure during dehydration, which has been proven to be strongly predictive of the plant response to drought. In this study, we compiled a data set of a pi(tlp) for 1752 woody plant individuals belonging to 389 species from nine major woody biomes in China, along with reduced sample size of hydraulic and leaf carbon economics data. We aimed to investigate the variation of pi(tlp) across biomes varying in water availability. We also tested two hypotheses: (i) pi(tlp) predicts leaf hydraulic safety margins and (ii) it is correlated with leaf carbon economics traits. Our results showed that there was a positive relationship between pi(tlp )and aridity index: biomes from humid regions had less negative values than those from arid regions. This supports the idea that pi(tlp )may reflect drought tolerance at the scale of woody biomes. As expected, pi(tlp) was significantly positively correlated with leaf hydraulic safety margins that varied significantly across biomes, indicating that this trait may be useful in modelling changes of forest components in response to increasing drought. Moreover, pi(tlp) was correlated with a suite of coordinated hydraulic and economics traits; therefore, it can be used to predict the position of a given species along the 'fast-slow' whole-plant economics spectrum. This study expands our understanding of the biological significance of pi(tlp )not only in drought tolerance, but also in the plant economics spectrum.

AB Limited conservation resources mean that management decisions are often made on the basis of scarce biological information. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed as a way to improve the representation of biodiversity features in conservation planning, but the extent to which SDMs are used in conservation planning is unclear. We reviewed the peer-reviewed and grey conservation planning literature to explore if and how SDMs are used in conservation prioritisations. We use text mining to analyse 641 peer-reviewed conservation prioritisation articles published between 2006 and 2012 and find that only 10% of atticles specifically mention SDMs in the abstract, title, and/or keywords. We use topic modelling of all peer-reviewed articles plus a detailed review of a random sample of 40 peer-reviewed and grey literature plans to evaluate factors that might influence whether decision-makers use SDMs to inform prioritisations. Our results reveal that habitat maps, expert-elicited species distributions, or metrics representing landscape processes (e.g. connectivity surfaces) are used more often than SDMs as biodiversity surrogates in prioritisations. We find four main reasons for using such alternatives in place of SDMs: (i) insufficient species occurrence data (particularly for threatened species); (ii) lack of biologically-meaningful predictor data relevant to the spatial scale of planning; (iii) low concern about uncertainty in biodiversity data; and (iv) a focus on accounting for ecological, evolutionary, and cumulative threatening processes that requires alternative data to be collected. Our results suggest that SDMs are perceived as best-suited to dealing with traditional reserve selection objectives and accounting for uncertainties such as future climate change or mapping accuracy. The majority of planners in both the grey and peer-reviewed literature appear to trade off the benefits of using SDMs for the benefits of including information on multiple threats and processes. We suggest that increasing the complexity of species distribution modelling methods might have little impact on their use in conservation planning without a corresponding increase in research aiming at better incorporation of a range of ecological, evolutionary, and threatening processes.

AB Conservation activities in fragmented landscapes have largely focused on keeping remaining large patches intact, often disregarding the increasingly important role of smaller patches in the conservation of remaining vegetation. As habitat loss proceeds in fragmented landscapes, there is an increasing need to measure the relative contribution of all patches (large and small) to overall ecosystem persistence, in a way that helps deliver effective conservation strategies aimed at preventing the death of ecosystems by a thousand cuts. Using Australian vegetation communities as a case study, we calculated the historical change in the contribution of patches below different sized thresholds to overall extent. We introduced a new patch assessment metric based on the Gini coefficient that indicates how unequal the distribution of patch sizes is relative to historical distributions. At least 22% of major vegetation communities in Australia have >50% of their remaining extent in patches <1000ha. Loss does not always match fragmentation status: though some vegetation communities are exposed to the double jeopardy of high loss and high fragmentation, others are far more affected by fragmentation than loss of extent. For some communities, actions focused on protecting large patches are critical but for many others, protecting and managing small patches is crucial for community persistence.Synthesis and applications. Arbitrary patch size thresholds for permitting native vegetation clearing are dangerous for ecosystems whose distribution is now restricted to small patches. We recommend that clearing thresholds be scaled to reflect the fact that some ecosystems are more dominated by small patches than others. With a renewed focus on formally assessing the threat status of ecosystems as well as species, ecosystem accounts such as those demonstrated in this study are the first step to reliably assessing vulnerability. Measures of ecosystem vulnerability that only consider the extent of vegetation loss and not the size of remaining patches are likely to be ineffective for impact assessment, conservation planning and preventing ecosystem loss.

AB Range shifts are among the most ubiquitous ecological responses to anthropogenic climate change and have large consequences for ecosystems. Unfortunately, the ecophysiological forces that constrain range boundaries are poorly understood, making it difficult to mechanistically project range shifts. To explore the physiological mechanisms by which drought stress controls dry range boundaries in trees, we quantified elevational variation in drought tolerance and in drought avoidance-related functional traits of a widespread gymnosperm (ponderosa pine - Pinus ponderosa) and angiosperm (trembling aspen - Populus tremuloides) tree species in the southwestern USA. Specifically, we quantified tree-to-tree variation in growth, water stress (predawn and midday xylem tension), drought avoidance traits (branch conductivity, leaf/needle size, tree height, leaf area-to-sapwood area ratio), and drought tolerance traits (xylem resistance to embolism, hydraulic safety margin, wood density) at the range margins and range center of each species. Although water stress increased and growth declined strongly at lower range margins of both species, ponderosa pine and aspen showed contrasting patterns of clinal trait variation. Trembling aspen increased its drought tolerance at its dry range edge by growing stronger but more carbon dense branch and leaf tissues, implying an increased cost of growth at its range boundary. By contrast, ponderosa pine showed little elevational variation in drought-related traits but avoided drought stress at low elevations by limiting transpiration through stomatal closure, such that its dry range boundary is associated with limited carbon assimilation even in average climatic conditions. Thus, the same climatic factor (drought) may drive range boundaries through different physiological mechanisms - a result that has important implications for process-based modeling approaches to tree biogeography. Further, we show that comparing intraspecific patterns of trait variation across ranges, something rarely done in a range-limit context, helps elucidate a mechanistic understanding of range constraints.

AB Taking into account the continuous increase in freshwater introductions, and to support the recent European legislation on invasive alien species, the identification of priority pathways and gateways of introductions is of utmost importance to develop adequate control strategies. The aim of this paper was to analyse the main pathways and gateways of introductions of freshwater alien species in Europe. Based on a thorough review of the scientific and grey literature, information on pathways, country and year of initial introduction of all freshwater alien species in Europe, was retrieved. The spatial and temporal patterns and trends of biological invasions in freshwater ecosystems in Europe, in relation to different pathways, were assessed. Our results pinpoint the major importance of aquaculture, pet/aquarium trade and stocking activities as pathways of introduction of freshwater alien species in Europe. For species native to some European countries, shipping and inland canals were the most important pathways, highly responsible for the entry of many harmful species. Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy were the main entry gateways of freshwater alien species in Europe. We found a geographical pattern related to some pathways of introduction in Europe: introductions through inland canals were concentrated in Central/North-eastern Europe, while introductions through pet/terrarium/aquarium trade were mainly observed in Central/Western Europe. While Chordata species entered Europe mainly through the three major above mentioned pathways, many harmful Arthropoda and Mollusca entered through shipping and inland canals. The information gathered in this study clearly indicates the entry routes that should be prioritised by Member States, for which stronger control and management actions should be implemented and prevention efforts concentrated under the scope of the related new EU Regulation.

AB In the current literature, the impact of nano-particles (NPs) on growth of higher plants has scantly been reported. An investigation was carried out to study the effect of zinc oxide nano-particles (<100 nm) on growth of maize (Zea mays L.) plant, as one of the major agricultural crops, in a solution culture system. Various concentrations of zinc (Zn) were applied through nano-zinc oxide (ZnO) particles (<100 nm) in suspension form and in ionic form through zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) salt in Hoagland solution culture. Experimental results showed that nano zinc oxide particles could enhance and maintain the growth of maize plant as well as conventional Zn fertilizer (as ZnSO4). The plant parameters like plant height, root length, root volume, and dry matter weight were all improved due to application of zinc oxide nano-particle. These findings indicate that plant roots might have the unique mechanism of assimilating nano-Zn and using for its growth and development. Different enzymatic activities were also studied and experimental results revealed that nano-ZnO particles (<100 nm) also governed the enzymatic activity of maize plant. A separate laboratory experiment was also carried out to characterize the zinc oxide nano particle for its size, zeta potential, etc.

AB Empirical phylogeographic studies have progressively sampled greater numbers of loci over time, in part motivated by theoretical papers showing that estimates of key demographic parameters improve as the number of loci increases. Recently, next-generation sequencing has been applied to questions about organismal history, with the promise of revolutionizing the field. However, no systematic assessment of how phylogeographic data sets have changed over time with respect to overall size and information content has been performed. Here, we quantify the changing nature of these genetic data sets over the past 20years, focusing on papers published in Molecular Ecology. We found that the number of independent loci, the total number of alleles sampled and the total number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per data set has improved over time, with particularly dramatic increases within the past 5years. Interestingly, uniparentally inherited organellar markers (e.g. animal mitochondrial and plant chloroplast DNA) continue to represent an important component of phylogeographic data. Single-species studies (cf. comparative studies) that focus on vertebrates (particularly fish and to some extent, birds) represent the gold standard of phylogeographic data collection. Based on the current trajectory seen in our survey data, forecast modelling indicates that the median number of SNPs per data set for studies published by the end of the year 2016 may approach similar to 20000. This survey provides baseline information for understanding the evolution of phylogeographic data sets and underscores the fact that development of analytical methods for handling very large genetic data sets will be critical for facilitating growth of the field.

AB Light energy absorbed by chloroplasts drives photosynthesis. When absorbed light is in excess, the thermal dissipation systems of excess energy are induced and the photosynthetic electron flow is regulated, both contributing to suppression of reactive oxygen species production and photodamages. Various regulation mechanisms of the photosynthetic electron flow and energy dissipation systems have been revealed. However, most of such knowledge has been obtained by the experiments conducted under controlled conditions with constant light, whereas natural light condition is drastically fluctuated. To understand photosynthesis in nature, we need to clarify not only the mechanisms that raise photosynthetic efficiency but those for photoprotection in fluctuating light. Although these mechanisms appear to be well balanced, regulatory mechanisms achieving the balance is little understood. Recently, some pioneering studies have provided new insight into the regulatory mechanisms in fluctuating light. In this review, firstly, the possible mechanisms involved in regulation of the photosynthetic electron flow in fluctuating light are presented. Next, we introduce some recent studies focusing on the photosynthetic electron flow in fluctuating light. Finally, we discuss how plants effectively cope with fluctuating light showing our recent results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   INFERENCE
AB Background: Accurate model comparison requires extensive computation times, especially for parameter-rich models of sequence evolution. In the Bayesian framework, model selection is typically performed through the evaluation of a Bayes factor, the ratio of two marginal likelihoods (one for each model). Recently introduced techniques to estimate (log) marginal likelihoods, such as path sampling and stepping-stone sampling, offer increased accuracy over the traditional harmonic mean estimator at an increased computational cost. Most often, each model's marginal likelihood will be estimated individually, which leads the resulting Bayes factor to suffer from errors associated with each of these independent estimation processes.
   Results: We here assess the original 'model-switch' path sampling approach for direct Bayes factor estimation in phylogenetics, as well as an extension that uses more samples, to construct a direct path between two competing models, thereby eliminating the need to calculate each model's marginal likelihood independently. Further, we provide a competing Bayes factor estimator using an adaptation of the recently introduced stepping-stone sampling algorithm and set out to determine appropriate settings for accurately calculating such Bayes factors, with context-dependent evolutionary models as an example. While we show that modest efforts are required to roughly identify the increase in model fit, only drastically increased computation times ensure the accuracy needed to detect more subtle details of the evolutionary process.
   Conclusions: We show that our adaptation of stepping-stone sampling for direct Bayes factor calculation outperforms the original path sampling approach as well as an extension that exploits more samples. Our proposed approach for Bayes factor estimation also has preferable statistical properties over the use of individual marginal likelihood estimates for both models under comparison. Assuming a sigmoid function to determine the path between two competing models, we provide evidence that a single well-chosen sigmoid shape value requires less computational efforts in order to approximate the true value of the (log) Bayes factor compared to the original approach. We show that the (log) Bayes factors calculated using path sampling and stepping-stone sampling differ drastically from those estimated using either of the harmonic mean estimators, supporting earlier claims that the latter systematically overestimate the performance of high-dimensional models, which we show can lead to erroneous conclusions. Based on our results, we argue that highly accurate estimation of differences in model fit for high-dimensional models requires much more computational effort than suggested in recent studies on marginal likelihood estimation.

AB Alien insects are increasingly being dispersed around the world through international trade, causing a multitude of negative environmental impacts and billions of dollars in economic losses annually. Border controls form the last line of defense against invasions, whereby inspectors aim to intercept and stop consignments that are contaminated with harmful alien insects. In Europe, member states depend on one another to prevent insect introductions by operating a first point of entry rule - controlling goods only when they initially enter the continent. However, ensuring consistency between border control points is difficult because there exists no optimal inspection strategy. For the first time, we developed a method to quantify the volume of agricultural trade that should be inspected for quarantine insects at border control points in Europe, based on global agricultural trade of over 100 million distinct origin-commodity-species-destination pathways. This metric was then used to evaluate the performance of existing border controls, as measured by border interception results in Europe between 2003 and 2007. Alarmingly, we found significant gaps between the trade pathways that should be inspected and actual number of interceptions. Moreover, many of the most likely introduction pathways yielded none or very few insect interceptions, because regular interceptions are only made on only a narrow range of pathways. European countries with gaps in border controls have been invaded by higher numbers of quarantine alien insect species, indicating the importance of proper inspections to prevent insect invasions. Equipped with an optimal inspection strategy based on the underlying risks of trade, authorities globally will be able to implement more effective and consistent border controls.

AB In many developing regions of Melanesia, fishers' traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) has been integrated with western science and management knowledge (SMK) to generate innovative and effective fisheries management. Previous research suggests that three factors initiate this process: depleted fishery stocks, limited SMK, and ownership of resources by local communities. In other contexts the extent of power-sharing through comanagement, and the cultural significance of species may also be important determinants of knowledge integration. Here we assess the role of these factors in the application of TEK in the Torres Strait Islands, Australia, where commercial and subsistence fisheries are fundamental to the Indigenous Melanesian culture and livelihoods. In 2009 we surveyed fishery managers and scientists who revealed that TEK had only been recently and sparingly applied in four fisheries (turtle, dugong, lobster, and hand collectables), and only two of the seven species concerned had a combination of depleted stocks, low SMK, and high community ownership. Instead, comanagement characteristics and the cultural value of species were the primary determinants of TEK application. We suggest that turtles and dugong are cultural keystone species that simultaneously provide important ecosystem services to both islanders' livelihoods and international conservation interests. Combined with their ecological scale these species have catalyzed comanagement between indigenous and government stakeholders, precipitating the application of TEK in other fisheries of lesser cultural importance. We discuss modifications to governance required to enable knowledge integration to evolve further through adaptive comanagement, and its role in enhancing fisheries management and thus the resilience of the Torres Strait social-ecological system. Our study highlights the potential utility of cultural keystone species in stimulating cross-cultural resource governance in developed economies such as Australia.

AB Transcontinental dispersals by organisms usually represent improbable events that constitute a major challenge for biogeographers. By integrating molecular phylogeny, historical biogeography and palaeoecology, we test a bold hypothesis proposed by Vladimir Nabokov regarding the origin of Neotropical Polyommatus blue butterflies, and show that Beringia has served as a biological corridor for the dispersal of these insects from Asia into the New World. We present a novel method to estimate ancestral temperature tolerances using distribution range limits of extant organisms, and find that climatic conditions in Beringia acted as a decisive filter in determining which taxa crossed into the New World during five separate invasions over the past 11 Myr. Our results reveal a marked effect of the Miocene-Pleistocene global cooling, and demonstrate that palaeoclimatic conditions left a strong signal on the ecology of present-day taxa in the New World. The phylogenetic conservatism in thermal tolerances that we have identified may permit the reconstruction of the palaeoecology of ancestral organisms, especially mobile taxa that can easily escape from hostile environments rather than adapt to them.

AB P>1. Different grass species dominate grasslands fertilized with nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P), possibly due to the impact of N : P stoichiometry on competitive interactions. How species compete for nutrients, and whether the mechanisms are similar for N and P, is still not fully understood.
   2. We investigated whether the outcome of competition between Alopecurus pratensis and Agrostis capillaris depends on N : P stoichiometry, and on the ability to acquire supplied N or P. Monocultures and mixtures of the two species were grown in pots at nine combinations of N and P supply (N : P ratios 1 center dot 7, 15 and 135, all at three supply levels). After 3 months, we determined plant biomass, morphological traits and nutrient concentrations of plant tissues.
   3. N : P supply ratios had similar effects on the growth of the two species but contrasting effects on their competitive strength, as assessed by comparing growth in competition to growth in monoculture: Alopecurus was the stronger competitor under N limitation (N : P ratio 1 center dot 7), whereas Agrostis was an equal or stronger competitor under P limitation (N : P ratio 135). This result resembled patterns of species distribution observed in the field.
   4. The strong competitive response of Alopecurus at the low N : P supply ratio was associated with a high investment in root biomass and root length, and a high nitrogen productivity. The competitive response of Agrostis at the high N : P supply ratio was associated with low root mortality and high root phosphatase activity.
   5. Our results obtained under N limitation support the pre-emption theory in which plants with the highest root length are able to acquire more N from the soil than their competitors, and therefore can suppress their growth. Under P limitation, however, plant investment in root length could not explain competitor suppression. Here, other factors important in competition for P, such as mycorrhizal hyphal length, root longevity, or exudation rates of P releasing compounds, merit investigation.

AB The headwaters of karst rivers experience considerable hydrological variability, including spates and streambed drying. Extreme summer flooding on the River Lathkill (Derbyshire, UK) provided the opportunity to examine the invertebrate community response to unseasonal spate flows, flow recession and, at temporary sites, streambed drying. Invertebrates were sampled at sites with differing flow permanence regimes during and after the spates. Following streambed drying at temporary sites, dewatered surface sediments were investigated as a refugium for aquatic invertebrates. Experimental rehydration of these dewatered sediments was conducted to promote development of desiccation-tolerant life stages. At perennial sites, spate flows reduced invertebrate abundance and diversity, whilst at temporary sites, flow reactivation facilitated rapid colonisation of the surface channel by a limited number of invertebrate taxa. Following streambed drying, 38 taxa were recorded from the dewatered and rehydrated sediments, with Oligochaeta being the most abundant taxon and Chironomidae (Diptera) the most diverse. Experimental rehydration of dewatered sediments revealed the presence of additional taxa, including Stenophylax sp. (Trichoptera: Limnephilidae) and Nemoura sp. (Plecoptera: Nemouridae). The influence of flow permanence on invertebrate community composition was apparent despite the aseasonal high-magnitude flood events. Flow permanence was also critical in determining the community response to the spate flows. Following streambed drying at temporary sites, the surficial sediments overlying the karstic bedrock functioned as an effective refugium for several taxa. The development of aquatic insects following experimental rehydration indicated that these taxa survived in dewatered sediments as desiccation-resistant eggs.

AB One of the major concerns about global warming is the potential for an increase in decomposition and soil respiration rates, increasing CO2 emissions and creating a positive feedback between global warming and soil respiration. This is particularly important in ecosystems with large belowground biomass, such as grasslands where over 90% of the carbon is allocated belowground. A better understanding of the relative influence of climate and litter quality on litter decomposition is needed to predict these changes accurately in grasslands. The Long-Term Intersite Decomposition Experiment Team (LIDET) dataset was used to evaluate the influence of climatic variables (temperature, precipitation, actual evapotranspiration, and climate decomposition index), and litter quality (lignin content, carbon : nitrogen, and lignin : nitrogen ratios) on leaf and root decomposition in the US Great Plains. Wooden dowels were used to provide a homogeneous litter quality to evaluate the relative importance of above and belowground environments on decomposition. Contrary to expectations, temperature did not explain variation in root and leaf decomposition, whereas precipitation partially explained variation in root decomposition. Percent lignin was the best predictor of leaf and root decomposition. It also explained most variation in root decomposition in models which combined litter quality and climatic variables. Despite the lack of relationship between temperature and root decomposition, temperature could indirectly affect root decomposition through decreased litter quality and increased water deficits. These results suggest that carbon flux from root decomposition in grasslands would increase, as result of increasing temperature, only if precipitation is not limiting. However, where precipitation is limiting, increased temperature would decrease root decomposition, thus likely increasing carbon storage in grasslands. Under homogeneous litter quality, belowground decomposition was faster than aboveground and was best predicted by mean annual precipitation, which also suggests that the high moisture in soil accelerates decomposition belowground.

AB The Coral Triangle is the global center of marine biodiversity; however, its coral reefs arc, critically threatened. Because of The bipartite life history of many marine species with sedentary adults and dispersive pelagic larvae, designing effective marine protected areas requires an understanding of patterns of larval dispersal and connectivity among geographically discrete populations. We used mtDNA sequence data to examine patterns of genetic connectivity in the boring giant clam (Tridacna crocea) in an effort to guide conservation efforts within the Coral Triangle. We collected an approximately 485 base pair fragment of mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) from 414 individuals at 26 sites across Indonesia. Genetic structure was strong between regions (phi(ST) = 0.549, p < 0.00001) with 3 strongly supported clades: one restricted to western Sumatra, another distributed across central Indonesia, and a third limited to eastern Indonesia and Papua. Even within the single largest clade, small but significant genetic structure was documented (phi(ST) = 0.069, p < 0.00001), which indicates limited gene flow within and among phylogeographic regions. Significant patterns of isolation by distance indicated an average dispersal distance of only 25-50 km, which is far below dispersal predictions of 406-708 km derived from estimates of passive dispersal over 10 days via surface currents. The strong regional genetic structure we found indicates potent limits to genetic and demographic connectivity for this species throughout the Coral Triangle and provides a regional context for conservation planning. The recovery of 3 distinct evolutionarily significant units within a well-studied taxonomic group suggests that biodiversity in this region may be significantly underestimated and that Tridacna taxa may be more endangered than currently recognized.

AB Salt stress alters a wide array of plant metabolic mechanisms. Different strategies of the application of nutrients and phytohormones are required to overcome the adverse effects of salt stress. The main objective of the present study was to determine if added nitrogen (N) and gibberellin (GA(3)) in growth medium could alleviate the adverse effects of salt stress on plant metabolism. Two-week-old plants were fed with: (i) 0 mM NaCl + 0 mg N kg(-1) sand + 0 M GA(3) (control), (ii) 100 mM NaCl + 0 mg N kg(-1) sand + 0 M GA(3), (iii) 0 mM NaCl + 40 mg N kg(-1) sand + 0 M GA(3), (iv) 0 mM NaCl + 0 mg N kg(-1) sand + 10(-5) M GA(3), (v) 100 mM NaCl + 40 mg N kg(-1) sand + 0 M GA(3), (vi) 100 mM NaCl + 0 mg N kg(-1) sand + 10(-5) M GA(3), (vii) 100 mM NaCl + 40 mg N kg(-1) sand + 10(-5) M GA(3). Growth and physio-biochemical attributes i.e. shoot length, leaf area, fresh weight, dry weight, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, malondialdehyde concentration, electrolyte leakage, total chlorophyll concentration, nitrate reductase and carbonic anhydrase activities, proline and glycinebetaine concentration, leaf - N, potassium (K) and sodium (Na) concentration and K/Na ratio were affected by NaCl treatment. But application of N or GA(3) alone as well as in combination proved beneficial in alleviating the adverse effects of salt stress on these growth and physio-biochemical parameters. However, N applied with GA(3) proved more effective than N and GA(3) applied alone. The results revealed that combined application of N and GA(3) may ameliorate most of the attributes and prove to be a physiological remedy to increase the tolerance against the ill effects of salt stress in Brassica.

AB DNA barcoding has been touted as a program that will efficiently and relatively cheaply inform on biological diversity; yet many exemplars purporting to demonstrate the efficacy of the method have been undertaken by its principal proponents. Critics of DNA barcoding identify insufficient within-taxon sampling coupled with the knowledge that levels of haplotypic paraphyly are rather high as key reasons to be sceptical of the value of an exclusively DNA-based taxonomic. Here I applied a DNA barcoding approach using mtDNA sequences from the cytochrome oxidase I gene to examine diversity in a group of endemic New Zealand grasshoppers belonging to the genus Sigaus. The mtDNA data revealed high genetic distances among individuals of a single morpho-species, but this diversity was geographically partitioned. Phylogenetic analysis supported at least four haplogroups within one species (Sigaus australis) but paraphyly of this species with respect to several others. In some instances two morphologically and ecologically distinct species shared identical mtDNA haplotypes. The mismatch of genealogy and taxonomy revealed in the Sigaus australis complex indicates that, if used in isolation, DNA barcoding data can be highly misleading about biodiversity. Furthermore, failure to take into account evidence from natural history and morphology when utilizing DNA barcoding will tend to conceal the underlying evolutionary processes associated with speciation.

AB Numerous models for predicting species distribution have been developed for conservation purposes. Most of them make use of environmental data (e.g., climate, topography, land use) at a coarse grid resolution (often kilometres). Such approaches are useful for conservation policy issues including reserve-network selection. The efficiency of predictive models for species distribution is usually tested on the area for which they were developed. Although highly interesting from the point of view of conservation efficiency, transferability of such models to independent areas is still under debate. We tested the transferability of habitat-based predictive distribution models for two regionally threatened butterflies, the green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi) and the grayling (Hipparchia semele), within and among three nature reserves in northeastern Belgium. We built predictive models based on spatially detailed maps of area-wide distribution and density of ecological resources. We used resources directly related to ecological functions (host plants, nectar sources, shelter microclimate) rather than environmental surrogate variables. We obtained models that performed well with few resource variables. All models were transferable-although to different degrees-among the independent areas within the same broad geographical region. We argue that habitat models based on essential functional resources could transfer better in space than models that use indirect environmental variables. Because functional variables can easily be interpreted and even be directly affected by terrain managers, these models can be useful tools to guide species-adapted reserve management.

AB The badger, Meles meles, is a widely distributed mustelid in Eurasia and shows large geographic variability in morphological characters whose evolutionary significance is unclear and needs to be contrasted with molecular data. We sequenced 512 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region in 115 Eurasian badgers from 21 countries in order to test for the existence of structuring in their phylogeography, to describe the genetic relationships among their populations across its widespread geographic range, and to infer demographic and biogeographic processes. We found that the Eurasian badger is divided into four groups regarding their mitochondrial DNA: Europe, Southwest Asia, North and East Asia, and Japan. This result suggests that the separation of badgers into phylogeographic groups was influenced by cold Pleistocene glacial stages and permafrost boundaries in Eurasia, and by geographic barriers, such as mountains and deserts. Genetic variation within phylogeographic groups based on distances assuming the Tamura-Nei model with rate heterogeneity and invariable sites (d(T-N) range: 3.3-4.2) was much lower than among them (d(T-N) range: 10.7-38.0), and 80% of the variation could be attributed to differences among regions. Spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA), median-joining network, and Mantel test did not detect genetic structuring within any of the phylogeographic groups with the exception of Europe, where 50% of variation was explained by differences among groups of populations. Our data suggest that the European, Southwest Asian, and North and East Asian badgers evolved separately since the end of Pliocene, at the beginnings of glacial ages, whereas Japanese badgers separated from continental Asian badgers during the middle Pleistocene. Endangered badgers from Crete Island, classified as Meles meles arcalus subspecies, were closely related to badgers from Southwest Asia. We also detected sudden demographic growth in European and Southwest Asian badgers that occurred during the Middle Pleistocene.

AB Taiwan and Ryukyus Constitute ail archipelago lying on the western rim of the Pacific Ocean. In contrast to volcanic islands that often arise sequentially, these continental islands emerged almost simultaneously as the Luzon are collided with the Eurasian margin some 9 million years ago (Mya). Taiwan and Ryukyus attained their modern features and their current flora and fauna from the adjacent mainland and from tropical Asia only 5-6 Mya. Quaternary glaciation led to a drop in sea level of the South China Sea and a land bridge that connected the Taiwan-Ryukyu Archipelago to the mainland, which allowed plants and animals to migrate across what was previously ocean. These islands provided refugia for northern species that migrated south during glacial periods.. as indicated by unanticipated high levels of genetic diversity in island populations of plants like Cunninghamia and Pinus. For most insect-pollinated species, allozymes and nuclear DNA markers indicate significant genetic differentiation between Populations and between geographical regions of the archipelago. In contrast, organelle based DNA markers Suggest a migrant-pool model, where colonists are recruited from a random sample of source Populations. Consistent with this model, low elevation species have high genetic heterogeneity within Populations and low levels of genetic differentiation between populations. In contrast, colonization of alpine species appeared to follow a phalanx model due to the limited availability of high elevation habitats. Genetic differentiation was detected between fragmented populations of the alpine species. A scenario of stepwise colonization from the mainland to near and then distant islands remains to be tested, although several Studies indicate no such pattern. These conflicting results challenge the ability to define clear conservation criteria for the rare plant species of the archipelago.

AB We compared the potential for compensatory growth of two grass species from the Mongolian steppe that differ in their ability to persist under grazing: the rhizomatous Leymus chinensis and the caespitose Stipa krylovii, and investigated how this ability might be affected by drought. Plants were grown in a greenhouse under wet and dry conditions and subjected to a clipping treatment (biweekly removal of 75-90% of the aerial mass). Leymus exhibited a much stronger compensatory growth after clipping than Stipa. Leymus showed a significant increase in its relative growth rate (RGR) after clipping, while for Stipa RGR was negatively affected. Clipped Leymus plants maintained leaf productivity levels that were similar to undamaged individuals, while leaf-productivity in clipped Stipa dropped to less than half of that of the controls. In Leytrus, there was less compensatory growth under dry than under wet conditions, while in Stipa the compensation was increased under drought. This difference probably reflects the fact that Stipa is more drought-tolerant than Leymus. The greater compensatory growth of Leymus compared to Stipa mainly resulted from a greater stimulation of its net assimilation rate (NAR), and its greater capacity to store and reallocate carbohydrates by clipping. The greater increase in NAR was probably the result of a stronger reduction in self-shading, because Leymits shoots were much denser than those of Stipa, which resulted in a higher increase in light penetration to remaining leaves after clipping. The results of this study suggest that the greater ability of Leymus to persist under grazing is the result of its larger capacity for compensatory growth.

AB 1. It was recently shown that body size of Palearctic shrews decreases with increasing latitude, thus contradicting Bergmann's rule, and this trend was explained by food shortage during the cold northern winter. In Alaska, global warming has resulted in milder winters that may improve food supply. In this study we tested the hypothesis that body size of Alaskan shrews increased during the second half of the twentieth century, in response to global warming.
   2. Data on body weight and length of body, tail, hind foot and ear of museum specimens of the masked shrew Sorex cinereus Kerr from Alaska were used in order to examine the effects of latitude, longitude, mean ambient temperature in January and July, and year of collection, on these parameters.
   3. We found that variation in body size of the masked shrew in Alaska appears to contradict to the prediction of Bergmann's rule, decreasing in high latitudes and in areas cold January temperature.
   4. Body size of shrews in Alaska increased significantly during the second half of the twentieth century, apparently due to the higher food availability in winter as a result of improved weather conditions for its prey.

AB Composting of rice straw with poultry manure and oilseed rape cake and its effects on growth and yield of faba bean and soil properties was studied in pot experiments at Gifu University, Japan in 2001/2002. The composts reached maturity in 90 days, were rich in organic matter and mineral nutrients, had a high level of stability, and no phytotoxicity. The addition of compost (20-200 g pot(-1)) improved selected soil chemical (increased total N, total C and CEC), physical (decreased particle density) and biological (increased soil respiration rate) properties. Application of composts at a rate of 20 g pot(-1) significantly increased growth, yield, yield components and total crude protein of faba bean plants. The benefit of this compost without chemical fertilizer demonstrated the validity and possibility of sustainable agronomic performance of faba bean using locally available recycled organic materials.

AB The number of de novo mutations in the germline can be expected to increase with age in males, therefore females might decrease mutation load in their progeny by avoiding mating with older males. Here, I propose that female polyandry can be more effective in decreasing the risk of genetic disorders in progeny than pre-copulatory mate choice, particularly if sperm competitiveness declines more steeply with age than other traits affecting chances of males to mate. If faster ageing of spermatogenic tissue causes older males to transfer inadequate numbers of functional sperm, polyandry would also benefit females directly.

AB Genetic analyses of bird subspecies designated as conservation units can address whether they represent units with independent evolutionary histories and provide insights into the evolutionary processes that determine the degree to which they are genetically distinct. Here we use mitochondrial DNA control region sequence and six microsatellite DNA loci to examine phylogeographical structure and genetic differentiation among five North American grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum ) populations representing three subspecies, including a population of the endangered Florida subspecies (A. s. floridanus ). This federally listed taxon is of particular interest because it differs phenotypically from other subspecies in plumage and behaviour and has also undergone a drastic decline in population size over the past century. Despite this designation, we observed no phylogeographical structure among populations in either marker: mtDNA haplotypes and microsatellite genotypes from floridanus samples did not form clades that were phylogenetically distinct from variants found in other subspecies. However, there was low but significant differentiation between Florida and all other populations combined in both mtDNA (F (ST) = 0.069) and in one measure of microsatellite differentiation (theta = 0.016), while the non-Florida populations were not different from each other. Based on analyses of mtDNA variation using a coalescent-based model, the effective sizes of these populations are large (similar to80 000 females) and they have only recently diverged from each other (< 26 000 ybp). These populations are probably far from genetic equilibrium and therefore the lack of phylogenetic distinctiveness of the floridanus subspecies and minimal genetic differentiation is due most probably to retained ancestral polymorphism. Finally, levels of variation in Florida were similar to other populations supporting the idea that the drastic reduction in population size which has occurred within the last 100 years has not yet had an impact on levels of variation in floridanus . We argue that despite the lack of phylogenetic distinctiveness of floridanus genotypes the observed genetic differentiation and previously documented phenotypic differences justify continued designation of this subspecies as a protected population segment.

AB Root systems of individual crop plants may encounter large variations in mechanical impedance to root penetration. Split-root experiments were conducted to compare the effects of spatial variation in soil strength on the morphological plasticity of wheat and barley roots, and its relationship to shoot growth. Plants of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Prisma) and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum cv Alexandria) were grown for 12 days with their seminal roots divided between two halves of a cylinder packed with sandy loam soil. Three treatment combinations were imposed: loose soil where both halves of the cylinder were packed to 1.1 g cm(-3) (penetrometer resistance 0.3 MPa), dense soil where both halves were packed to 1.4 g cm(-3) (penetrometer resistance 1 MPa), and a split-root treatment where one half was packed to 1.1 and the other to 1.4 g cm(-3). In barley, uniform high soil strength restricted the extension of main seminal root axes more than laterals. In the split-root treatment, the length of laterals and the dry weight of main axes and laterals were increased in the loose soil half and reduced in the dense soil half compared with their respective loose and dense-soil controls. No such compensatory adjustments between main axis and laterals and between individual seminal roots were found in wheat. Variation in soil strength had no effect on the density of lateral roots (number per unit main axis length) in either barley or wheat. The nature and extent of wheat root plasticity in response to variation in soil strength was very different from that in response to changes in N-supply in previous experiments. In spite of the compensatory adjustments in growth between individual seminal roots of barley, the growth of barley shoots, as in wheat, was reduced when part of the root system was in compacted soil.

AB Intraspecific phylogeny and genetic variation were investigated based on nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene in six soricine shrew species, Sorex unguiculatus, S. caecutiens, S. shinto, S. gracillimus, S. minutissimus and S. hosonoi, collected primarily from northeastern Asia. Maximum likelihood trees and a phylogenetic network were generated to estimate intraspecific phylogenies. S. minutissimus showed high congruence between phylogenetic position and geographical origin and S. gracillimus showed low congruence. In contrast, there was no congruence between phylogeny and geography in S. unguiculatus and the S. caecutiens from Sakhalin-Eurasia. Positive correlation between genetic and geographical distances was found in S. minutissimus and S. gracillimus, but not in the other species (or regional populations). The results of the phylogenetic and genetic analyses suggest that S. minutissimus and S. gracillimus have occupied their present ranges for a longer time than the other species if we assume a stepping-stone model of population structure. In addition, there was no contradiction between the present investigations and the hypotheses of multiple immigration by S. gracillimus and a single immigration by S. unguiculatus into Hokkaido Island. It is proposed that these six northeastern Asian species experienced different historical processes of range expansion and dispersal despite the fact that some of them currently show similar patterns of distribution.

AB Phylogeographic studies using mitochondrial DNA sequence information are frequently used as the principal source of evidence to infer species boundaries. However, a critical analysis of further evidence is essential to test whether different haplotype clades identify different species. We demonstrate a hypothesis-testing approach, using a combination of phylogeographic methods, multivariate morphometrics and matrix association tests, to investigate species boundaries in eastern Brazilian pitvipers conventionally assigned to the species Bothrops leucurus and B. pradoi. Two basal haplotype clades with partly overlapping geographical distributions are identified, which could either represent two partly sympatric species, or multiple haplotypes within one organismal lineage. We use partial Mantel matrix association tests to verify whether generalized morphology, or any of four Supposedly diagnostic characters for the two species, show any association with mtDNA variation. Negative results lead to the conclusion that the haplotype clades do not denote independently evolving organismal lineages, and do not constitute separate species under any criterion.

AB The effect of plant species diversity on productivity and competitive ability was studied in an experiment carried out simultaneously in five European countries: Czech Republic (CZ), the Netherlands (NL), Sweden (SE), Spain (SP), and United Kingdom (UK). The aim was to separate the 'chance' or 'sampling effect' (increasing the number of sown species increases the probability that a species able 'to do a job' will be included) from the complementarity effect (species-rich communities are better able to exploit resources and to take care of ecosystem functions than species-poor communities). In the experiment, low diversity (LD) and high diversity (HD) mixtures of grassland species were sown into fields taken out of arable cultivation. The HD mixture consisted of five grass species, five legumes and five other forbs. The LD mixtures consisted of two grasses, one legume and one other forb, with different plant species combinations in each replicate block. The design of the experiment was constructed in such a way that the total number of seeds of each species over all the replications was exactly the same in HD and LD treatments, and the total number of grass seeds, leguminous seeds and other forb seeds were the same in both LD and HD. The responses measured were the total above-ground biomass las a measure of productivity) and the average number of naturally establishing species in a plot las a measure of the competitive ability of the mixture), both measured in the third year of the experiment. The results show that, on average, the HD plots performed better (i.e., attained higher biomass, had better weed suppression), but that the best LD mixture was as good as the best HD mixture. On the contrary, the worst LD mixture was always less successful than the worst HD replicate. The performance of particular species in the HD mixtures was a good predictor of the success of a certain species combination in a LD mixture (explaining 61% of variability between particular LD mixtures). In all sites, the LD mixture composed of species which were the most abundant in HD mixtures was as efficient in suppressing weeds as the HD mixture itself. It is argued that the performance of a species assemblage is influenced mostly by the identity of species and the diversity effect is mainly due to the 'chance' or 'sampling' effect with increasing number of species the probability that an important species will be included in the mixture increases. Caution is urged in interpreting experiments with manipulated diversity and the possible limitations of such experiments are discussed.

AB In stark contrast to other species within the Salmonidae family, phylogeographic information on European grayling, Thymallus thymallus, is virtually nonexistent. In this paper, we utilized mitochondrial DNA polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (mtDNA PCR-RFLP) and sequence variation to infer the postglacial dispersal routes of T. thymallus into and within northern Europe, and to locate geographically, potential evolutionarily distinct populations. Mitochondrial analyses revealed a total of 27 T. thymallus haplotypes which clustered into three distinct lineages. Average pairwise interlineage divergence was four and nine times higher than average intralineage divergence for RFLP and sequence data, respectively. Two European grayling individuals from the easternmost sample in Russia exhibited haplotypes more genetically diverged from any T. thymallus haplotype than T. arcticus haplotype, and suggested that hybridization/introgression zone of these two sister species may extend much further west than previously thought. Geographic division of the lineages was generally very clear with northern Europe comprising of two genetically differentiated areas: (i) Finland, Estonia and north-western Russia; and (ii) central Germany, Poland and western Fennoscandia. Average interpopulation divergence in North European T. thymallus was 10 times higher than that observed in a recent mtDNA study of North American T. arcticus. We conclude that (i) North European T. thymallus populations have survived dramatic Pleistocene temperature oscillations and originate from ancient eastern and central European refugia; (ii) genetic divergence of population groups within northern Europe is substantial and geographically distinct; and (iii) the remainder of Europe harbours additional differentiated assemblages that likely descend from a Danubian refugium. These findings should provide useful information for developing appropriate conservation strategies for European grayling and exemplify a case with a clear need for multinational co-operation for managing and conserving biodiversity.

AB The maximum rate of carboxylation (V-cmax) and the potential rate of RuBP regeneration (P-ml, which equals J(max)/4), as well as leaf nitrogen content (N-L) and specific leaf area (SLA), were studied in sun leaves of 30 species from differently managed mountain grassland ecosystems (abandoned areas, pastures and meadows) at three study areas in the Eastern Alps. A significant correlation between V-cmax and P-ml across the investigated species was observed. In comparison to a previous survey on the relationship between P-ml and V-cmax, the investigated species were found to invest a proportionally smaller amount of available resources into P-ml. Despite this close correlation between V-cmax and P-ml, variation in the V-cmax-N-L and P-ml-N-L relationships was large, indicating that the investigated species differed widely in their respective nitrogen use efficiencies. Among the investigated species, dwarf shrubs were characterized by significantly lower values of V-cmax, P-ml and N-L compared to graminoids and forbs, which did not differ significantly from each other. Species from abandoned areas were found to be lower,vith respect to V-cmax, P-ml, N-L and SLA than species from pastures and meadows, which were not significantly different from each other.

AB To resolve the population genetic structure and phylogeography of the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region sequences were compared among eight locations across the western Atlantic region. Fifteen haplotypes were identified among 86 individuals from Florida, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Brazil. Despite the manatee's ability to move thousands of kilometres along continental margins, strong population separations between most locations were demonstrated with significant haplotype frequency shifts. These findings are consistent with tagging studies which indicate that stretches of open water and unsuitable coastal habitats constitute substantial barriers to gene flow and colonization. Low levels of genetic diversity within Florida and Brazilian samples might be explained by recent colonization into high latitudes or bottleneck effects. Three distinctive mtDNA lineages were observed in an intraspecific;phylogeny of T. manatus, corresponding approximately to: (i) Florida and the West Indies; (ii) the Gulf of Mexico to the Caribbean rivers of South America; and (iii) the northeast Atlantic coast of South America. These Lineages, which are not concordant with previous subspecies designations, are separated by sequence divergence estimates of d = 0.04-0.07, approximately the same level of divergence observed between T. manatus and the Amazonian manatee (T. inunguis, n = 16). Three individuals from Guyana, identified as T. manatus, had mtDNA haplotypes which are affiliated with the endemic Amazon form T. inunguis. The three primary T. manatus lineages and the T. inunguis lineage may represent relatively deep phylogeographic partitions which have been bridged recently due to changes in habitat availability (after the Wisconsin glacial period, 10 000 BP), natural colonization, and human-mediated transplantation.

AB Based on available sequence data, a phylogeny of small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) was established for env, pol, gag and LTR fragments using maximum likelihood, neighbour-joining and minimum evolution reconstruction techniques, To reconstruct topologies as accurately as possible, phylogenetic parameters like base composition, percentage divergences, kappa, the gamma shape parameter alpha and codon position-specific rates were estimated prior to the reconstruction of trees. Divergences between fragments of SRLV ranged from 16% in gag and pol to 22% in env and 35% in LTR, The codon position bias found and the ratios of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions were inversely related to overall divergence, indicating the existence of both negative and positive Darwinian selection in SRLV genes. The phylogenetic trees reconstructed with relative substitution rates assigned to the codon positions revealed an interesting relationship between lentiviruses from sheep and goats. Overall, at least six different clades could be differentiated, with no clear separation of SRLV strains derived from goats (caprine arthritisencephalitis virus) or sheep (maedi-visna virus). Trees generated with fragments from different coding regions were in good agreement with each other as well as with trees generated with different phylogeny reconstruction methods, In this work, clear indications of the existence and epidemiological importance of cross-species transmission were found.

AB The relative performance of barley, bread wheat, durum wheat, triticale and oats was compared in rainfed environments to identify any outstanding features of these species that contribute to high grain yield. Fourteen high-yielding cultivars with a range of flowering times were evaluated in five rainfed environments. There was a terminal drought in all environments but water deficit was not a significant factor before flowering. Barley, which flowered earliest, had a 25% higher grain yield than the other species when averaged over all cultivars. However, the highest-yielding barley had a 39% higher yield than the best wheat when averaged over all environments. There was little variation in the mean grain yield between the durum and bread wheats, oats and triticale but there was substantial variation within each species. After correcting for the husk enclosing the barley grain, the grain yield of barley was 17% higher than that of the other species whereas the highest-yielding barley yielded 28% more than the best wheat. With the exception of oats this higher yield was achieved by a higher above-ground dry mass (AGDM) rather than a higher harvest index. The AGDM of barley averaged over all environments was 22%, 16%, 13% and 2% higher than those of durum wheat, oats, bread wheat and triticale respectively. Barley also had a more extensive and heavier root system than did bread wheat and triticale. Root mass of barley was estimated to be 35% greater, with most of the difference occurring in the top 15 cm, but differences occurred down to 90 cm. No differences were found in rooting depth.

AB In order to understand variability in recruitment to populations of benthic and demersal marine species, it is critical to distinguish between the contributions due to variations in larval settlement versus those caused by post-settlement mortality. In this study, fine-scale (1-2 days) temporal changes in recruit abundance were followed through an entire settlement season in a temperate demersal fish in order to determine 1) how dynamic the process of recruitment is on a daily scale, 2) whether settlement and post-settlement mortality are influenced by habitat structure and conspecific density, and 3) how the relationship between settlement and recruitment changes over time. ''Settlement'' is considered to be the arrival of new individuals from the pelagic habitat, and ''recruitment'' is defined as the number of individuals surviving arbitrary periods of time after settlement. Replicate standardized habitat units were placed in 2 spatial configurations (clumped and randomly dispersed) and monitored visually for cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus) settlement and recruitment every 1-2 days throughout the settlement season. The process of recruitment in T. adspersus was highly variable at a fine temporal scale. Changes in the numbers of recruits present on habitat units were due to both settlement of new individuals and mortality of animals previously recruited. The relative importance of these two processes appeared to change from day to day. The magnitude of the change in recruit number did not differ between the clumped and random habitats. However, post-settlement loss was significantly greater on randomly dispersed than clumped habitats. During several sampling dates, the extent of the change in recruit abundance was correlated with the density of resident con-specifics; however, on other dates no such relationship appeared to exist. Despite the presence of significant relationships between the change in recruit number and density, there was no evidence of either density-dependent mortality or settlement. Initially, there was a strong relationship between settlement and recruitment; however, this relationship weakened over time. Within 2 months after the cessation of settlement, post-settlement loss was greater than 99%, and no correlation remained between recruitment and the initial pattern of settlement. The results of this study demonstrate that the spatial arrangement of the habitat affects the rate and intensity of post-settlement loss. Counter to much current thinking, this study suggests that in order to understand the population ecology of reef fishes, knowledge of what habitats new recruits use and how mortality varies with structural aspects of the habitats is essential.

AB Context Grasslands provide a variety of ecosystem services (ESs) for humans. While much ES research has focused on forests and wetlands, synthesizing the currently somewhat sporadic studies of grassland ecosystem services (GESs) is much needed. Objectives We aimed to review the scope, major methods, and key findings of GESs, and identify knowledge gaps and future directions. Methods We conducted a systematic review of articles published during 1970-2018 (including 380 peer-reviewed articles from Web of Science and 32 book chapters from Google Scholar). Results The number of GES studies has accelerated in recent decades, with China (31%) and the United States (18%) together accounting for almost half of them. A total of 33 GESs were mentioned in the searched articles, of which carbon sequestration, forage production, and water erosion control had the highest frequencies. Methods for evaluating GESs include field survey, field experiments, and statistical and process-based modeling. Grasslands are the primary source of meat and dairy products, account for about one-third of the total carbon of all terrestrial ecosystems, and provide numerous other ESs, such as night cooling, soil erosion control, and flood mitigation. Conclusions This review presents the state-of-the-science of GESs, and identifies several future research directions. To move forward, we propose a framework with a 3-M methodology: (1) "Multi-scales"-understanding GESs from various spatiotemporal scales; (2) "Multi-methods"-evaluating GESs with multiple statistical and modeling techniques using multiple data sources; and (3) "Multi-perspectives"-assessing GESs from ecological, social, and economic perspectives for sustainability.

AB Restoring gene flow into small, isolated populations can alleviate genetic load and decrease extinction risk (i.e., genetic rescue), yet gene flow is rarely augmented as a conservation strategy. Due to this discrepancy between opportunity and action, a recent call was made for widespread genetic rescue attempts. However, several aspects of augmenting gene flow are poorly understood, including the magnitude and duration of beneficial effects and when deleterious effects are likely to occur. We discuss the remaining uncertainties of genetic rescue in order to promote and direct future research and to hasten progress toward implementing this potentially powerful conservation strategy on a broader scale.

AB Species distribution is strongly driven by local and global gradients in water availability but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Vulnerability to xylem embolism (P-50) is a key trait that indicates how species cope with drought and might explain plant distribution patterns across environmental gradients. Here we address its role on species sorting along a hydro-topographical gradient in a central Amazonian rainforest and examine its variance at the community scale.
   We measured P-50 for 28 tree species, soil properties and estimated the hydrological niche of each species using an indicator of distance to the water table (HAND).
   We found a large hydraulic diversity, covering as much as 44% of the global angiosperm variation in P-50. We show that P-50: contributes to species segregation across a hydro-topographic gradient in the Amazon, and thus to species coexistence; is the result of repeated evolutionary adaptation within closely related taxa; is associated with species tolerance to P-poor soils, suggesting the evolution of a stress-tolerance syndrome to nutrients and drought; and is higher for trees in the valleys than uplands.
   The large observed hydraulic diversity and its association with topography has important implications for modelling and predicting forest and species resilience to climate change.

AB Ecological communities change in time and space, but long-term dynamics at the century-to-millennia scale are poorly documented due to lack of relevant data sets. Nevertheless, understanding long-term dynamics is important for explaining present-day biodiversity patterns and placing conservation goals in a historical context. Here, we use recent examples and new perspectives to highlight how environmental DNA (eDNA) is starting to provide a powerful new source of temporal data for research questions that have so far been overlooked, by helping to resolve the ecological dynamics of populations, communities, and ecosystems over hundreds to thousands of years. We give examples of hypotheses that may be addressed by temporal eDNA biodiversity data, discuss possible research directions, and outline related challenges.

AB The term tipping point has experienced explosive popularity across multiple disciplines over the last decade. Research on social-ecological systems (SES) has contributed to the growth and diversity of the term's use. The diverse uses of the term obscure potential differences between tipping behavior in natural and social systems, and issues of causality across natural and social system components in SES. This paper aims to create the foundation for a discussion within the SES research community about the appropriate use of the term tipping point, especially the relatively novel term 'social tipping point.' We review existing literature on tipping points and similar concepts (e.g. regime shifts, critical transitions) across all spheres of science published between 1960 and 2016 with a special focus on a recent and still small body of work on social tipping points. We combine quantitative and qualitative analyses in a bibliometric approach, rooted in an expert elicitation process. We find that the term tipping point became popular after the year 2000-long after the terms regime shift and critical transition-across all spheres of science. We identify 23 distinct features of tipping point definitions and their prevalence across disciplines, but find no clear taxonomy of discipline-specific definitions. Building on the most frequently used features, we propose definitions for tipping points in general and social tipping points in SES in particular.

AB This review summarizes current understanding of five key plant traits: seed mass, plant height, wood density, leaf mass per unit area and leaf size, emphasizing ways in which our understanding of large-scale patterns in plant traits have improved over the last two decades. Notable advances include: (1) large-seeded species have greater seed dispersal distances than do small-seeded species, (2) leaf mass per unit area is not strongly or consistently related to plant traits outside the leaf economics spectrum, or to broad gradients in environmental conditions, and (3) fleshy fruit could not have first evolved for seed dispersal, as the first fleshy fruit appeared millions of years before the first potential seed dispersers. While quantifying large-scale patterns in plant traits has yielded many important discoveries, it is clear that the next major leap in understanding will not come from simply including ever more variables in our analyses. I suggest that we build upon Harper's Darwinian approach to plant ecology and apply evolutionary ideas to large-scale trait ecology. For example, quantifying trait impacts on lifetime fitness rather than on particular stages of plant regeneration can allow us to understand the coordination between seemingly disparate traits. I use this approach to bring seed mass and plant height together as integrated parts of a species' life-history spectrum. I then point out problems associated with the implicit assumption that selection acts on species' mean trait values and show how considering the way selection acts can improve our understanding of the effects of climate on plant traits. A goal for the future is to quantify the full suite of biotic and abiotic factors that shape plant strategy in complex, real-world situations.Synthesis. Enormous data availability and ever more powerful computational and statistical tools have given ecologists unprecedented power to quantify large-scale patterns in plant ecology. However, there is a limit to how far big data alone can take us. The time is ripe for a new generation of hypotheses and ecological theory built on strong evolutionary foundations. Let the creativity begin!

AB Translocation is a popular conservation tool, but the outcomes are variable. Many tactics can be used to improve the probability of success, but a comprehensive summary of these does not exist. This increases the risk that valuable tactics will be overlooked, and inhibits effective communication. We assess the diversity of translocation tactics' used in mammal and bird translocations, by reviewing the IUCN/SSC Guidelines for Reintroduction and other Conservation Translocations, 195 peer-reviewed articles and 73 case studies from the IUCN/SSC Global Reintroduction Perspectives Series. We recorded descriptions of every technique used to influence the post-release performance of translocated wildlife. We developed the Translocation Tactics Classification System (TTCS) which defines a collection of 30 tactics and organize them into an ecologically relevant framework. We also assess the occurrence of tactics within the Guidelines, the primary literature and the case studies to evaluate how tactics are communicated within these mediums. Our results indicate that the Guidelines are a valuable resource, but do not exhaustively cover tactics, and that detailed methodological accounts are rarely made publicly accessible. This highlights the need to develop context-specific resources to support the Guidelines, and to develop and exploit mediums that facilitate recording of methodological detail, the tactical rationale behind the design and evaluations of effectiveness. Although some forms of grey literature address this issue, the general lack of information limits the ability to investigate the relationship between tactics and translocation success.Synthesis and applications. The Translocation Tactics Classification System (TTCS) provides a checklist which ensures that the full diversity of tactics is considered when developing translocation processes. Standardizing the communication of tactics, and encouraging detailed accounts of applied methodologies to be recorded, along with the tactical reasoning behind the design, will provide operational models and the data required to conduct broad-scale meta-analyses.

AB Intensification of the use of natural resources is a world-wide trend driven by the increasing demand for water, food, fibre, minerals and energy. These demands are the result of a rising world population, increasing wealth and greater global focus on economic growth. Land use intensification, together with climate change, is also driving intensification of the global hydrological cycle. Both processes will have major socio-economic and ecological implications for global water availability. In this paper we focus on the implications of land use intensification for the conservation and management of freshwater ecosystems using Australia as an example. We consider this in the light of intensification of the hydrologic cycle due to climate change, and associated hydrological scenarios that include the occurrence of more intense hydrological events (extreme storms, larger floods and longer droughts). We highlight the importance of managing water quality, the value of providing environmental flows within a watershed framework and the critical role that innovative science and adaptive management must play in developing proactive and robust responses to intensification. We also suggest research priorities to support improved systemic governance, including adaptation planning and management to maximise freshwater biodiversity outcomes while supporting the socioeconomic objectives driving land use intensification. Further research priorities include: i) determining the relative contributions of surface water and groundwater in supporting freshwater ecosystems; ii) identifying and protecting freshwater biodiversity hotspots and refugia; iii) improving our capacity to model hydro-ecological relationships and predict ecological outcomes from land use intensification and climate change; iv) developing an understanding of long term ecosystem behaviour; and v) exploring systemic approaches to enhancing governance systems, including planning and management systems affecting freshwater outcomes. A major policy challenge will be the integration of land and water management, which increasingly are being considered within different policy frameworks.

AB Most studies of forest litter dynamics examine the biochemical characteristics and decomposition of leaf litter, but fine roots are also a large source of litter in forests.
   We quantified the concentrations of eight biochemical fractions and nitrogen (N) in leaf litter and fine roots at four sugar maple (Acer saccharum)-dominated hardwood forests in the north-central United States. We combined these results with litter production data to estimate ecosystem biochemical fluxes to soil. We also compared how leaf litter and fine root biochemistry responded to long-term simulated N deposition.
   Compared with leaf litter, fine roots contained 2.9-fold higher acid-insoluble fraction (AIF) and 2.3-fold more condensed tannins; both are relatively difficult to decompose. Comparatively, leaf litter had greater quantities of more labile components: nonstructural carbohydrates, cellulose and soluble phenolics. At an ecosystem scale, fine roots contributed over two-thirds of the fluxes of AIF and condensed tannins to soil. Fine root biochemistry was also less responsive than leaf litter to long-term simulated N deposition.
   Fine roots were the dominant source of difficult-to-decompose plant carbon fractions entering the soil at our four study sites. Based on our synthesis of the literature, this pattern appears to be widespread in boreal and temperate forests.

AB Background: Small-scale topographic complexity is a characteristic feature of alpine landscapes, with important effects on alpine plant distribution.
   Aims: We investigated the links between small-scale topographic complexity and resultant microclimatic heterogeneity, vascular-plant species richness and beta diversity, and realised niche width and trait variation of some target species.
   Methods: We recorded temperature and soil moisture within 10 sites (40mx40m) of differing topographic complexity in alpine terrain at Finse, Norway (N 60 degrees 36MODIFIER LETTER PRIME, E 7 degrees 33MODIFIER LETTER PRIME). Plant species occurrence and traits of target species were recorded in 16 sample plots at each site.
   Results: Sites differed significantly in microclimatic heterogeneity, and topographically rough sites were always more heterogeneous than flatter ones. Greater species richness and turnover was associated with greater microclimatic heterogeneity, and rough sites contained 15-55% more species than flatter ones. Plant species had on average wider realised niches when growing at rough sites. Individuals of Bistorta vivipara, but not those of Luzula spicata, tended to exhibit greater phenotypic variation at rough sites.
   Conclusions: Rough alpine terrains create small-scale variation in microclimate, promoting species richness and beta diversity. In the event of climate change, small-scale microclimatic heterogeneity might allow plant species to escape from regional climate change by short-distance migration to local micro-refugia. This study suggests that the opportunity for such responses would be greater in topographically complex terrains.

AB Global plant trait studies have revealed fundamental trade-offs in plant resource economics. We evaluated such trait trade-offs during secondary succession in two species-rich tropical ecosystems that contrast in precipitation: dry deciduous and wet evergreen forests of Mexico. Species turnover with succession in dry forest largely relates to increasing water availability and in wet forest to decreasing light availability. We hypothesized that while functional trait trade-offs are similar in the two forest systems, the successful plant strategies in these communities will be different, as contrasting filters affect species turnover. Research was carried out in 15 dry secondary forest sites (5-63 years after abandonment) and in 17 wet secondary forest sites (<1-25 years after abandonment). We used 11 functional traits measured on 132 species to make species-trait PCA biplots for dry and wet forest and compare trait trade-offs. We evaluated whether multivariate plant strategies changed during succession, by calculating a 'Community-Weighted Mean' plant strategy, based on species scores on the first two PCA-axes. Trait spectra reflected two main trade-off axes that were similar for dry and wet forest species: acquisitive versus conservative species, and drought avoiding species versus evergreen species with large animal-dispersed seeds. These trait associations were consistent when accounting for evolutionary history. Successional changes in the most successful plant strategies reflected different functional trait spectra depending on the forest type. In dry forest the community changed from having drought avoiding strategies early in succession to increased abundance of evergreen strategies with larger seeds late in succession. In wet forest the community changed from species having mainly acquisitive strategies to those with more conservative strategies during succession. These strategy changes were explained by increasing water availability during dry forest succession and increasing light scarcity during wet forest succession. Although similar trait spectra were observed among dry and wet secondary forest species, the consequences for succession were different resulting from contrasting environmental filters.

AB In the last few decades, mounting evidence points to a negative impact of roads on several groups of animals. Most studies on the effects of roads on animal populations concentrate on vertebrates, and only a few on insects. It is difficult to determine the real effects of roads on insects due to the variety of methods used. We review recent literature examining the ecological impact of roads on insects. The objectives of our synthesis are to gain insight into the effects of the construction and operation of a road on insect groups, and to determine the gaps of knowledge. We found that roads negatively affect the abundance and diversity of insects due to two main factors: (1) the high mortality of some groups when crossing the road, with more impact at higher traffic volumes. (2) The unwillingness of many species to cross a road or live close to it. Roads are major barriers for small or flightless species, although the response varied for flying species. Finally, both experimental and observational evidence support the idea that air pollutants and de-icing salt used for the road maintenance negatively affect insects.

AB Movement is influenced by landscape structure, configuration and geometry, but measuring distance as perceived by animals poses technical and logistical challenges. Instead, movement is typically measured using Euclidean distance, irrespective of location or landscape structure, or is based on arbitrary cost surfaces. A recently proposed extension of spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models resolves this issue using spatial encounter histories of individuals to calculate least-cost paths (ecological distance: Ecology, 94, 2013, 287) thereby relaxing the Euclidean assumption. We evaluate the consequences of not accounting for movement heterogeneity when estimating abundance in highly structured landscapes, and demonstrate the value of this approach for estimating biologically realistic space-use patterns and landscape connectivity. We simulated SCR data in a riparian habitat network, using the ecological distance model under a range of scenarios where space-use in and around the landscape was increasingly associated with water (i.e. increasingly less Euclidean). To assess the influence of miscalculating distance on estimates of population size, we compared the results from the ecological and Euclidean distance based models. We then demonstrate that the ecological distance model can be used to estimate home range geometry when space use is not symmetrical. Finally, we provide a method for calculating landscape connectivity based on modelled species-landscape interactions generated from capture-recapture data. Using ecological distance always produced unbiased estimates of abundance. Explicitly modelling the strength of the species-landscape interaction provided a direct measure of landscape connectivity and better characterised true home range geometry. Abundance under the Euclidean distance model was increasingly (negatively) biased as space use was more strongly associated with water and, because home ranges are assumed to be symmetrical, produced poor characterisations of home range geometry and no information about landscape connectivity. The ecological distance SCR model uses spatially indexed capture-recapture data to estimate how activity patterns are influenced by landscape structure. As well as reducing bias in estimates of abundance, this approach provides biologically realistic representations of home range geometry, and direct information about species-landscape interactions. The incorporation of both structural (landscape) and functional (movement) components of connectivity provides a direct measure of species-specific landscape connectivity.

AB The concept of ecosystem services (ES) has become widely used because it bridges ecology and economics and links nature to society. ES may evolve over time in dynamic landscapes driven by myriad processes. However, the consequences of changes in key ES has not been considered adequately in current ES research. Here we propose a framework for linking ES with landscape history, which can help us better understand the evolution of ES over time. We illustrate the framework by a case study from Switzerland. Both the capacity of landscapes to supply ES and the realization and recognition of key ES are likely to change over time. This insight should have important implications for landscape sustainability and related scenario studies.

AB As the most widely distributed freshwater fish worldwide, common carp Cyprinus carpio can be either invasive or "naturalized" in most areas of introduction. This leads to different levels of perception regarding the species' role in freshwater ecosystems, with experimental research focusing either on its "middle-out" impacts or overall function in limnological processes. At the same time, the large scales at which carp dynamics operate may severely limit the validity of laboratory and, oftentimes, field experiments in extrapolating results to real-world ecosystems. In this study, 129 laboratory, field, and "natural" experiments were systematically reviewed through causal criteria analysis, and within an historical/biogeographical and risk-assessment context. Of the 19 countries where experiments were conducted, only 4 were considered as "low risk" and one as "no risk," the other being "medium" to "high risk." Experimental findings from 373 component-wise assessments supported the framework of effects on water quality, vegetation, invertebrates, and vertebrates, with the latter including also amphibians and waterfowl, previously unreported. Stronger evidence was provided by natural and field relative to laboratory experiments, reflecting the reductionism of the latter. Critical biomass for an impact was highly dependent on experimental setup, even though the overall threshold of approximate to 200 kg ha(-1) under natural conditions supported recent findings. Management of carp should reflect the level of current and potential risk posed by the species in its different areas of distribution, thereby accounting for projections of further spread but also for unsuccessful colonization. Future experimentation should favor a holistic -> reductionist over a reductionist -> holistic approach.

AB Aquatic macroinvertebrates inhabiting temporary rivers are typically described as having low resistance to riverbed drying. However, little research has examined the seedbank' within dry riverbed sediments, which comprises aquatic life stages that survive in dewatered sediments and from which active organisms may develop only after surface water returns. We synthesised published and unpublished data from studies that had experimentally rehydrated sediments collected from dry riverbeds, to establish the importance of the seedbank in promoting macroinvertebrate community resistance. Studies from across climate zones were included, to examine seedbank importance in relation to environmental harshness and, in particular, sediment moisture. We also assessed the importance of the seedbank relative to alternative habitats promoting persistence of the flowing river (FR) assemblage. We predicted that the proportion of the FR assemblage present in rehydrated sediments (RS) would decrease with environmental harshness, due to conditions within the sediments becoming less conducive to the survival of biota. A negative relationship between the proportion of FR taxa present in RS and harshness was observed, and this contributed to a reduction in the compositional similarity of FR and RS assemblages as harshness increased. Significant positive correlations were identified between sediment moisture content and macroinvertebrate community metrics (density and taxon richness) in some systems. Habitats external to the dry reach, which contribute to community resilience, were invariably inhabited by a greater number of FR taxa than rehydrated sediments. However, rehydrated sediments included several FR taxa that were not found in any other habitats during the dry phase, including families of Coleoptera and Diptera. Our results indicate the importance of the seedbank as a resistance mechanism for temporary river macroinvertebrates. With climate change scenarios predicting an increase in riverbed drying, maintaining habitats that facilitate the persistence of instream communities during dry phases is an increasing priority. We identified strong relationships between sediment moisture and taxon richness, and river management and rehabilitation activities should therefore aim to retain moisture in drying sediments, by manipulating parameters such as riparian shading.

AB The addition of fresh organic matter is known to modify both soil aggregation and soil biotic community composition. We hypothesized that fertilization alters the composition of soil nematode and microbial communities in soil aggregates, and the interaction between nematodes and microbes can stimulate or inhibit microbial activity. We used a field experiment with 9 years of manure application to investigate changes in nematodes and microbial communities among aggregate size fractions in an acid soil planted with maize in subtropical China. Nematodes, microbial communities, and metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) were examined within three aggregate size fractions from soils under four fertilization regimes. Three aggregate fractions include large macroaggregates (>2000 mu m; LA), small macroaggregates (250-2000 mu m; SA), and inter-aggregate soil and space (<250 mu m; IA). Four manure treatments include no manure (M-0), low-rate manure with 150 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) (M-1), high-rate manure with 600 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) (M-2), and high-rate manure with 600 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) and lime at 3000 kg Ca(OH)(2) ha(-1) 3 y(-1) (M-3). Fertilization influenced the proportion of the aggregate size fractions. The proportion of the LA fraction significantly increased under M-2 and M-3 treatments compared to M-0 and M-1 treatments, while the SA fraction significantly decreased. Aggregate fractions significantly affected the total number of nematodes and the abundance of bacterivorous nematodes (dominant genus Protorhabditis) and plant parasitic nematodes (dominant genus Pratylenchus), with values following the trend of LA > SA > IA. A high value for the nematode structure index (SI) in the IA fraction suggested a complex community structure with many linkages in the food web. Aggregate fractions also influenced microbial biomass and diversity. PLFA signature analysis revealed that microbial biomass and diversity (Shannon index) increased with decreasing aggregate size. However, the SA fraction had a significantly higher soil metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) than the IA fraction. Only fertilization had a significant effect on the compositions of nematode groups, while both fertilization and aggregate fractions significantly affected microbial community composition. The variations in the composition of nematode and microbial communities could be explained independently by fertilization treatments (44% and 48%, respectively) and aggregate size (6.0% and 21%, respectively). Aggregated boosted trees (ABT) analysis indicated that total C exerted the strongest influence on microbial biomass, while pH influenced the total number of nematodes. The abundance of bacterivores showed a significant positive association with bacterial biomass across fertilization treatments and aggregate fractions (r(2) = 0.17, P = 0.026), which could partly explain the significant negative correlation between the total number of nematodes and qCO(2) (r(2) = 0.25, P = 0.002). The grazing on microbes by microbivores may decrease microbial activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB National-scale analyses of fire occurrence are needed to prioritize fire policy and management activities across the United States. However, the drivers of national-scale patterns of fire occurrence are not well understood, and how the relative importance of human or biophysical factors varies across the country is unclear. Our research goal was to model the drivers of fire occurrence within ecoregions across the conterminous United States. We used generalized linear models to compare the relative influence of human, vegetation, climate, and topographic variables on fire occurrence in the United States, as measured by MODIS active fire detections collected between 2000 and 2006. We constructed models for all fires and for large fires only and generated predictive maps to quantify fire occurrence probabilities. Areas with high fire occurrence probabilities were widespread in the Southeast, and localized in the Mountain West, particularly in southern California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Probabilities for large-fire occurrence were generally lower, but hot spots existed in the western and south-central United States The probability of fire occurrence is a critical component of fire risk assessments, in addition to vegetation type, fire behavior, and the values at risk. Many of the hot spots we identified have extensive development in the wildland-urban interface and are near large metropolitan areas. Our results demonstrated that human variables were important predictors of both all fires and large fires and frequently exhibited nonlinear relationships. However, vegetation, climate, and topography were also significant variables in most ecoregions. If recent housing growth trends and fire occurrence patterns continue, these areas will continue to challenge policies and management efforts seeking to balance the risks generated by wildfires with the ecological benefits of fire.

AB Recent advancements in molecular sequencing techniques have led to a surge in the number of phylogenetic studies that incorporate large amounts of genetic data. We test the assumption that analyzing large number of genes will lead to improvements in tree resolution and branch support using moths in the superfamily Bombycoidea, a group with some interfamilial relationships that have been difficult to resolve. Specifically, we use a next-gen data set that included 19 taxa and 938 genes (similar to 1.2M bp) to examine how codon position and saturation might influence resolution and node support among three key families. Maximum likelihood, parsimony, and species tree analysis using gene tree parsimony, on different nucleotide and amino acid data sets, resulted in largely congruent topologies with high bootstrap support compared with prior studies that included fewer loci. However, for a few shallow nodes, nucleotide and amino acid data provided high support for conflicting relationships. The third codon position was saturated and phylogenetic analysis of this position alone supported a completely different, potentially misleading sister group relationship. We used the program RADICAL to assess the number of genes needed to fix some of these difficult nodes. One such node originally needed a total of 850 genes but only required 250 when synonymous signal was removed. Our study shows that, in order to effectively use next-gen data to correctly resolve difficult phylogenetic relationships, it is necessary to assess the effects of synonymous substitutions and third codon positions.

AB The genomics era has opened up exciting possibilities in the field of conservation biology by enabling genomic analyses of threatened species that previously were limited to model organisms. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the collection of genome-wide data allow for more robust studies of the demographic history of populations and adaptive variation associated with fitness and local adaptation. Genomic analyses can also advance management efforts for threatened wild and captive populations by identifying loci contributing to inbreeding depression and disease susceptibility, and predicting fitness consequences of introgression. However, the development of genomic tools in wild species still carries multiple challenges, particularly those associated with computational and sampling constraints. This review provides an overview of the most significant applications of NGS and the implications and limitations of genomic studies in conservation.

AB Background: Anthropogenic land use may influence transmission of multi-host vector-borne pathogens by changing diversity, relative abundance, and community composition of reservoir hosts. These reservoir hosts may have varying competence for vector-borne pathogens depending on species-specific characteristics, such as life history strategy. The objective of this study is to evaluate how anthropogenic land use change influences blood meal species composition and the effects of changing blood meal species composition on the parasite infection rate of the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius pallescens in Panama.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: R. pallescens vectors (N = 643) were collected in different habitat types across a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance. Blood meal species in DNA extracted from these vectors was identified in 243 (40.3%) vectors by amplification and sequencing of a vertebrate-specific fragment of the 12SrRNA gene, and T. cruzi vector infection was determined by pcr. Vector infection rate was significantly greater in deforested habitats as compared to contiguous forests. Forty-two different species of blood meal were identified in R. pallescens, and species composition of blood meals varied across habitat types. Mammals (88.3%) dominated R. pallescens blood meals. Xenarthrans (sloths and tamanduas) were the most frequently identified species in blood meals across all habitat types. A regression tree analysis indicated that blood meal species diversity, host life history strategy (measured as r(max), the maximum intrinsic rate of population increase), and habitat type (forest fragments and peridomiciliary sites) were important determinants of vector infection with T. cruzi. The mean intrinsic rate of increase and the skewness and variability of r(max) were positively associated with higher vector infection rate at a site.
   Conclusions/Significance: In this study, anthropogenic landscape disturbance increased vector infection with T. cruzi, potentially by changing host community structure to favor hosts that are short-lived with high reproductive rates.

AB Connectivity has fundamental consequences for the productivity, persistence and management of coral reefs. The area and position of adjacent mangroves and seagrass can affect the demography of reef fish populations and the composition of reefal assemblages. To date, no studies have attempted to partition the influences of these habitats on reef fish assemblages. We used an exploratory seascape approach to separate the effects of connectivity with mangroves and seagrass on reef fish in Moreton Bay, Australia. We then compared the performance of seascape connectivity and reef complexity (i.e. coral cover, rugosity and area) in structuring these assemblages. Our results suggest a hierarchy of seascape connectivity effects, with reef fish assemblages being primarily distinguished by isolation (i.e. separation distance) from mangroves and secondarily by proximity (an index incorporating habitat isolation and area) to seagrass. Importantly, measures of reef complexity were only useful in separating reef fish assemblages within levels of connectivity with mangroves and seagrass. We demonstrate that neighbouring mangroves and seagrasses can exert different effects on reef fish assemblages, with 25% of all species being primarily influenced by mangroves and a different 25% being affected by seagrass. These findings have important implications for the design of marine reserve networks. They show that position in the seascape can be of greater significance than reef area or complexity to the composition of reef fish assemblages and highlight the value of incorporating seascape connectivity into conservation planning.

AB Early detection of population declines is essential to prevent extinctions and to ensure sustainable harvest. We evaluated the performance of two N-e estimators to detect population declines: the two-sample temporal method and a one-sample method based on linkage disequilibrium (LD). We used simulated data representing a wide range of population sizes, sample sizes and number of loci. Both methods usually detect a population decline only one generation after it occurs if N-e drops to less than approximately 100, and 40 microsatellite loci and 50 individuals are sampled. However, the LD method often out performed the temporal method by allowing earlier detection of less severe population declines (N-e approximately 200). Power for early detection increased more rapidly with the number of individuals sampled than with the number of loci genotyped, primarily for the LD method. The number of samples available is therefore an important criterion when choosing between the LD and temporal methods. We provide guidelines regarding design of studies targeted at monitoring for population declines. We also report that 40 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers give slightly lower precision than 10 microsatellite markers. Our results suggest that conservation management and monitoring strategies can reliably use genetic based methods for early detection of population declines.

AB The role of carrion in food webs is governed by complex competitive interactions among a wide range of taxa. Although this competition is known to be influenced by several biotic and abiotic factors, relatively few data are available from highly altered landscapes. We investigated the fate of mouse carcasses in an intensively farmed region in Indiana, USA, using remote cameras. Vertebrates removed 234 of 266 (88%) carcasses within two weeks after placement. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) were the predominant scavengers, removing 184 of 197 (93%) carcasses for which a scavenger could be identified. Air temperature influenced carcass removal by vertebrates only at higher temperatures, with fewer carcasses removed as temperatures increased over similar to 22 degrees C. Elevated densities of mesopredators, coupled with the reduced search area for carrion due to the sparse distribution of forested habitat, likely were responsible for the rapid discovery and high level of carcass removal by vertebrates compared to previous investigations. Our data suggest that in agricultural landscapes, the competitive balance for carrion can differ substantially from that found in more pristine habitats. Moreover, the monopolization of carrion resources by abundant mesopredators may have negative consequences for other species that use carrion.

AB Lizards have been model organisms for ecological and evolutionary studies from individual to community levels at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here we highlight lizards as models for phylogeographic studies, review the published population genetics/phylogeography literature to summarize general patterns and trends and describe some studies that have contributed to conceptual advances. Our review includes 426 references and 452 case studies: this literature reflects a general trend of exponential growth associated with the theoretical and empirical expansions of the discipline. We describe recent lizard studies that have contributed to advances in understanding of several aspects of phylogeography, emphasize some linkages between phylogeography and speciation and suggest ways to expand phylogeographic studies to test alternative pattern-based modes of speciation. Allopatric speciation patterns can be tested by phylogeographic approaches if these are designed to discriminate among four alternatives based on the role of selection in driving divergence between populations, including: (i) passive divergence by genetic drift; (ii) adaptive divergence by natural selection (niche conservatism or ecological speciation); and (iii) socially-mediated speciation. Here we propose an expanded approach to compare patterns of variation in phylogeographic data sets that, when coupled with morphological and environmental data, can be used to to discriminate among these alternative speciation patterns.

AB Alien plant invaders significantly threaten native community diversity, although it is poorly understood whether invasion initiates a linear or non-linear loss of resident species. Where low abundances of an invader have little impact on native species diversity, then a threshold level may exist, above which native communities rapidly decline. Our aim was to assess the broadscale effects of an alien thicket-forming shrub, lantana (Lantana carnara L.), on wet sclerophyll forest in southeastern Australia. Vascular plant species richness, abundance and composition were measured and compared along a gradient of lantana invasion. There was a strong negative non-linear relationship between native species richness and lantana cover, indicative of an impact threshold. Native species richness remained stable below 75% lantana cover, but declined rapidly above this threshold level, leading to compositional change. Thus, sparse lantana infestations had evidently little effect on the resident community, with impacts elicited at an advanced stage of invasion. The impact of lantana was pervasive, with all major structural groups (i.e. ferns, herbs, shrubs, trees and vines) exhibiting significant species losses; however, the rate of species loss was relatively greater for tree and shrub species, signalling a shift in vegetation structure from tall open forest to low, dense lantana-dominated shrubland. Potentially, broadscale conservation of species diversity could be achieved by maintaining lantana infestations below the 75% cover impact threshold at sites containing regionally common species that are also widely represented in non-invaded vegetation. This would enable targeted invader eradication at sites of high conservation value (i.e. those containing regionally rare species or endangered ecological communities). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Marine conservation programs in Oceania are increasingly turning to precautionary and adaptive management, particularly approaches which emphasize local participation and customary management. Although the application of community-based natural resource management is widespread in the region, the full integration of local knowledge and practices into the design, implementation, and monitoring of community-based conservation programs has been limited. There is also little empirical data to show whether or not community-based conservation projects are meeting their stated objectives. This paper summarizes an integrated method for selecting Marine Protected Area (MPA) sites and presents empirical evidence that illustrates how an MPA that was largely conceived using indigenous ecological knowledge and existing sea tenure governance (i.e., customary management practices), as part of a regional precautionary and adaptive community-based management plan, is showing signs of biological and social success. More generally, the paper shows how hybrid natural and social research approaches in tandem with customary management for designing MPAs can protect coral reefs in Oceania.

AB The determinants of local species richness of diurnal Lepidoptera were studied in 68 agricultural landscapes in five geographic regions by sampling field margins, road verges, forest edges and patches of semi-natural grassland. Butterflies and day-active moths were counted and habitat quality was measured in 1191 separate 50 m transects. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were built to explain patterns of species richness by first adjusting for the effects of geographic location and weather conditions during the butterfly counts. Habitat type and quality largely determined local species richness, whereas the explanatory power of the local habitat quantity and management variables was limited. Species richness was highest in patches of semi-natural grassland, second highest in forest edges and lowest in road and field margins surrounded by cultivated fields. Species richness increased with abundance of nectar flowers and margin width, and decreased with increasing soil moisture and within-patch openness. Landscape openness showed a unimodal response with a maximum species richness at intermediate values. Largely the same variables affected species richness of moths and butterflies, but moths appeared to be more sensitive to negative effects of windiness and intensive management and less dependent on abundant flowers and increasing margin width than butterflies. The results highlight the significance of even small patches of semi-natural grasslands and open, sunny forest edges for species richness in typical modern farmland with relatively intensive agriculture. The effectiveness of agri-environment schemes in promoting biodiversity could be increased by directing more efforts to maintenance and restoration of these habitats. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB An emerging infectious facial cancer threatens Tasmanian devils with extinction. The disease is likely to occur across the range of the devil within 5 years. This urgent time frame requires management options that can be implemented immediately: the establishment of insurance populations, in captivity, wild-living on islands, and aiming for eradication in areas that can be isolated. The long-term options of the spontaneous or assisted evolution of resistance or development of a field-deliverable vaccine are unlikely to be available in time. The disease's characteristic allograft transmission through intimate contact simplifies isolation of insurance populations and breaking transmission in suppression trials. Better knowledge of contact matrices in wild devils will help focus timing and demographic targets of removals. A metapopulation approach is needed that integrates captive and wild-living island and peninsula (disease suppression) populations to minimize the loss of genetic diversity over 50 years until either extinction and reintroduction can occur, resistance evolves or a field-deliverable vaccine is developed. Given the importance of the insurance populations and the low genetic diversity of devils, a conservative target for retention of 95% genetic diversity is recommended. Encouraging preliminary results of the first disease-suppression trial on a large peninsula show fewer late stage tumors and no apparent population decline. Limiting geographic spread or suppressing the disease on a broadscale are both unlikely to be feasible. Since the synergy of devil decline and impending fox establishment could have devastating consequences for Tasmanian wildlife, it is crucial to manage the dynamics of new and old predator species together.

AB In this paper, the role played by habitat diversity in the landscape on species richness and on the stability of farmland bird communities was investigated. Species richness was estimated on 374 samples monitored in farmland by the French breeding bird survey during the 2001-2005 period. A capture-recapture approach was used to estimate species richness accounting for the variation in detection probability among species of the 100 most common species detected in farmland. Landscape structure and composition were measured both in farmland and in adjacent habitats. The independent effect of each variable on community richness and stability was further assessed using hierarchical variance partitioning and taking spatial autocorrelation into account. A strong matrix effect was detected: non-cropped land deeply influenced richness and stability of bird assemblages. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Backgrounds and Aims Identification of physiological traits associated with leaf photosynthetic rate (P-n) is important for improving potential productivity of rice (Oryza sativa). The objectives of this study were to develop a model which can explain genotypic variation and ontogenetic change of P-n in rice under optimal conditions as a function of leaf nitrogen content per unit area (N) and stomatal conductance (g(s)), and to quantify the effects of interaction between N and g(s) on the variation of P-n.
   Methods P-n, N and g(s) were measured at different developmental stages for the topmost fully expanded leaves in ten rice genotypes with diverse backgrounds grown in pots (2002) and in the field (2001 and 2002). A model of P-n that accounts for carboxylation and CO2 diffusion processes, and assumes that the ratio of internal conductance to g(s) is constant, was constructed, and its goodness of fit was examined.
   Key Results Considerable genotypic differences in P-n were evident for rice throughout development in both the pot and field experiments. The genotypic variation of P-n was correlated with that of g(s) at a given stage, and the change of P-n with plant development was closely related to the change of N. The variation of g(s) among genotypes was independent of that of N. The model explained well the variation in P-n of the ten genotypes grown under different conditions at different developmental stages.
   Conclusions The response of P-n to increased N differs with g(s), and the increase in P-n of genotypes with low gs is smaller than that of genotypes with high g(s). Therefore, simultaneous improvements of these two traits are essential for an effective breeding of rice genotypes with increased P-n.

AB (.) In this study we investigated the effects of temperature on fungal growth and tested whether the differences in fungal growth were related to the effects of temperature on carbon movement to, or within, the fungus.
   (.) Growth curves and C uptake-transfer-translocation measurements were obtained for three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) isolates cultured within a 6-30 degrees C temperature range. A series of experiments with a model fungal isolate, Glomus intraradices, was used to examine the effects of temperature on lipid body and 33 P movement, and to investigate the role of acclimation and incubation time.
   (.) Temperature effects on AMF growth were both direct and indirect because, despite clear independent root and AMF growth responses in some cases, the uptake and translocation of 13 C was also affected within the temperature range tested. Root C uptake and, to a lesser extent, C translocation in the fungus, were reduced by low temperatures (< 18 C). Uptake and translocation of 33 P by fungal hyphae were, by contrast, similar between 10 and 25 C.
   (.) We conclude that temperature, between 6 and 18 C, reduces AMF growth, and that C movement to the fungus is involved in this response.

AB Dispersal is an important influence on species' distributions, patch colonization and population persistence in fragmented habitat. We studied the impacts of habitat fragmentation resulting from establishment of an exotic pine plantation on dispersal of the marsupial carnivore, Antechinus agilis. We applied spatial analyses of individual multilocus microsatellite genotypes and mitochondrial haplotypes to study patterns of gene flow in fragmented habitat and natural habitat 'control' areas, and how this is affected by the spatial dispersion of habitat patches, the presence of corridors and a 'mainland' source of migrants. Spatial analysis of molecular variance and partial Mantel tests confirmed the absence of cryptic barriers to gene flow in continuous habitat, which if present would confound the comparison of genetic structures in fragmented vs. unfragmented habitats. Spatial genotypic structure suggested that although dispersal was male-biased in both habitat types, fragmentation restricted dispersal of males more than that of females and the degree of restriction of male dispersal was dependent on the geographical isolation of the patch. The scale of positive genotypic structure in fragmented habitat was restricted to the two closest patches for females and the three closest patches for males. Our results provide evidence for significantly increased gene flow through habitat corridors relative to that across the matrix and for significantly lower gene flow between 'mainland' unfragmented habitat and habitat patches relative to that within either habitat type, suggesting a behavioural barrier to crossing habitat interfaces.

AB There have been few contemporary extinctions in the sea, which suggests marine species are either less vulnerable to extinction than terrestrial species, or marine extinctions may have gone unnoticed. We consider whether a large conspicuous reef fish, the giant humphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum), is likely to have declined across much of its geographical range. Informal knowledge was used to determine the status of the giant humphead parrotfish. We first surveyed fishers' knowledge of this parrotfish at 12 lightly exploited islands in the Lau group, Fiji and then compiled a global inventory of available information. In the Lau islands, Fiji, fishers reported this parrotfish as previously abundant, but it had not been caught at six islands since at least 1990 and was considered rare at another four islands. The parrotfish had been captured recently (since the 1990s) at three islands where fishers did not target parrotfishes regularly. A compilation of giant humphead parrotfish records provided by local scientists at 39 locations in 31 Indo-Pacific nations suggested this fish is locally common only inside areas where fishing is prohibited and that it is currently globally rare. Local densities of the giant humphead parrotfish were negatively correlated to a categorical scale of fishing pressure across six Indo-Pacific locations. The retrospective discovery of local disappearances and global rarity of a distinctive and formerly prominent reef fish is consistent with the hypothesis that the capacity to detect disappearances of exploitation-vulnerable species in the sea is lower than expected.

AB Cloud forests are distributed in the Neotropics, from northern Mexico to Argentina, under very specific ecological conditions, namely slopes with high humidity input from clouds and mist. Its distribution in Mesoamerica is highly fragmented, similar to an archipelago, and taxa are thus frequently represented as sets of isolated populations, each restricted to particular mountain ranges and often showing a high degree of divergence, both morphologically and genetically. The common bush-tanager (Chlorospingus ophthalmicus, Aves Thraupidae) inhabits cloud forests from eastern and southern Mexico south to northwestern Argentina. Here we use 676 bp of mtDNA (around the ATPase 8 gene) to explore the genetic variation and phylogeographic structure of the Mexican populations of C ophthalmicus. Phylogenctic analyses of mtDNA sequences indicate deep genetic structure. Five major clades, which segregate according to geographic breaks, are identified (starting from the deepest one in the phylogeny): (1) Southern Chiapas and Northern Central America, (2) Tuxtlas massif, (3) Sierra Madre del Sur, (4) Eastern Oaxaca and Northern Chiapas, and (5) Sierra Madre Oriental. The long history of isolation undergone by each clade, as suggested by the phylogeny, implies that the species status of each of them should be revised. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Coenagrion mercuriale (Charpentier) (Odonata: Zygoptera) is one of Europe's most threatened damselflies and is listed in the European Habitats directive. We combined an intensive mark-release-recapture (MRR) study with a microsatellite-based genetic analysis for C. mercuriale from the Itchen Valley, UK, as part of an effort to understand the dispersal characteristics of this protected species. MRR data indicate that adult damselflies are highly sedentary, with only a low frequency of interpatch movement that is predominantly to neighbouring sites. This restricted dispersal leads to significant genetic differentiation throughout most of the Itchen Valley, except between areas of continuous habitat, and isolation by distance (IBD), even though the core populations are separated by less than 10 km. An urban area separating some sites had a strong effect on the spatial genetic structure. Average pairwise relatedness between individual damselflies is positive at short distances, reflecting fine-scale genetic clustering and IBD both within- and between-habitat patches. Damselflies from a fragmented habitat have higher average kinship than those from a large continuous population, probably because of poorer dispersal and localized breeding in the former. Although indirect estimates of gene flow must be interpreted with caution, it is encouraging that our results indicate that the spatial pattern of genetic variation matches closely with that expected from direct observations of movement. These data are further discussed with respect to possible barriers to dispersal within the study site and the ecology and conservation of C. mercuriale. To our knowledge, this is the first report of fine-scale genetic structuring in any zygopteran species.

AB Multivariate regression tree methodology is developed and illustrated in a study predicting the abundance of several cooccurring plant species in Missouri Ozark forests. The technique is a variation of the approach of Segal (1992) for longitudinal data. It has the potential to be applied to many different types of problems in which analysts want to predict the simultaneous cooccurrence of several dependent variables. Multivariate regression trees can also be used as an alternative to cluster analysis in situations where clusters are defined by a set of independent variables and the researcher wants clusters as homogeneous as possible with respect to a group of dependent variables.

AB Organisms may respond to changing environments by evading the new conditions or by adapting to them. Recently, a large body of evidence has been collected indicating that phenotypic adaptation to climate change is widespread. Adaptation may be achieved by phenotypic adjustment or by changes in the genetic composition of populations. Both processes can assure the survival of populations in changing environments, but at different time scales and at different costs. Recent studies indicate that the mechanisms leading to adaptive phenotypic changes in birds may be complex, involving both plastic response and genetic change. Changes in the timing of breeding, for instance, seem to be predominantly caused by phenotypic adjustment to environmental conditions. Shifts in the genetic composition of populations have been demonstrated to be involved in recent changes in morphology and migratory behaviour. The presence of considerable amounts of additive genetic variation within and among avian populations, and examples of rapid evolutionary response to rare climatic events suggest that birds have a high potential for adaptive evolutionary change. However, it is presently unclear whether this is a general pattern, and which factors actually limit the adaptability of avian populations. Antagonistic genetic correlations and maladaptive phenotypic responses (evolutionary traps) are probably the most important constrains to microevolutionary change. Furthermore, the loss of genetic variation due to population declines, and gene flow in the presence of among-population variation in the response to climate change may limit the rate of adaptive evolution. Future research should try to identify the targets of selection and gauge the importance of constraints to microevolutionary change.

AB A phylogenetic framework is essential for understanding the origin and evolution of metazoan development. Despite a number of recent molecular studies and a rich fossil record of sponges and cnidarians, the evolutionary relationships of the early branching metazoan groups to each other and to a putative outgroup, the choanoflagellates, remain uncertain. This situation may be the result of the limited amount of phylogenetic information found in single genes and the small number of relevant taxa surveyed. To alleviate the effect of these analytical factors in the phylogenetic reconstruction of early branching metazoan lineages, we cloned multiple protein-coding genes from two choanoflagellates and diverse sponges, cnidarians, and a ctenophore. Comparisons of sequences for alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin, elongation factor 2, HSP90, and HSP70 robustly support the hypothesis that choanoflagellates are closely affiliated with animals. However, analyses of single and concatenated amino acid sequences fail to resolve the relationships either between early branching metazoan groups or between Metazoa and choanoflagellates. We demonstrate that variable rates of evolution among lineages, sensitivity of the analyses to taxon selection, and conflicts in the phylogenetic signal contained in different amino acid sequences obscure the phylogenetic associations among the early branching Metazoa. These factors raise concerns about the ability to resolve the phylogenetic history of animals with molecular sequences. A consensus view of animal evolution may require investigations of genome-scale characters.

AB The effect of a population's location on the landscape on genetic variation has been of interest to population genetics for more than half a century. However, most studies do not consider broadscale biogeography when interpreting genetic data. In this study, we propose an operational definition of a peripheral population, and then explore whether peripheral populations of Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) have less genetic variation than core populations at nine microsatellite loci. We show that peripheral populations of lynx have fewer mean numbers of alleles per population and lower expected heterozygosity. This is surprising, given the lynx's capacity to move long distances, but can be explained by the fact that peripheral populations often have smaller population sizes, limited opportunities for genetic exchange and may be disproportionately affected by ebbs and flows of species' geographical range.

AB Sand flies in the Lutzomyia longipalpis species complex include the primary vector of Leishmania chagasi, the etiologic agent of visceral leishmaniasis in the Neotropics. Twelve L. longipalpis populations from South and Central America were compared using the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene from the mitochondrial genome. The haplotype profiles for each population revealed that the majority of sequence variation was inter-population (98%) rather than intra-population, suggesting that sequence polymorphisms at the COI locus should provide excellent characters for the study of phylogenetic relationships among populations. Phylogenetic reconstruction using distance (neighbor-joining) and maximum parsimony analysis revealed the existence of four clades among the L. longipalpis populations studied: (1) Laran, (2) Brazilian, (3) cis-Andean and (4) trans-Andean. We suggest that these clades represent species. A biogeographical interpretation of the molecular phylogeny suggests that the process of speciation in the L. longipalpis complex began in the Pliocene, from a sub-Andean-Amazonian gene pool resulting from the Andean orogeny (formation of the East Andean Cordillera). The four clades probably diverged as a result of vicariance events that occurred throughout the late Pliocene and Pleistocene. We propose and discuss several historical scenarios, based on the biogeography and historical geology of Central and South America. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

AB We tested the hypothesis that photosynthetic and growth responses to phosphorus (P) are functions of differences in the partitioning of nitrogen (N) among different compounds, particularly ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). We tested this hypothesis in: (a) a greenhouse experiment with mycorrhizal seedlings of Pinus pinaster Ait. grown in sand culture for 4 months with six factorial combinations of N (0.125 and 2.0 mM) and P (0.02, 0.08 and 0.34 mM); and (b) a field study in which P was applied at five rates (up to 175 kg ha(-1)) to 2-year-old P. pinaster growing on P-deficient siliceous sand. After 4 months of nutrient addition or 2 years after fertilizer application, we measured light-saturated rates of photosynthesis, growth, and N and P allocation in needles. Growth of P. pinaster increased significantly with increasing concentrations of P, as did the concentration of P in needles. Concentrations of P and Rubisco were positively related, whereas those of N and Rubisco were unrelated. At low-P supply, the Rubisco/Chl ratio varied between 8.5 and 12 mmol mol(-1). With P supply in excess of requirement (needle N:P ratio = 2-12) the Rubisco/Chl ratio increased to between 24 and 26 mmol mol(-1). Rates of light-saturated photosynthesis were unaffected by P supply because adequate concentrations of P were maintained in plants in all treatments. Orthophosphate accumulated in needles of plants receiving a high P supply, which may allow growth to continue for periods under P deficiency, provided that other nutrients also accumulate. In the case of N, Rubisco may fill this role.

AB To examine the effects of different solar irradiances on leaf characteristics at the leaf primordium and expansion stages, we shaded parts of branches in the upper canopies of two adult beech trees, Fagus crenata Blume and Fagus japonica Maxim., for 4 years. The treatments during the leaf primordium and leaf expansion stages, respectively, were: (1) high light and high light (H, control), (2) high light and low light (I-IL), (3) low light and low light (LL), and (4) low light and high light (LII). Both number of cell layers in palisade tissue and individual leaf area were affected by the previous-year irradiance, whereas cell length of palisade tissue was larger in LH leaves than in LL leaves, suggesting determination by current-year irradiance. Lamina chlorophyll/nitrogen ratio was higher in HL and LL leaves than in LI-I leaves, suggesting determination by current-year irradiance. Diurnal minimum values of lear water potential measured under sunlit conditions were lower in H and LH leaves than in HL and LL leaves. Effective osmotic adjustment was found in H and LH leaves, suggesting that leaf water relations were affected by current-year irradiance. Net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance measured under sunlight conditions were higher in H and LH leaves than in I-IL and LL leaves. Thus, effects of current-year irradiance had a greater effect on leaf-area-based daily carbon gain than previous-year irradiance.

AB Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) function as central regulators of both the cell cycle and transcription. CDK activation depends on phosphorylation by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). Different CAKs have been identified in budding yeast, fission yeast, and metazoans. All known CAKs belong to the extended CDK family. The sole budding yeast CAK, CAK1, and one of the two CAKs in fission yeast, csk1, have diverged considerably from other CDKs. Cell cycle regulatory components have been largely conserved in eukaryotes; however, orthologs of neither CAK1 nor csk1 have been identified in other species to date. To determine the evolutionary relationships of yeast and metazoan CAKs, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the extended CDK family in budding yeast, fission yeast, humans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We observed that there were 10 clades for CDK-related genes, of which seven appeared ancestral, containing both yeast and metazoan genes. The four clades that contain CDKs that regulate transcription by phosphorylating the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II generally have only a single orthologous gene in each species of yeast and metazoans. In contrast, the ancestral cell cycle CDK (analogous to budding yeast CDC28) gave rise to a number of genes in metazoans, as did the ancestor of budding yeast PHO85. One ancestral clade is unique in that there are fission yeast and metazoan members, but there is no budding yeast ortholog, suggesting that it was lost subsequent to evolutionary divergence. Interestingly, CAK1 and csk1 branch together with high bootstrap support values. We used both the relative apparent synapomorphy analysis (RASA) method in combination with the S-F method of sampling reduced character sets and gamma-corrected distance methods to confirm that the CAK1/csk1 association was not an artifact of long-branch attraction. This result suggests that CAK1 and csk1 are orthologs and that a central aspect of CAK regulation has been conserved in budding and fission yeast. Although there are metazoan CDK-family members for which we could not define ancestral lineage, our analysis failed to identify metazoan CAK1/csk1 orthologs, suggesting that if the CAK1/csk1 gene existed in the metazoan ancestor, it has not been conserved.

AB 1. In this paper we develop a theoretical framework for describing the composition and morphology of leaves on a volumetric basis which is inclusive of both the liquids and internal air space. That framework is then used to link the composition and morphology with the function of leaves.
   2. Leaves are segmented into a functional scheme named a-u-s-V lair space-solution-structure-volume basis) and a measurement scheme named a-q-d-M lair space-liquid-dry matter-Mass basis). Measurements of mass, liquid mass, volume and fractional air space are necessary to (partially) link the two schemes.
   3. The liquid content of leaves can be used to infer the mode of mechanical support and, hence, the likely values of air space, solution and structure. For example, if a leaf has a high liquid content, then it cannot have a large volumetric fraction of structure (which is largely made of dry matter) and is unlikely to have large internal air spaces.
   4. Based on measurements of individual leaf components, the specific gravity of the non-gaseous fraction in leaves would usually be in the range 1-1.3. Consequently, the specific gravity of leaves would be most sensitive to variation in fractional air space.
   5. For the dimensions typical of most leaves, the surface area to volume ratio of a leaf is determined by leaf thickness (or diameter).
   6. Leaf design is considered in terms of light interception and gas exchange. The requirements for each are essentially incompatible and lead to a trade-off on leaf thickness. However, that relationship is complicated because Variation in fractional air space can potentially lead to broad optima for gas exchange at any given leaf thickness.
   7. The theoretical predictions have not been assessed owing to a lack of measurements of leaf density, fractional air space and Liquid content. However, published data were used to develop the following hypotheses: (1) the mass of nitrogen per unit mass of liquid is relatively constant within leaves; (2) the surface area to volume ratio of leaves is proportional to leaf liquid content. These hypotheses are tested in a subsequent paper.

AB The biochemically based leaf photosynthesis model proposed by Farquhar et al. (1980) and the stomatal conductance model proposed by Jarvis (1976) were parameterized for walnut. Responses of photosynthesis to CO2 and irradiance were used to determine the key parameters of the photosynthesis model. Concurrently, stomatal conductance responses to leaf irradiance (Q), leaf temperature (T-1), water vapor pressure deficit at the leaf surface (D), and air CO2, concentration at the leaf surface (C-s) were used to parameterize the stomatal conductance model. To test the generality of the model parameters, measurements were made on leaves from a 20-year-old tree growing in the field, and from sunlit and shaded greenhouse-grown seedlings. The three key parameters of the photosynthesis model (maximum carboxylation rate V-camx electron transport capacity J(max), and dark respiration rate Rd) and the key parameter of the conductance model (reference stomatal conductance, g(sref)) were linearly correlated with the amount of leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area. Unique relationships could be used to describe nitrogen effects on these parameters for leaves from both the tree and the seedlings. Our data allowed separation of the effects of increasing total photosynthetic apparatus per unit leaf area from the effects of partitioning nitrogen among different pools of this apparatus for foliage acclimation to leaf irradiance. Strong correlations were found between stomatal conductance g(s) and Q, D and C-s, whereas the relationship between g(s) and T-1 was weak. Based on these parameterizations, the model adequately predicted leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance when tested with an independent set of data obtained for the tree and seedlings. Total light-driven electron flows derived from chlorophyll fluorescence data obtained at different leaf temperatures were consistent with values computed by the model. The model was also tested with branch bag data acquired from a three-year-old potted walnut tree. Despite a relatively large variance between observed and simulated values, the model predicted stomatal conductance and photosynthesis reasonably well at the branch scale. The results indic ate that the photosynthesis-conductance model developed here is robust and can be applied to walnut trees and seedlings under various environmental conditions where water is non-limiting.

AB This paper discusses the effects of intercropping and tree pruning on root distribution and soil water depletion in an alley cropping system with Acacia saligna and Sorghum bicolor in northern Kenya. Root distribution was determined by destructive sampling, and the soil water suction was measured with tensiometers and gypsum blocks, both up to 150 cm depth. The root systems of the intercropped trees and crops were distinguished using the natural C-13 discrimination between C-3 and C-4 plants. The root carbohydrate contents were used to estimate plant water stress integrated over time. The highest root length density was always measured in the topsoil, regardless of season or cropping system. In the dry season, the proportion of roots under the tree row compared to the alley was higher than during the wet season; the same was found for the proportion of roots in the subsoil compared to the topsoil. Pruning decreased the total root length density of sole cropped trees by 47%. The highest root length density was found when the pruned trees were intercropped with Sorghum. If the trees were not pruned, combining trees and crops did not increase root length density. Intercropping resulted in a spatial separation of the root systems of trees and crops between the hedgerows, Sorghum having more roots in the topsoil and the trees having more roots in the subsoil under alley cropping than in monoculture. At the hedgerow of the agroforestry system, however, the root systems of trees and crop overlapped and more roots were found than the sum of roots of sole cropped trees and crops. Soil water depletion was higher under the tree row than in the alley and higher in alley cropping than in monocultural systems. Water competition between tree and crop was confirmed by the carbohydrate analyses showing lower sugar contents of roots in agroforestry than in monoculture. The agroforestry combination used the soil water between the hedgerows more efficiently than the sole cropped trees or crops, as water uptake of the trees reached deeper and started earlier after the flood irrigation than of the Sorghum, whereas the crop could better utilize topsoil water. Under the experimental conditions, the root system of the alley cropped Acacia and Sorghum exploited a larger soil volume utilizing soil resources more efficiently than the respective monocultures.

AB Biochemical, histological, physiological, and genetic evidence indicates that dinoflagellates symbiotic with marine invertebrates are a heterogeneous complex of taxa, representing at least five genera in three orders. Despite a wealth of data regarding morphological, biochemical, and behavioral differences among symbiotic dinoflagellates, knowledge concerning patterns of diversification is limited. I analyzed approximately 900 bp of the 5' end of the large-subunit ribosomal RNA gene from 14 dinoflagellate isolates: six cultured Symbiodinium specimens, two cultured symbiotic Gymnodinium, two algal samples isolated from reef-building corals, an algal sample obtained from cultures of the jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana, and three free-living Gymnodinium isolates. Results show that morphological similarities among the examined symbiotic taxa do not necessarily correspond with molecular phylogeny. The included Symbiodinium tars represent a paraphyletic assemblage while Gymnodinium is reconstructed as a polyphyletic assemblage. Analysis indicates that all the included symbiotic dinoflagellates descended from a common, symbiotic ancestor (though within the dinoflagellates, symbiosis is a polyphyletic trait). Additionally, two free-living dinoflagellates emerge within the symbiotic clade, suggesting that the symbiotic lifestyle has been lost at least once in this group. It has been hypothesized that rates of evolution within mutualistic endosymbioses should be reduced relative to free-living fare. However, results indicate that rates of molecular, morphological, biochemical and behavioral change are similar among branches leading to symbiotic and free-living dinoflagellates.

TI Sorting out tigers (Panthera tigris): mitochondrial sequences, nuclear

SO ANIMAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Sequences from complete mitochondrial cytochrome b genes of 34 tigers support the hypothesis that Sumatran tigers are diagnostically distinct from mainland populations. None of the latter, including Bengals, Siberians, or Indochinese tigers, were found to have fixed diagnostic characters. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences confirms these results. Within the framework of a phylogenetic species concept, current evidence thus supports the recognition of two distinct taxa, and within the context of this definition they could be ranked at the species level. This paper also documents a previously unrecognized nuclear insert of mitochondrial DNA that includes, minimally, mitochondrial homologues of a control region that lacks the feline mitochondrial repeat sequences, a complete cytochrome b gene, and complete tRNAThr and tRNAPro genes. In a phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear cytochrome b-like sequences and various feline mitochondrial sequences, the nuclear insert clusters with lion mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences, which suggests the insert is at least as old as the split between lions and tigers. The results of this study emphasize the importance of doing more to conserve Sumatran tigers. Because they are underrepresented in zoos relative to Bengals and Siberians, an effort should be made to increase captive breeding stocks of Sumatrans. That Sumatrans are a distinct taxonomic entity relative to mainland populations can be used in educational programs to increase conservation efforts within Indonesia.

AB The vertical profile of stable carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C) of leaves was analyzed for 13 tree species in a cool-temperate deciduous forest in Japan. The vertical distribution of long-term averaged delta(13)C in atmospheric CO2 (delta(a)) was estimated from delta(13)C of dry matter from NADP-malic enzyme type C-4 plant (Zea mays L. var. saccharata Sturt.) grown at a tower in the forest for 32 days, assuming constant Delta value (3.3 parts per thousand) in Z. mays against height. The delta(a) value obtained from delta(13)C in Z. mays was lowest at the forest floor (-9.30 +/- 0.03 parts per thousand), increased with height, and was almost constant above 10 m (-7.14 +/- 0.14 parts per thousand). Then leaf Delta values for the tree species were calculated from tree leaf delta(13)C and delta(a). Mean leaf Delta values for the three tall deciduous species (Fraxinus mandshurica, Ulmus davidiana, and Alnus hirsuta) were significantly different among three height levels in the forest: 23.1 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand at the forest floor (understory), 21.4 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand in lower canopy, and 20.5 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand in upper canopy. The true difference in tree leaf Delta among the forest height levels might be even greater, because Delta in Z. mays probably increased with shading by up to similar to 1 parts per thousand. The difference in tree leaf Delta among the forest height levels would be mainly due to decreasing intercellular CO2 (C-i) with the increase in irradiance. Potential assimilation rate for the three species probably increased with height, since leaf nitrogen content on an area basis for these species also increased with height. However, the increase in stomatal conductance for these tree species would fail to meet the increase in potential assimilation rate, which might lead to increasing the degree of stomatal limitation in photosynthesis with height.

ID TRICKLE IRRIGATION; TEMPERATURE; MOISTURE; ROOTS; WATER
AB Although use of micro-irrigation has risen steadily in Georgia, few studies have been reported describing its effect on yield or rooting distribution of tomato (Licopersicon esculentum). The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of mulch type (plastic mesh and straw) and micro-irrigation on soil physical properties and growth of 'Celebrity' tomato. In 1986, an experiment was initiated on a Cecil sandy loam (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic, Typic Kanhapludult) at Griffin, GA. Tomato yield and root growth, soil temperature, and water potential in 1987 and 1988 were compared using black plastic mesh and straw mulches and three micro-irrigation frequencies: control (no irrigation), daily, and twice weekly. Soil properties beneath the two types of mulches were compared in terms of surface evaporation, measured during 24-h periods several times each year, and bulk density, organic C, pH, infiltration rate, and cone index measured at the end of the 1988 growing season. Straw mulch resulted in a significantly greater infiltration rate, and lower pH, bulk density, surface evaporation, cone index, soil temperature and matric potential than the plastic mulch. Yields were higher under the straw mulch compared to the plastic mulch and irrigation increased yield with a straw mulch in 1987 but not 1988. Yields were not increased by irrigation of the plastic mulch treatment. Straw mulches have the potential to improve tomato yields in high-temperature environments, provided soil pH is controlled.

AB Spectroscopy is becoming an increasingly powerful tool to alleviate the challenges of traditional measurements of key plant traits at the leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales. Spectroscopic methods often rely on statistical approaches to reduce data redundancy and enhance useful prediction of physiological traits. Given the mechanistic uncertainty of spectroscopic techniques, genetic modification of plant biochemical pathways may affect reflectance spectra causing predictive models to lose power. The objectives of this research were to assess over two separate years, whether a predictive model can represent natural and imposed variation in leaf photosynthetic potential for different crop cultivars and genetically modified plants, to assess the interannual capabilities of a partial least square regression (PLSR) model, and to determine whether leaf N is a dominant driver of photosynthesis in PLSR models. In 2016, a PLSR analysis of reflectance spectra coupled with gas exchange data was used to build predictive models for photosynthetic parameters including maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (V-c,V-max), maximum electron transport rate (J(max)) and percentage leaf nitrogen ([N]). The model was developed for wild type and genetically modified plants that represent a wide range of photosynthetic capacities. Results show that hyperspectral reflectance accurately predicted V-c,V-max,V- J(max) and [N] for all plants measured in 2016. Applying these PLSR models to plants grown in 2017 resulted in a strong predictive ability relative to gas exchange measurements for V-c,V-max but not for J(max,) and not for genotypes unique to 2017. Building a new model including data collected in 2017 resulted in more robust predictions, with R-2 increases of 17% for V-c,V-max. and 13% Plants generally have a positive correlation between leaf nitrogen and photosynthesis, however, tobacco with reduced Rubisco (SSuD) had significantly higher [N] despite much lower V-c,V-max. The PLSR model was able to accurately predict both V-c,V-max lower and higher leaf [N] for this genotype suggesting that the spectral based estimates of V-c,V-max and leaf nitrogen [N] are independent. These results suggest that the PLSR model can be applied across years, but only to genotypes used to build the model and that the actual mechanism measured with the PLSR technique is not directly related to leaf [N]. The success of the leaf-scale analysis suggests that similar approaches may be successful at the canopy and ecosystem scales but to use these methods across years and between genotypes at any scale, application of accurately populated physical based models based on radiative transfer principles may be required.

AB Melanoma is the deadliest type of skin cancer with highest mortality rate. However, the annihilation in early stage implies a high survival rate therefore, it demands early diagnosis. The accustomed diagnosis methods are costly and cumbersome due to the involvement of experienced experts as well as the requirements for highly equipped environment. The recent advancements in computerized solutions for these diagnoses are highly promising with improved accuracy and efficiency. In this article, we proposed a method for the classification of melanoma and benign skin lesions. Our approach integrates preprocessing, lesion segmentation, features extraction, features selection, and classification. Preprocessing is executed in the context of hair removal by DullRazor, whereas lesion texture and color information are utilized to enhance the lesion contrast. In lesion segmentation, a hybrid technique has been implemented and results are fused using additive law of probability. Serial based method is applied subsequently that extracts and fuses the traits such as color, texture, and HOG (shape). The fused features are selected afterwards by implementing a novel Boltzman Entropy method. Finally, the selected features are classified by Support Vector Machine. The proposed method is evaluated on publically available data set PH2. Our approach has provided promising results of sensitivity 97.7%, specificity 96.7%, accuracy 97.5%, and F-score 97.5%, which are significantly better than the results of existing methods available on the same data set. The proposed method detects and classifies melanoma significantly good as compared to existing methods.

AB Niche differences are key to understanding the distribution and structure of biodiversity. To examine niche differences, we must first characterize how species occupy niche space, and two approaches are commonly used in the ecological literature. The first uses species traits to estimate multivariate trait space (so-called functional trait diversity, FD); the second quantifies the amount of time or evolutionary history captured by a group of species (phylogenetic diversity, PD). It is often-but controversially-assumed that these putative measures of niche space are at a minimum correlated and perhaps redundant, since more evolutionary time allows for greater accumulation of trait changes. This theoretical expectation remains surprisingly poorly evaluated, particularly in the context of multivariate measures of trait diversity. We evaluated the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and trait diversity using analytical and simulation-based methods across common models of trait evolution. We show that PD correlates with FD increasingly strongly as more traits are included in the FD measure. Our results indicate that phylogenetic diversity can be a useful surrogate for high-dimensional trait diversity, but we also show that the correlation weakens when the underlying process of trait evolution includes variation in rate and optima.

AB Climate change projections anticipate increased frequency and intensity of drought stress, but grassland responses to severe droughts and their potential to recover are poorly understood. In many grasslands, high land-use intensity has enhanced productivity and promoted resource-acquisitive species at the expense of resource-conservative ones. Such changes in plant functional composition could affect the resistance to drought and the recovery after drought of grassland ecosystems with consequences for feed productivity resilience and environmental stewardship. In a 12-site precipitation exclusion experiment in upland grassland ecosystems across Switzerland, we imposed severe edaphic drought in plots under rainout shelters and compared them with plots under ambient conditions. We used soil water potentials to scale drought stress across sites. Impacts of precipitation exclusion and drought legacy effects were examined along a gradient of land-use intensity to determine how grasslands resisted to, and recovered after drought. In the year of precipitation exclusion, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in plots under rainout shelters was -15% to -56% lower than in control plots. Drought effects on ANPP increased with drought severity, specified as duration of topsoil water potential psi < -100kPa, irrespective of land-use intensity. In the year after drought, ANPP had completely recovered, but total species diversity had declined by -10%. Perennial species showed elevated mortality, but species richness of annuals showed a small increase due to enhanced recruitment. In general, the more resource-acquisitive grasses increased at the expense of the deeper-rooted forbs after drought, suggesting that community reorganization was driven by competition rather than plant mortality. The negative effects of precipitation exclusion on forbs increased with land-use intensity. Our study suggests a synergistic impact of land-use intensification and climate change on grassland vegetation composition, and implies that biomass recovery after drought may occur at the expense of biodiversity maintenance.

AB Ecosystem services (ES) is a significant research topic with diverse modelling and mapping approaches. However, the variety of approaches along with an inconsistent terminology cause uncertainties concerning the choice of methods. This paper identifies and qualitatively assesses methods for mapping ES in terrestrial landscapes, based on a systematic review of the scientific literature. It further aims to clarify the associated terminology, in particular the concept of landscape and landscape scale. In total, 347 cases of ES mapping were identified in the reviewed papers. Regulating and maintenance services were most commonly mapped (165), followed by cultural (85), and provisioning services (73). For individual ES, a large variation in number of mapping cases was found. This variation may either reflect the perceived importance of the ES, or that different ES can be more or less easily mapped. Overall, Logical models and Empirical models were most commonly used, followed by Extrapolation, Simulation/Process models, Data integration, and Direct mapping. Only twelve percent of all ES mapping cases were validated with empirical data. The review revealed highly diverging views on the spatial extent of landscapes in studies of ES, and that the term landscape is sometimes used rather arbitrarily. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The jaguar is the top predator of the Atlantic Forest (AF), which is a highly threatened biodiversity hotspot that occurs in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. By combining data sets from 14 research groups across the region, we determine the population status of the jaguar and propose a spatial prioritization for conservation actions. About 85% of the jaguar's habitat in the AF has been lost and only 7% remains in good condition. Jaguars persist in around 2.8% of the region, and live in very low densities in most of the areas. The population of jaguars in the AF is probably lower than 300 individuals scattered in small sub-populations. We identified seven Jaguar Conservation Units (JCUs) and seven potential JCUs, and only three of these areas may have >= 50 individuals. A connectivity analysis shows that most of the JCUs are isolated. Habitat loss and fragmentation were the major causes for jaguar decline, but human induced mortality is the main threat for the remaining population. We classified areas according to their contribution to jaguar conservation and we recommend management actions for each of them. The methodology in this study could be used for conservation planning of other carnivore species.

AB Fire is an integral component of the Earth system that will critically affect how terrestrial carbon budgets and living systems respond to climate change. Paleo and observational records document robust positive relationships between fire activity and aridity in many parts of the world on interannual to millennial timescales. Observed increases in fire activity and aridity in many areas over the past several decades motivate curiosity as to the degree to which anthropogenic climate change will alter global fire regimes and subsequently Earth's terrestrial biosphere. Importantly, fire responses to warming are not ubiquitous and effects by humans, fuels, and non-temperature climate variables are also apparent in both paleo and observational datasets. The complicated and interactive relationships among these variables necessitate quantitative modeling to better understand future fire responses to global change. Macro-scale fire models exhibit a wide spectrum of complexity. Correlation-based models are inherently superior at representing the current global mean distribution of fire activity but future projections developed from these models cannot account for important processes such as CO2 fertilization and vegetation response after extreme events. Process-based models address some of these limitations by explicitly modeling vegetation dynamics, but this requires false assumptions about processes that are not yet well understood. Continued empirical evaluation of interactions between fire, vegetation, climate, and humans, and resultant improvements to both correlation- and process-based macro-fire models, are mandatory to better understand the past and future of the Earth system.

AB Ecological theory and evidence suggest that plant community biomass and composition may often be jointly controlled by climatic water availability and soil nutrient supply. To the extent that such colimitation operates, alterations in water availability caused by climatic change may have relatively little effect on plant communities on nutrient-poor soils. We tested this prediction with a 5-y rainfall and nutrient manipulation in a semiarid annual grassland system with highly heterogeneous soil nutrient supplies. On nutrient-poor soils, rainfall addition alone had little impact, but rainfall and nutrient addition synergized to cause large increases in biomass, declines in diversity, and near-complete species turnover. Plant species with resource-conservative functional traits (low specific leaf area, short stature) were replaced by species with resource-acquisitive functional traits (high specific leaf area, tall stature). On nutrient-rich soils, in contrast, rainfall addition alone caused substantial increases in biomass, whereas fertilization had little effect. Our results highlight that multiple resource limitation is a critical aspect when predicting the relative vulnerability of natural communities to climatically induced compositional change and diversity loss.

AB The authenticity and reliability of urbanization levels measured by different indicators in China have not reached a consensus, which may impede our understanding of the process of urbanization and its impacts on the environment. The objective of this study was to describe a reliable method of estimating urbanization level based on the Operational Line-scan System (OLS) on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) nighttime light data and to analyze the dynamics of urbanization levels in China from 1992 to 2012. We calculated the comprehensive urbanization level at the national, provincial, and county scales using a compounded night light index (CNLI) and compared the change rate of CNLI with those of the other two conventional urbanization level indicators, proportion of the nonagricultural population and proportion of built-up area. Our results showed that CNLI derived from the DMSP/OLS data set provided a relatively reliable and accurate measure of the comprehensive urbanization level in China. During the last two decades, China has experienced continued and rapid urbanization with large regional variations. The CNLI increased 3.12 times, from 1.72 x 10(-3) to 7.09 x 10(-3). The annual increases of CNLI in eastern provinces were much faster than those in western provinces. In addition, we found that the rates of change in these three indicators were consistent for most provinces with the exception of the four municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing) and a few eastern coastal provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong). Because the imbalance among population growth, urban expansion and socioeconomic development may affect cities' sustainable development, we should pay more attention to these regions with large disparities between different indicators.

AB Recently, in addition to the popular concept of "ecosystem services" (ES), the term "landscape services" (LS) has come into use. We are examining the question of whether a stronger focus on LS would be useful, particularly with regard to case studies carried out in Germany. Important reasons for introducing the term LS include the prominent role of spatial aspects, the reference to landscape elements and the landscape character, and the relevance of LS for landscape planning. We found no strong arguments for replacing the concept of ES by LS; however, we do prefer a situation-related use of both concepts. We propose the following definition: Landscape services are the contributions of landscapes and landscape elements to human well-being.

AB Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a complex zoonosis that is highly virulent in humans. The largest recorded outbreak of EVD is ongoing in West Africa, outside of its previously reported and predicted niche. We assembled location data on all recorded zoonotic transmission to humans and Ebola virus infection in bats and primates (1976-2014). Using species distribution models these occurrence data were paired with environmental covariates to predict a zoonotic transmission niche covering 22 countries across Central and West Africa. Vegetation, elevation, temperature, evapotranspiration and suspected reservoir bat distributions define this relationship. At-risk areas are inhabited by 22 million people, however the rarity of human outbreaks emphasises the very low probability of transmission to humans. Increasing population sizes and international connectivity by air since the first detection of EVD in 1976 suggest that the dynamics of human-to-human secondary transmission in contemporary outbreaks will be very different to those of the past.

AB The role of Pleistocene climate changes in promoting evolutionary diversification in global biota is well documented, but the great majority of data regarding this subject come from North America and Europe, which were greatly affected by glaciation. The effects of Pleistocene changes on cold- and/or dry-adapted species in tropical areas where glaciers were not present remain sparsely investigated. Many such species are restricted to small areas surrounded by unfavourable habitats, which may represent potential interglacial microrefugia. Here, we analysed the phylogeographic structure and diversification history of seven cactus species in the Pilosocereus aurisetus complex that are restricted to rocky areas with high diversity and endemism within the Neotropical savannas of eastern South America. We combined palaeodistributional estimates with standard phylogeographic approaches based on two chloroplast DNA regions (trnT-trnL and trnS-trnG), exon 1 of the nuclear gene PhyC and 10 nuclear microsatellite loci. Our analyses revealed a phylogeographic history marked by multiple levels of distributional fragmentation, isolation leading to allopatric differentiation and secondary contact among divergent lineages within the complex. Diversification and demographic events appear to have been affected by the Quaternary climatic cycles as a result of isolation in multiple patches of xerophytic vegetation. These small patches presently harbouring P.aurisetus populations seem to operate as microrefugia, both at present and during Pleistocene interglacial periods; the role of such microrefugia should be explored and analysed in greater detail.

AB The long-term impacts of large hydroelectric dams on small-scale fisheries in tropical rivers are poorly known. A promising way to investigate such impacts is to compare and integrate the local ecological knowledge (LEK) of resource users with biological data for the same region. We analyzed the accuracy of fishers' LEK to investigate fisheries dynamics and environmental changes in the Lower Tocantins River (Brazilian Amazon) downstream from a large dam. We estimated fishers' LEK through interviews with 300 fishers in nine villages and collected data on 601 fish landings in five of these villages, 22 years after the dam's establishment (2006-2008). We compared these two databases with each other and with data on fish landings from before the dam's establishment (1981) gathered from the literature. The data obtained based on the fishers' LEK (interviews) and from fisheries agreed regarding the primary fish species caught, the most commonly used type of fishing gear (gill nets) and even the most often used gill net mesh sizes but disagreed regarding seasonal fish abundance. According to the interviewed fishers, the primary environmental changes that occurred after the impoundment were an overall decrease in fish abundance, an increase in the abundance of some fish species and, possibly, the local extinction of a commercial fish species (Semaprochilodus brama). These changes were corroborated by comparing fish landings sampled before and 22 years after the impoundment, which indicated changes in the composition of fish landings and a decrease in the total annual fish production. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that large dams may adversely affect small-scale fisheries downstream and establish a feasible approach for applying fishers' LEK to fisheries management, especially in regions with a low research capacity.

AB Global factors, such as climate change, international trade and introductions of exotic species are often elicited as contributors to the unprecedented rate of disease emergence, but few studies have partitioned these factors for global pandemics. Although contemporary correlative species distribution models (SDMs) can be useful for predicting the spatial patterns of emerging diseases, they focus mainly on the fundamental niche (FN) predictors (i.e. abiotic climate and habitat factors), neglecting dispersal and propagule pressure predictors (PP, number of non-native individuals released into a region). Using a validated, predictive and global SDM, we show that both FN and PP accounted for significant, unique variation to the distribution of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a pathogen implicated in the declines and extinctions of over 200 amphibian species worldwide. Bd was associated positively with vegetation, total trade and introduced amphibian hosts, nonlinearly with annual temperature range and non-significantly with amphibian leg trade or amphibian species richness. These findings provide a rare example where both FN and PP factors are predictive of a global pandemic. Our model should help guide management of this deadly pathogen and the development of other globally predictive models for species invasions and pathogen emergence influenced by FN and PP factors.

AB This paper provides a review of theoretical and practical aspects related to genetic management of forest trees. The implementation of international commitments on forest genetic diversity has been slow and partly neglected. Conservation of forest genetic diversity is still riddled with problems, and complexities of national legal and administrative structures. Europe is an example of a complex region where the distribution ranges of tree species extend across large geographical areas with profound environmental differences, and include many countries. Conservation of forest genetic diversity in Europe has been hampered by a lack of common understanding on the management requirements for genetic conservation units of forest trees. The challenge resides in integrating scientific knowledge on conservation genetics into management of tree populations so that recommendations are feasible to implement across different countries. Here, we present pan-European minimum requirements for dynamic conservation units of forest genetic diversity. The units are natural or man-made tree populations which are managed for maintaining evolutionary processes and adaptive potential across generations. Each unit should have a designated status and a management plan, and one or more tree species recognized as target species for genetic conservation. The minimum sizes of the units are set at 500, 50 or 15 reproducing individuals depending on tree species and conservation objectives. Furthermore, silvicultural interventions should be allowed to enhance genetic processes, as needed, and field inventories carried out to monitor regeneration and the population size. These minimum requirements are now used by 36 countries to improve management of forest genetic diversity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Tree mortality has important influences on forest structure and composition, but the mechanisms that cause tree mortality are not well understood. Asymmetric competition is known to be a dominant cause of plant mortality, but this idea has not received much attention in studies of long-lived trees.
   2. We hypothesised that while tree mortality is dependent on size relative to neighbours as a result of asymmetric competition, tree mortality of shade-tolerant species varies little with size because of their physiological and morphological adaptations to shaded environments. Furthermore, we hypothesised that tree mortality is higher in more crowded stands because of higher average resource competition, in conspecific stands because of potential negative intra-specific interactions, and in older stands because of the physiological limitations and susceptibility to minor disturbances of large trees.
   3. Using data from repeatedly measured permanent sampling plots that covered a wide range of tree sizes, stand developmental stages and stand compositions in boreal forests, we simultaneously tested, by boosted regression tree models, the effects of an individual's relative size, stand crowding, species interaction and ageing on mortality of Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera and Picea mariana.
   4. Mortality increased strongly with decreasing relative size for all study species, and the size-dependent mortality was stronger for shade-intolerant than for shade-tolerant species. With increasing stand basal area, mortality increased for Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides and Picea mariana but decreased for Betula papyrifera. Mortality was higher in stands with more conspecific neighbours for Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera and Picea mariana, but was slightly lower for Pinus banksiana. Mortality also increased with stand age for all species. Furthermore, the size-dependent mortality was generally stronger in more crowded stands.
   5. Synthesis. Our findings show that tree mortality over a wide range of tree sizes, stand developmental stages and stand compositions in non-equilibrium boreal forests was strongly controlled by competition, but species interactions and ageing were also important mechanisms. Furthermore, the relative importance of these mechanisms to tree mortality differed with the shade tolerance of species.

AB Potential causes of species' geographic distribution limits fall into two broad classes: (1) limited adaptation across spatially variable environments and (2) limited opportunities to colonize unoccupied areas. Combining demographic studies, analyses of demographic responses to environmental variation, and species distribution models, we investigated the causes of range limits in a model system, the eastern border of the California annual plant Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana. Vital rates of 20 populations varied with growing season temperature and precipitation: fruit number and overwinter survival of 1-year-old seeds declined steeply, while current-year seed germination increased modestly along west-to-east gradients in decreasing temperature, decreasing mean precipitation, and increasing variation in precipitation. Long-term stochastic finite rate of increase, X exhibited a fourfold range and varied among geologic surface materials as well as with temperature and precipitation. Growth rate declined significantly toward the eastern border, falling below 1 in three of the five easternmost populations. Distribution models employing demographically important environmental variables predicted low habitat favorability beyond the eastern border. Models that filtered or weighted population presences by X, predicted steeper eastward declines in favorability and assigned greater roles in setting the distribution to among-year variation in precipitation and to geologic surface material. These analyses reveal a species border likely set by limited adaptation to declining environmental quality.

AB Ecologists need an empirical understanding of physiological and behavioural adjustments that animals can make in response to seasonal and long-term variations in environmental conditions. Because many species experience trade-offs between timing and duration of one seasonal event versus another and because interacting species may also shift phenologies at different rates, it is possible that, in aggregate, phenological shifts could result in mismatches that disrupt ecological communities. We investigated the timing of seasonal events over 14 years in two Arctic ground squirrel populations living 20 km apart in Northern Alaska. At Atigun River, snow melt occurred 27 days earlier and snow cover began 17 days later than at Toolik Lake. This spatial differential was reflected in significant variation in the timing of most seasonal events in ground squirrels living at the two sites. Although reproductive males ended seasonal torpor on the same date at both sites, Atigun males emerged from hibernation 9 days earlier and entered hibernation 5 days later than Toolik males. Atigun females emerged and bred 13 days earlier and entered hibernation 9 days earlier than those at Toolik. We propose that this variation in phenology over a small spatial scale is likely generated by plasticity of physiological mechanisms that may also provide individuals the ability to respond to variation in environmental conditions over time.

AB The most controversial fishery in U.S. waters of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) is for northern red snapper Lutjanus campechanus, which collapsed in the late 1980s when stock biomass became too low to be fished commercially in the eastern Gulf. Red snapper management began in 1989; the stock is now showing signs of recovery. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council has been slow to sufficiently reduce catches of the directed fisheries to rebuild the stock in a timely fashion, although compliance with the Magnuson-Stevens Reauthorization Act of 2006 (MSRA) required substantial cuts in the harvest of red snapper beginning in 2007. In our opinion, this could have been avoided if conservative management practices had been adopted earlier. We believe that 'faith-based fisheries' arguments have been used to defer effective management of red snapper in the Gulf, which in turn has strained the relationship between science, management, and stakeholders there. We provide a simple empirical argument and alternate interpretations of a recently published perspective on the historical fishery of red snapper in the Gulf to conclude that the preponderance of evidence used in the agency stock assessment process, and the simple arguments made here, do not support the perspective that the red snapper stock has increased in size sufficiently to defer compliance with the MSRA.

AB Squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes) are a diverse clade in which there appear to have been multiple origins of many remarkable traits, including (a) parthenogenetic reproduction, (b) viviparity, (c) snake-like, limb-reduced body form, (d) herbivory, and (e) venom. These repeated transitions make squamates an outstanding/excellent system for addressing many fundamental questions in evolutionary biology. For example, they are the only vertebrate group with true parthenogenesis (with at least 40 separate origins), they have more origins of viviparity than any other group of vertebrates, and they have undergone dramatic changes in body form (lizard-like to snake-like) dozens of times. New molecular phylogenies for squamates have overturned many traditional hypotheses and taxonomies based on morphology and are now revealing exciting new insights into the evolution of many of these traits at both higher and lower taxonomic levels. In this review, we summarize many of these new insights and outline important areas for future research.

AB Calibration data sets give a unique opportunity to establish patterns of biological existence and their statistical associations with environmental variables. By use of calibration data sets, environmental variables can be inferred quantitatively. The resulting long time-series may assist in distinguishing natural environmental variability from human-induced variability, both in terms of climate change and biotic turnover. However, the validity of the palaeoenvironmental reconstructions depends on their accuracy, precision and sensibility. Before performing palaeoenvironmental inferences, key mechanisms controlling contemporary species' distribution, abundances and dynamics should be identified and understood. An inference model is developed to produce reconstructions. A major challenge lies in validating and interpreting the reconstructions. Calibration data sets involving midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) suggest that climate has a broad-scale, regional control over midge existence and abundance, often over-riding the influence of local within-lake variables. In recent years, the use of midges as quantitative indicators of past temperatures has greatly expanded. As the number of reconstructions increase, especially in Fennoscandia and North America, it seems the among-site variability is so large that it is unlikely to be due only to local differences in climate. Hence, we question whether the long climate gradients in calibration data sets can accurately be used to calibrate local variables, when most local gradients in time and space are short. Ten Holocene chironomid-inferred temperature curves from Fennoscandia are compared. We illustrate some general principles in palaeoecology by identifying factors that may cause bias. Especially, we consider how calibration data sets simplify the complexity of the real world by maximizing single ecological gradients and by not taking into account co-varying variables. We give some recommendations and criteria that chironomid analysis should meet in order to improve the reliability of the temperature inferences. Finally, we discuss how the complex interactions between species and environment may have implications when we aim at predicting future biodiversity.

AB To estimate the combined effects of elevated [CO2] and night temperature on C assimilation, N absorption, and their allocations in rice organs, we conducted a pot experiment in controlled-environment chambers with [CO2] at 380 or 680 ppm, night temperatures of 22 or 32 degrees C, and a 32 degrees C day temperature. Whole-plant C and N concentrations were unaffected by elevated [CO2] and high night temperature, while C assimilation and N absorption increased significantly under both elevated [CO2] and high night temperature with a significant interaction of [CO2] and high night temperature. C assimilation increased under high night temperatures despite the higher C loss to night respiration. Regarding to part organs of rice, high night temperature significantly increased living leaf N concentration and area (by 7.8% and 14.5%, respectively), and enhanced photosynthetic capacity at last stage of rice growth. Elevated [CO2] did not affect C and N allocations between ear and stem during reproductive growth, but high night temperature significantly decreased C and N allocation to the ears. Because high night temperatures limited the translocation of C and N to the ear, they will reduce the stimulatory effect of elevated [CO2] on rice yield in the future if both [CO2] and temperature continue to increase.

AB Background and Aims Asexual organisms are more widespread in previously glaciated areas than their sexual relatives ('geographical parthenogenesis'). In plants, this pattern is probably dependent on reproductive isolation and stability of cytotypes within their respective distribution areas. Both partial apomixis and introgressive hybridization potentially destabilize the spatial separation of sexual and apomictic populations. The wide distribution of apomicts may be further enhanced by uniparental reproduction which is advantageous for colonization. These factors are studied in the alpine species Ranunculus kuepferi.
   Methods Geographical distribution, diversity and mode of reproduction of cytotypes were assessed using flow cytometry and flow cytometric seed screening on samples from 59 natural populations of Ranunculus kuepferi. Seed set of cytotypes was compared in the wild.
   Key Results Diploid sexuals are confined to the south-western parts of the Alps. while tetraploid apomicts dominate in previously glaciated and in geographically isolated areas despite a significantly lower fertility. Other cytotypes (3x, 5.v and 6x) occur mainly in the sympatric zone, but without establishing populations. The tetraploids are predominantly apomictic, but also show a partial apomixis via an uncoupling of apomeiosis and parthenogenesis in the seed material. Both pseudogamy and autonomous endosperm formation are observed which may enhance uniparental reproduction.
   Conclusions Diploids occupy a glacial relic area and resist introgression of apomixis, probably because of a significantly higher seed set. Among the polyploids, only apomictic tetraploids form stable populations: the other cytotypes arising from partial apomixis fail to establish, probably because of minority cytotype disadvantages. Tetraploid apomicts colonize previously devastated and also distant areas via long-distance dispersal. confirming Baker's law of an advantage of uniparental reproduction. It is concluded that stability of cytotypes and of modes of reproduction are important factors for establishing a pattern of geographical parthenogenesis.

AB P>1. Changes in cladoceran subfossils in the surface sediments of 54 shallow lakes were studied along a European latitude gradient (36-68 degrees N). Multivariate methods, such as regression trees and ordination, were applied to explore the relationships between cladoceran taxa distribution and contemporary environmental variables, with special focus on the impact of climate.
   2. Multivariate regression tree analysis showed distinct differences in cladoceran community structure and lake characteristics along the latitude gradient, identifying three groups: (i) northern lakes characterised by low annual mean temperature, conductivity, nutrient concentrations and fish abundance, (ii) southern, macrophyte rich, warm water lakes with high conductivity and high fish abundance and (iii) Mid-European lakes at intermediate latitudes with intermediate conductivities, trophic state and temperatures.
   3. Large-sized, pelagic species dominated a group of seven northern lakes with low conductivity, where acid-tolerant species were also occasionally abundant. Small-sized, benthic-associated species dominated a group of five warm water lakes with high conductivity. Cladoceran communities generally showed low species-specific preferences for habitat and environmental conditions in the Mid-European group of lakes. Taxon richness was low in the southern-most, high-conductivity lakes as well as in the two northern-most sub-arctic lakes.
   4. The proportion of cladoceran resting eggs relative to body shields was high in the northern lakes, and linearly (negatively) related to both temperature and Chl a, indicating that both cold climate (short growing season) and low food availability induce high ephippia production.
   5. Latitude and, implicitly, temperature were strongly correlated with conductivity and nutrient concentrations, highlighting the difficulties of disentangling a direct climate signal from indirect effects of climate, such as changes in fish community structure and human-related impacts, when a latitude gradient is used as a climate proxy. Future studies should focus on the interrelationships between latitude and gradients in nutrient concentration and conductivity.

AB Aim
   We tested whether the species-energy and species-human relationships vary between native and both naturalized and casual alien species richness when other environmental variables had been taken into account.
   Location
   Trento Province, a region (c. 6200 km2) on the southern border of the European Alps (Italy), subdivided into 156 contiguous (c. 37.5 km2) cells and ranging in elevation from 66 to 3769 m.
   Methods
   Data were separated into three subsets, representing richness of natives, naturalized aliens and casual aliens and separately related to temperature, human population and various environmental correlates of plant species diversity. We applied ordinary least squares and simultaneous autoregressive regressions to identify potential contrasting responses of the three plant status subsets and hierarchical partitioning to evaluate the relative importance of the predictor variables.
   Results
   Variation in alien plant species richness along the region was almost entirely explained by temperature and human population density. The relationships were positive but strongly curvilinear. Native species richness was less strongly related to either factor but was positively related to the presence of calcareous bedrock. Native species richness had a decelerating positive relationship with temperature (R2 = 55%), whereas naturalized and casual aliens had a positive accelerating relationship explaining 86% and 62% of the variation in richness, respectively. Native species richness had a positive decelerating relationship with population density (R2 = 42%), whilst both alien subsets had a positive accelerating relationship.
   Main conclusions
   Alien species richness was higher in areas with the most rich and diverse assemblages of native species. Areas at high altitudes are not especially prone to alien invasion due to energy constraints, low propagule pressure and disturbance, even considering a potential increased in temperature. Thus, if we consider future environmental change, we should expect a stronger response of aliens than natives in the currently warm, urbanized, low-altitude areas than in cold, high-altitude areas where human population density is low.

AB Aim
   To investigate the impact of past environmental changes on Cedrus atlantica and its current genetic diversity, and to predict its future distribution.
   Location
   Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.
   Methods
   Eleven fossil pollen records from these three countries were used to locate putative glacial refugia and to reconstruct past climate changes. A mechanistic vegetation distribution model was used to simulate the distribution of C. atlantica in the year 2100. In addition, a genetic survey was carried out on modern Moroccan C. atlantica.
   Results
   Pollen records indicate that Cedrus was present during the last glacial period, probably in scattered refugia, in Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. In the Tunisian and Algerian sites, cedar expanded during the late glacial and the early Holocene, then disappeared after c. 8000 yr bp. Reconstructed mean annual precipitation and January temperature show that the last glacial period in Morocco was cooler by 10-15 degrees C and drier by c. 300-400 mm year(-1) than the climate today. Modern chloroplast microsatellites of 15 C. atlantica populations in Morocco confirm the presence of multiple refugia and indicate that cedar recolonized the Moroccan mountains fairly recently. Model simulation indicates that by the year 2100 the potential distribution of C. atlantica will be much restricted with a potential survival area located in the High Atlas.
   Main conclusions
   Environmental changes in northern Africa since the last glacial period have had an impact on the geographical distribution of C. atlantica and on its modern genetic diversity. It is possible that by the end of this century C. atlantica may be unable to survive in its present-day locations. To preserve the species, we suggest that seedlings from modern C. atlantica populations located in the High Atlas mountains, where a high genetic diversity is found, be transplanted into the western High Atlas.

AB Photosynthetic rate per unit nitrogen generally declines as leaf mass per unit area (LMA) increases. To determine how much of this decline was associated with allocating a greater proportion of leaf nitrogen into cell wall material, we compared two groups of plants. The first group consisted of two species from each of eight genera, all of which were perennial evergreens growing in the Australian National Botanic Gardens (ANBG). The second group consisted of seven Eucalyptus species growing in a greenhouse. The percentage of leaf biomass in cell walls was independent of variation in LMA within any genus, but varied from 25 to 65% between genera. The nitrogen concentration of cell wall material was 0.4 times leaf nitrogen concentration for all species apart from Eucalyptus, which was 0.6 times leaf nitrogen concentration. Between 10 and 30% of leaf nitrogen was recovered in the cell wall fraction, but this was independent of LMA. No trade-off was observed between nitrogen associated with cell walls and the nitrogen allocated to ribulose 1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Variation in photosynthetic rate per unit nitrogen could not be explained by variation in cell wall nitrogen.

AB Animal populations are increasingly challenged by anthropogenic environmental changes. Species, populations and individuals vary in their ability to cope with exposure to human proximity. However, little is known about what drives habituation or sensitization in wild populations. Via behavioural observations and heart rate telemetry during experimental disturbance, we determined the habituation potential of yellow-eyed penguins, Megadyptes antipodes, a key species for nature-based tourism in southern New Zealand. Individual birds differed significantly in both their initial stress response and habituation potential. While some birds did not habituate, or even appeared to be sensitized by frequent disturbance, others habituated. Individual variation in habituation potential depended on previous experience with humans, sex and character (i.e. timid, calm or aggressive). Birds that were exposed to research that involved frequent interactions at the nest site, including blood sampling, several years prior to our experiments were less likely to habituate. Overall, females were more flexible than males in their stress response pattern, and calm individuals appeared to adapt more readily than aggressive birds. Character, classified during penguin-researcher interactions at the nest site, was independent of sex, age or previous experience, and was consistent over two seasons. Initial heart rate response to human approach, also similar between seasons, varied with sex and character of an individual. Yellow-eyed penguins may habituate to short and consistent approaches, but appear unsuitable for unregulated tourist visits at nest sites. Individual differences in habituation potential to human disturbance can have fitness consequences and may lead to contemporary evolutionary change in the composition of breeding populations.

AB Natural disturbances are key processes in the vast majority of ecosystems and a range of ecological theories have been developed in an attempt to predict biotic responses to them. However, empirical support for these theories has been inconsistent and considerable additional work remains to be done to better understand the response of biodiversity to natural disturbance. We tested predictions from the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and the habitat accommodation model of succession for reptile responses to fire history and a single major fire event. We focused our work on a broad range of vegetation types spanning sedgeland to temperate rainforest located within a national park in south-eastern Australia. We found no significant relationships between reptile species richness and the number of fires over the past 35 years, the time since the last fire, or the severity of a major fire in 2003. Thus, we found no strong evidence to support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. A correspondence analysis of reptile assemblages revealed a gradient in species responses to fire history. However, we found limited evidence for an ordered succession of reptiles. Nor could the responses of individual species be readily predicted from life history attributes. Thus, our findings were generally not consistent with predictions from the habitat accommodation model of succession. A possible explanation for the absence of a predictable sequence of recovery following disturbance might be the rapidity of post-fire recovery of many components of native vegetation cover that were found to be important for reptiles (e.g. the extent of grass cover). This would have limited the time for early successional conditions to prevail and limited opportunities for species associated with such conditions. We found that most reptile species responses were much more strongly linked to vegetation type than fire variables, emphasizing a need to understand relationships with vegetation before being able to understand possible fire effects (if and where they exist). We found the disturbance concepts we examined were limited in their ability to accurately predict reptile responses to past fire history or the impacts of a single major fire in 2003. Practical management might be best guided not by disturbance theory, but by carefully setting objectives to meet conservation goals for particular individual species of reptiles.

AB Although arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form spatially complex communities in terrestrial ecosystems, the scales at which this diversity manifests itself is poorly understood. This information is critical to the understanding of the role of AMF in plant community composition. We examined small-scale (submetre) variability of AMF community composition (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting) and abundance (extraradical hyphal lengths) in two 1 m(2) plots situated in a native grassland ecosystem of western Montana. Extraradical AMF hyphal lengths varied greatly between samples (14-89 m g soil(-1)) and exhibited spatial structure at scales < 30 cm. The composition of AMF communities was also found to exhibit significant spatial autocorrelation, with correlogram analyses suggesting patchiness at scales < 50 cm. Supportive of overall AMF community composition analyses, individual AMF ribotypes corresponding to specific phylogenetic groups exhibited distinct spatial autocorrelation. Our results demonstrate that AMF diversity and abundance can be spatially structured at scales of < 1 m. Such small-scale heterogeneity in the soil suggests that establishing seedlings may be exposed to very different, location dependent AMF communities. Our results also have direct implications for representative sampling of AMF communities in the field.

AB In the development of a species distribution model based on regression techniques such as generalized linear or additive modelling (GLM/GAM), a basic assumption is that records of species presence and absence are real. However, a common concern in many studies examining species distributions is that absences cannot be inferred with certainty. This is particularly the case where the species is rare, difficult to detect and/or does not occupy all available habitat considered suitable. The western ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris) of southern Western Australia, Australia, is a case in point, as not only is it rare and difficult to detect, but it is also unlikely to occupy all available suitable habitat. A recent survey of ground parrots provided the opportunity to develop a predictive distribution model. As the data were susceptible to false absences, these were replaced with randomly selected ` pseudo' absences and modelled using GLM. As a comparison, presence-only information was modelled using a relatively new approach, MAXENT, a machine-learning technique that has been shown to perform comparatively well. The predictive performance of both models, as assessed by the receiver operating characteristic plot (ROC) was high (AUC > 0.8), with MAXENT performing only marginally better than the GLM. These approaches both indicated that the ground parrot prefers areas relatively high in altitude, distant from rivers, gently sloping to level habitat, with an intermediate cover of vegetation and where there is a mosaic of vegetation ages. In this case, the use of presence-only information resulted in the identification of important environmental attributes defining the occurrence of the ground parrot, but additional factors that account for the inability of the bird to occupy all suitable habitat should be a component of model refinement.

AB Developing effective indicators of ecological condition requires calibration to determine the geographic range and ecosystem type appropriate for each indicator. Here, we demonstrate an approach for evaluating the relative influence of geography, geomorphology and human disturbance on patterns of variation in biotic indicators derived from multiple assemblages for ecosystems that span broad spatial scales. To accomplish this, we collected abundance information on six biotic assemblages (birds, fish, amphibians, aquatic macroinvertebrates, wetland vegetation., and diatoms) from over 450 locations along U.S. shorelines throughout each of the Great Lakes during 2002-2004. Sixty-six candidate taxon- and function-based indicators analyzed using hierarchical variance partitioning revealed that geographic (lake) rather than geomorphic factors (wetland type) had the greatest influence on the proportion of variance explained across all indicators, and that a significant portion of the variance was also related to response to human disturbance. Wetland vegetation, fish and bird indicators were the most, and macroinvertebrates the least, responsive to human disturbance. Proportion of rock bass, Carex lasiocarpa, and stephanodiscoid diatoms, as well as the presence of spring peepers and the number of insectivorous birds were among the indicators that responded most strongly to a human disturbance index, suggesting they have good potential as indicators of Great Lakes coastal wetland condition. Ecoprovince, wetland type, and indicator type (taxa vs function based) explained relatively little variance. Variance patterns for macroinvertebrates and birds were least concordant with those of other assemblages, while diatoms and amphibians, and fish and wetland vegetation were the most concordant assemblage pairs. Our results strongly suggest it will not be possible to develop effective indicators of Great Lakes coastal wetland condition without accounting for differences among lakes and their important interactions. This is one of the first attempts to show how ecological indicators of human disturbance vary over a broad spatial scale in wetlands. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past decade an increasing number of studies have experimentally manipulated the number of species in a community and examined how this alters the aggregate production of species biomass. Many of these studies have shown that the effects of richness on biomass change through time, but we have limited understanding of the mechanisms that produce these dynamic trends. Here we report the results of an experiment in which we manipulated the richness of freshwater algae in laboratory microcosms. We used two experimental designs ( additive and substitutive) that make different assumptions about how patches are initially colonized, and then tracked the development of community biomass from the point of initial colonization through a period of 6 - 12 generations of the focal species. We found that the effect of initial species richness on biomass production qualitatively shifted twice over the course of the experiment. The first shift occurred as species transitioned from density-independent to dependent phases of population growth. At this time, intraspecific competition caused monocultures to approach their respective carrying capacities more slowly than polycultures. As a consequence, species tended to over-yield for a brief time, generating a positive, but transient effect of diversity on community biomass. The second shift occurred as communities approached carrying capacity. At this time, strong interspecific interactions caused biomass to be dominated by the competitively superior species in polycultures. As this species had the lowest carrying capacity, a negative effect of diversity on biomass resulted in late succession. Although these two shifts produced dynamics that appeared complex, we show that the patterns can be fit to a simple Lotka-Volterra model of competition. Our results suggest that the effects of algal diversity on primary production change in a predictable sequence through successional time.

AB Genetic variation was investigated in 17 populations of the Italian endemic Apennine yellow-bellied toad using both mitochondrial (598 bp of the cytochrome b gene) and nuclear (21 allozyme loci) markers. Populations from central Calabria (southern Italy) showed the highest levels of intrapopulation genetic variation, whereas samples located north of this region were nearly lacking in variation. This appears to be a typical pattern of 'southern richness and northern purity', usually attributed to the prolonged population stability within southern refugia coupled with the loss of variation during postglacial northward expansion. However, the overall pattern of genetic variation observed has a strong geographical component, suggesting two Calabrian plains, Catanzaro and Crati-Sibari, as historical barriers to dispersal separating three population groups. These findings cannot be explained by the prolonged stability of southern populations alone, and suggest that the southern richness has been at least in part shaped by allopatric differentiation within the refugial range, followed by intermixing of previously differentiated lineages. From a conservation standpoint, Calabria is the major genetic diversity reservoir for this species, thus deserving particular conservation efforts. Furthermore, although the low intrapopulation genetic variation outside Calabria appears to be of clear historical origin, evidence of a current reduction of gene flow suggests that human disturbance has also played a part, particularly in the anthropogenic impacted Volturno river drainage basin.

AB Traditionally, studies of intrasexual selection have focused on single traits that are more exaggerated in males. Relatively little is known about systems in which traits are larger in females or the role of multiple traits in male contests. We used a tournament design in which each male encounters a series of different opponents, in conjunction with the structured Bradley-Terry model, to examine the role of multiple male traits in contests between male Cape dwarf chameleons, Bradypodion pumilum. Females are larger but males have relatively longer tails, larger and more ornamented heads and a larger central flank patch, all of which are emphasized during agonistic displays. We found no evidence that larger body size confers an advantage in male contests, despite high levels of aggression and escalated encounters. However, both the height of the casque (head ornament) and relative area of the flank patch were positively associated with fighting ability, and not correlated with each other, suggesting that they may represent independent sources of information about an opponent's ability. We discuss these results in relation to the role of male contest competition in the evolution of multiple male signals and sexual dimorphism in dwarf chameleons. In addition, we show that the use of tournament designs, in conjunction with the structured Bradley-Terry model, has important advantages over traditional designs and methods of analysing animal contests.

AB Eastern North American wolves have long been recognized as morphologically distinct from both coyotes and gray wolves. This has led to questions regarding their origins and taxonomic status. Eastern wolves are mainly viewed as: (1) a smaller subspecies of gray wolf (Canis lupus lycaon), potentially the result of historical hybridization between gray wolves (C. lupus) and red wolves (C. rufus), (2) a hybrid, the result of gray wolf (C. lupus) and coyote (C. latrans) interbreeding, or (3) a distinct species, C. lycaon, closely related to the red wolf (C. rufus). Although debate persists, recent molecular studies suggest that the eastern wolf is not a gray wolf subspecies, nor the result of gray wolf/coyote hybridization. Eastern wolves were more likely a distinct species, C. lycaon, prior to the eastward spread of coyotes in the late 1800s. However, contemporary interbreeding exits between C. lycaon to both C. lupus and C. latrans over much of its present range complicating its present taxonomic characterization. While hybridization may be reducing the taxonomic distinctiveness of C. lycaon, it should not necessarily be viewed as negative influence. Hybridization may be enhancing the adaptive potential of eastern wolves, allowing them to more effectively exploit available resources in rapidly changing environments.

AB The floristic quality assessment index (FQAI) is an evaluation procedure that uses measures of ecological conservatism (expressed numerically as a coefficient of conservatism or C value) and richness of the native plant community to derive a score (I) that is an estimate of habitat quality. We evaluated the ability of the FQAI to indicate the level of anthropogenic disturbance in headwater wetlands in the Ridge and Valley physiographic province of central Pennsylvania. I scores were highly correlated with disturbance, with scores generally decreasing with increasing levels of disturbance. However, we found that I did not equally characterize sites with differing species richness. I scores were higher for sites with greater intrinsic native species, regardless of other influences on floristic quality. To eliminate sensitivity to species richness, we evaluated sites using mean conservatism values ((C) over bar) and a variant of the I score (adjusted FQAI, hereafter cited as I') that considered both the contribution of non-native species and the intrinsic low species richness of high quality forested wetlands. (C) over bar values were more highly correlated with disturbance than I scores; however, site assessments based on (C) over bar values alone were misleading. I' scores were also more highly correlated with disturbance than I scores and were robust to differences in native species richness. Therefore, we offer I' as an improved formulation of the index that, in addition to serving as a useful condition assessment tool, addresses two problematic issues that have plagued the FQAI since its conception: the overwhelming influence of the species richness multiplier and the role of non-native species in floristic assessment.

AB We determined the complete mitochondrial genomes of five cephalopods of the Subclass Coleoidea (Suborder Oegopsida: Watasenia scintillans, Todarodes pacificus, Suborder Myopsida: Sepioteuthis lessoniana, Order Sepiida: Sepia officinalis, and Order Octopoda: Octopus ocellatus) and used them to infer phylogenetic relationships. In our Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree, sepiids (cuttlefish) are at the most basal position of all decapodiformes, and oegopsids and myopsids form a monophyletic clade, thus supporting the traditional classification of the Order Teuthida. We detected extensive gene rearrangements in the mitochondrial genomes of broad cephalopod groups. It is likely that the arrangements of mitochondrial genes in Oegopsida and Sepiida were derived from those of Octopoda, which is thought to be the ancestral order, by entire gene duplication and random gene loss. Oegopsida in particular has undergone long-range gene duplications. We also found that the mitochondrial gene arrangement of Sepioteuthis lessoniana differs from that of Loligo bleekeri, although they belong to the same family. Analysis of both the phylogenetic tree and mitochondrial gene rearrangements of coleoid Cephalopoda suggests that each mitochondrial gene arrangement was acquired after the divergence of each lineage.

AB Predictive models are increasingly used in geomorphology, but systematic evaluations of novel statistical techniques are still limited. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), classification tree analysis (CTA), neural networks (ANN) and multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS) in predictive geomorphological modelling. Five different distribution models both for non-sorted and sorted patterned ground were constructed on the basis of four terrain parameters and four soil variables. To evaluate the models, the original data set of 9997 squares of 1 ha in size was randomly divided into model training (70%, n=6998) and model evaluation sets (30%, n=2999).
   In general, active sorted patterned ground is clearly defined in upper fell areas with high slope angle and till soils. Active non-sorted patterned ground is more common in valleys with higher soil moisture and fine-scale concave topography. The predictive performance of each model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Kappa value. The relatively high discrimination capacity of all models, AUC=0.85-0.88 and Kappa=0.49-0.56, implies that the model's predictions provide an acceptable index of sorted and non-sorted patterned ground occurrence. The best performance for model calibration data for both data sets was achieved by the CTA. However, when the predictive mapping ability was explored through the evaluation data set, the model accuracies of CTA decreased clearly compared to the other modelling techniques. For model evaluation data MARS performed marginally best.
   Our results show that the digital elevation model and soil data can be used to predict relatively robustly the activity of patterned ground in fine scale in a subarctic landscape. This indicates that predictive geomorphological modelling has the advantage of providing relevant and useful information on earth surface processes over extensive areas, such data being unavailable through more conventional survey methods.

AB In the Australian frog Crinia georgiana, matings frequently involve a single female and multiple males (group spawning). The aim of the present study was to demonstrate a connection between variation in the intensity of intrasexual competition, measured by using male density and operational sex ratio (OSR), and the incidence of group spawning. Over a 3-month breeding period, male density and OSR varied substantially and were significantly influenced by climatic conditions. The frequency of agonistic interactions between males was higher in denser choruses. Fights were typically over the possession of sites used to broadcast advertisement calls and were almost always won by larger males. At higher densities, males allocated significantly less time to calling to attract females and spent more time as nonmoving satellites or roaming through an aggregation (searching). However, large males always called more than did small males. The number of males involved in a spawning correlated positively with variation in both male density and OSR. Observation of group spawnings revealed that they generally arose when a satellite male joined a mating pair after a female chose to mate with a calling male or when a female was seized by a searching male and the pair was joined by other searching males. These findings, coupled with past research documenting costs but no benefits of multiple paternity to females, suggest that competitively inferior males force group spawns.

AB Odonates (dragonflies) are well known for the ability of the mates to displace sperm stored in the female's sperm-storage organs during copulation. By this means, copulating mates are able to increase their fertilization success. This ability has been used as an example to illustrate a conflict of interests between the sexes in which males have evolved sperm-displacement mechanisms whilst females have presumably evolved means to avoid sperm displacement. The present review has four aims: (1) to describe the copulatory mechanisms used during sperm displacement; (2) to analyse the causes of sperm usage patterns; (3) to discuss this information using current hypotheses on conflict between the sexes; (4) to illuminate topics for further research. Four copulatory mechanisms are described: sperm removal (physical withdrawal of stored sperm), sperm repositioning ('pushing' of rival sperm to sites where its use will be least likely), female sensory stimulation to induce sperm ejection, and sperm flushing (displacement of sperm using the copulating male's sperm). Sperm-precedence studies in Odonata are scarce and their values vary considerably between species. In those species in which sperm displacement is incomplete, the last copulating male obtains a high but variable short-term fertilization success which decreases with time. Some male and female factors affecting sperm precedence patterns are mentioned: (1) male variation in genital morphology; (2) duration of copulation influenced by the male (the longer the copulation, the more stored sperm displaced); (3) adaptations of the sperm-storage organs that allow the female to manipulate the sperm she has received (i.e. avoiding sperm displacement, re-distributing sperm masses, favouring sperm located in certain sites and ejecting sperm after copulation). We suggest that male and female odonates have co-evolved at the level of genital function with the control of stored sperm as the focus of the conflict. The benefits for males in this co-evolution lie in maximizing their fertilization success. However, it is not clear what females obtain from storing sperm and making it unreachable during sperm displacement. Two hypothetical benefits that females may obtain for which some evidence has been gathered are genetic diversity and viability genes. It is finally suggested that odonates can become excellent subjects of study for testing current ideas related to sexual conflict and speciation processes through sexual selection.

AB The sexy-sperm hypothesis predicts that females obtain indirect benefits for their offspring via polyandy, in the form of increased fertilization success for their sons. I use a quantitative genetic approach to test the sexy-sperm hypothesis using the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus . Previous studies of this species have shown considerable phenotypic variation in fertilization success when two or more males compete. There were high broad-sense heritabilities for both paternity and polyandry. Patterns of genotypic variance were consistent with X-linked inheritance and/or maternal effects on these traits. The genetic architecture therefore precludes the evolution of polyandry via a sexy-sperm process. Thus the positive genetic correlation between paternity in sons and polyandry in daughters predicted by the sexy-sperm hypothesis was absent. There was significant heritable variation in the investment by females in ovaries and by males in the accessory gland. Surprisingly there was a very strong genetic correlation between these two traits. The significance of this genetic correlation for the coevolution of male seminal products and polyandry is discussed.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate medfly longevity and reproduction across a broad spectrum of diet restriction using a protocol similar to those applied in most rodent studies. Age-specific reproduction and age of death were monitored for 1200 adult males and 1200 females, each individually maintained on one of 12 diets from ad libitum to 30% of ad libitum. Diet was provided in a fixed volume of solution that was fully consumed each day, ensuring control of total nutrient consumption for every fly. Contrary to expectation and precedence, increased longevity was not observed at any level of diet restriction. Among females, reproduction continued across all diet levels despite the cost in terms of increased mortality. Among males, life expectancy exceeded that of females at most diet levels. However, in both sexes, mortality increased more sharply and the pattern of survival changed abruptly once the diet level fell to 50% of ad libitum or below, even though the energetic demands of egg production has no obvious counterpart in males. We believe that a more complete picture of the life table response to dietary restriction will emerge when studies are conducted on a wider range of species and include both sexes, more levels of diet, and the opportunity for mating and reproduction.

AB In the Bonin Islands of the western Pacific where the light environment is characterized by high fluctuations due to frequent typhoon disturbance, we hypothesized that the invasive success of Bischofia javanica Blume (invasive tree, mid-successional) may be attributable to a high acclimation capacity under fluctuating light availability. The physiological and morphological responses of B. javanica to both simulated canopy opening and closure were compared against three native species of different successional status: Trema orientalis Blume (pioneer), Schima mertensiana (Sieb. et Zucc.) Koidz (mid-successional) and Elaeocarpus photiniaefolius Hook.et Arn (late-successional). The results revealed significant species-specific differences in the timing of physiological maturity and phenotypic plasticity in leaves developed under constant high and low light levels. For example, the photosynthetic capacity of T. orientalis reached a maximum in leaves that had just fully expanded when grown under constant high light (50% of full sun) whereas that of E . photiniaefolius leaves continued to increase until 50 d after full expansion. For leaves that had just reached full expansion, T. orientalis , having high photosynthetic plasticity between high and low light, exhibited low acclimation capacity under the changing light (from high to low or low to high light). In comparison with native species, B. javanica showed a higher degree of physiological and morphological acclimation following transfer to a new light condition in leaves of all age classes (i.e. before and after reaching full expansion). The high acclimation ability of B. javanica in response to changes in light availability may be a part of its pre-adaptations for invasiveness in the fluctuating environment of the Bonin Islands.

AB Coastal freshwater fishes provide valuable models for studying the role of the last glaciations in promoting speciation. To date, the great majority of studies are of Northern Hemisphere taxa, and reflect the influence of vicariant events during, or prior to, the Pleistocene. Microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA sequences were used to investigate patterns of population divergence and evolutionary relationships in a freshwater group of silverside fishes (Odontesthes perugiae complex), endemic to the recently formed coastal plain of southern Brazil. Lacustrine morphotypes showed concordant patterns of genetic and morphological divergence consistent with the geographical history of the coastal plain. The results support the proposal of a silverside radiation chronologically shaped by the sea-level changes of the Pleistocene and Holocene. The radiating lineage comprises a minimum of three allopatric and two sympatric lacustrine species. Four species displayed extremely high levels of genetic variation and some of the most rapid speciation rates reported in fishes. These features were related to a marine-estuarine origin of the radiation. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first molecular phylogeographic survey of a coastal radiation in South America.

AB New morphometric methods, the geometrical morphometrics, offer promising perspectives to appraise morphological variation among organisms and open up, to a large extent, the field of morphometrics for the study of systematics and evolution. Until now, however, few studies have explored the potential of these methods at a microgeographical scale. In the present work, we applied them to quantify morphological (size and shape) differentiation among populations of two forest species of ground beetles: Carabus auronitens and C. nemoralis. We found a significant shape variation among sites, as well as among sexes, for both species. Additionally, for C. auronitens, we found significant positive correlations in both sexes between morphological (shape) and geographical distances between populations. In contrast, significant size differences were found between sexes, but not between sites. We conclude that geometrical morphometric methods provide valuable tools for the study of morphological variation among populations and therefore offer, on the whole, interesting perspectives for the study of biodiversity patterns.

AB Compositional changes are a major feature of genome evolution. Overlooking nucleotide composition differences among sequences can seriously mislead phylogenetic reconstructions. Large compositional variation exists among the members of the family Drosophilidae. Until now, however, base composition differences have been largely neglected in the formulations of the nucleotide substitution process used to reconstruct the phylogeny of this important group of species. The present study adopts a maximum-likelihood framework of phylogenetic inference in order to analyze five nuclear gene regions and shows that (1) the pattern of compositional variation in the Drosophilidae, does not match the phylogeny of the species; (2) accounting for the heterogeneous GC content with Galtier and Gouy's nucleotide substitution model leads to a tree that differs in significant aspects from the tree inferred when the nucleotide composition differences are ignored, even though both phylogenetic hypotheses attain strong nodal support in the bootstrap analyses; and (3) the LogDet distance correction cannot completely overcome the distorting effects of the compositional variation that exist, among the species of the Drosophilidae. Our analyses confidently place the Chymomyza genus as an outgroup closer than the genus Scaptodrosophila to the Drosophila genus and conclusively support the monophyly of the Sophophora subgenus.

AB New Zealand's isolation, its well-studied rapidly changing landscape, and its many examples of rampant speciation make it an excellent location for studying the process of genetic differentiation. Using 1520 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA from the cytochrome oxidase subunit I, ATPase subunits 6 and 8 and tRNA(Asp) genes, we detected two well-differentiated, parapatrically distributed clades within the widespread New Zealand cicada species Maoricicada campbelli that may prove to represent two species. The situation that we uncovered is unusual in that an ancient lineage with low genetic diversity is surrounded on three sides by two recently diverged lineages. Using a relaxed molecular clock model coupled with Bayesian statistics, we dated the earliest divergence within M. campbelli at 2.3 +/- 0.55 million years. Our data suggest that geological and climatological events of the late Pliocene divided a once-widespread species into northern and southern components and that near the middle of the Pleistocene the northern lineage began moving south eventually reaching the southern clade. The southern clade seems to have moved northward to only a limited extent. We discovered five potential zones of secondary contact through mountain passes that will be examined in future work. We predict that, as in North American periodical cicadas, contact between these highly differentiated lineages will exist but will not involve gene flow.

AB The phylogenetic relationships of the Clitellata were investigated with a data set of published and new complete 18S rRNA gene sequences of 51 species representing 41 families. Sequences were aligned on the basis of a secondary structure model and analysed with maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood. In contrast to the latter method, parsimony did not recover the monophyly of Clitellata. However, a close scrutiny of the data suggested a spurious attraction between some polychaetes and clitellates. As a rule, molecular trees are closely aligned with morphology-based phylogenies. Acanthobdellida and Euhirudinea were reconciled in their traditional Hirudinea clade and were included in the Oligochaeta with the Branchiobdellida via the Lumbriculidae as a possible link between the two assemblages. While the 18S gene yielded a meaningful historical signal for determining relationships within clitellates, the exact position of Hirudinea and Branchiobdellida within oligochaetes remained unresolved. The lack of phylogenetic signal is interpreted as evidence for a rapid radiation of these taxa. The placement of Clitellata within the Polychaeta remained unresolved. The biological reality of polytomies within annelids is suggested and supports the hypothesis of an extremely ancient radiation of polychaetes and emergence of clitellates.

AB Availability of nitrogen almost always limits plant growth. Therefore, efficient use of nitrogen is essential for the plants. In upright plants, especially when they form dense plant stands, old, lower leaves are shaded by young, upper leaves. Nitrogenous compounds in such shaded leaves are degraded and re-allocated to the developing young, upper leaves. These processes raise efficiency of nitrogen use in photosynthetic production of the plant. For this to occur in the most effective way, leaves would need to sense their photosynthetic status in a plant and increase, maintain or decrease their photosynthetic capacity accordingly. Hypotheses that explain how a leaf can sense its photosynthetic status in the plant are reviewed. They include systems involving phytochrome, sugar-sensing, or cytokinin. Our experimental results with Helianthus annuus and Phaseolus vulgaris plants, which were subject to various shading treatments, are examined in the light of these hypotheses. Our experimental results favoured the sugar-sensing hypothesis: A leaf can sense demand of other plant parts for photosynthates produced by it and nitrogen abundance or deficiency by monitoring its sugar concentration. Problems that are to be challenged in the near future are also pointed out.

TI Microsatellite heterozygosity, fitness and demography in natterjack
   toads Bufo calamita
SO ANIMAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Relationships between mean individual fitness and genetic heterozygosity remain controversial because multiple studies over many years have yielded inconsistent results. However, molecular measurements of genetic variation have mostly been based on allozyme markers, which may have substantial limitations due to their relative insensitivity and occasionally also to the effects of natural selection. We investigated variation in the number of tandem dinucleotide repeats at eight polymorphic microsatellite loci in 38 natterjack toad, Bufo calamita, populations that varied in census size, degree of isolation and distance from the distributional range edge. We also measured fitness attributes, notably larval survival and growth rates, under standardized conditions using samples from six of these populations. The results indicated that larval growth rates were positively and strongly correlated with expected heterozygosity (H-e) across the microsatellite loci. H-e was in turn highest in large populations with minimal isolation, but low near the biogeographical range edge irrespective of population size. Larvae from the smallest and most isolated natterjack population exhibited particularly low fitness and heterozygosity. Our results suggest that microsatellite loci may provide a valuable new approach in studies of links between fitness and heterozygosity.

AB Ferrets (Mustela furo) were domesticated from polecats (M. putorius, M. eversmannii) over 2000 years ago. Following their introduction to Britain, they escaped and hybridized with native European polecats (M. putorius). Native polecats declined to the point of near extinction prior to World War I, but have recently begun to expand from a Welsh refugium. Concern has arisen as to the extent of polecat/ferret introgression, and in particular, whether the expanding population is of mainly hybrid origin. Therefore, mitochondrial DNA sequencing was used to investigate polecat genetic diversity in Britain. Two geographically distinct lineages were found, where one may be ancestral to the British polecat, and the other to the domestic ferret. The ancestral distribution of each lineage, or assortative mating is sufficient to explain the observed pattern. A further comparison between the distribution of the polecat phenotype and mitochondrial haplotype implies that the current population expansion may be mediated by dispersing male polecats hybridizing with female feral ferrets. However, the wild source of the ferret remains obscure. Relatively recent speciation from European mink (M. lutreola) and black-footed ferrets (M. nigripes), and/or the effects of hybridization result in an unresolved molecular phylogeny.

TI Evaluation of fine root length and diameter measurements obtained using
   RHIZO image analysis
SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPUTER; SCANNER
AB Image analysis systems facilitate rapid measurement of root length and diameter, but their accuracy is not easily determined. The objective of this study was to develop a set of simple experiments for evaluating the accuracy of fine root measurements obtained using image analysis, Using the system RHIZO (trademark of Regent Instruments, Quebec), we tested the accuracy of (i) length measurements made over a range of root lengths per unit area, (ii) average diameter measurements and length per diameter distributions in string, wire, and fine root samples of varying diameter, and (iii) diameter measurements on short segments of diagonally oriented objects. Our results suggest that preliminary testing of image analysis systems is absolutely necessary for producing reliable root measurements. Total length was accurately determined for typically encountered length per unit areas of < 1.5 cm cm(-1). For samples with higher values, however, the method underestimated total length by >5%. It is therefore recommended that users of image analysis systems determine this maximum length per unit area for accurate determinations of total root length, In samples that contained different string diameters, the total sample length and average string diameter could accurately be measured. However, the length per diameter class was underestimated by >20% when the string diameter was less than one pixel smaller than the upper limit of the diameter class. Adjustment of diameter intervals and increasing the scanner resolution are required to reduce this underestimation. Both the length and the angle of the short segments analyzed were found to influence diameter measurements. Similar sets of experiments are proposed for a rigorous evaluation of the performance of other image analysis systems on root measurements.

AB Collections of old scales from salmonid fishes can be found in many fisheries institutions in Europe and North America. Such scales have been shown to be useful as a source of DNA, which can be used for analysis of microsatellites. We here describe the technical procedures in relation to extraction and PCR amplification of DNA from old scales. Further, we describe case stories of the application of old scale DNA analysis for conservation genetics with regard to: 1) Identification of native populations, 2) assessment of loss of genetic variation, 3) estimation of effective population size, 4) evaluation of anthropogenic effects on the genetic population structure/mode of migration and 5) the temporal stability of the genetic population structure. Finally, we describe the perspectives for Future genetic studies using old scale DNA. In particular, we evaluate other types of genetic markers such as mtDNA and loci subjected to selection, in association with old scale DNA, as tools for prioritising populations for conservation.

AB Low phosphorus availability is often a primary constraint to plant productivity in native soils. Here we test the hypothesis that root carbon costs are a primary limitation to plant growth in low P soils by assessing the effect of P availability and mycorrhizal infection on whole plant C budgets in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Plants were grown in solid-phase-buffered silica sand providing a constant supply of low (1 mu M) or moderate (10 mu M) P. Carbon budgets were determined weekly during the vegetative growth phase. Mycorrhizal infection in low-P plants increased the root specific P absorption rate, but a concurrent increase in root respiration consumed the increased net C gain resulting from greater P uptake. The energy content of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots was similar. We propose that the increase in root respiration in mycorrhizal roots was mainly due to increased maintenance and growth respiration of the fungal tissue. Plants grown with low P availability expended a significantly larger fraction of their total daily C budget on below-ground respiration at days 21, 28 and 35 after planting (29-40 %) compared with plants grown with moderate P supply (18-25 %). Relatively greater belowground respiration in low P plants was mainly a result of their increased root:shoot ratio, although specific assimilation rate was reduced significantly at days 21 and 28 after planting. Specific root respiration was reduced over time by low P availability, by up to 40 %. This reduction in specific root respiration was due to a reduction in ion uptake respiration and growth respiration, whereas maintenance respiration was increased in low-P plants. Our results support the hypothesis that root C costs are a primary limitation to plant growth in low-P soils.

AB The effect of mycorrhizal infection on root exudation and the survival and physiological status of a bioluminescent fluorescent pseudomonad on the roots of pepper was examined. Pepper plants were grown for 27 days in split-root microcosms with one side mycorrhizal with Glomus deserticola (GD) or Glomus intraradices (GI) while the other side was non-mycorrhizal. Plants with both sides non-mycorrhizal served as controls. The soil was inoculated with a bioluminescent fluorescent pseudomonad (P. fluorescens 2-79RL). This strain emits light in its exponential growth phase, such that the length of the lag phase prior to bioluminescence can be used to assess the physiological status of the bacterium. Mycorrhizal infection had no significant effect on plant growth. The percent root length infected was 8% for GD and 34% for GI. After pulse-labeling of the shoots with (CO2)-C-14, quartz filter strips were used to collect C-14 labeled root exudates at specific locations on the roots. Compared with the non-mycorrhizal roots, GI decreased C-14 labeled root exudation by 78% at the root tip and by 50% at the older root parts. GD had no effect on C-14 labeled root exudation. Rhizosphere soil solutions collected with quartz filter strips were analyzed for amino acids and organic acids by GC-MS. The overall pattern of the chromatograms of the rhizosphere soil solution was similar in the non-mycorrhizal and the mycorrhizal roots. The number of peaks detected was higher in the non-mycorrhizal roots than in the mycorrhizal roots. Compared with the non-mycorrhizal plants, GI decreased the population density of P. fluorescens 2-79RL on the roots by one order of magnitude, both on the mycorrhizal and the non-mycorrhizal side. GD decreased the population density by one order of magnitude only on the side where the fungus was present. The physiological status of P. fluorescens 2-79RL on the roots, as measured by the length of the lag phase prior to bioluminescence, decreased significantly from day 3 to day 6 and remained at a similar level thereafter. Mycorrhizal infection had little effect on the physiological status. Compared to the non-mycorrhizal plants, GI increased the physiological status of P. fluorescens 2-79RL only during the first 6 days, while GD had no effect at all. It is concluded that mycorrhizal infection may decrease root exudation and alter the composition of the rhizosphere soil solution, thereby reducing the population density of certain bacterial groups in the rhizosphere.

AB Mortality patterns from peak of settlement to dispersal from the nursery area, concurrently with integration of juveniles into adult populations, of 3 littoral fishes of the genus Diplodus (D. puntazzo, D. sargus, and D. vugaris) (Family Sparidae) were studied between May 1993 and June 1996. Twenty-one stations were censused weekly, weather conditions permitting, along the Mediterranean coasts of Spain, France, and Italy. Eight stations were located in protected areas and 13 in unprotected zones. Declines in abundance in all 3 species were particularly marked in the first month after settlement. Patterns of survivorship indicated that the 3 species were subject to density-dependent mortality from settlement to recruitment to the adult population. The effect of this mortality pattern was to reduce the variability in year-class strength, though without changing the rank order of abundance between years. The mortality rates for D. sargus were higher than for D. puntazzo and D. vulgaris. The results of this study indicated that mortality rates in protected areas did not differ significantly from those in unprotected zones, suggesting that marine reserves are not necessarily a sink for post-settlement fishes.

AB The rate of photosynthesis and its relation to tissue nitrogen content was studied in leaves and siliques of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) growing under field conditions including three rates of nitrogen application (0, 100 or 200 kg N ha(-1)) and two levels of irrigation (rainfed or irrigated at a deficit of 20 mm).
   The predominant effect of increasing N application under conditions without water deficiency was enhanced expansion of photosynthetically active leaf and silique surfaces, while the rate of photosynthesis per unit leaf or silique surface area was similar in the different N treatments. Thus, oilseed rape did not increase N investment in leaf area expansion before a decline in photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area due to N deficiency could be avoided. Much less photosynthetically active radiation penetrated into high-N canopies than into low-N canopies. The specific leaf area increased markedly in low light conditions, causing leaves in shade to be less dense than leaves exposed to ample light.
   In both leaves and siliques the photosynthetic rate per unit surface area responded linearly to increasing N content up to about 2 g m(-2), thus showing a constant rate of net CO2 assimilation per unit increment in N (constant photosynthetic N use efficiency). At higher tissue N contents, photosynthetic rate responded less to changes in N status. Expressed per unit N, light saturated photosynthetic rate was three times higher in leaves than in silique valves, indicating a more efficient photosynthetic N utilization in leaves than in siliques. Nevertheless, from about two weeks after completion of flowering and onwards total net CO2 fixation in silique valves exceeded that in leaves because siliques received much higher radiation intensities than leaves and because the leaf area declined rapidly during the reproductive phase of growth.
   Water deficiency in late vegetative and early reproductive growth stages reduced the photosynthetic rate in leaves and, in particular, siliques of medium- and high-N plants, but not of low-N plants.

AB In tallgrass prairie, high plant species diversity results not from a large number of grass species, but from a large number of forb (nongrass, herbaceous) species. Forbs exhibit morphological, life history, and ecophysiological characteristics that contrast sharply with those of the dominant C-4 grasses. Success of the subdominant forbs varies strongly with topographic position and burning regime, and landscape scale patterns of abundance are well documented. But comparatively little is known about the mechanisms determining these patterns in persistent tallgrass prairie forbs. To elucidate these mechanisms, (1) leaf-level physiological characteristics of the dominant C-4 grass, Andropogon gerardii, and four co-occurring C-3 forbs were measured in response to natural and experimentally manipulated gradients of N availability, and (2) seasonal light environments of forbs in contrasting topographic positions and burning regimes and their morphological and physiological responses in these environments were compared to determine whether resource availability and utilization patterns contributed to patterns of forb distribution and abundance. The effects of burning regime and topographic position on maximum rate of photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance to water vapor (g) measured at the leaf level were not consistent with patterns of forb abundance. Nitrogen did not appear to limit forb physiological processes, even though increased N availability resulted in higher tissue N concentrations and greater biomass. There was no consistent increase in A or decrease in g in response to fertilization. However, A at low light levels was as much as 67% higher in fertilized Vernonia baldwinii and A. gerardii compared to unfertilized plants. Greater light availability to forbs in the canopy was associated with lower grass biomass production in uplands compared to lowlands and in unburned compared to burned sites. Forbs did not appear to adjust morphologically (leaf area and plant height) to different light environments at different sites. As a result, as much as 90% of forb leaf area in the burned lowland was displayed in low light, whereas as little as 30% of forb leaf area was in low light in the uplands at midseason. Estimates of potential whole-plant carbon uptake, based on leaf area distribution relative to available light and A as a function of light availability, agreed well with patterns of forb abundance and production. Differences in light availability may account for much of the variability in forb abundance related to burning regime and topographic position by limiting carbon gain in forbs more in burned lowlands than in other sites.

AB Echinometra mathaei (de Blainville) population increases, attributable to removal of their predators by fishermen, results in competitive exclusion of herbivorous fish and other sea urchin species, high reef substratum bioerosion and decreased reef topographic complexity. This study explores the population regulation of E. mathaei under conditions of reduced predator abundance. Experimental density manipulations suggest some density-dependent mortality, yet populations on heavily fished reefs continue to increase despite high biomass and reduced food. On two of three studied reefs, including the site with the highest population density, adult and juvenile densities were positively correlated in 1-m2 quadrats. Individuals on the high population-density reef had smaller gonads and gonad indices (gonad wt . body wt-1), lower relative gut weights, a higher fraction of calcium carbonate in their guts, larger Aristotle's lantern indices (jaw wt . body wt-1), and lower respiration rates than individuals on the low population density reef. Comparisons with individuals starved in aquaria indicate that these are responses to reduced food availability. There was no indication that larger individuals were able to avoid resource limitations more effectively than small individuals. Additionally, there was no indication of reduced body size with increasing population density. The frequency of intraspecific agonistic behavior during experimental manipulations was lower (G test, p < 0.001) on the high than on the low-density reef. Agonistic behavior appears important for defending burrows which reduces predator-induced mortality but not in maintaining a balance between the population food requirements and food resources. In high-density reefs, where predator densities and topographic complexity are low, the lack of predators and agonistic behavior or territorial defense leads to unrestrained population increases and reduced energy availability to individuals. Regulation occurs at the level of the individual organism, allowing high population densities through decreased energy availability to all individuals.

AB Key message Wildfire danger and burnt areas should increase over the century in southern Europe, owing to climate warming. Fire-prone area expansion to the north and to Mediterranean mountains is a concern, while climate-induced burnt area increase might be limited by fuel availability in the most arid areas. Further studies are needed to both assess and reduce uncertainties on future trends. Context Wildfire is the main disturbance in forested ecosystems of southern Europe. Warmer and drier conditions projected in this region are expected to profoundly affect wildfire regimes. Aims In this review, we pursue a twofold objective: (i) report the trends in wildfire danger and activity projected under warming climate in southern Europe and (ii) discuss the limitations of these projections. Methods We reviewed 23 projection studies that examined future wildfire danger or wildfire activity at local, regional or continental scale. Results Under the scenarios with the highest greenhouse gas emissions, we found that projection studies estimate an increase in future fire danger and burnt areas varying, on average, from 2 to 4% and from 5 to 50% per decade, respectively. Further comparisons on the magnitude of increase remained challenging because of heterogeneous methodological choices between projection studies. We then described three main sources of uncertainty that may affect the reliability of wildfire projections: climate projections, climate-fire models and the influences of fuels, fire-vegetation feedbacks and human-related factors on the climate-fire relationships. Conclusion We suggest research directions to address some of these issues for the purpose of refining fire danger and fire activity projections in southern Europe.

AB Recent increases in the frequency of extreme climate events (ECEs) such as heatwaves and floods have been attributed to climate change, and could have pronounced ecosystem and evolutionary impacts because they provide little opportunity for organisms to acclimate or adapt. Here we synthesize information on a series of ECEs in Australia from 2011 to 2017 that led to well-documented, abrupt, and extensive mortality of key marine habitat-forming organisms - corals, kelps, seagrasses, and mangroves - along >45% of the continental coastline of Australia. Coral bleaching occurred across much of northern Australia due to marine heatwaves (MHWs) affecting different regions in 2011, 2013, 2016, and 2017, while seagrass was impacted by anomalously high rainfall events in 2011 on both east and west tropical coasts. A MHW off western Australia (WA) during the 2011 La Nina extended into temperate and subtropical regions, causing widespread mortality of kelp forests and seagrass communities at their northern distribution limits. Mangrove forests experienced high mortality during the 2016 El Nino across coastal areas of northern and north-WA due to severe water stress driven by drought and anomalously low mean sea levels. This series of ECEs reflects a variety of different events - MHWs, intense rainfall from tropical storms, and drought. Their repeated occurrence and wide extent are consistent with projections of increased frequency and intensity of ECEs and have broad implications elsewhere because similar trends are predicted globally. The unprecedented and widespread nature of these ECE impacts has likely produced substantial ecosystem-wide repercussions. Predictions from ecosystem models suggest that the widespread mortality of habitat-forming taxa will have long-term and in some cases irreversible consequences, especially if they continue to become more frequent or severe. The abrupt ecological changes that are caused by ECEs could have greater long-term impacts than slower warming that leads to gradual reorganization and possible evolution and adaptation. ECEs are an emerging threat to marine ecosystems, and will require better seasonal prediction and mitigation strategies.

AB Camera traps are increasingly used to study wildlife ecology and inform conservation, but valid inference depends on appropriate data analysis. This article introduces the most common analytical approaches for camera-trap data. Camera traps are generally used as point-based sampling devices, and many analytical methods require spatial independence of camera-trap stations and temporal independence of subsequent records. Photographic rates of species should be interpreted with care, because they confound abundance/use with detectability. Occupancy models estimate species occurrence while accounting for imperfect detection and can reveal species-habitat associations. Capture-recapture models estimate abundance and detection probability from individual detection/nondetection data and are applicable to camera-trap data for individually recognizable species. Spatial capture-recapture extends this framework by accounting for animal movement and location relative to the trap array. This is particularly useful for the often wide-ranging species typically studied with camera traps and presents possibilities of modelling spatial population processes. Several methods have been developed to estimate abundance for species that cannot be individually identified; they all heavily rely on model assumptions. Finally, time stamps on camera-trap records can be used to describe activity pattern and temporal interactions between species. Considering the usefulness of camera trapping, we expect ongoing development of analytical approaches for camera-trap data.

AB The recent discovery of comammox Nitrospira capable of converting ammonia to nitrate in a single organism radically challenged our century-long perception of the classic two-step nitrification performed by ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers. However, our understanding of the niche separation of comammox Nitrospira and canonical nitrifiers in forest ecosystems remains limited, especially under a global scenario of elevated nitrogen (N) deposition. Here we evaluated the impacts of six-year N deposition on the dynamics of comammox Nitrospira, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in a subtropical forest soil. Soil inorganic N concentrations significantly increased under the six-year simulation of N deposition, while soil pH, available phosphorus, total carbon (C), C/N ratio and microbial biomass significantly decreased. Quantitative PCR showed that the amoA gene abundances of comammox Nitrospira Glade B and AOA substantially increased under the increasing rates of N deposition. By contrast, the AOB amoA gene abundance significantly decreased with the higher levels of N deposition (100 and 150 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). Increased (CO2)-C-13 incorporation into the AOA communities, rather than comammox Nitrospira or AOB, was demonstrated in a DNA-stable isotope probing microcosm, indicative of the capacity of AOA to assimilate (CO2)-C-13 through autotrophic nitrification in the investigated subtropical forest soil under long-term N deposition. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the autotrophic AOA assemblages belonged to the Nitrosotalea cluster, and their capacity for assimilating CO2 through autotrophic nitrification was not affected by the long-term N deposition. Taken together, we provided new evidence for the niche separation of comammox Nitrospira and canonical ammonia oxidizers in soil nitrification under the long-term N deposition in the acidic subtropical forest soil.

AB Based on a comprehensive analysis of key definitions of Green Infrastructure (GI) and their conceptual evolution, we present a review of current GI mapping approaches at multiple spatial scales and their associated functional analyses. GI is an approach that is used to combine ecosystem services and human well-being to realize an efficient and sustainable use of spaces, hereafter named "GI concept". The interdisciplinary database that forms the basis of our literature review includes peer-reviewed journal papers as well as books and documents published by international organizations, governmental agencies, and research institutions. By analyzing these publications not only English but also Chinese articles we present an exhaustive review that gauges the state and evolution of GI in chronological terms, and we discuss how GI should be further improved. We systematically examine what GI actually measures and question whether its current manifestations are consistent with its conceptual development. Furthermore, we seek to find out whether there are specific trends in the conceptual evolution of definitions of GI, and whether there are gaps between this evolution and the implementation of GI in the context of advancing sustainable development. We then draw attention to differentiation while analyzing GI functions and classifications. On this foundation, we discuss six primary principles and propose a number of ways of enhancing and applying GI in the future. Our review shows that, at this point in time, special emphasis on the core idea of multifunctionality is significant for depicting the 'state of the art' of the evolving GI concept. Finally, the study identifies multifunctionality as the solution best suited to enhance the GI concept and to open up potential avenues for further research.

AB Invasive alien species modify pollinator biodiversity and the services they provide that underpin ecosystem function and human well-being. Building on the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) global assessment of pollinators and pollination, we synthesize current understanding of invasive alien impacts on pollinators and pollination. Invasive alien species create risks and opportunities for pollinator nutrition, re-organize species interactions to affect native pollination and community stability, and spread and select for virulent diseases. Risks are complex but substantial, and depend greatly on the ecological function and evolutionary history of both the invader and the recipient ecosystem. We highlight evolutionary implications for pollination from invasive alien species, and identify future research directions, key messages and options for decision-making.

AB Demand for restoration of resilient, self-sustaining, and biodiverse natural ecosystems as a conservation measure is increasing globally; however, restoration efforts frequently fail to meet standards appropriate for this objective. Achieving these standards requires management underpinned by input from diverse scientific disciplines including ecology, biotechnology, engineering, soil science, ecophysiology, and genetics. Despite increasing restoration research activity, a gap between the immediate needs of restoration practitioners and the outputs of restoration science often limits the effectiveness of restoration programs. Regrettably, studies often fail to identify the practical issues most critical for restoration success. We propose that part of this oversight may result from the absence of a considered statement of the necessary practical restoration science questions. Here we develop a comprehensive framework of the research required to bridge this gap and guide effective restoration. We structure questions in five themes: (1) setting targets and planning for success, (2) sourcing biological material, (3) optimizing establishment, (4) facilitating growth and survival, and (5) restoring resilience, sustainability, and landscape integration. This framework will assist restoration practitioners and scientists to identify knowledge gaps and develop strategic research focused on applied outcomes. The breadth of questions highlights the importance of cross-discipline collaboration among restoration scientists, and while the program is broad, successful restoration projects have typically invested in many or most of these themes. Achieving restoration ecology's goal of averting biodiversity losses is a vast challenge: investment in appropriate science is urgently needed for ecological restoration to fulfill its potential and meet demand as a conservation tool.

AB Global climate change affects marine fish through drivers such as ocean warming, acidification and oxygen depletion, causing changes in marine ecosystems and socioeconomic impacts. While experimental and observational results can inform about anticipated effects of different drivers, linking between these results and ecosystem-level changes requires quantitative integration of physiological and ecological processes into models to advance research and inform management. We give an overview of important physiological and ecological processes affected by environmental drivers. We then provide a review of available modelling approaches for marine fish, analysing their capacities for process-based integration of environmental drivers. Building on this, we propose approaches to advance important research questions. Examples of integration of environmental drivers exist for each model class. Recent extensions of modelling frameworks increase the potential for including detailed mechanisms and improving model projections. Experimental results on energy allocation, behaviour and physiological limitations will advance the understanding of organism-level trade-offs and thresholds in response to multiple drivers. More explicit representation of life cycles and biological traits can improve description of population dynamics and adaptation, and data on food web topology and feeding interactions help to detail the conditions for possible regime shifts. Identification of relevant processes will also benefit the coupling of different models to investigate spatial-temporal changes in stock productivity and integrated responses of social-ecological systems. Thus, a more process-informed foundation for models will promote the integration of experimental and observational results and increase the potential for model-based extrapolations into a future under changing environmental conditions.

AB Deforestation rates have declined in the Brazilian Amazon since 2005, yet degradation from logging, fire, and fragmentation has continued in frontier forests. In this study we quantified the aboveground carbon density (ACD) in intact and degraded forests using the largest data set of integrated forest inventory plots (n = 359) and airborne lidar data (18,000ha) assembled to date for the Brazilian Amazon. We developed statistical models relating inventory ACD estimates to lidar metrics that explained 70% of the variance across forest types. Airborne lidar-ACD estimates for intact forests ranged between 5.0 2.5 and 31.9 10.8kgCm(-2). Degradation carbon losses were large and persistent. Sites that burned multiple times within a decade lost up to 15.0 0.7kgCm(-2) (94%) of ACD. Forests that burned nearly 15years ago had between 4.1 0.5 and 6.8 +/- 0.3kgCm(-2) (22-40%) less ACD than intact forests. Even for low-impact logging disturbances, ACD was between 0.7 +/- 0.3 and 4.4 +/- 0.4kgCm(-2) (4-21%) lower than unlogged forests. Comparing biomass estimates from airborne lidar to existing biomass maps, we found that regional and pantropical products consistently overestimated ACD in degraded forests, underestimated ACD in intact forests, and showed little sensitivity to fires and logging. Fine-scale heterogeneity in ACD across intact and degraded forests highlights the benefits of airborne lidar for carbon mapping. Differences between airborne lidar and regional biomass maps underscore the need to improve and update biomass estimates for dynamic land use frontiers, to better characterize deforestation and degradation carbon emissions for regional carbon budgets and Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+).

AB Determining the links between the behavioural and population responses of wild species to environmental variations is critical for understanding the impact of climate variability on ecosystems. Using long-term data sets, we show how large-scale climatic anomalies in the Southern Hemisphere affect the foraging behaviour and population dynamics of a key marine predator, the king penguin. When large-scale subtropical dipole events occur simultaneously in both subtropical Southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans, they generate tropical anomalies that shift the foraging zone southward. Consequently the distances that penguins foraged from the colony and their feeding depths increased and the population size decreased. This represents an example of a robust and fast impact of large-scale climatic anomalies affecting a marine predator through changes in its at-sea behaviour and demography, despite lack of information on prey availability. Our results highlight a possible behavioural mechanism through which climate variability may affect population processes.

AB Ballast water has been widely used by commercial vessels to control trim, draft and stability since the late 1870s. While the global transport of ballast water (and associated sediments) was first recognized as a potential dispersal mechanism for plankton in the late 1890s, quantitative research on the issue does not appear in the primary scientific literature until the mid-1980s. Following James T. Carlton's comprehensive review of the biology of ballast water in 1985, there was an explosion in research effort, with nearly 400 papers published in the last thirty years. This article provides a brief overview of the role that ballast water has played as a global vector for aquatic invasive species, summarizing the current state of ballast water research and emerging topics for future study, based on a review of articles in the primary scientific literature.
   Initially, the main research focus was to document the community composition of ballast water in ships arriving to ports around the world. In the late 1990s, risk ssessments examining shipping traffic patterns and environmental tolerances of species likely transported in ballast water dominated. By 2000, ballast water studies examining efficacy of various treatment strategies dominated, and papers exploring new tools and methods for more accurate/representative sampling and analysis of ballast water emerged as an important research topic. There is currently insufficient data to confidently quantify the probability of invasion associated with any particular inoculum density (or discharge standard), as a result, laboratory, field and modeling studies examining the relationship between invasion risk and the size of the initially released population (the 'risk-release relationship') are an emerging, high priority field of study.

AB The assumption that increased wildfire incidence in the Mediterranean Basin during the last decades is an outcome of changes in land use warrants an objective analysis. In this study we examine how annual area burned (BA) in the Portuguese public forest varied in relation to environmental and human-influenced drivers during the 1943-2011 period. Fire behaviour models were used to describe fuel hazard considering biomass removal, cover type changes, area burned, post-disturbance fuel accumulation, forest age-classes distribution and fuel connectivity. Biomass removal decreased rapidly beyond the 1940s, which, along with afforestation, increased fuel hazard until the 1980s; a subsequent decline was caused by increased fire activity. Change point analysis indicates upward shifts in BA in 1952 and in 1973, both corresponding to six-fold increases. Fire weather (expressed by the 90th percentile of the Canadian FWI during summer) increased over the study period, accounting for 18 and 36% of log(BA) variation before 1974 and after 1973, respectively. Regression modelling indicates that BA responds positively to fire weather, fuel hazard and number of fires in descending order of importance; pre-summer and 2-year lagged precipitation respectively decrease and increase BA, but the effects are minor and non-significant when both variables are included in the model. Land use conflicts (expressed through more fires) played a role, but it was afforestation and agricultural abandonment that supported the fire regime shifts, explaining weather-drought as the current major driver of BA as well. We conclude that bottom-up factors, i.e. human-induced changes in landscape flammability and ignition density, can enhance or override the influence of weather-drought on the fire regime in Mediterranean humid regions. A more relevant role of fuel control in fire management policies and practices is warranted by our findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite no obvious barrier to gene flow, historical environmental processes and ecological specializations can lead to genetic differentiation in highly mobile animals. Ecotypes emerged in several large mammal species as a result of niche specializations and/or social organization. In the North-West Atlantic, two distinct bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) ecotypes (i.e. coastal' and pelagic') have been identified. Here, we investigated the genetic population structure of North-East Atlantic (NEA) bottlenose dolphins on a large scale through the analysis of 381 biopsy-sampled or stranded animals using 25 microsatellites and a 682-bp portion of the mitochondrial control region. We shed light on the likely origin of stranded animals using a carcass drift prediction model. We showed, for the first time, that coastal and pelagic bottlenose dolphins were highly differentiated in the NEA. Finer-scale population structure was found within the two groups. We suggest that distinct founding events followed by parallel adaptation may have occurred independently from a large Atlantic pelagic population in the two sides of the basin. Divergence could be maintained by philopatry possibly as a result of foraging specializations and social organization. As coastal environments are under increasing anthropogenic pressures, small and isolated populations might be at risk and require appropriate conservation policies to preserve their habitats. While genetics can be a powerful first step to delineate ecotypes in protected and difficult to access taxa, ecotype distinction should be further documented through diet studies and the examination of cranial skull features associated with feeding.

AB This study employed least square support vector machine regression (LS-SVM-R) and multi-linear regression (MLR) for statistically downscaling monthly general circulation model (GCM) outputs directly to monthly catchment streamflows. The scope of the study was limited to calibration and validation of the downscaling models. The methodology was demonstrated by its application to a streamflow site in the Grampian water supply system in northwestern Victoria, Australia. Probable predictors for the study were selected from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data set based on the past literature and hydrology. Probable variables that displayed the best significant correlations, consistently with the streamflows over the entire period of the study (19502010) and under three 20-year time slices (19501969, 19701989 and 19902010) were selected as potential predictors. To better capture seasonal variations of streamflows, downscaling models were developed for each calendar month. The standardized potential predictors were introduced to the LS-SVM-R and MLR models, starting from the best correlated three and then, others one by one, based on their correlations with the streamflows, until the model performance in validation was maximized. This stepwise model development enabled the identification of the optimum number of potential variables for each month. The model calibration was performed over the period 19501989 and validation was done for 19902010. LS-SVM-R model parameter optimization was achieved using simplex algorithm and leave-one-out cross-validation. The MLR models were optimized by minimizing the sum of squared errors. In both modelling techniques, validation was performed as an independent simulation. In calibration, LS-SVM-R and MLR models displayed equally good performances with a trend of under-predicting high flows. During validation, LS-SVM-R outperformed MLR, though both techniques over-predicted most of the streamflows. It was concluded that LS-SVM-R is a better technique for statistically downscaling GCM outputs to streamflows than MLR, but still MLR is a potential technique for the same task.

AB Aim Earth observation (EO) products are a valuable alternative to spectral vegetation indices. We discuss the availability of EO products for analysing patterns in macroecology, particularly related to vegetation, on a range of spatial and temporal scales. Location Global. Methods We discuss four groups of EO products: land cover/cover change, vegetation structure and ecosystem productivity, fire detection, and digital elevation models. We address important practical issues arising from their use, such as assumptions underlying product generation, product accuracy and product transferability between spatial scales. We investigate the potential of EO products for analysing terrestrial ecosystems. Results Land cover, productivity and fire products are generated from long-term data using standardized algorithms to improve reliability in detecting change of land surfaces. Their global coverage renders them useful for macroecology. Their spatial resolution (e.g. GLOBCOVER vegetation, 300 m; MODIS vegetation and fire, = 500 m; ASTER digital elevation, 30 m) can be a limiting factor. Canopy structure and productivity products are based on physical approaches and thus are independent of biome-specific calibrations. Active fire locations are provided in near-real time, while burnt area products show actual area burnt by fire. EO products can be assimilated into ecosystem models, and their validation information can be employed to calculate uncertainties during subsequent modelling. Main conclusions Owing to their global coverage and long-term continuity, EO end products can significantly advance the field of macroecology. EO products allow analyses of spatial biodiversity, seasonal dynamics of biomass and productivity, and consequences of disturbances on regional to global scales. Remaining drawbacks include inter-operability between products from different sensors and accuracy issues due to differences between assumptions and models underlying the generation of different EO products. Our review explains the nature of EO products and how they relate to particular ecological variables across scales to encourage their wider use in ecological applications.

AB Gametophytic apomixis is a common form of asexual reproduction in plants. Virtually all gametophytic apomicts are polyploids, and some view polyploidy as a prerequisite for the transition to apomixis. However, any causal link between apomixis and polyploidy is complicated by the fact that most apomictic polyploids are allopolyploids, leading some to speculate that hybridization, rather than polyploidy, enables apomixis. Diploid apomixis presents a rare opportunity to isolate the role of hybridization, and a number of diploid apomicts have been documented in the genus Boechera (Brassicaceae). Here, we present the results of a microsatellite study of 1393 morphologically and geographically diverse diploid individuals, evaluating the hypothesis that diploid Boechera apomicts are hybrids. This genus-wide dataset was made possible by the applicability of a core set of microsatellite loci in 69 of the 70 diploid Boechera species and by our ability to successfully genotype herbarium specimens of widely varying ages. With few exceptions, diploid apomicts exhibited markedly high levels of heterozygosity resulting from the combination of disparate genomes. This strongly suggests that most apomictic diploid Boechera lineages are of hybrid origin, and that the genomic consequences of hybridization allow for the transition to gametophytic apomixis in this genus.

AB The increasing evidence for population declines in bumble bee (Bombus) species worldwide has accelerated research efforts to explain losses in these important pollinators. In North America, a number of once widespread Bombus species have suffered serious reductions in range and abundance, although other species remain healthy. To examine whether declining and stable species exhibit different levels of genetic diversity or population fragmentation, we used microsatellite markers to genotype populations sampled across the geographic distributions of two declining (Bombus occidentalis and Bombus pensylvanicus) and four stable (Bombus bifarius; Bombus vosnesenskii; Bombus impatiens and Bombus bimaculatus) Bombus species. Populations of declining species generally have reduced levels of genetic diversity throughout their range compared to codistributed stable species. Genetic diversity can be affected by overall range size and degree of isolation of local populations, potentially confounding comparisons among species in some cases. We find no evidence for consistent differences in gene flow among stable and declining species, with all species exhibiting weak genetic differentiation over large distances (e.g. >1000 km). Populations on islands and at high elevations experience relatively strong genetic drift, suggesting that some conditions lead to genetic isolation in otherwise weakly differentiated species. B.similar to occidentalis and B.similar to bifarius exhibit stronger genetic differentiation than the other species, indicating greater phylogeographic structure consistent with their broader geographic distributions across topographically complex regions of western North America. Screening genetic diversity in North American Bombus should prove useful for identifying species that warrant monitoring, and developing management strategies that promote high levels of gene flow will be a key component in efforts to maintain healthy populations.

AB Leaf-level photosynthetic parameters of species in the closely related genera Eucalyptus and Corymbia were assessed along a strong rainfall gradient in northern Australia. Both instantaneous gas exchange measurements and leaf carbon isotope discrimination indicated little variation in intercellular CO(2) concentrations during photosynthesis (c(i)) in response to a decrease in mean annual precipitation from similar to 1700 mm to similar to 300 mm. Correlation between stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity contributed toward the maintenance of relatively constant c(i) among the sampled leaves, when assessed at ambient CO(2) concentration and photon irradiance similar to full sunlight. Leaf mass per area was the most plastic leaf trait along the rainfall gradient, showing a linear increase in response to decreasing mean annual precipitation. The maximum Rubisco carboxylation velocity, V(cmax), expressed on a leaf-area basis, showed a modest increase in response to decreasing rainfall. This modest increase in V(cmax) was associated with the strongly expressed increase in leaf mass per area. These results suggest that variation in ecosystem-level gas exchange during the dry season in north-Australian savannas will likely be dominated by changes in leaf area index in response to increasing aridity, rather than by changes in photosynthetic performance per unit leaf area.

AB Assessment of abundance, survival, recruitment rates, and density (i.e., population assessment) is especially challenging for elusive species most in need of protection (e.g., rare carnivores). Individual identification methods, such as DNA sampling, provide ways of studying such species efficiently and noninvasively. Additionally, statistical methods that correct for undetected animals and account for locations where animals are captured are available to efficiently estimate density and other demographic parameters. We collected hair samples of European wildcat (Felis silvestris) from cheek-rub lure sticks, extracted DNA from the samples, and identified each animals' genotype. To estimate the density of wildcats, we used Bayesian inference in a spatial capture-recapture model. We used WinBUGS to fit a model that accounted for differences in detection probability among individuals and seasons and between two lure arrays. We detected 21 individual wildcats (including possible hybrids) 47 times. Wildcat density was estimated at 0.29/km2 (SE 0.06), and 95% of the activity of wildcats was estimated to occur within 1.83 km from their home-range center. Lures located systematically were associated with a greater number of detections than lures placed in a cell on the basis of expert opinion. Detection probability of individual cats was greatest in late March. Our model is a generalized linear mixed model; hence, it can be easily extended, for instance, to incorporate trap- and individual-level covariates. We believe that the combined use of noninvasive sampling techniques and spatial capture-recapture models will improve population assessments, especially for rare and elusive animals.

AB Although there is growing evidence of climate warming, for many regions the broader effects of climate variation on marine top predators remains unknown owing to the difficulty in obtaining, for synthesis, long-term and short-term datasets on multiple species. In the Australian region, climatic and oceanographic variability and change have been shown to affect marine species, often with profound consequences. Many seabirds are apex predators for which changes in climatic and oceanic dynamics have driven range movements poleward, reduced breeding success and altered breeding timing for some species. Here we review the literature to assess and determine the vulnerability of Australian seabirds to variation and change in climate and identify which species and ecosystems may be more resilient to future climate warming. It is clear from this synthesis that not all Australian seabirds are affected similarly, with responses varying by species and location. In addition, the paucity of information on the distribution and biology of seabird prey, foraging patterns and movements of seabirds, and the ability of seabirds to switch between prey species or adjust timing of life-cycles make generalisations about potential effects of future climate change and adaptive capacity in seabirds difficult. This applies both within Australia and elsewhere, where data are similarly sparse.

AB Spiders represent a diverse, widespread and abundant group of carnivores. Studying the nutritional ecology of spiders is critical because it can aid in understanding the evolution of prey capture and life history strategies, factors regulating the abundance and diversity of spiders in particular habitats and the role of spiders in arthropod community dynamics including biological control of crop pests. The feeding habits of spiders have long attracted the attention of biologists, in part, because many build webs and are relatively easy to observe. While these studies have provided a wealth of information on the abundance and types of prey captured, they have yielded relatively little information on the types and quantities of nutrients ingested by spiders in nature. Relatively little is also known about the nutritional requirements of spiders, although recent studies using more controlled manipulations of prey nutrient content are beginning to provide a clearer understanding of the types and quantities of nutrients needed by spiders to maximize performance. There is a tremendous opportunity to rapidly advance our understanding of spider nutrition, given a strong foundation in the natural history, behaviour, physiology and ecology of spiders and recent advances in analytical techniques and frameworks for studying nutrition. Studies focusing on the connections between spider nutritional physiology and how this is affected by and affects prey communities may produce particularly exciting results.

AB Current shifts in ecosystem composition and function emphasize the need for an understanding of the links between environmental factors and organism fitness and tolerance. The examples discussed here illustrate how recent progress in the field of comparative physiology may provide a better mechanistic understanding of the ecological concepts of the fundamental and realized niches and thus provide insights into the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance. Here we argue that, as a link between physiological and ecological indicators of organismal performance, the mechanisms shaping aerobic scope and passive tolerance set the dimensions of an animal's niche, here defined as its capacity to survive, grow, behave, and interact with other species. We demonstrate how comparative studies of cod or killifish populations in a latitudinal cline have unraveled mitochondrial mechanisms involved in establishing a species' niche, performance, and energy budget. Riverine fish exemplify how the performance windows of various developmental stages follow the dynamic regimes of both seasonal temperatures and river hydrodynamics, as synergistic challenges. Finally, studies of species in extreme environments, such as the tilapia of Lake Magadi, illustrate how on evolutionary timescales functional and morphological shifts can occur, associated with new specializations. We conclude that research on the processes and time course of adaptations suitable to overcome current niche limits is urgently needed to assess the resilience of species and ecosystems to human impact, including the challenges of global climate change.

AB Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) possesses ecological and socio-economic advantages, relative to single-species aquaculture. The promotion of a sustainable aquaculture industry requires that decision-makers, ecosystem managers and farmers have sufficient quantitative information associated with its implementation from both public and private perspectives. The present paper applies the Differential Drivers Pressure State Impact Response (ADPSIR) methodological approach to an ecological and economic comparison between mono-aquaculture and IMTA. Data from a South African 240-ton year(-1) abalone farm were used as a case study. Three operation schemes were considered: abalone monoculture in a flow-through system; and two IMTA schemes, which recycle water and replace 10% and 30% of kelp consumption with on-farm-grown seaweed. The analysis indicates a decrease in the aquaculture generated ecological pressures with the incorporation of seaweeds, mainly a reduction in nitrogen discharges into the adjacent coastal ecosystem (by 3.7 to 5.0 tons year(-1) a reduction in harvest of natural kelp beds (by 2.2 to 6.6 ha year(-1)) and a reduction of GHG emissions (by 290 to 350 tons CO(2)e year(-1)). Adopting an IMTA configuration raised farm profits by 1.4 to 5%. The corresponding overall gain from using IMTA in the case study is several folds larger than the net gain in profit, and is estimated between 1.1 and 3.0 million U.S. dollar per annum. This range of values reflects the gains of adopting IMTA on (i) economic value of the aquaculture, i.e. farm's profit, (ii) value of environmental externalities, and (iii) implementation costs. The analysis suggests that the value of the benefits to the public by adopting the IMTA configurations can be larger than the gains in farm's profitability. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB This case study shows the application of nontraditional diagnostic methods to investigate the microbial consortia inhabiting an ancient manuscript. The manuscript was suspected to be biologically deteriorated and SEM observations showed the presence of fungal spores attached to fibers, but classic culturing methods did not succeed in isolating microbial contaminants. Therefore, molecular methods, including PCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and clone libraries, were used as a sensitive alternative to conventional cultivation techniques. DGGE fingerprints revealed a high biodiversity of both bacteria and fungi inhabiting the manuscript. DNA sequence analysis confirmed the existence of fungi and bacteria in manuscript samples. A number of fungal clones identified on the manuscript showed similarity to fungal species inhabiting dry or saline environments, suggesting that the manuscript environment selects for osmophilic or xerophilic fungal species. Most of the bacterial sequences retrieved from the manuscript belong to phylotypes with cellulolytic activities.

AB Birds are responding to recent climate change in a variety of ways including shifting their geographic ranges to cooler climates. There is evidence that northern-temperate birds have shifted their breeding and non-breeding ranges to higher latitudes, and tropical birds have shifted their breeding ranges to higher altitudes. There is further evidence these shifts have affected migration strategies and the composition and structure of communities. Projections based on correlative distributional models suggest many birds will experience substantial pressures under climate change, resulting in range contraction and shifts. Inherent limitations of correlative models, however, make it difficult to develop reliable projections and detailed inference. Incorporating a mechanistic perspective into species distribution models enriches the quality of model inferences but also severely narrows the taxonomic and geographic relevance. Mechanistic distributional models have seen increased applications, but so far primarily in ectotherms. We argue that further development of similar models in birds would complement existing empirical knowledge and theoretical projections. The considerable data already available on birds offer an exciting basis. In particular, information compiled on flight performance and thermal associations across life history stages could be linked to distributional limits and dispersal abilities, which could be used to develop more robust and detailed projections. Yet, only a broadening of taxonomic scale, specifically to appropriately represented tropical diversity, will allow for truly general inference and require the continued use of correlative approaches that may take on increasingly mechanistic components. The trade-off between detail and scale is likely to characterize the future of global change biodiversity research, and birds may be an excellent group to improve, integrate and geographically extend current approaches.

AB In arid environments, ecological refuges are often conceptualised as places where animal species can persist through drought owing to the localised persistence of moisture and nutrients. The mesopredator release hypothesis (MRH) predicts that reduced abundance of top-order predators results in an increase in the abundance of smaller predators (mesopredators) and consequently has detrimental impacts on the prey of the smaller predators. Thus according to the MRH, the existence of larger predators may provide prey with refuge from predation. In this study, we investigated how the abundance of an endangered rodent Notomys fuscus is affected by Australia's largest predator, the dingo Canis lupus dingo, introduced mesopredators, introduced herbivores, kangaroos and rainfall. Our surveys showed that N. fuscus was more abundant where dingoes occurred. Generalised linear modelling showed that N. fuscus abundance was associated positively with dingo activity and long-term annual rainfall and negatively with red fox Vulpes vulpes activity. Our results were consistent with the hypothesis that areas with higher rainfall and dingoes provide N. fuscus with refuge from drought and predation by invasive red foxes, respectively. Top-order predators, such as dingoes, could have an important functional role in broad-scale biodiversity conservation programmes by reducing the impacts of mesopredators.

AB With examples from Australo-Papuan ornithology, we examine the technical and theoretical roots of molecular phylogeography and review its development. We describe the progression from ad hoc interpretation of gene trees in single species phylogeographic studies through to comparative phylogeography and currently advocated model-testing approaches. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences have provided most advances to date, although we demonstrate and advocate the future use of multilocus datasets analysed with coalescent methods. We examine interrelationships among speciation research, historical biogeography, phylogeography and landscape genetics. Mitochondrial paraphyly, in which individuals of one species or population have mtDNA that is more closely related to that of another than to their own, emerges in 44% of Australian studies to date as a common, important result in Australian avian phylogeography. Accordingly, we explore at length its most common causes and its impact on case studies in Australo-Papuan avian phylogeography. The impact of so much paraphyly on avian phylogeography and taxonomy is a major theme of the review. We suggest a full research agenda for avian phylogeography in the Australo-Papuan region that spans diverse topics: the need for more studies of pelagic birds, spatio-temporal links between New Guinea and Australia, island populations, testing of long-established biogeographical hypotheses, and integration of molecular and non-molecular datasets into integrated evolutionary understanding of species and populations. Studying the full continuum of divergences from landscape genetics, to phylogeography, to recently diverged species with evidence of paraphyly, to highly divergent species with many fixed differences will lead to a more complete understanding of the processes and patterns of avian evolution.

AB The barrens-forming sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii (Diadematidae) has recently undergone poleward range-extension to Tasmania where grazing of diverse and economically important macroalgal beds has occurred. We compared growth, biometric, dietary and morphometric characteristics of C. rodgersii between macroalgal habitat and adjacent barrens to inform population dynamics of the sea urchin within the newly extended range. The age structure of C. rodgersii in macroalgal habitat and adjacent barrens is similar, suggesting that both habitats have been influenced by similar recruitment events. However, there are clear differences in body size, body mass, spine length and diet of sea urchins in the 2 habitat types. We identified 2 broad morphologies of C. rodgersii. The first is of relatively large size with thick test, rapid growth and short spines, that. grazes macroalgal beds (macroalgal eco-morph). The second ecomorph persists on the barrens habitat and demonstrates smaller body size, slower growth and thinner test, with gut contents dominated by closely cropped filamentous and/or coralline algae; but occurs at higher density, possesses longer spines and appears to enhance the persistence stability of barrens habitat. once it is formed (barrens ecomorph). Invading dense, swell-prone macroalgal habitat of eastern Tasmania, the phenotypic plasticity displayed by this sea urchin appears to be an important mechanism facilitating colonisation of reef habitats within the extension region. Importantly, habitat.-specific patterns in population dynamics are broadly consistent with those observed from within the historical range, suggesting that patterns in macroalgal-sea urchin dynamics and the ecological importance of this species will be similar across the newly extended range.

AB Females tend to be smaller than males in woody dioecious plant species, but they tend to be larger in herbs. The smaller size of females in woody species has been attributed to higher reproductive costs, yet no satisfactory explanation has been provided for their larger size in herbs. Because herbs have higher nitrogen concentrations in their tissues than woody plants, and because pollen is particularly rich in nitrogen, we predicted that male growth would be more compromised by reproduction than female growth. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three experiments on the annual dioecious herb Mercurialis annua. First, we compared the timing of reproduction between males and females and found that males started flowering earlier than females; early flowering is expected to compromise growth more than later flowering. Second, we compared plants allowed to flower with those prevented from flowering by experimental debudding and found that males incurred a higher reproductive cost than females in terms of both biomass and, particularly, nitrogen. Third, we grew plants under varying levels of nitrogen availability and found that although sexual size dimorphism was unaffected by nitrogen, females, but not males, decreased their relative allocation to both roots and reproduction under high nitrogen availability. We propose that males deal with the high cost of pollen production in terms of nitrogen by allocating biomass to nitrogen-harvesting roots, whereas females pay for carbon-rich seeds and fruits by investing in photosynthetic organs. Sexual dimorphism would thus seem to be the outcome of allocation to above-versus below-ground sinks that supply resources (carbon versus nitrogen) limiting the female and male reproduction differentially.

AB We present the first quantified evidence of shifting environmental baselines from an island coral reef fishery (Rodrigues). As depletion of commercial fish species spreads out from the coast youngsters share few of their elders' memories of former abundance. Of three generations, the oldest reported more fish species as depleted (p <= 0.001), including predators indicative of ecosystem health and of interest to tourists. They recalled larger catches of the most-cited species Epinephelus multinotatus and bigger fish (p < 0.001). Generations also differed in their perceptions of island-level environmental change. Shifting baseline studies may be useful when planning Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in data-poor countries prioritising sustainable development. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphorus (P) is a major factor limiting the response of carbon acquisition of plants and ecosystems to increasing atmospheric CO, content. An important consideration, however, is the effect of P deficiency at the low atmospheric CO2 content common in recent geological history, because plants adapted to these conditions may also be limited in their ability to respond to further increases in CO, content. To ascertain the effects of low P on various components of photosynthesis, white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) was grown hydroponically at 200, 400 and 750 mu mol mol(-1) CO2, under sufficient and deficient P supply (250 and 0.69 mu m P, respectively). Increasing growth CO, content increased photosynthesis only under sufficient growth P. Ribulose 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) content and activation state were not reduced to the same degree as the net CO2 assimilation rate (A), and the in vivo rate of electron transport was sufficient to support photosynthesis in all cases. The rate of triose phosphate use did not appear limiting either, because all the treatments continued to respond positively to a drop in oxygen levels. We conclude that, at ambient and elevated CO2 content, photosynthesis in low-P plants appears limited by the rate of ribulose biphosphate (RuBP) regeneration, probably through inhibition of the Calvin cycle. This failure of P-deficient plants to respond to rising CO2 content above 200 mu mol mol(-1) indicates that P status already imposes a widespread restriction in plant responses to increases in CO2 content from the pre-industrial level to current values.

AB The spatial distribution of mycorrhizae and hyphae in a regolith of thin soils overlying deeply weathered granitic bedrock was investigated at Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve in southern California. The regolith supports mature Quercus agrifolia trees and consists of thin soils (24-100 cm) overlying four varieties of granitic parent materials, and a fault gouge. Evergreen plants with deep, extensive root systems are favored during inherent seasonal droughts of Mediterranean climate. However, sub-soil roots are confined to the fractures and are physically restricted from the matrix micropores of the weathered granitic bedrock where the bulk of the regolith plant available water exists. Ectomycorrhizal (EM) root tips were found throughout the regolith to depths of similar to 4 in. Some EM infection frequencies of fracture-confined roots (range 1-63%) were similar to those found in the upper 30 cm of soil (range 33-94%). Hyphae were recovered from all depths and material types: soil (averaged 75.0-127.8 in cm(-3)), fracture (2.5-30.2 m cm(-3)), and matrix material (1.2-10.0 m cm(-3)). Hyphae in the form of rhizomorphs were also recovered from deep, matrix materials. Total N was extremely low in the fractures and negligible in the matrix materials; therefore we postulate that N deficits are not driving the formation of ectomycorrhizal infection within the bedrock. Hyphae have been shown to act as water conduits and can transport matrix water, otherwise unavailable to plants, from micropores to fracture-confined, mycorrhizal roots. The formation of mycorrhizae in weathered bedrock fractures, and hyphal extension into the matrix, may be crucial to the water balance of evergreen trees in Mediterranean climates by providing a link between matrix resources and the plant.

AB 1. In mountainous regions, road construction is accompanied by large-scale physical disturbance associated with cut and fill operations that drastically alter the landscape. Cut operations remove soil and rock from the hillside above the proposed road, while soil and rock are deposited on the down-slope area in fill operations. The resultant roadsides are highly disturbed habitats characterized by plant communities maintained at an early successional stage. They are often planted with non-native species and frequently provide vectors for the introduction and spread of invasive species. Public transportation managers need to balance the rapid revegetation of roadsides with the goal of maximizing use of native species and minimizing the introduction of non-native species.
   2. This study examined vegetation-site relationships along 13 major four-lane highways in West Virginia, USA, using analysis of variance, multiresponse permutation procedures and indicator species analysis.
   3. Mean soil nutrient values showed some differences with respect to highway, but fewer when highway positions were compared. Similarly, when highway position was considered, there were no significant differences in mean plant species richness, evenness or diversity.
   4. Results of multiresponse permutation procedures suggested that different highways may be characterized by distinct vegetation assemblages. This hypothesis was supported by indicator species analysis: 54 species showed a statistically significant (P < 0.05) affinity to one highway over all others. More than half of these were classified as non-native and exotic invasive species. When highway position was considered, no significant differences in community composition were found, and indicator species analysis found only 25 species that exhibited a significant affinity to one type of position. Of these, only eight were exotic.
   5. Of the 33 most abundant herbaceous species, 11 showed a significant relationship between cover and distance from pavement. For all but one, average cover declined in a linear fashion with increasing distance.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Despite extensive topographic disturbance associated with highway construction, the resultant vegetative communities do not differ with respect to type of construction or resultant landform. This suggests that highway agencies can manage roadside vegetation using similar, standard techniques. Roadsides are optimal growing sites for exotic invasive species that out-compete native vegetation. Management goals should therefore include techniques for limiting the establishment of these species, and substitution of non-native species planted for erosion control with suitable native species.

AB The first third (ca. 1200 bp) of exon 1 of the nuclear gene encoding the interstitial retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) has been sequenced for 12 representative primates belonging to Lemuriformes, Lorisiformes, Tarsiiformes, Platyrrhini, and Catarrhini, and combined with available data (13 other primates, 11 nonprimate placentals, and 2 marsupials). Phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood on nucleotides and amino acids robustly support the monophyly of primates, Strepsirrhini, Lemuriformes, Lorisiformes, Anthropoidea, Catarrhini, and Platyrrhini. It is interesting to note that 1) Tarsiidae grouped with Anthropoidea, and the support for this node depends on the molecular characters considered; 2) Cheirogaleidae grouped within Lemuriformes; and 3) Daubentonia was the sister group of all other Lemuriformes. Study of the IRBP evolutionary rate shows a high heterogeneity within placentals and also within primates. Maximum likelihood local molecular clocks were assigned to three clades displaying significantly contrasted evolutionary rates. Paenungulata were shown to evolve 2.5-3 times faster than Perissodactyla and Lemuriformes. Six independent calibration points were used to estimate splitting ages of the main primate clades, and their compatibility was evaluated. Divergence ages were obtained for the following crown groups: 13.8-14.2 MY for Lorisiformes, 26.5-27.2 MY for Lemuroidea, 39.6-40.7 MY for Lemuriformes, 45.4-46.7 MY for Strepsirrhini, and 56.7-58.4 MY for Haplorrhini. The incompatibility between some paleontological and molecular estimates may reflect the incompleteness of the placental fossil record, and/or indicate that the variable IRBP evolutionary rates are not fully accommodated by local molecular clocks.

AB This review describes how ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) is related to photosynthesis, N economy, and whole plant growth in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Rubisco is a rate-limiting factor for potential photosynthesis under the present atmospheric air conditions. Although there is no variation in the enzymic properties of Rubisco among rice varieties including old and modern cultivars, the specific activity is 30 to 40% lower than that in other higher plants such as wheat, spinach, and tobacco. In the future, the use of recombinant DNA technology in the chloroplast may enable to improve the kinetic efficiency of rice leaf Rubisco. Rubisco content is correlated with leaf-N content, but its amount in senescent leaves is often much lower than predicted from leaf-N content. Degradation of Rubisco is the major determinant of Rubisco content in senescent leaves. In sub-optimal environments characterized by a moderately low temperature, low irradiance, and CO2 enrichment, Rubisco content does not limit photosynthesis and remains excessive. Even when rice is adapted to such environments, rice does not optimize Rubisco content. Transgenic rice with theoretically optimal Rubisco content at elevated [CO2] by antisense rbcS shows higher rates of photosynthesis only under elevated [CO2] conditions. However, such an improvement at the level of a single leaf does not necessarily lead to a higher production of plant biomass. Decrease in Rubisco content induces the operation of the cyclic electron flow around PS I, which enables to prevent photoinhibition as well as to downregulate the quantum yield of PS II. Thus, the photosynthetic processes are highly integrated and strictly regulated. It is considered that there is a limit to improvement which can be achieved only by alteration of Rubisco.

AB High-altitude and high-latitude sites are expected to be very sensitive to global warming, because the biological activity of most plants is restricted by the length of the short snowfree season, which is determined by climate. Long-term observational studies in subalpine meadows of the Colorado Rocky Mountains have shown a strong positive correlation between snowpack and flower production by the forb Delphinium nuttallianum. If a warmer climate reduces annual snowfall in this region then global warming might reduce fitness in D. nuttallianum. In this article we report effects of experimental warming on the abundance and flower production of D. nuttallianum. Plant abundance (both flowering and vegetative plants) was slightly greater on warmed than control plots prior to initiation of the warming treatment in 1991. Since 1994 experimental warming has had a negative effect on D. nuttallianum flower production, reducing both the abundance of flowering plants and the total number of flowers per plant. Flower bud abortion was higher in the heated plots than the controls only in 1994 and 1999. Results from both the warming experiment and analyses of unmanipulated long-term plots suggest that global warming may affect the fecundity of D. nuttallianum, which may have cascading effects on the pollinators that depend on it and on the fecundity of plants that share similar pollinators.

AB Mitochondrial DNA variation in 109 individuals from four populations of wild living gorillas in East Africa was ascertained by sequencing the first hypervariable segment of the control region, or 'D-loop'. amplified from noninvasively collected hair and faeces. D-loop haplotypes from eastern gorillas fell into two distinct clades, each with low levels of genetic diversity; most observed haplotypes within each clade differing by only one or two mutations. Both clades show evidence of population bottlenecks in the recent past, perhaps concomitant with the tropical forest reduction and fragmentation brought on by global cooling and drying associated with the last glacial maximum.

AB Hydrogenases, oxygen-sensitive enzymes that can make hydrogen gas, are key to the function of hydrogen-producing organelles (hydrogenosomes), which occur in anaerobic protozoa scattered throughout the eukaryotic tree. Hydrogenases also play a central role in the hydrogen and syntrophic hypotheses for eukaryogenesis. Here, we show that sequences related ro iron-only hydrogenases ([Fe] hydrogenases) are more widely distributed among eukaryotes than reports of hydrogen production have suggested. Genes encoding small proteins which contain conserved structural features unique to [Fe] hydrogenases were identified on all well-surveyed aerobic eukaryote genomes. Longer sequences encoding [Fe] hydrogenases also occur in the anaerobic eukaryotes Entamoeba histolytica and Spironucleus barkhanus, both of which lack hydrogenosomes. We also identified a new [Fe] hydrogenase sequence from Trichomonas vaginalis, bringing the total of [Fe] hydrogenases reported for this organism to three, all of which may function within its hydrogenosomes. Phylogenetic analysis and hypothesis testing using likelihood ratio tests and parametric bootstrapping suggest that the [Fe] hydrogenases in anaerobic eukaryotes are not monophyletic. Iron-only hydrogenases from Entamoeba, Spironucleus, and Trichomonas are plausibly monophyletic, consistent with the hypothesis that a gene for [Fe] hydrogenase was already present on the genome of the common, perhaps also anaerobic, ancestor of these phylogenetically distinct eukaryotes. Trees where the [Fe] hydrogenase from the hydrogenosomal ciliate Nyctotherus was constrained to be monophyletic with the other eukaryote sequences were rejected using a likelihood ratio test of monophyly. In most analyses, the Nyctotherus sequence formed a sister group with a [Fe] hydrogenase on the genome of the eubacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris. Thus, it is possible that Nyctotherus obtained its hydrogenosomal [Fe] hydrogenase from a different source from Trichomonas for its hydrogenosomes. We find no support for the hypothesis that components of the Nyctotherus [Fe] hydrogenase fusion protein derive from the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

AB The relationships among light-saturated photosynthesis and concentrations of nitrogen and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco, EC 4.1.1.39) in Australian native plants are poorly known, primarily due to the difficulty of extracting and analysing Rubisco from such species. Rubisco may be rapidly quantified in crude extracts of plant tissue by capillary electrophoresis (CE); however, the presence of phenolic compounds in many Australian native plants limits the use of these methods. The addition of insoluble polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) during leaf extractions effectively removed phenols permitting quantitation of Rubisco. Relationships among maximum rates of photosynthesis and concentrations of nitrogen and Rubisco were then investigated in ten species native to Australia. Total nitrogen and the major pools of N in foliage varied greatly between species. Equally, within species N-partitioning was highly plastic, as affected by different concentrations and forms of N applied in sand culture (0.5 or 8 mM, nitrate or ammonium). In Hakea prostrata, for example, the proportion of total N present as soluble proteins varied between 43 and 71%, while the proportion of total N present as Rubisco N ranged between 9.4 and 30.0%, and the contribution of Rubisco to soluble proteins varied between 21 and 42%. The measured concentration of Rubisco varied between 40% and 600% of that estimated from enzyme kinetics and measured rates of photosynthesis. Generally there was a large 'excess' of Rubisco, and in only two cases was the measured concentration of Rubisco significantly less than predicted. Total N, soluble protein and Rubisco concentrations were poorly related to maximum rates of photosynthesis, while the relationship between photosynthesis and Rubisco was worse than that with N, primarily due to the plants' variable over-investment in Rubisco.

AB We tested the hypothesis that plants adjust to nutrient availability by altering carbon allocation patterns and nutrient-use efficiency (NUE = net primary production NPP per unit nutrient uptake), but are constrained by a trade-off between NUE and light-use efficiency (epsilon = NPP per unit intercepted light). NPP, NUE and E were measured in montane Metrosideros polymorpha forest across a 4.1 x 10(6) yr space for time substitution chronosequence in which available soil N and P pools change with site age. Although the range of N and P availability across sites was broad, there was little difference in NPP between sites, and in contrast to theories of carbon allocation relative to limiting resources, we found no consistent relationships in production allocation to leaves, fine roots or wood. However, canopy nutrient pools and fluxes were correlated with the mass of fine roots per unit soil volume and there was a weak but positive correlation of NPP with LAI. Patterns of E and NUE across the soil developmental sequence were opposite to each other. E increased as nutrient availability and nutrient turnover increased, while NUE decreased in response to the same influences but reached its highest values where either N or P availability and turnover of both N and P were low. A negative correlation between E and NUE supports the hypothesis that a trade-off exists between E and leaf characteristics affecting NUE.

AB Nucleotide sequences from a 434-bp region of the 16S rRNA gene were analyzed for 65 taxa of Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps, parasitoid wasps, sawflies) to examine the patterns of variation within the gene fragment and the taxonomic levels for which it shows maximum utility in phylogeny estimation. A hierarchical approach was adopted in the study through comparison of levels of sequence variation among taxa at different taxonomic levels. As previously reported for many holometabolous insects, the 16S data reported here for Hymenoptera are highly AT-rich and exhibit strong site-to-site variation in substitution rate. More precise estimates of the shape parameter (alpha) Of the gamma distribution and the proportion of invariant sites were obtained in this study by employing a reference phylogeny and utilizing maximum-likelihood estimation. The effectiveness of this approach to recovering expected phylogenies of selected hymenopteran taxa has been tested against the use of maximum parsimony. This study finds that the 16S gene is most informative for phylogenetic analysis at two different levels: among closely related species or populations, and among tribes, subfamilies, and families. Maximization of the phylogenetic signal extracted from the 16S gene at higher taxonomic levels may require consideration of the: base composition bias and the site-to-site rate variation in a maximum-likelihood framework.

AB The utility of a nuclear protein-coding gene for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships within the family Culicidae was explored. Relationships among 13 species representing three subfamilies and nine genera of Culicidae were analyzed using a 762-bp fragment of coding sequence from the eye color gene, white. Outgroups for the study were two species from the sister group Chaoboridae. Sequences were determined from cloned PCR products amplified from genomic DNA, and aligned following conceptual intron splicing and amino acid translation. Third codon positions were characterized by high levels of divergence and biased nucleotide composition, the intensity and direction of which varied among taxa. Equal weighting of all characters resulted in parsimony and neighbor-joining trees at odds with the generally accepted phylogenetic hypothesis based on morphology and rDNA sequences. The application of differential weighting schemes recovered the traditional hypothesis, in which the subfamily Anophelinae formed the basal clade. The subfamily Toxorhynchitinae occupied an intermediate position, and was a sister group to the subfamily Culicinae. Within Culicinae, the genera Sabethes and Tripteroides formed an ancestral clade, while the Culex-Deinocerites and Aedes-Haemagogus clades occupied increasingly derived positions in the molecular phylogeny. An intron present in the Culicinae-Toxorhynchitinae lineage and one outgroup taxon was absent in the basal Anophelinae lineage and the second outgroup taxon, suggesting that intron insertions or deletions may not always be reliable systematic characters.

AB Availability of soil nitrogen, soil moisture, and light were examined, along with the growth, biomass allocation, and leaf nitrogen concentration of naturally established Acer saccharum Marsh. seedlings, in the understories of 12 forest sites in northern Wisconsin. The sites represented a nutrient and moisture gradient (poor to rich) according to a habitat classification system. We asked (1) Are seedling growth rates, biomass allocation patterns, and leaf nitrogen related to soil water and nitrogen availability? and (2) Do soil resource rankings predicted by habitat classifications mirror our direct observations? Across sites compared in a low-light data set (plots with <5% canopy openness), rich sites had 2- to 4-fold higher seedling growth, percent leaf nitrogen, nitrogen mineralization rates, and nitrification rates than poor sites. Seedling growth in low light correlated (P less than or equal to 0.05) positively with nitrification, total nitrogen mineralization, percent leaf nitrogen, soil moisture, and organic carbon, and negatively with fine root density. In multiple regression, soil moisture (P = 0.033) and nitrification (P = 0.015) together explained 79% of the variation in growth. Thus, seedling growth in shade was enhanced on richer sites in part because of higher nitrate N and water availability. This has potential implications for forest dynamics, since the probability of sugar maple becoming the dominant woody regeneration in any given understory may be partially dependent upon the level of soil resources.

AB This paper describes experiments carried out to investigate the causes of high leaf nitrogen concentrations and high delta(13)C values in Alchemilla alpina L. growing at high altitudes. We investigated whether genetic adaptation, high levels of nitrogen input or low temperatures could account for these trends. In a field experiment, plants from two altitudes in the Scottish Highlands were transplanted to Great Dun Fell, a site in the Pennines of northern England. The experimental design was fully factorial: two altitudinal origins x two altitudes of growth x two nitrogen levels. A second experiment used a controlled environment to test the effects of temperature alone.
   The effects of altitude in the field transplant experiment were very similar to those in naturally growing plants. Leaf nitrogen concentration and delta(13)C were both higher at the high altitude, whilst growth declined and nitrogen per leaf was unaffected. An increase in potassium concentration with altitude was also found. Nitrogen addition caused increased leaf nitrogen concentrations but also increased nitrogen per leaf; delta(13)C was not affected and potassium and phosphorus concentrations decreased. The addition of nitrogen also increased mortality. Altitude of origin had relatively few effects but the population from the higher altitude did have a higher specific leaf area. Low temperature in the controlled environment caused increased delta(13)C, decreased leaf size and increased nitrogen and carbon contents, although the effect was less clear than the effects of altitude in the field. Gas exchange measurements suggested that the delta(13)C effect was caused by a reduction in stomatal conductance.
   We conclude that the effects of altitude on this species are principally the result of direct environmental modifications to growth rather than genetic adaptation. Of the various factors that change with altitude, temperature and a short growing season are particularly important; enhanced nitrogen supply through atmospheric deposition promotes increasing leaf nitrogen concentrations but must be considered in conjunction with other variables.

AB Interaction coefficients between species have been estimated using both static regression models (from a single census) and dynamic regression models (incorporating population change through time). However, the output of these varied models has not been compared with the results of experimental manipulations within the same system. Using a guild of tidepool sculpins, I tested whether the competition coefficients obtained from static and dynamic regression models were consistent with the results of experimental manipulations. Field manipulations revealed a competitive effect of Oligocottus maculosus on Clinocottus globiceps growth and no effect of C. globiceps on O. maculosus growth. The result of dynamic regression models most closely matched the results of the experiments. Static regression models, in contrast, were less consistent with experimental results, sometimes even predicting interactions with a different sign from those in experiments. I show that the inconsistency in the static regression models may result from the way covariance in carrying capacities directly affects variability in equilibrium population sizes, yielding an erroneous interaction coefficient. The dynamic regression models are free of equilibria assumptions and more accurately predicted a competitive effect of O. maculosus on C. globiceps but no effect of C. globiceps on O. maculosus. These analyses illustrate why dynamically derived measures of interaction strength, rather than static ones, may better predict effects of one species on another.

AB Distribution of foliar carbon and nitrogen was studied across a vertical light gradient in the natural canopy of Fagus sylvatica. Leaf dry and fresh weight per area (LWA and LWA(w), respectively) increased linearly with diffuse site factor (a(d), relative irradiance). Tree size, independent of a(d), was another determinant of leaf morphology, and both LWA and LWA(w) increased with increasing tree dimensions. A positive linear relationship between a(d) and the content of total non-structural carbohydrates per leaf dry weight (TNC, the um of ethanol-soluble carbohydrates and starch) was found, presumably caused by higher photosynthetic production of leaves at greater irradiance. Therefore, to account for confounding variation in TNC with irradiance, it may be necessary in studies on light-related modifications in leaf structure to express the content of leaf constituents on che basis of TNC-free dry weight instead of total dry weight. Total leaf carbon content per dry weight and a(d) were not correlated, however, leaf carbon content, corrected fur changes in TNC with a(d), increased significantly with relative light availability, suggesting increasing investment of leaf carbon for mechanical support. Leaf water content decreased with a(d), probably due to a less favourable water balance of leaves at higher canopy heights.
   Leaf nitrogen content per dry weight (N-m) decreased with increasing irradiance. If nitrogen content was expressed on the basis of TNC-free dry weight, the relationship became more scattered, though the qualitative tendency remained. No correlation between leaf nitrogen and TNC, considered as an estimate of daily photosynthetic production, was found, and it was suggested that increasing N-m at decreasing values of a(d) was invested for more efficient light harvesting, representing a strategy of nitrogen partitioning inherent to shade-tolerant plants. Because a considerable fraction of leaf magnesium is contained in chlorophyll, decreasing leaf magnesium content, expressed both on total and TNC-free dry weight, with increasing a(d), and a linear relationship between the contents of leaf nitrogen and magnesium, provide additional evidence for the partitioning of foliar nitrogen towards enhanced light capture with decreasing irradiance.

AB Field and laboratory investigations into the effect of the parasitic isopod Anilocra pomacentri (Cymothoidae) on the population dynamics of the reef fish Chromis nitida (Pomacentridae) were carried out at Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Fish carried a single adult parasite just posterior and dorsal to the eye either to the right or to the left of the midline. The adult parasite was overdispersed among fish on patch reefs (dispersion factor, k = 0.69). Sequential field observations on a single cohort of fish showed that parasites significantly depressed growth, reproduction, and survivorship. The von Bertalanffy growth coefficients (a measure of somatic growth) were 0.10 for parasitized fish compared with 0.17 for non-parasitized fish. Female fish carrying the parasite produced only 12% of the number of eggs produced by non-parasitized fish of the same size. In the field, the mortality of infected juvenile C. nitida (LCF 15-30 mm) was estimated to be at least 88% in the first 70 days after recruitment of the fish. The mortality of uninfected recruits over the same period was 66%. In laboratory trials, the mortality associated with the infection of juvenile fish by larval parasites ranged from 78% for small fish (mean LCF 15.0 mm) to 28% for larger fish (mean LCF 24.9 mm) within 4 days of experimental infection. This is one of the few studies that evaluates the effect of a parasite on a population of fish in the field.

AB Photosynthetic plasticity of two congeneric shrub species growing under natural field conditions was compared along transects spanning two canopy gaps in a Costa Rican rain forest. Piper arieianum is a shade-tolerant species common in successional and mature forests, whereas P. sancti-felicis is a pioneer species abundant in abandoned clearings and large gaps. Twenty potted cuttings of each species were placed at regular intervals along two east-west transects crossing a small branch-fall gap and a large tree-fall gap. Along the transects, the percent of full sun photon flux density varied from less than 2% to 45%. After six months of growth under these conditions, leaves were monitored for incident photon flux density, photographic measures of light availability, photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), leaf nitrogen content, leaf chlorophyll content, and specific leaf mass. Although both species demonstrated considerable plasticity in A(max) across gap transects, P. sancti-felicis leaves had a superior capacity to track closely variation in light availability, particularly in the larger gap. For regressions of A(max) on measures of light availability, P. sancti-felicis consistently showed a 3.5 to 5-fold higher coefficient of determination (R2) and a 3 to 4-fold higher slope than P. arieianum. In both species leaf nitrogen content per leaf area increased significantly with light availability, although P. sancti-felicis, again, showed a much stronger relationship between these variables. Across the transects, mean chlorophyll content per unit leaf area did not differ significantly between the species, whereas mean chlorophyll content per unit leaf dry mass was 3-times greater in leaves of P. sancti-felicis. Piper arieianum exhibited highly significant increases in chlorophyll a:b ratio with increased light availability, whereas P. sancti-felicis lacked significant variation in this trait across a gradient of light availability. Mean specific leaf mass did not vary significantly between species across the gap transects. The nature of the light acclimatory response differs quantitatively and qualitatively between these species. An important constraint on light acclimation of the shade-tolerant P. arieianum is its inability to increase photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency under conditions of high light availability. The lack of plasticity in chlorophyll a:b ratios does not restrict light acclimation of A. in P. sancti-felicis. Leaves of P. arieianum exhibited symptoms of chronic photoinhibition in exposed microsites within the large gap. Species differences in the capacity to finely adjust A. across a wide range of light conditions may be attributed to their maximum growth potential. Light acclimation in species with low maximum growth potential may be constrained at the cellular level by rates of protein and chlorophyll synthesis and at the whole-plant level by low maximum rates of uptake and supply of nutrients and water. For P. arieianum, restriction of photosynthetic plasticity is likely to limit competitive abilities of plants in high-light conditions of large gaps and clearings, whereas observed habitat restrictions for P. sancti-felicis do not appear to depend upon the highly-developed capacity for adjustment of A(max) observed in this species.

AB In a long-term field experiment millet straw application (+CR) increased soil pH and base saturation and strongly improved pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) growth on acid sandy soils. Aluminum (Al) toxicity may be responsible for poor millet growth in plots without crop residues (-CR). Laboratory experiments were conducted to verify this assumption. The concentrations of labile Al (8-hydroxyquinoline, 15 sec) in equilibrium soil solutions of top soil samples from field plots were 14.0 and 0.6-mu-M in unfertilized samples of -CR and +CR soil, respectively. The corresponding values for labile Al in fertilized (NPK) samples were 51.8 and 11.0-mu-M, respectively. A short-term (14 days) incubation of -CR soil with ground millet straw (0.1% w/w) increased soil solution pH and decreased total and labile Al in the soil solution by more than 44%. In a water-culture experiment with increasing concentrations of Al (0-60-mu-M) pearl millet proved to be very Al-tolerant compared to cowpea, peanut and soybean. A short-term (12 days) pot experiment with the incubated soil showed that root growth of pearl millet is not restricted by Al toxicity in the acid soils from Niger, but that after millet straw incubation root growth is considerably enhanced. Phosphorus (P) concentration in the soil solution was about three times higher in +CR (1.75-mu-M) than in -CR (0.52-mu-M) top soil. Since P is the most growth-limiting nutrient in those soils, the beneficial effect of crop residues on pearl millet is likely due to improvement of P nutrition by both increase in P mobility in the soil and enhancement of root growth.

AB Since their emergence onto land, terrestrial plants have developed diverse strategies to acquire soil resources. However, we lack a framework that adequately captures how these strategies vary among species. Observations from around the world now allow us to quantify the variation observed in commonly-measured fine-root traits but it is unclear how root traits are interrelated and whether they fall along an "economic" spectrum of acquisitive to conservative strategies. We assessed root trait variation and mycorrhizal colonization rates by leveraging the largest global database of fine-root traits (the Fine-Root Ecology Database; FRED). We also developed a heuristic model to explore the role of mycorrhizal fungi in defining belowground exploration efficiency across a gradient of thin- to thick-diameter roots. In support of the expectations of the "root economic spectrum," we found that root diameter was negatively related to specific root length (Pearson's r=-0.76). However, we found an unexpected negative relationship between root diameter and root tissue density (Pearson's r = -0.40), and we further observed that root nitrogen content was largely unrelated to other economic traits. Mycorrhizal colonization was most closely associated with root diameter (Pearson's r = 0.62) and was unrelated to root tissue density and root nitrogen. The heuristic model demonstrated that while thinner roots have inherently greater capacity to encounter soil resources based on higher surface area per unit mass, the potential for increased associations with mycorrhizal fungi in thicker roots, combined with greater hyphal growth, can result in equally acquisitive strategies for both thin- and thick roots. Taken together, our assessments of root trait variation, trade-offs with mycorrhizal fungi, and broader connections to root longevity allowed us to propose a series of fundamental constraints on belowground resource acquisition strategies. Physical tradeoffs based on root construction (i.e., economic traits) and functional limitations related to the capacity of a root to encounter and acquire soil resources combine to limit the two-dimensional belowground trait space. Within this trait space there remains a diversity of additional variation in root traits that facilitates a wide range of belowground resource acquisition strategies.

AB In January 2017, hundreds of fires in Mediterranean Chile burnt more than 5000km(2), an area nearly 14 times the 40-year mean. We contextualize these fires in terms of estimates of global fire intensity using MODIS satellite record, and provide an overview of the climatic factors and recent changes in land use that led to the active fire season and estimate the impact of fire emissions to human health. The primary fire activity in late January coincided with extreme fire weather conditions including all-time (1979-2017) daily records for the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and maximum temperature, producing some of the most energetically intense fire events on Earth in the last 15-years. Fire activity was further enabled by a warm moist growing season in 2016 that interrupted an intense drought that started in 2010. The land cover in this region had been extensively modified, with less than 20% of the original native vegetation remaining, and extensive plantations of highly flammable exotic Pinus and Eucalyptus species established since the 1970s. These plantations were disproportionally burnt (44% of the burned area) in 2017, and associated with the highest fire severities, as part of an increasing trend of fire extent in plantations over the past three decades. Smoke from the fires exposed over 9.5 million people to increased concentrations of particulate air pollution, causing an estimated 76 premature deaths and 209 additional admissions to hospital for respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. This study highlights that Mediterranean biogeographic regions with expansive Pinus and Eucalyptus plantations and associated rural depopulation are vulnerable to intense wildfires with wide ranging social, economic, and environmental impacts, which are likely to become more frequent due to longer and more extreme wildfire seasons.

AB Long-term variations in fire weather conditions are examined throughout Australia from gridded daily data from 1950 to 2016. The McArthur forest fire danger index is used to represent fire weather conditions throughout this 67-yr period, calculated on the basis of a gridded analysis of observations over this time period. This is a complementary approach to previous studies (e.g., those based primarily on model output, reanalysis, or individual station locations), providing a spatially continuous and long-term observations-based dataset to expand on previous research and produce climatological guidance information for planning agencies. Long-term changes in fire weather conditions are apparent in many regions. In particular, there is a clear trend toward more dangerous conditions during spring and summer in southern Australia, including increased frequency and magnitude of extremes, as well as indicating an earlier start to the fire season. Changes in fire weather conditions are attributable at least in part to anthropogenic climate change, including in relation to increasing temperatures. The influence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on fire weather conditions is found to be broadly consistent with previous studies (indicating more severe fire weather in general for El Nino conditions than for La Nina conditions), but it is demonstrated that this relationship is highly variable (depending on season and region) and that there is considerable potential in almost all regions of Australia for long-range prediction of fire weather (e.g., multiweek and seasonal forecasting). It is intended that improved understanding of the climatological variability of fire weather conditions will help lead to better preparedness for risks associated with dangerous wildfires in Australia.

AB The grey wolf (Canis lupus) is an iconic large carnivore that has increasingly been recognized as an apex predator with intrinsic value and a keystone species. However, wolves have also long represented a primary source of human-carnivore conflict, which has led to long-term persecution of wolves, resulting in a significant decrease in their numbers, genetic diversity and gene flow between populations. For more effective protection and management of wolf populations in Europe, robust scientific evidence is crucial. This review serves as an analytical summary of the main findings from wolf population genetic studies in Europe, covering major studies from the 'pre-genomic era' and the first insights of the 'genomics era'. We analyse, summarize and discuss findings derived from analyses of three compartments of the mammalian genome with different inheritance modes: maternal (mitochondrial DNA), paternal (Y chromosome) and biparental [autosomal microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)]. To describe large-scale trends and patterns of genetic variation in European wolf populations, we conducted a meta-analysis based on the results of previous microsatellite studies and also included new data, covering all 19 European countries for which wolf genetic information is available: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Belarus, Russia, Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Spain and Portugal. We compared different indices of genetic diversity in wolf populations and found a significant spatial trend in heterozygosity across Europe from south-west (lowest genetic diversity) to north-east (highest). The range of spatial autocorrelation calculated on the basis of three characteristics of genetic diversity was 650-850 km, suggesting that the genetic diversity of a given wolf population can be influenced by populations up to 850 km away. As an important outcome of this synthesis, we discuss the most pressing issues threatening wolf populations in Europe, highlight important gaps in current knowledge, suggest solutions to overcome these limitations, and provide recommendations for science-based wolf conservation and management at regional and Europe-wide scales.

AB Fitness results from an optimal balance between survival, mating success and fecundity. The interactions between these three components of fitness vary depending on the selective context, from positive covariation between them, to antagonistic pleiotropic relationships when fitness increases in one reduce the fitness of others. Therefore, elucidating the routes through which selection shapes life history and phenotypic adaptations via these fitness components is of primary significance to understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics. However, while the fitness components mediated by natural (survival) and sexual (mating success) selection have been debated extensively from most possible perspectives, fecundity selection remains considerably less studied. Here, we review the theoretical basis, evidence and implications of fecundity selection as a driver of sex-specific adaptive evolution. Based on accumulating literature on the life-history, phenotypic and ecological aspects of fecundity, we (i) suggest a re-arrangement of the concepts of fecundity, whereby we coin the term 'transient fecundity' to refer to brood size per reproductive episode, while 'annual' and 'lifetime fecundity' should not be used interchangeably with 'transient fecundity' as they represent different life-history parameters; (ii) provide a generalized re-definition of the concept of fecundity selection as a mechanism that encompasses any traits that influence fecundity in any direction (from high to low) and in either sex; (iii) review the (macro) ecological basis of fecundity selection (e.g. ecological pressures that influence predictable spatial variation in fecundity); (iv) suggest that most ecological theories of fecundity selection should be tested in organisms other than birds; (v) argue that the longstanding fecundity selection hypothesis of female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD) has gained inconsistent support, that strong fecundity selection does not necessarily drive female-biased SSD, and that this form of SSD can be driven by other selective pressures; and (vi) discuss cases in which fecundity selection operates on males. This conceptual analysis of the theory of fecundity selection promises to help illuminate one of the central components of fitness and its contribution to adaptive evolution.

AB Multiple niche-based processes including conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) determine plant regeneration and community structure. We ask how interspecific and intraspecific density-dependent interactions relate to plant life histories and associated functional traits. Using hierarchical models, we analysed how such interactions affected first-year survival of seedling recruits of 175 species in a tropical forest, and how species abundances and functional traits are related to interspecific variation in density-dependent effects. Conspecific seedling neighbour effects prevailed over the effects of larger conspecific and all heterospecific neighbours. Tolerance of seedling CNDD enhanced recruit survival and subsequent abundance, all of which were greater among larger seeded, slow-growing and well-defended species. Niche differentiation along the growth-survival trade-off and tolerance of seedling CNDD strongly correlated with regeneration success, with manifest consequences for community structure. The ability of larger seeded species to better tolerate CNDD suggests a novel mechanism for CNDD to contribute to seed-size variation and promote species coexistence through a tolerance-fecundity trade-off.

AB Predicting the dynamics of community composition and functional attributes responding to environmental changes is an essential goal in community ecology but remains a major challenge, particularly in microbial ecology. Here, by targeting a model system with low species richness, we explore the spatial distribution of taxonomic and functional structure of 40 acid mine drainage (AMD) microbial communities across Southeast China profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA pyrosequencing and a comprehensive microarray (GeoChip). Similar environmentally dependent patterns of dominant microbial lineages and key functional genes were observed regardless of the large-scale geographical isolation. Functional and phylogenetic beta-diversities were significantly correlated, whereas functional metabolic potentials were strongly influenced by environmental conditions and community taxonomic structure. Using advanced modeling approaches based on artificial neural networks, we successfully predicted the taxonomic and functional dynamics with significantly higher prediction accuracies of metabolic potentials (average Bray-Curtis similarity 87.8) as compared with relative microbial abundances (similarity 66.8), implying that natural AMD microbial assemblages may be better predicted at the functional genes level rather than at taxonomic level. Furthermore, relative metabolic potentials of genes involved in many key ecological functions (for example, nitrogen and phosphate utilization, metals resistance and stress response) were extrapolated to increase under more acidic and metal-rich conditions, indicating a critical strategy of stress adaptation in these extraordinary communities. Collectively, our findings indicate that natural selection rather than geographic distance has a more crucial role in shaping the taxonomic and functional patterns of AMD microbial community that readily predicted by modeling methods and suggest that the model-based approach is essential to better understand natural acidophilic microbial communities.

AB Mountain ecosystems have been less adversely affected by invasions of non-native plants than most other ecosystems, partially because most invasive plants in the lowlands are limited by climate and cannot grow under harsher high-elevation conditions. However, with ongoing climate change, invasive species may rapidly move upwards and threaten mid-, and then high-elevation mountain ecosystems. We evaluated this threat by modeling the current and future habitat suitability for 48 invasive plant species in Switzerland and New South Wales, Australia. Both regions had contrasting climate interactions with elevation, resulting in possible different responses of species distributions to climate change. Using a species distribution modeling approach that combines data from two spatial scales, we built high-resolution species distribution models (<= 250 m) that account for the global climatic niche of species and also finer variables depicting local climate and disturbances. We found that different environmental drivers limit the elevation range of invasive species in each of the two regions, leading to region-specific species responses to climate change. The optimal suitability for plant invaders is predicted to markedly shift from the lowland to the montane or subalpine zone in Switzerland, whereas the upward shift is far less pronounced in New South Wales where montane and subalpine elevations are already suitable. The results suggest that species most likely to invade high elevations in Switzerland will be cold-tolerant, whereas species with an affinity to moist soils are most likely to invade higher elevations in Australia. Other plant traits were only marginally associated with elevation limits. These results demonstrate that a more systematic consideration of future distributions of invasive species is required in conservation plans of not yet invaded mountainous ecosystems.

AB Photosynthetic capacity, determined by light harvesting and carboxylation reactions, is a key plant trait that determines the rate of photosynthesis; however, in Earth System Models (ESMs) at a reference temperature, it is either a fixed value for a given plant functional type or derived from a linear function of leaf nitrogen content. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis that considered correlations of environmental factors with photosynthetic capacity as determined by maximum carboxylation (V-c,V-m) rate scaled to 25 degrees C (i.e., V-c,V-25; mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1)) and maximum electron transport rate (Jmax) scaled to 25 degrees C (i.e., J(25); mu mol electron m(-2).s(-1)) at the global scale. Our results showed that the percentage of variation in observed Vc,25 and J25 explained jointly by the environmental factors (i.e., day length, radiation, temperature, and humidity) were 2-2.5 times and 6-9 times of that explained by area-based leaf nitrogen content, respectively. Environmental factors influenced photosynthetic capacity mainly through photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, rather than through leaf nitrogen content. The combination of leaf nitrogen content and environmental factors was able to explain similar to 56% and similar to 66% of the variation in V-c,V-25 and J(25) at the global scale, respectively. Our analyses suggest that model projections of plant photosynthetic capacity and hence land atmosphere exchange under changing climatic conditions could be substantially improved if environmental factors are incorporated into algorithms used to parameterize photosynthetic capacity in ESMs.

AB Construction of hydroelectric dams affect river ecosystems, fish diversity, and fisheries yields. However, there are no studies assessing the combined effects on fish caused by several adjacent dams and their reservoirs, as in a 'dam cascade'. This study predicts the potential effects that a cascade of ten dams currently under construction in the upper Yangtze River in China will have on local fishes, and uses such predictions to assess the effectiveness of possible fish conservation measures. We found that the dam cascade will have serious combined effects on fishes mainly due to impoundment, habitat fragmentation and blocking, flow regime modification, and hypolimnetic discharges. The impoundments will cause loss of critical habitats for 46 endemic species. The dams will fragment the populations of 134 species and will block migration routes for 35 potamodromous fishes. Corieus guichenoti will have a high risk of extinction due to the combined effects of impoundment and blocking. Modification of the flow regime will adversely affect the recruitment of 26 species that produce drifting eggs. The start of annual spawning for 13 fishes will be postponed by more than 1 month, and fish spawning and growth opportunities will be reduced due to low water temperatures associated with hypolimnetic discharges. Combined dam effects will further reduce the likelihood of successful recruitment of some endangered species, such as Acipenser dabryanus and Psephurus gladius. Three countermeasures hold promise to mitigate the near-term effects of the dam cascade, including preservation and rehabilitation of critical habitat, restoration of a semi-natural flow regime, and stock enhancement that respects genetic integrity. These conclusions can guide the development of protection plans for fishes in the upper Yangtze River. The approach undertaken in this study-by which the known and likely effects of present and future dams were simultaneously considered in light of the biology of the species-highlights the usefulness of ichthyology for fish conservation.

AB Background: Model selection is a vital part of most phylogenetic analyses, and accounting for the heterogeneity in evolutionary patterns across sites is particularly important. Mixture models and partitioning are commonly used to account for this variation, and partitioning is the most popular approach. Most current partitioning methods require some a priori partitioning scheme to be defined, typically guided by known structural features of the sequences, such as gene boundaries or codon positions. Recent evidence suggests that these a priori boundaries often fail to adequately account for variation in rates and patterns of evolution among sites. Furthermore, new phylogenomic datasets such as those assembled from ultra-conserved elements lack obvious structural features on which to define a priori partitioning schemes. The upshot is that, for many phylogenetic datasets, partitioned models of molecular evolution may be inadequate, thus limiting the accuracy of downstream phylogenetic analyses.
   Results: We present a new algorithm that automatically selects a partitioning scheme via the iterative division of the alignment into subsets of similar sites based on their rates of evolution. We compare this method to existing approaches using a wide range of empirical datasets, and show that it consistently leads to large increases in the fit of partitioned models of molecular evolution when measured using AICc and BIC scores. In doing so, we demonstrate that some related approaches to solving this problem may have been associated with a small but important bias.
   Conclusions: Our method provides an alternative to traditional approaches to partitioning, such as dividing alignments by gene and codon position. Because our method is data-driven, it can be used to estimate partitioned models for all types of alignments, including those that are not amenable to traditional approaches to partitioning.

AB Genetic biodiversity contributes to individual fitness, species' evolutionary potential, and ecosystem stability. Temporal monitoring of the genetic status and trends of wild populations' genetic diversity can provide vital data to inform policy decisions and management actions. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding which genetic metrics, temporal sampling protocols, and genetic markers are sufficiently sensitive and robust, on conservation-relevant timescales. Here, we tested six genetic metrics and various sampling protocols (number and arrangement of temporal samples) for monitoring genetic erosion following demographic decline. To do so, we utilized individual-based simulations featuring an array of different initial population sizes, types and severity of demographic decline, and DNA markers [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites] as well as decline followed by recovery. Number of alleles markedly outperformed other indicators across all situations. The type and severity of demographic decline strongly affected power, while the number and arrangement of temporal samples had small effect. Sampling 50 individuals at as few as two time points with 20 microsatellites performed well (good power), and could detect genetic erosion while 80-90% of diversity remained. This sampling and genotyping effort should often be affordable. Power increased substantially with more samples or markers, and we observe that power of 2500 SNPs was nearly equivalent to 250 microsatellites, a result of theoretical and practical interest. Our results suggest high potential for using historic collections in monitoring programs, and demonstrate the need to monitor genetic as well as other levels of biodiversity.

AB Shifts in precipitation regimes are an inherent component of climate change, but in low-energy systems are often assumed to be less important than changes in temperature. Because soil moisture is the hydrological variable most proximally linked to plant performance during the growing season in arctic-alpine habitats, it may offer the most useful perspective on the influence of changes in precipitation on vegetation. Here we quantify the influence of soil moisture for multiple vegetation properties at fine spatial scales, to determine the potential importance of soil moisture under changing climatic conditions. A fine-scale data set, comprising vascular species cover and field-quantified ecologically relevant environmental parameters, was analysed to determine the influence of soil moisture relative to other key abiotic predictors. Soil moisture was strongly related to community composition, species richness and the occurrence patterns of individual species, having a similar or greater influence than soil temperature, pH and solar radiation. Soil moisture varied considerably over short distances, and this fine-scale heterogeneity may contribute to offsetting the ecological impacts of changes in precipitation for species not limited to extreme soil moisture conditions. In conclusion, soil moisture is a key driver of vegetation properties, both at the species and community level, even in this low-energy system. Soil moisture conditions represent an important mechanism through which changing climatic conditions impact vegetation, and advancing our predictive capability will therefore require a better understanding of how soil moisture mediates the effects of climate change on biota.

AB Salmonids rank among the most socioeconomically valuable fishes and the most targeted species by stocking with hatchery-reared individuals. Here, we used molecular parentage analysis to assess the reproductive success of wild- and hatchery-born Atlantic salmon over three consecutive years in a small river in Quebec. Yearly restocking in this river follows a single generation of captive breeding. Among the adults returning to the river to spawn, between 11% and 41% each year were born in hatchery. Their relative reproductive success (RRS) was nearly half that of wild-born fish (0.55). RRS varied with life stage, being 0.71 for fish released at the fry stage and 0.42 for fish released as smolt. The lower reproductive success of salmon released as smolt was partly mediated by the modification of the proportion of single-sea-winter/multi-sea-winter fish. Overall, our results suggest that modifications in survival and growth rates alter the life-history strategies of these fish at the cost of their reproductive success. Our results underline the potential fitness decrease, warn on long-term evolutionary consequences for the population of repeated stocking and support the adoption of more natural rearing conditions for captive juveniles and their release at a younger stage, such as unfed fry.

AB Understanding how landscape heterogeneity constrains gene flow and the spread of adaptive genetic variation is important for biological conservation given current global change. However, the integration of population genetics, landscape ecology and spatial statistics remains an interdisciplinary challenge at the levels of concepts and methods. We present a conceptual framework to relate the spatial distribution of genetic variation to the processes of gene flow and adaptation as regulated by spatial heterogeneity of the environment, while explicitly considering the spatial and temporal dynamics of landscapes, organisms and their genes. When selecting the appropriate analytical methods, it is necessary to consider the effects of multiple processes and the nature of population genetic data. Our framework relates key landscape genetics questions to four levels of analysis: (i) node-based methods, which model the spatial distribution of alleles at sampling locations (nodes) from local site characteristics; these methods are suitable for modeling adaptive genetic variation while accounting for the presence of spatial autocorrelation. (ii) Link-based methods, which model the probability of gene flow between two patches (link) and relate neutral molecular marker data to landscape heterogeneity; these methods are suitable for modeling neutral genetic variation but are subject to inferential problems, which may be alleviated by reducing links based on a network model of the population. (iii) Neighborhood-based methods, which model the connectivity of a focal patch with all other patches in its local neighborhood; these methods provide a link to metapopulation theory and landscape connectivity modeling and may allow the integration of node- and link-based information, but applications in landscape genetics are still limited. (iv) Boundary-based methods, which delineate genetically homogeneous populations and infer the location of genetic boundaries; these methods are suitable for testing for barrier effects of landscape features in a hypothesis-testing framework. We conclude that the power to detect the effect of landscape heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of genetic variation can be increased by explicit consideration of underlying assumptions and choice of an appropriate analytical approach depending on the research question.

AB Species distribution modeling (SDM) is an important tool to assess the impact of global environmental change. Many species exhibit ecologically relevant intraspecific variation, and few studies have analyzed its relevance for SDM. Here, we compared three SDM techniques for the highly variable species Pinus contorta. First, applying a conventional SDM approach, we used MaxEnt to model the subject as a single species (species model), based on presenceabsence observations. Second, we used MaxEnt to model each of the three most prevalent subspecies independently and combined their projected distributions (subspecies model). Finally, we used a universal growth transfer function (UTF), an approach to incorporate intraspecific variation utilizing provenance trial tree growth data. Different model approaches performed similarly when predicting current distributions. MaxEnt model discrimination was greater (AUC species model: 0.94, subspecies model: 0.95, UTF: 0.89), but the UTF was better calibrated (slope and bias species model: 1.31 and 0.58, subspecies model: 1.44 and 0.43, UTF: 1.01 and 0.04, respectively). Contrastingly, for future climatic conditions, projections of lodgepole pine habitat suitability diverged. In particular, when the species' intraspecific variability was acknowledged, the species was projected to better tolerate climatic change as related to suitable habitat without migration (subspecies model: 26% habitat loss or UTF: 24% habitat loss vs. species model: 60% habitat loss), and given unlimited migration may increase amount of suitable habitat (subspecies model: 8% habitat gain or UTF: 12% habitat gain vs. species model: 51% habitat loss) in the climatic period 20702100 (SRES A2 scenario, HADCM3). We conclude that models derived from within-species data produce different and better projections, and coincide with ecological theory. Furthermore, we conclude that intraspecific variation may buffer against adverse effects of climate change. A key future research challenge lies in assessing the extent to which species can utilize intraspecific variation under rapid environmental change.

AB Sea ice conditions in the Antarctic affect the life cycle of the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri). We present a population projection for the emperor penguin population of Terre Adelie, Antarctica, by linking demographic models (stage-structured, seasonal, nonlinear, two-sex matrix population models) to sea ice forecasts from an ensemble of IPCC climate models. Based on maximum likelihood capture-mark-recapture analysis, we find that seasonal sea ice concentration anomalies (SICa) affect adult survival and breeding success. Demographic models show that both deterministic and stochastic population growth rates are maximized at intermediate values of annual SICa, because neither the complete absence of sea ice, nor heavy and persistent sea ice, would provide satisfactory conditions for the emperor penguin. We show that under some conditions the stochastic growth rate is positively affected by the variance in SICa. We identify an ensemble of five general circulation climate models whose output closely matches the historical record of sea ice concentration in Terre Adelie. The output of this ensemble is used to produce stochastic forecasts of SICa, which in turn drive the population model. Uncertainty is included by incorporating multiple climate models and by a parametric bootstrap procedure that includes parameter uncertainty due to both model selection and estimation error. The median of these simulations predicts a decline of the Terre Adelie emperor penguin population of 81% by the year 2100. We find a 43% chance of an even greater decline, of 90% or more. The uncertainty in population projections reflects large differences among climate models in their forecasts of future sea ice conditions. One such model predicts population increases over much of the century, but overall, the ensemble of models predicts that population declines are far more likely than population increases. We conclude that climate change is a significant risk for the emperor penguin. Our analytical approach, in which demographic models are linked to IPCC climate models, is powerful and generally applicable to other species and systems.

AB In response to climate change and other threatening processes there is renewed interest in the role of refugia and refuges. In bioregions that experience drought and fire, micro-refuges can play a vital role in ensuring the persistence of species. We develop and apply an approach to identifying potential micro-refuges based on a time series of remotely sensed vegetation greenness (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the sunlit canopy; fPAR). The primary data for this analysis were NASA MODIS 16-day L3 Global 250 m (MOD13Q1) satellite imagery. This method draws upon relevant ecological theory (source sink habitats, habitat templet) to calculate a micro-refuge index, which is analyzed for each of the major vegetation ecosystems in the case-study region (the Great Eastern Ranges of New South Wales, Australia). Potential ecosystem greenspots were identified, at a range of thresholds, based on an index derived from: the mean and coefficient of variance (COV) of fPAR over the 10-year time series; the minimum mean annual (PAR; and the COV of the 12 values of mean monthly fPAR. These greenspots were mapped and compared with (1) an index of vascular plant species composition, (2) environmental variables, and (3) protected areas. Potential micro-refuges were found within all vegetation ecosystem types. The total area of ecosystem greenspots within the upper 25% threshold was 48 406 ha; around 0.2% of the total area of native vegetation (23.9 x 10(6) ha) in the study region. The total area affected by fire was 3.4 x 10(6) ha. The results of the environmental diagnostic analysis suggest deterministic controls on the geographical distribution of potential micro-refuges that may continue to function under climate change. The approach is relevant to other regions of the world where the role of micro-refuges in the persistence of species is recognized, including across the world's arid zones and, in particular, for the Australian, southern African, and South American continents. Micro-refuge networks may play an important role in maintaining beta-diversity at the bio-region scale and contribute to the stability, resilience, and adaptive capacity of ecosystems in the face of ever-growing pressures from human-forced climate change, land use, and other threatening processes.

AB The evolution of symbiotic relationships involving reef corals has had much impact on tropical marine biodiversity. Because of their endosymbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) corals can grow fast in tropical shallow seas where they form reefs that supply food, substrate and shelter for other organisms. Many coral symbionts are host-specific, depending on particular coral species for their existence. Some of these animals have become popular objects for underwater photographers and aquarists, whereas others are hardly noticed or considered pests. Loss of a single coral host species also leads to the disappearance of some of its associated fauna. In the present study we show which mushroom corals (Scleractinia: Fungiidae) are known to act as hosts for other organisms, such as acoel flatworms, copepods, barnacles, gall crabs, pontoniine shrimps, mytilid bivalves, epitoniid snails, coralliophilid snails, fish and certain types of zooxanthellae. Several of these associated organisms appear to be host-specific whereas other species are generalists and not even necessarily restricted to fungiid hosts. Heliofungia actiniformis is one of the most hospitable coral species known with a recorded associated fauna consisting of at least 23 species. The availability of a phylogeny reconstruction of the Fungiidae enables comparisons of closely related species of mushroom corals regarding their associated fauna. Application of a phylogenetic ecological analysis indicates that the presence or absence of associated organisms is evolutionarily derived or habitat-induced. Some associations appear to be restricted to certain evolutionary lineages within the Fungiidae, whereas the absence of associated species may be determined by ecomorphological traits of the host corals, such as coral dimensions (coral diameter and thickness) and polyp shape (tentacle size).

AB Fire is both a widespread natural disturbance that affects the distribution of species and a tool that can be used to manage habitats for species. Knowledge of temporal changes in the occurrence of species after fire is essential for conservation management in fire-prone environments. Two key issues are: whether postfire responses of species are idiosyncratic or if multiple species show a limited number of similar responses; and whether such responses to time since fire can predict the occurrence of species across broad spatial scales. We examined the response of bird species to time since fire in semiarid shrubland in southeastern Australia using data from surveys at 499 sites representing a 100-year chronosequence. We used nonlinear regression to model the probability of occurrence of 30 species with time since. fire in two vegetation types, and compared species' responses with generalized response shapes from the literature. The occurrence of 16 species was significantly influenced by time since fire: they displayed six main responses consistent with generalized response shapes. Of these 16 species, 15 occurred more frequently in mid- or later-successional vegetation (>20 years since fire), and only one species occurred more often in early succession (<5 years since fire). The models had reasonable predictive ability for eight species, some predictive ability for seven species, and were little better than random for one species. Bird species displayed a limited range of responses to time since fire; thus a small set of fire ages should allow the provision of habitat for most species. Postfire successional changes extend for decades and management of the age class distribution of vegetation will need to reflect this timescale. Response curves revealed important seral stages for species and highlighted the importance of mid- to late-successional vegetation (>20 years). Although time since fire clearly influences the distribution of numerous bird species, predictive models of the spatial distribution of species in fire-prone landscapes need to incorporate other factors in addition to time since fire.

AB We apply the concept of biodiversity hotspot analysis (the identification of biogeographical regions of high species diversity) to identify invasion hotspots areas of potentially suitable climate for multiple non-native plant species in Australia under current and future climates. We used the species distribution model Maxent to model climate suitability surfaces for 72 taxa, recognized as Weeds of National Significance (WoNS) in Australia, under current and projected climate for 2020 and 2050. Current climate suitability layers were summed across all 72 species, and we observed two regions of high climatic suitability corresponding to the top 25th percentile of combined climatic suitability values across Australia. We defined these as potential invasion hotspots. Areas of climatic suitability equivalent to the hotspot regions were identified in the composite maps for 2020 and 2050, to track spatial changes in the hotspots over the two time steps. Two potential invasion hotspot regions were identified under current and projected climates: the south west corner of Western Australia (SW), and south eastern Australia (SE). Herbarium data confirmed the presence of 73% and 99% of those species predicted to be in each hotspot respectively, suggesting that the SE has greater invasion potential. The area of both hotspots was predicted to retract southward and towards the coast under future climate scenarios, reducing in size by 81% (SW) and 71% (SE) by 2050. This reduction was driven by the dominance of southern temperate invasive plant species in the WoNS list (47 of the 72), of which 44 were predicted to experience reductions in their bioclimatic range by 2050. While climate is likely to become less suitable for the majority of WoNS in the future, potential invasion hotspots based on climate suitability are likely to remain in the far south of eastern Australia, and in the far south west of Western Australia by 2050.

AB Aim Analyses of species distributions are complicated by various origins of spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in biogeographical data. SAC may be particularly important for invasive species distribution models (iSDMs) because biological invasions are strongly influenced by dispersal and colonization processes that typically create highly structured distribution patterns. We examined the efficacy of using a multi-scale framework to account for different origins of SAC, and compared non-spatial models with models that accounted for SAC at multiple levels.
   Location We modelled the spatial distribution of an invasive forest pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, in western USA.
   Methods We applied one conventional statistical method (generalized linear model, GLM) and one nonparametric technique (maximum entropy, Maxent) to a large dataset on P. ramorum occurrence (n = 3787) to develop four types of model that included environmental variables and that either ignored spatial context or incorporated it at a broad scale using trend surface analysis, a local scale using autocovariates, or multiple scales using spatial eigenvector mapping. We evaluated model accuracies and amounts of explained spatial structure, and examined the changes in predictive power of the environmental and spatial variables.
   Results Accounting for different scales of SAC significantly enhanced the predictive capability of iSDMs. Dramatic improvements were observed when fine-scale SAC was included, suggesting that local range-confining processes are important in P. ramorum spread. The importance of environmental variables was relatively consistent across all models, but the explanatory power decreased in spatial models for factors with strong spatial structure. While accounting for SAC reduced the amount of residual autocorrelation for GLM but not for Maxent, it still improved the performance of both approaches, supporting our hypothesis that dispersal and colonization processes are important factors to consider in distribution models of biological invasions.
   Main conclusions Spatial autocorrelation has become a paradigm in biogeography and ecological modelling. In addition to avoiding the violation of statistical assumptions, accounting for spatial patterns at multiple scales can enhance our understanding of dynamic processes that explain ecological mechanisms of invasion and improve the predictive performance of static iSDMs.

AB Aim Biological invasions pose a major conservation threat and are occurring at an unprecedented rate. Disproportionate levels of invasion across the landscape indicate that propagule pressure and ecosystem characteristics can mediate invasion success. However, most invasion predictions relate to species' characteristics (invasiveness) and habitat requirements. Given myriad invaders and the inability to generalize from single-species studies, more general predictions about invasion are required. We present a simple new method for characterizing and predicting landscape susceptibility to invasion that is not species-specific.
   Location Corangamite catchment (13,340 km(2)), south-east Australia.
   Methods Using spatially referenced data on the locations of non-native plant species, we modelled their expected proportional cover as a function of a site's environmental conditions and geographic location. Models were built as boosted regression trees (BRTs).
   Results On average, the BRTs explained 38% of variation in occupancy and abundance of all exotic species and exotic forbs. Variables indicating propagule pressure, human impacts, abiotic and community characteristics were rated as the top four most influential variables in each model. Presumably reflecting higher propagule pressure and resource availability, invasion was highest near edges of vegetation fragments and areas of human activity. Sites with high vegetation cover had higher probability of occupancy but lower proportional cover of invaders, the latter trend suggesting a form of biotic resistance. Invasion patterns varied little in time despite the data spanning 34 years.
   conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first multispecies model based on occupancy and abundance data used to predict invasion risk at the landscape scale. Our approach is flexible and can be applied in different biomes, at multiple scales and for different taxonomic groups. Quantifying general patterns and processes of plant invasion will increase understanding of invasion and community ecology. Predicting invasion risk enables spatial prioritization of weed surveillance and control.

AB Top-down control has been extensively documented in food webs based on living plants, where predator limitation of herbivores can cascade to facilitate plant growth (the green-world hypothesis), particularly in grasslands and aquatic systems. Yet the ecosystem role of predators in detrital food webs is less explored, as is the potential effect of climate warming on detritus-based communities. We here show that predators have a "brown-world" role in decomposer communities via a cascading top-down control on plant growth, based on the results of an experiment that factorially manipulated presence and size of two predator species as well as temperature (warmed vs. unwarmed). The inclusion of predatory beetles significantly decreased abundance of coprophagous beetles and thus the rate of dung decomposition and productivity of plants growing surrounding the dung. Moreover, the magnitude of these decreases differed between predator species and, for dung loss, was temperature dependent. At ambient temperature, the larger predators tended to more strongly influence the dung loss rate than did the smaller predators; when both predators were present, the dung loss rate was higher relative to the treatments with the smaller predators but comparable to those with the larger ones, suggesting an antagonistic effect of predator interaction. However, warming substantially reduced dung decomposition rates and eliminated the effects of predation on dung decomposition. Although warming substantially decreased dung loss rates, warming only modestly reduced primary productivity. Consistent with these results, a second experiment exploring the influence of the two predator species and warming on dung loss over time revealed that predatory beetles significantly decreased the abundance of coprophagous beetles, which was positively correlated with dung loss rates. Moreover, experimental warming decreased the water content of dung and hence the survival of coprophagous beetles. These results confirm that the "brown-world" effect of predator beetles was due to cascading top-down control through coprophagous beetles to nutrient cycling and primary productivity. Our results also highlight potentially counterintuitive effects of climate warming. For example, global warming might significantly decrease animal-mediated decomposition of organic matter and recycling of nutrients in a future warmed world.

AB In this paper, we describe sequences of fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs) in the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (MuFREPs) with the fibrinogen domain probably involved in the antigen recognition, but without the additional collagen-like domain of ficolins, molecules responsible for complement activation by the lectin pathway. Although they do not seem to be true or primive ficolins since the phylogenetic analysis are not conclusive enough, their expression is increased after bacterial infection or PAMPs treatment and they present opsonic activities similar to mammalian ficolins. The most remarkable aspect of these sequences was the existence of a very diverse set of FREP sequences among and within individuals (different mussels do not share any identical sequence) which parallels the extraordinary complexity of the immune system, suggesting the existence of a primitive system with a potential capacity to recognize and eliminate different kind of pathogens.

AB The objectives of this work were to examine the past, current and potential influence of global climate change on the spatial distribution of some commercially exploited fish and to evaluate a recently proposed new ecological niche model (ENM) called nonparametric probabilistic ecological niche model (NPPEN). This new technique is based on a modified version of the test called Multiple Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) using the generalized Mahalanobis distance. The technique was applied in the extratropical regions of the North Atlantic Ocean on eight commercially exploited fish species using three environmental parameters (sea surface temperature, bathymetry and sea surface salinity). The numerical procedure and the model allowed a better characterization of the niche (sensu Hutchinson) and an improved modelling of the spatial distribution of the species. Furthermore, the technique appeared to be robust to incomplete or bimodal training sets. Despite some potential limitations related to the choice of the climatic scenarios (A2 and B2), the type of physical model (ECHAM 4) and the absence of consideration of biotic interactions, modelled changes in species distribution explained some current observed shifts in dominance that occurred in the North Atlantic sector, and particularly in the North Sea. Although projected changes suggest a poleward movement of species, our results indicate that some species may not be able to track their climatic envelope and that climate change may have a prominent influence on fish distribution during this century. The phenomenon is likely to trigger locally major changes in the dominance of species with likely implications for socio-economical systems. In this way, ENMs might provide a new management tool against which changes in the resource might be better anticipated.

AB High levels of deer browsing can prevent canopy tree regeneration, but little is known about changes to forest size-structure following long-term deer herd reductions. We monitored changes in forest stand structure and composition in southwestern Ontario, Canada, over 28-years using permanent plots. Our study site was the largest remaining tract of Carolinian (deciduous) forest in Canada (11 km(2)), a habitat type that contains up to a fifth of Canada's species at risk and is under intense anthropogenic pressures. We recorded declines in all tree size classes between 1981 and 1996, during which densities of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) reached a peak of 55 deer km(-2). Despite significant and sustained deer herd reductions between 1996 and 2009, which reduced deer densities to 7 deer km(-2), there was limited recruitment of small trees and declines in basal area of tree species that were sensitive to deer browsing. Our results suggest that recovery from herbivory is a protracted process during which canopy tree regeneration may continue to decline despite a reduction in browsing pressure due to deer culling. Large declines in canopy-tree densities in Carolinian forests may lead to forest size-structures and herbaceous plant communities that resemble rare oak savanna habitat, creating difficult decisions for conservation managers aiming to protect rare and endangered species within native ecosystems. We recommend that managers protect Carolinian forest stands and encourage canopy tree regeneration by increasing seed sources of native trees. While deer control is essential in reducing forest damage, our results highlight the need to explore other forms of active management to expedite otherwise slow increases in tree density.

AB Plant invasions are known to have negative impacts on native plant communities, yet their influence on higher trophic levels has not been well documented. Past studies investigating the effects of invasive plants on herbivores and carnivores have been largely observational in nature and thus lack the ability to tease apart whether differences are a cause or consequence of the invasion. In addition, understanding how plant traits and plant species compositions change in invaded habitats may increase our ability to predict when and where invasive plants will have effects that cascade to animals. To assess effects on arthropods, we experimentally introduced a non-native plant (Microstegium vimineum, Japanese stiltgrass) in a community re-assembly experiment. We also investigated possible mechanisms through which the invader could affect associated arthropods, including changes in native plant species richness, above-ground plant biomass, light availability and vegetation height. In experimentally invaded plots, arthropod abundance was reduced by 39%, and species richness declined by 19%. Carnivores experienced greater reductions in abundance than herbivores (61% vs 31% reduction). Arthropod composition significantly diverged between experimentally invaded and control plots, and particular species belonging to the abundant families Aphididae (aphids), Formicidae (ants) and Phalacridae (shining flower beetles) contributed the most to compositional differences. Among the mechanisms we investigated, only the reduction in native plant species richness caused by invasion was strongly correlated with total arthropod abundance and richness. In sum, our results demonstrate negative impacts of M. vimineum invasion on higher trophic levels and suggest that these effects occur, in part, indirectly through invader-mediated reductions in the richness of the native plant community. The particularly strong response of carnivores suggests that plant invasion could reduce top-down control of herbivorous species for native plants.

AB P>1. Clonal plants benefit from the ability to translocate resources among interconnected ramets to colonize heterogeneous habitats. Clonal integration affects the resource level and morphological traits of ramets, and thus may influence their physiology and general performance. Although leaf gas exchange and its associated physiological adjustments are key traits to assess plant fitness, the effect of clonal integration on these functional traits is insufficiently understood.
   2. In a glasshouse experiment, we addressed how clonal integration affects gas exchange properties, leaf characters and growth of ramets in two invasive plants, Alternanthera philoxeroides and Phyla canescens, under full sun and 85% shade. We also used stable-isotope labelling to assess the maternal subsidy to daughter ramets.
   3. Similar effects of connection were observed in both species for most gas exchange parameters and leaf characters. Clonal integration did not affect photosynthetic capacity and respiratory rates of ramets. When grown in shade, ramets connected with an unshaded mother plant displayed higher area-based leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll content than severed ramets, but the additional nitrogen and chlorophyll was not translated to increased photosynthetic capability. Overall, severed ramets displayed significant light response for leaf nitrogen (area-based), photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, chlorophyll to nitrogen ratio, and nitrogen stable-isotope signature, but the light response was eliminated by clonal integration in connected ramets.
   4. Both species displayed substantial maternal carbohydrate subsidy that benefited the growth of daughter ramets, but species-specific patterns were observed in the growth of daughter ramets and the amount of subsidy. The amount of subsidy was independent of ramet growth light levels for P. canescens, but shaded, connected ramets of A. philoxeroides received more subsidy than unshaded controls, facilitating a larger growth improvement relative to severed counterparts than P. canescens.
   5. Synthesis. We observed increased leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll in shaded, connected ramets of two clonal invasive plants. Clonal integration may facilitate nitrogen assimilation and allow pre-acclimation to high-light conditions for shaded, connected ramets, thus promoting the opportunistic expansion of these invaders on site scale. The species-specific maternal subsidy pattern demonstrated that clonal plants possess different strategies to subsidize ramets under light-limited conditions.

AB Observed 20th century changes ill the length of the growing season (GS) across the Northern Hemisphere have been linked to increasing temperatures, associated with global warming. Past studies of GS changes in China have largely been based on phenological observations and satellite data, and little attention has been paid to changes in starting and ending dates of GS. Here we examine changes in the thermal GS over China from 1951 to 2007 based on observed daily surface air temperature. Using five indices, trends of three GS parameters, start, end and length, were determined at 114 high-quality stations over China. Our results show large spatial and temporal differences in the GS parameters in China, where the most prominent changes have Occurred in northern China relative to southern China. On average, from 1951 to 2007 the GS has been extended by 2.3 days/decade in northern China where most of these changes is due to an earlier onset of the GS in spring (-1.7 days/decade). In southern China, there is an average increase of GS by 1.3 days/decade with 0.6 days/decade earlier onsets in spring. Furthermore, most stations showing significant trends of GS changes are located in northern China. An extended GS in northern China indicates improved agricultural conditions due to warmer and longer GS. However, this effect may be counteracted by changes in the precipitation pattern.

   POPULATION DIFFERENTIATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; SOUTHEASTERN ALASKA
AB Aim
   Limited population structure is predicted for vagile, generalist species, such as the grey wolf (Canis lupus L.). Our aims were to study how genetic variability of grey wolves was distributed in an area comprising different habitats that lay within the potential dispersal range of an individual and to make inferences about the impact of ecology on population structure.
   Location
   British Columbia, Canada - which is characterized by a continuum of biogeoclimatic zones across which grey wolves are distributed - and adjacent areas in both Canada and Alaska, United States.
   Methods
   We obtained mitochondrial DNA control region sequences from grey wolves from across the province and integrated our genetic results with data on phenotype, behaviour and ecology (distance, habitat and prey composition). We also compared the genetic diversity and differentiation of British Columbia grey wolves with those of other North American wolf populations.
   Results
   We found strong genetic differentiation between adjacent populations of grey wolves from coastal and inland British Columbia. We show that the most likely factor explaining this differentiation is habitat discontinuity between the coastal and interior regions of British Columbia, as opposed to geographic distance or physical barriers to dispersal. We hypothesize that dispersing grey wolves select habitats similar to the one in which they were reared, and that this differentiation is maintained largely through behavioural mechanisms.
   Main conclusions
   The identification of strong genetic structure on a scale within the dispersing capabilities of an individual suggests that ecological factors are driving wolf differentiation in British Columbia. Coastal wolves are highly distinct and representative of a unique ecosystem, whereas inland British Columbia grey wolves are more similar to adjacent populations of wolves located in Alaska, Alberta and Northwest Territories. Given their unique ecological, morphological, behavioural and genetic characteristics, grey wolves of coastal British Columbia should be considered an Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU) and, consequently, warrant special conservation status. If ecology can drive differentiation in a highly mobile generalist such as the grey wolf, ecology probably drives differentiation in many other species as well.

AB Biotic interactions can affect the distribution of species across environmental gradients, and as air and soil temperatures increase, plant community response may depend on interactions with symbionts. We measured the effect of elevated soil temperatures on mycorrhizal function and on the response of both plant and fungal symbionts, using fungal inoculum isolated from either high-temperature thermal or nonthermal grassland soils. Our source for thermal soils was Yellowstone National Park, USA, where plants experience rooting zone temperatures of 45 degrees C or more. In the greenhouse, we grew three plant species (Dichanthelium lanuginosum, Agrostis scabra, and Mimulus guttatus) with three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) treatments (no AMF, nonthermal AMF, thermal AMF) and two soil temperatures (ambient, elevated). Biomass of the facultative thermal plants Agrostis scabra and Mimulus guttatus decreased by 50% in elevated-temperature soils, and AMF had no effect on measured plant traits. In contrast, the biomass and total root length of the obligate thermal plant Dichanthelium lanuginosum were greater at elevated soil temperatures, but only when mycorrhizal. Both mycorrhizal colonization levels and length of extraradical hyphae (ERH) increased with soil temperature across all host species. The source of the AMF inoculum, on the other hand, did not affect colonization level, ERH length, host plant biomass, or flowering for all host species in either temperature treatment, suggesting that AMF from thermal soils are not specifically adapted to higher temperatures. In the field we collected soil cores to measure in situ depth distributions of D. lanuginosum roots and ERH, and to determine which AMF species were active in plants growing in thermal soils. Roots were limited to soils with an average temperature <= 30 degrees C, while ERH existed in the hottest soils we sampled, averaging 35 degrees C. Molecular analyses of roots indicated that thermal AMF communities were composed of both generalist and possibly unique fungal species. The increase in host plant allocation to AMF, apparent lack of temperature adaptation by AMF, and differential host response to AMF suggest that AMF could be significant drivers of plant community response to increased soil temperature associated with global change.

   PERSPECTIVE
AB Population outbreaks of crown-of-thorns sea star (Acanthaster planci L) remain one of the most significant biological disturbances on tropical coral reefs although the increasing attention given to other threats has greatly limited recent progress in understanding the cause and consequences of this phenomenon. In September 2005 dramatic increases in the abundance of A. planci were observed on reefs within Bootless Bay, Central Province, Papua New Guinea, where few crown-of-thorns have previously been reported. Densities of A. planci peaked at 162 sea stars per hectare and caused extensive coral mortality. This outbreak killed upwards of 55% of live corals, reducing overall coral cover from 42.4% in 2005 down to just 19.1% in March 2006. Declines in coral cover were largely driven by widespread mortality of Acropora spp. which dominated reef assemblages prior to the outbreak. The extensive depletion of Acropora spp. greatly altered the coral composition as well as the physical structure of reef habitats. In the absence of any other major disturbances these coral communities are likely to quickly recover, but this Outbreak highlights the ongoing contribution of A. planci to degradation of coral reef environments.

AB Neutral models characterize evolutionary or ecological patterns expected in the absence of specific causal processes, such as natural selection or ecological interactions. In this study, we describe and evaluate three neutral models that can, in principle, help to explain the apparent 'twigginess' of asexual lineages on phylogenetic trees without involving the negative consequences predicted for the absence of recombination and genetic exchange between individuals. Previously, such phylogenetic twiggyness of asexual lineages has been uncritically interpreted as evidence that asexuality is associated with elevated extinction rates and thus represents an evolutionary dead end. Our first model uses simple phylogenetic simulations to illustrate that, with sexual reproduction as the ancestral state, low transition rates to stable asexuality, or low rates of ascertained 'speciation' in asexuals, can generate twiggy distributions of asexuality, in the absence of high extinction rates for asexual lineages. The second model, developed by Janko et al. (2008), shows that a dynamic equilibrium between origins and neutral losses of asexuals can, under some conditions, generate a relatively low mean age of asexual lineages. The third model posits that the risk of extinction for asexual lineages may be higher than that of sexuals simply because asexuals inhabit higher latitudes or altitudes, and not due to effects of their reproductive systems. Such neutral models are useful in that they allow quantitative evaluation of whether empirical data, such as phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns of sex and asexuality, indeed support the idea that asexually reproducing lineages persist over shorter evolutionary periods than sexual lineages, due to such processes as mutation accumulation, slower rates of adaptive evolution, or relatively lower levels of genetic variability.

AB Stony corals are the foundation species of tropical reefs, and their structures can harbor a diverse range of mutualist taxa that can confer important benefits, including provision of nutrients. Prominent among the associates of branching coral in the genus Pocillopora are groups of zooplanktivorous damselfishes that take refuge in the coral to avoid their predators. In field and laboratory experiments, we explored the effects of colonies of resident damselfishes on growth of their host corals. Laboratory studies revealed a positive relationship between biomass of fish and output of ammonium. In the field, levels of ammonium were significantly elevated in the water surrounding the branches of Pocillopora occupied by colonies of damselfish, particularly in time periods following active feeding by the fish. Experimental manipulation of the presence of fish on host corals during a month-long field experiment revealed that corals hosting fish grew significantly more than those that lacked fish, and coral growth was positively correlated with the biomass of resident fish. The Pocillopora colonies in the field experiment varied in the degree of openness of their branching structure, and dye studies indicated that this affected their ability to retain waterborne nutrients. Together with biomass of resident fish, colony openness explained 76% of the variation in coral growth rate during the experiment. Corals can exhibit considerable morphological variability, and mutualistic fish respond to colony architecture during habitat selection, with some species preferring more open-branched forms. This makes it likely that corals may face tradeoffs in attracting resident fish and in retaining the nutrients they provide.

AB Shark nets placed along the coast of KwaZulu-Natal to protect bathers from shark attacks result in an incidental by-catch of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) at twice the level suggested by the IWC as the maximum sustainable capture rate for a cetacean population. Observational data reported the presence of at least two putative populations, one a seasonal migratory population moving into the KwaZulu-Natal area following the movement of sardines, and the other a coastal, apparently resident population. Some observations indicated possible further subdivision of the coastal population. We analysed nine microsatellite loci and 599 bps of the mitochondrial control region and found small but significant differentiation within the putative coastal population (F(ST) = 0.022) separated north and south of Ifafa. There was weaker evidence for differentiation between the southern coastal and migratory populations (F(ST) = 0.012). Genetic diversity was low for both types of markers in all populations, and the pattern of mtDNA variation was consistent with a founder event. Considering the high capture rate, the low level of genetic diversity, and the evidence of possible population differentiation along the coast, we suggest that particular care should be taken in managing the take from shark nets especially in the north coastal area of KZN where the population showed the higher degree of differentiation.

AB The ecological consequences of climate change are determined by many climate parameters, not just by the commonly investigated changes in mean temperature and rainfall. More comprehensive studies, including analyses of climate variability, extremes and aggregate changes in the climate system, can improve the understanding of the nature, and therefore possible consequences, of recent changes in climate. Here climate trends on the sub-Antarctic Marion Island are documented (between 1949 and 2003) in more detail than previously. Significant trends in biologically-relevant, and previously unexplored, parameters were observed, and the potential ecological consequences of these changes discussed. For example, the decline in precipitation experienced on the island comprises a trend for longer dry spells punctuated by fewer and smaller precipitation events. This more detailed understanding of the island's drying trends enables more accurate predictions about its impacts, including, for example, particularly severe effects on plant species growing in soils with poor water-holding capacity. Therefore, in addition to changes in average conditions, more inclusive climate analyses should also examine trends in climatic variability and extremes, for individual climate parameters as well as for the climate system as a whole.

AB Dramatic shifts in community composition occur between vertical and horizontal rocky surfaces in subtidal environments worldwide, yet the forces mediating this transition are poorly understood. Vertical rock walls are often covered by lush, diverse communities of sessile suspension-feeding invertebrates, while adjacent horizontal substrates are dominated by algae, or corals in the tropics. Multiple factors, including light, sedimentation, water flow, and predation have been proposed to explain this pattern, but experimental tests of these hypotheses are lacking. We manipulated light level and predation to test whether variation in these mechanisms could be responsible for the shift in composition of sessile communities between vertical and horizontal surfaces in the rocky subtidal Gulf of Maine. Shaded horizontally oriented granite plots were dominated by invertebrates (e. g., ascidians, barnacles, bryozoans) after 25 months. Unshaded plots were dominated by macroalgae, which was virtually absent in shaded plots. Exclusion of grazers with cages had no effect on percent cover of invertebrates or algae. Preferential settlement of invertebrate larvae to shaded plots, due to larval behaviors such as negative phototaxis, did not seem to play a role. Shading likely affects post-settlement mortality of invertebrates by alleviating competition for space with algae, although greater abundance of micropredators in algal-dominated communities could also be important. Communities on shaded plots lacked many taxa present on natural wall communities, likely due to greater disturbance on horizontal substrates and/or lack of sufficient time for colonization of these taxa. These results suggest that light plays a key role in controlling the structure, composition, and function of shallow subtidal communities.

AB 1. Long-term studies in ecology are essential for understanding natural variability and in interpreting responses to disturbances and human perturbations. We assessed the long-term variability, stability and persistence of macroinvertebrate communities by analysing data from three regions in northern California with a mediterranean-climate. During the study period, precipitation either increased or decreased, and extreme drought events occurred in each region.
   2. Temporal trends in precipitation resulted in shifts from 'dry-year' communities, dominated by taxa adapted to no or low flow, to 'wet-year' communities dominated by taxa adapted to high flows. The abundance of chironomid larvae was an important driver of community change. Directional change in community composition occurred at all sites and was correlated with precipitation patterns, with more dramatic change occurring in smaller streams.
   3. All communities exhibited high to moderate persistence (defined by the presence/absence of a species) and moderate to low stability (defined by changes in abundance) over the study period. Stability and persistence were correlated with climatic variation (precipitation and El Nino Southern Oscillation) and stream size. Stability and persistence increased as a result of drought in small streams (first-order) but decreased in larger streams (second- and third-order). Communities from the dry season were less stable than those from the wet-season.
   4. This study demonstrates the importance of long-term studies in capturing the effects of and recovery from rare events, such as the prolonged and extreme droughts considered here.

AB Despite the potential model role of the green algal genus Codium for studies of marine speciation and evolution, there have been difficulties with species delimitation and a molecular phylogenetic framework was lacking. In the present study, 74 evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) are delimited using 227 rbcL exon 1 sequences obtained from specimens collected throughout the genus' range. Several morpho-species were shown to be poorly defined, with some clearly in need of lumping and others containing pseudo-cryptic diversity. A phylogenetic hypothesis of 72 Codium ESUs is inferred from rbcL exon 1 and rps3-rp/16 sequence data using a conventional nucleotide substitution model (GTR + Gamma + I), a codon position model and a covariotide (covarion) model, and the fit of a multitude of substitution models and alignment partitioning strategies to the sequence data is reported. Molecular clock tree rooting was carried out because out-group rooting was probably affected by phylogenetic bias. Several aspects of the evolution of morphological features of Codium are discussed and the inferred phylogenetic hypothesis is used as a framework to study the biogeography of the genus, both at a global scale and within the Indian Ocean.

AB Inbreeding resulting from severe population bottlenecks may impair an individual's immune system and render it more susceptible to disease. Although a reduced immune response could threaten the survival of highly endangered species, few studies have assessed the effect of population bottlenecks on immunocompetence. We compared the counts of leucocytes and external, blood and gastrointestinal parasite loads in two populations of the endemic New Zealand robin Petroica australis to assess the immunocompetence of birds in a severely bottlenecked population relative to its more genetically diverse source population. Despite similar parasite loads in both populations, robins in the severely bottlenecked population showed lower counts of both total leucocyte and total lymphocyte numbers. When the immune system was experimentally challenged using the phytohaemagglutinin skin test, robins in the severely bottlenecked population exhibited a significantly lower immune response than the source population, suggesting that birds passing through a severe bottleneck have a compromised immunocompetence. Our results confirm that severe bottlenecks reduce the immune response of birds and highlight the need to avoid severe bottlenecks in the recovery programmes of endangered species.

AB It has been largely demonstrated that demographic performances of animals increase with age or experience as a result of an improvement of foraging skills, an increasing reproductive effort or a selection process. However, little is known about the age or experience-related response of populations to environmental variations. Theoretical studies consider that age-related variations of the performances are greater under more restricting conditions, but this has rarely been tested.
   We tested this hypothesis on a long-lived species, black browed albatross Thalassarche melanophrys Temminck, using a long-term capture-mark-recapture data set. We investigated the responses of a population to climate, by studying the effects of climatic factors and breeding experience on survival and breeding success.
   First-time breeders appear to be poorer performers compared with experienced adults, with lower reproductive success and lower survival. In addition, interannual variations of demographic traits were partly explained by climatic indices, reflecting environmental variations. The survival probability of black-browed albatrosses varied with experience and climate, and differences being greater under harsh conditions. By contrast, the reproductive success of inexperienced individuals was affected by climatic fluctuations in the same way as the experienced ones.
   First breeding event acts as a strong selective process on the highly heterogeneous class of inexperienced individuals, suggesting the increase in survival and breeding success with experience may mainly reflect a reduction in the heterogeneity among individual qualities.

AB Despite rather broad definitions, global analysis showed that seamount fishes, particularly seamount-aggregating fishes, had higher intrinsic vulnerability than other groups of fishes. The pattern was similar when considering only commercially exploited species. Biological characteristics leading to greater vulnerability included a longer life span, later sexual maturation, slower growth and lower natural mortality. The results supported the contention that seamount fishes, especially those that aggregate on seamounts, are highly vulnerable to exploitation and that fishing on seamounts may not be sustainable at current levels and with current methods. A number of seamount populations have already been depleted; more depletion, extirpations, and even species extinctions may follow if fishing on seamounts is not reduced.

AB Small-ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV), consisting of the caprine arthritis -encephalitis virus (CAEV) and the maedi-visna virus (MVV), cause chronic multisystemic infections in goats and sheep. The SRLV subtype B1, characterized by the prototypic strain CAEV-CO, has a worldwide distribution and, remarkably, has been isolated exclusively from goats, suggesting potential host specificity. To test this hypothesis, SRLV pol sequences were obtained by PCR amplification from blood samples of scropositive dairy goats and sheep living in mixed flocks. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences demonstrates that SRLV subtype B1 does cross the species barrier under field conditions through direct contact between adult animals. This implies that SRLV control programs targeting only sheep or goats can no longer be proposed (based on a putative species specificity of the SRLV subtype B1). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Molecular studies of the guenons suggest that the arboreal Cercopithecus species form a monophyletic group within the tribe Cercopithecini. However, the evolutionary relationships among these arboreal congeners remain poorly resolved. The present work marks the first attempt to reconstruct the history of this group through the phylogenetic analysis of long nuclear sequences. We surveyed 19 guenons and seven outgroup taxa for a similar to 9.3 kb fragment of X-chromosomal DNA homologous to a portion of human Xq13.3. Parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of these sequences consistently recover two strongly-supported patterns within the arboreal Cercopithecus clade: (1) a clustering of members of the cephus and mitis species groups, and (2) a monophyletic aggregate including the mona, neglectus, and diana species groups. Although guenons occasionally hybridize in the wild, interbreeding forms of different species groups do not cluster together as sister-taxa in the X-chromosomal tree, suggesting that the two clades inferred here are not reticulate patterns due to recent gene flow. These clades are most likely the result of either ancestral hybridization or true phylogenetic history. We advocate the latter explanation because the same two aggregates (cephus/mitis and mona/neglectus/diana) are recovered, albeit with weak support, by a number of earlier analyses. Finally, X-chromosomal divergence dates are estimated for a number of nodes in the guenon radiation. The divergence of guenon and papionin lineages at 11.5 (+/-1.3) MYA appears to be a particularly robust estimate since it is inferred from both mitochondrial and X-chromosomal studies, each using different fossil calibration points.

AB The effects of restorative grazing on species composition and community structure of butterflies and moths were studied in mesic semi-natural grasslands differing in their management history: (1) old continuously grazed pastures, (2) restored pastures with similar to5 yr of reinitiated grazing, and (3) abandoned former pastures. Butterflies and moths were counted with a transect method during 1999 and 2000 in 33 study sites in southwest Finland. In a multivariate ordination (NMDS), the studied grasslands were separated from each other on the basis of their species composition so that the actively grazed pastures differed from abandoned pastures. The first ordination, axis represented most (73%) of the variation in species composition, and it was strongly correlated with variables describing the current grazing intensity. Species richness and total abundance were highest in abandoned pastures, both for all species and for grassland-preferring species. In contrast, relative diversity (N-1, N-2, and alpha) and evenness (Alatalo's evenness index) were in most cases highest in old pastures and lowest in abandoned pastures. Generalized linear models (GLM) were constructed for four response variables: total species richness, grassland species richness, abundance of all species, and abundance of grassland species. The derived models explained 78-84% of the total variation for species richness and 92-93% for abundance, and the type of grazing history explained the largest proportion of variation. Mean vegetation height was included in the abundance models as a quadratic function, which indicated that butterflies and moths were most abundant at an intermediate level of grazing intensity, as predicted by the "dynamic equilibrium model." The results suggest that grazing management is a useful tool in the restoration of insect communities of abandoned semi-natural grasslands. In order to enhance the survival of species suffering from continuously high grazing intensity, the existing management instructions should be developed toward construction of regional networks of semi-natural grasslands, which would allow differing grazing intensities or rotational grazing on the patch level, but simultaneously ensure continuity of varying management regimes on a regional level.

AB Predictive habitat models rely on the relationship between a response variable (either occurrence or abundance of a species) and a set of environmental predictors. Vegetation is generally preferred as a source of potential predictors because of having a more direct link with reproductive necessities of species than topography and climate. However, vegetation maps are costly to produce and update and most land-use/land-cover maps I are usually made with a general purpose, focused on land management, and not thinking on animal distribution. On the contrary, basic topographic and climatic maps are easier to obtain or to derive, are not so sensitive to legend design, and do not need of such frequent updates. In this study, we compare the predictive ability of different sets of environmental predictors when modelling the distribution of breeding birds. Models were generated for 79 bird species in South-western Spain using Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) with binomial errors and logit link. For each species, several models were created that differed in the set of candidate predictors initially tested (either derived from vegetation or from topo-climatic maps) or in the conditional order in which those predictor sets were tested. Within vegetation predictors, a similar strategy was used to ascertain the relative relevance of vegetation landscape (variables describing the surrounding habitat matrix) compared to vegetation cover (variables describing the type of vegetation found on sampling sites).
   Vegetation models were significantly more accurate than topo-climatic models, but the difference was due to the higher number of potential predictors in the set of vegetation variables. Vegetation landscape models were significantly more accurate than vegetation cover models, even when controlling for the number of candidate predictors. Models that included both sets of predictors (vegetation and topo-climatic variables) had a slightly superior predictive ability. Our results indicate that, when building predictive models of bird distribution, the best results are obtained using both vegetation and topo-climatic variables as potential predictors. If time or budget constrains compel to concentrate on a single set of predictors, selection should be done on grounds of data availability, because model accuracy is likely to be-similar for models derived from vegetation compared to topographic and climatic predictors. In relation to vegetation predictors, vegetation landscape reflects important information not revealed by vegetation cover measures at the sampling site; thus, regional modelling programmes would certainly gain predictive ability by including landscape patterns that are currently disregarded.

AB Genetic population structure of the blacktip shark, Carcharhinus limbatus, a commercially and recreationally important species in the southeast U.S. shark fishery, was investigated using mitochondrial DNA control region sequences. Neonate blacktip sharks were sampled from three nurseries, Pine Island Sound, Terra Ceia Bay, and Yankeetown, along the Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida (Gulf) and one nursery, Bulls Bay, on the Atlantic Ocean coast of South Carolina (Atlantic). Sequencing of the complete mitochondrial control region of 169 neonates revealed 10 polymorphic sites and 13 haplotypes. Overall haplotype diversity and percent nucleotide diversity were 0.710 and 0.106%, respectively. Haplotype frequencies were compared among nurseries to determine if the high mobility and seasonal migrations of adult blacktip sharks have maintained genetic homogeneity among nurseries in the Atlantic and Gulf. Chi-square analysis and AMOVA did not detect significant structuring of haplotypes among the three Gulf nurseries, P(chi(2))=0.294, Phi(ST)=-0.005 to -0.002. All pairwise AMOVA between Gulf nurseries and the Atlantic nursery detected significant partitioning of haplotypes between the Gulf and Atlantic (Phi(ST)=0.087-0.129, P<0.008), as did comparison between grouped Florida Gulf nurseries and the Atlantic, Phi(CT)=0.090, P<0.001. Based upon the dispersal abilities and seasonal migrations of blacktip sharks, these results support the presence of philopatry for nursery areas among female blacktip sharks. Our data also support the treatment of Atlantic and Gulf blacktip shark nursery areas as separate management units.

AB Models used to predict species' potential distributions have been described as either correlative or mechanistic. We attempted to determine whether correlative models could perform as well as mechanistic models for predicting species potential distributions, using a case study. We compared potential distribution predictions made for a coastal dune plant (Scaevola plumieri) along the coast of South Africa, using a mechanistic model based on summer water balance (SWB), and two correlative models (a profile and a group discrimination technique). The profile technique was based on principal components analysis (PCA) and the group-discrimination technique was based on multiple logistic regression (LR). Kappa (kappa) statistics were used to objectively assess model performance and model agreement. Model performance was calculated by measuring the levels of agreement (using kappa) between a set of testing localities (distribution records not used for model building) and each of the model predictions. Using published interpretive guidelines for the kappa statistic, model performance was "excellent" for the SWB model (kappa = 0.852), perfect for the LR model (kappa = 1.000), and "very good" for the PCA model (kappa = 0.721). Model agreement was calculated by measuring the level of agreement between the mechanistic model and the two correlative models. There was "good" model agreement between the SWB and PCA models (kappa = 0.679) and "very good" agreement between the SWB And LR models (kappa = 0.786). The results suggest that correlative models can perform as well as or better than simple mechanistic models. The predictions generated from these three modelling designs are likely to generate different insights into the potential distribution and biology of the target organism and may be appropriate in different situations. The choice of model is likely to be influenced by the aims of the study, the biology of the target organism, the level of knowledge the target organism's biology, and data quality.

AB A cladistic analysis of relationships among the genera of Scorpionidae Latreille, 1802 - Heterometrus Ehrenberg, 1828; Opistophthalmus C. L. Koch, 1837; Pandinus Thorell, 1876; and Scorpio Linnaeus, 1758 - based on morphology and DNA sequence data from loci of three genes in the mitochondrial genome (12S ribosomal DNA ( rDNA), 16S rDNA and cytochrome oxidase I) and one gene in the nuclear genome (28S rDNA) is presented. The analysis makes use of exemplar species, specifically selected to test the monophyly of the genera, rather than supraspecific terminal taxa. Other methods used in the analysis are justified in the context of a discussion of current methods for phylogenetic reconstruction. Relationships among the scorpionid genera are demonstrated to be as follows: ( Opistophthalmus ( Scorpio ( Heterometrus + Pandinus))). This reconstruction identifies Opistophthalmus as the basal lineage of the Scorpionidae, rather than the sister-group of Scorpio. Revised descriptions, diagnoses and a key to identification of the four scorpionid genera are provided, together with a summary of what is known about their ecology, distribution and conservation status.

AB The mottled duck (Anas fulvigula) is a year-round endemic resident of the Gulf Coast and one of two non-migratory dabbling ducks that inhabit North America. To investigate population genetic structure of allopatric mottled duck populations, we collected 5' control region sequences (bp 78-774) from the mitochondria of 219 mottled ducks sampled at 11 widely spaced geographic localities in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida and compared them to each other and to homologous sequences from 4 Mexican ducks (A. diazi), 13 American black ducks (A. rubripes), and 10 mallards (A. platyrhynchos). We identified 57 unique haplotypes composed of 665 or 666 nucleotides in the 246 control region sequences. Of the 665 homologous positions, 8.3% (n = 55) vary among haplotypes, and 98.2% (n = 54) of these occur within the first 351 nucleotides from the 5' end of the outgroup sequence. Neighbor-joining analysis shows a large distal clade (52.5% of mottled ducks sampled in our study) composed of two reciprocally monophyletic clades of mottled duck haplotypes, one of which is endemic to Texas and Louisiana and the other endemic to Florida. No mottled ducks sampled in Florida occur in the clade composed of mottled ducks from Texas and Louisiana or vice versa, suggesting that (1) an enduring geographic split has existed for many years between east and west, and (2) gene flow currently is non-existent (or at least undetectable) across the central Gulf Coast. The remaining 47.5% of mottled ducks sampled in our study branch basally from this derived clade, show substantially less hierarchical structure, and fall into various lineage groups of mixed species composition with no geographic or species-specific pattern. Pairwise F-ST values corroborate the pattern of strong differentiation observed between Texas/Louisiana and Florida. Our findings are consistent with a pattern of partial lineage sorting from a polymorphic ancestral gene pool reshuffled by hybridizing mallards. Control region data and patterns of divergence in mallard-like species worldwide, furthermore, suggest that mottled ducks are close relatives of Mexican ducks, and in turn nested within black ducks. Genetic similarities to nominate mallards are less likely to be the product of common ancestry, but the result of past hybridization with a dichromatic mallard ancestor that invaded North America from Asia many generations ago. Our findings have several important consequences for the conservation biology of mottled ducks across the Gulf Coast and our understanding of the phylogeography of mallard-like species worldwide.

AB Maximum likelihood analysis, accounting for site-heterogeneity in evolutionary rate with the Gamma -distribution model. was carried out with amino acid sequences of 12 mitochondrial proteins and nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNAs from three turtles, one squamate, one crocodile, and eight birds. The analysis strongly suggests that turtles are closely related to archosaurs (birds + crocodilians), and it supports both Tree-2: (((birds, crocodilians), turtles). squamates) and Tree-3: ((birds, (crocodilians. turtles)), squamates). A more traditional Tree-1: (((birds, crocodilians), squamates), turtles) and a tree in which turtles are basal to other amniotes were rejected with high statistical significance. Tree-3 has recently been proposed by Hedges and Poling [Science 283 (1999) 998-1001] based mainly on nuclear genes. Therefore, we re-analyzed their data using the maximum likelihood method, and evaluated the total evidence of the analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear data sets. Tree-1 was again rejected strongly. The most likely hypothesis was Tree-3, though Tree-2 remained a plausible candidate. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We comment on the role of genetic markers in fisheries and aquaculture with a view to the future. Our goal is to encourage researchers to evaluate the molecular markers they need to deploy and shift their thinking away from analyses of stock structure towards more aggressive pursuit of questions related to genome structure and function. Examples illustrate that no one marker type is appropriate for all applications. Choice should be based on the evolutionary genetic attributes of both the species and the marker loci themselves. We evaluate three relatively new marker types: mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA, and hypervariable nuclear loci. We conclude that (i) sequences of mtDNA do not necessarily detect greater polymorphism than restriction endonuclease analysis, (ii) the technical ease of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA is offset by questionable repeatability, and (iii) simulations illustrate that even new marker systems with large numbers of alleles need not detect differences among closely related yet significantly differentiated populations. Increasing the number of alleles per locus did not increase the probability of detecting significant differences. Finally, we consider the roles of genetic markers in helping to determine family relationships in pooled lots of fishes and locate genes that control an organism's phenotype (quantitative trait loci). We discuss how knowledge of quantitative trait loci can help us to understand the basis of individual differences in performance.

AB Numerous studies of interactions between urchins and algae in temperate areas have shown an important structuring effect of sea urchin populations. These studies focused almost wholly on the effect of high urchin densities on laminarian forests. In contrast, algal communities below 5-6 m depth in the northwestern Mediterranean are characterised by low sea urchin densities (<5 ind m(-2)) and the absence of laminarian forests. No previous research has addressed sea urchin/algal interactions in this type of community. To determine the effect of the most abundant echinoid species, Paracentrotus lividus, on well-established algal communities in this area, we performed a removal-reintroduction experiment in rocky patches located between 13 and 16 m depth in the northwestern Mediterranean, where sea urchin densities ranged between 0.9 and 3.4 ind m(-2). After 6 months, the cover of non-crustose algae was significantly higher in the plots from which sea urchins had been removed than in control plots (84 vs 67% cover). These removal plots reverted to their original state upon reintroduction of sea urchins. The non-crustose algae consisted of turfing and frondose forms, with the former representing some 70% of the non-crustose algal cover. Change in the cover of turfing algae was responsible for the significant increase in algal development in the sea urchin removal plots. The response of frondose algae to the treatment varied between algal species. It is concluded that grazing by P. lividus exerts a significant effect on habitat structure, even in communities with low sea urchin densities, such as those found in vast areas of the Mediterranean sublittoral.

Survival and reproduction by adult females of two grasshopper species [Acrididae; Melanoplus sanguinipes (Fabricius) and Phoetaliotes nebrascensis (Thomas)] were evaluated in response to defined diets that varied factorially in both total nitrogen (1-7%) and total soluble carbohydrate (4.3-26.7%). These grasshopper species coexist naturally but are typically shifted phenologically so that specific developmental stages normally encounter host plants of different nutritional quality under natural conditions.
   2. Demographic responses by adult females of both species varied according to diet quality, but not in the same fashion. Diet quality affected survival significantly in P. nebrascensis but not in M. sanguinipes. Survival in P. nebrascensis was greatest on diets containing the lowest nitrogen concentrations; carbohydrate level had no effect.
   3. Diet quality influenced reproduction significantly in both species. Egg production rate (eggs/day) in M. sanguinipes exhibited a negative linear response to increased carbohydrate, coupled with a significant quadratic response to nitrogen that reached a maximum at an intermediate level of about 4% total N. A significant quadratic response to total N for pod production rate (indicating the timing of reproduction) was also observed. Clutch size in M. sanguinipes exhibited a negative relationship with total carbohydrate in the diet, but no response to nitrogen. No interaction was observed between nitrogen and carbohydrate levels. For P. nebrascensis, response to diet quality was much weaker, with only a suggestive maximum at 4% total-N for both egg production rate (eggs/day) and clutch size (eggs/pod) and a suggestive linear response for pod production rate as carbohydrate level increased. Female body weight did not contribute to any reproductive response as a covariate variable.
   4. Combined with a similar, previous analysis of demographic responses by the grass-feeding grasshopper, Ageneotettix deorum, these results challenge the ability to draw generalizations about host plant nutritional quality and grasshopper demographic responses. These three grasshopper species respond quite differently to defined diets that vary in total nitrogen and carbohydrate levels. Thus, although host plant quality can contribute significantly to grasshopper population responses, a uniform explanation is not likely.

AB BIOME-BGC is a general ecosystem model designed to simulate hydrologic across multiple scales, The objectives of this investigation were to compare BIOME-BGC estimates of hydrologic processes with observed data for different boreal forest stands and investigate factors that control simulated water fluxes. Model results explained 62 and 98% of the respective variances in observed daily evapotranspiration and soil water; simulations of the onset of spring thaw and the dates of snowpack disappearance and accumulation also generally tracked observations, Differences between observed and simulated evapotranspiration were attributed to model assumptions of constant, growing season, overstory leaf areas that did not account for phenological changes and understory effects on stand daily water fluxes. Vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation accounted for 58-74% of the variances in simulated daily evapotranspiration during the growing season, though low air temperature and photosynthetic light levels were found to be the major limiting factors regulating simulated canopy conductances to water vapor, Humidity and soil moisture were generally not low enough to induce physiological water stress in black spruce stands, though low soil water potentials resulted in approximate 34% reductions in simulated mean daily canopy conductances for aspen and jack pine stands. The sensitivity of evapotranspiration simulations to leaf area (LAI) was less than expected because of opposing responses of transpiration and evaporation to LAI, The results of this investigation identify several components within boreal forest stands that are sensitive to climate change.

AB Information on the reproductive behaviour and population structure of female hawksbill turtles, Eretmochelys imbricata, is necessary to define conservation priorities for this highly endangered species. Two hypotheses to explain female nest site choice, natal homing and social facilitation, were tested by analysing mtDNA control region sequences of 103 individuals from seven nesting colonies in the Caribbean and western Atlantic. Under the social facilitation model, newly mature females follow older females to a nesting location, and subsequently use this site for future nesting. This model generates an expectation that female lineages will be homogenized among regional nesting colonies. Contrary to expectations of the social facilitation model, mtDNA lineages were highly structured among western Atlantic nesting colonies. These analyses identified at least 6 female breeding stocks in the Caribbean and western Atlantic and support a natal homing model for recruitment of breeding females. Reproductive populations are effectively isolated over ecological time scales, and recovery plans for this species should include protection at the level of individual nesting colonies.

AB The hypothesis is developed that there are causal linkages in evolved insect herbivore life histories and behaviors from phylogenetic constrains to adaptive syndromes to the emergent properties involving ecological interactions and population dynamics.  Thus the argument is developed that the evolutionary biology of a species predetermines its current ecology.  Phylogenetic Constraints refer to old characters in the phylogeny of a species and a group of species which set limits on the range of life history patterns and behaviors that can evolve.  For example, a sawfly is commonly limited to oviposition in soft plant tissue, while plants are growing rapidly.  Adaptive Syndromes are evolutionary responses to the phylogenetic constraints that minimize the limitations and maximize larval performance.  Such syndromes commonly involve details of female ovipositional behavior and how individuals make choices for oviposition sites relative to plant quality variation which maximize larval survival.  Syndromes also involve larval adaptations to the kinds of choices females make in oviposition.  The evolutionary biology involved with phylogenetic constraints and adaptive syndromes commonly predetermines the ecological interactions of a species and its population dynamics.  Therefore, these ecological interactions are called Emergent Properties because they are natural consequences of evolved morphology, behavior, and physiology.  They commonly strongly influence the three-trophic-level interactions among host plants, insect herbivores, and carnivores, and the relative forces of bottom-up and top-down influences in food webs.  The arguments are supported using such examples as galling sawflies and other gallers, shoot-boring moths and beetles, budworms, and forest Macrolepidoptera.  The contrasts between outbreak or eruptive species and uncommon and rare species with latent population dynamics are emphasized.

AB Changes in carbon fixation rate and the levels of photosynthetic proteins were measured in fourth leaves of Lolium temulentum grown until full expansion at 360 mumol quanta m-2 s-1 and subsequently at the same irradiance or shaded to 90 mumol m-2 s-1. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), light-harvesting chlorophyll alb protein of photosystem II (LHCII), 65 kDa protein of photosystem I (PSI), cytochrome f (Cyt f) and coupling factor 1 (CF1) declined steadily in amount throughout senescence in unshaded leaves. In shaded leaves, however, the decrease in LHCII and the 65 kDa protein was delayed until later in senescence whereas the amount of Cyt f protein decreased rapidly following transfer to shade and was lower than that of unshaded leaves at the early and middle stages of senescence. Decreases in the Rubisco and CF1 of shaded leaves occurred at slightly reduced rates compared with unshaded leaves. These results indicate that chloroplast proteins in fully-expanded leaves are controlled individually, in a direction appropriate to acclimate photosynthesis to a given irradiance during senescence.

AB The absorption of NO3- was characterized in six regions of a 7-d-old corn root (Zea mays L. cv W64A x W182E) growing in a complete nutrient solution. Based on changing rates of N-15 accumulation during 15-min time courses, translocation of the concurrently absorbed N through each region of the intact root was calculated and distinguished from direct absorption from the medium. Of the N-15 accumulated in the 5-mm root tip after 15 min, less than 15 and 35% had been absorbed directly from the external solution at 0.1 and 10 mM NO3- concentration of the external solution, respectively. The characterization of the apical portion of the primary root as a sink for concurrently absorbed N was con-confirmed in a pulse-chase experiment that showed an 81% increase of N-15 in the 5-mM root tip during a 12-min chase (subsequent to a 6-min labeling period). The lateral roots alone accounted for 60% of root influx and 70% of 15-min whole root N-15 accumulation at either 0.1 or 10 mM. NO3- concentration of the external solution. Because relatively steady rates of N-15 accumulation in the shoot were reached after 6 min, the rapidly exchanging pools in lateral roots must have been involved in supplying N-15 to the shoot. The laterals and the basal primary root also showed large decreases (24 and 17%) in N-15 during the chase experiment, confirming their role in rapid translocation.

AB Subterranean clover was inoculated with Acaulospora laevis, [WUM 11(4)] or an undescribed Acaulospora sp. [WUM 18(1)] at three inoculum quantities and the rate of development of mycorrhizas and the production of spores and external hyphae were monitored. A critical length of mycorrhizal root was found to be associated with the onset of sporulation for both fungi. This was less for Acaulospora sp. than it was for A. laevis and was first reached for plants inoculated with the highest quantity of inoculum for each fungus. Root length colonized and number of spores produced were well correlated at early sampling times once sporulation had begun, but were not well correlated at the end of the experiment. Acaulospora sp. produced six times as many spores as did A. laevis by the final harvest, but this only represented half the volume of spores produced by the latter. After sporulation had commenced the percentage of root length colonized by A. laevis declined while the percentage of root length colonized by Acaulospora sp. remained high, perhaps because of differences in the length of external hyphae produced by each fungus. The length of external hyphae per gram of soil increased with Acaulospora sp. but not for A. laevis, throughout the experiment. However for each fungus there was not a dose relationship between the length of external hyphae and the number of spores produced.

AB 1. Allocation of biomass and nitrogen were studied for 1 year in experimental populations of Carex diandra, C. rostrata and C. lasiocarpa (species from mesotrophic fens) and C. acutiformis (a species from eutrophic fens). These species were grown at two levels of N supply (3.3 and 20.0 g Nm-2 year-1, respectively).
   2. At low N supply, total biomass did not differ between the species. At high N supply, the total biomass of C. lasiocarpa and C. acutiformis ('high-productive species') significantly exceeded that of C. diandra and C. rostrata ('low-productive species'). In all species, percentage nitrogen allocation to the leaves exceeded percentage biomass allocation to the leaves.
   3. The high-productive species had a higher shoot:root ratio, a higher percentage biomass allocation to the leaves (leaf weight ratio, LWR), a higher total nitrogen content and a higher percentage nitrogen allocation to the leaves than the low-productive species. However, the low-productive species had higher leaf nitrogen concentrations (on a weight basis) than the high-productive species.
   4. Parameters which are related to light interception, such as the specific leaf area (SLA: m2 of leaf per kg of leaf), the leaf area ratio (LAR: m2 of leaf per kg of plant), the leaf area index (LAI: m2 of leaf per m 2 of soil) and the ratio between total leaf area and total root length, did not differ consistently between the high-productive and the low-productive species.
   5. Compared with the high-productive species, the low-productive species invested relatively more biomass and nitrogen in plant parts which contribute to the acquisition of below-ground resources.
   6. At low N supply, there was a decrease in all species of the shoot:root ratio, LWR, LAR, LAI, and the ratio between total leaf area and total root length.
   7. The rank order of potential productivity of the species in this study did not match the rank order of nitrogen availability in their natural habitat. It is suggested that the distribution of these species is not only determined by their potential productivity, but also by specific demands on the water chemistry and by their competitive ability.

DT Article
AB Five groups of E. blakelyi seedlings were differentially fertilized to obtain a range of N concentrations from 0.8-3.0% dry wt in the foliage. Groups of P. atomaria larvae were reared from eclosion to the prepupal stage on these seedlings. The effects on larval growth and development caused by foliar concentrations of N, moisture content, and tannins and leaf toughness were measured. Pupal dry weight and development time of P. atomaria did not differ between those reared on foliage with N levels of 1.7-3.0% but there was a significant decrease in pupal weight and increase in development time for individuals fed foliage with N below this level. Larvae fed foliage with an average of 0.8% N died before reaching instar III. Total dry matter consumption increased with a decrease in N concentration. Larval nitrogen utilization efficiency increased as foliar N level decreased until N reached a level somewhere between 1.7%-1.2% below which it decreased. There appeared to be an N concentration threshold above which P. atomaria larvae received adequate N by regulating consumption and nitrogen utilization efficiency but below which they could no longer accumulate enough N by compensation to maintain an optimum growth rate and development time. Effects of food quality variables on relative growth and consumption rates are presented and discussed.

AB Recovering biological diversity and ecosystem functioning are primary objectives of ecological restoration, yet these outcomes are often unpredictable. Assessments based on functional traits may help with interpreting variability in both community composition and ecosystem functioning because of their mechanistic and generalizable nature. This promise remains poorly realized, however, because tests linking environmental conditions, functional traits, and ecosystem functioning in restoration are rare. Here, we provide such a test through what is to our knowledge the first empirical application of the response-effect trait framework' to restoration. This framework provides a trait-based bridge between community assembly and ecosystem functioning by describing how species respond to environmental conditions based on traits and how the traits of species affect ecosystem functioning. Our study took place across 29 prairies restored from former agricultural fields in southwestern Michigan. We considered how environmental conditions affect ecosystem functioning through and independently of measured functional traits. To do so, we paired field-collected trait data with data on plant community composition and measures of ecosystem functioning and used structural equationmodelling to determine relationships between environmental conditions, community-weighted means of functional traits and ecosystem functioning. Environmental conditions were predictive of trait composition. Sites restored directly from tillage (as opposed to those allowed to fallow) supported taller species with larger seeds and higher specific leaf area (SLA). Site age and fire frequency were both negatively related to SLA. We also found a positive relationship between soil moisture and SLA. Both trait composition and environmental conditions predicted ecosystem functioning, but these relationships varied among the measured functions. Pollination mode (animal pollination) increased and fire frequency decreased floral resource availability, seed mass had a negative effect on below-ground biomass production, and vegetative height increased decomposition rate. Soil moisture and fire frequency both increased while site age decreased above-ground biomass production, and site age and soil moisture both increased decomposition rate.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that both trait composition and environmental conditions play a role in shaping ecosystem function during restoration, and the importance of each is dependent on the function of interest. Because of this, environmental heterogeneity will be necessary to promote multiple ecosystem functions across restored landscapes. A trait-based approach to restoration can aid interpretation of variable outcomes through insights into community assembly and ecosystem functioning.

AB Human trade and travel are breaking down biogeographic barriers, resulting in shifts in the geographical distribution of organisms, yet it remains largely unknown whether different alien species generally follow similar spatiotemporal colonization patterns and how such patterns are driven by trends in global trade. Here, we analyse the global distribution of 241 alien ant species and show that these species comprise four distinct groups that inherently differ in their worldwide distribution from that of native species. The global spread of these four distinct species groups has been greatly, but differentially, influenced by major events in recent human history, in particular historical waves of globalization (approximately 1850-1914 and 1960 to present), world wars and global recessions. Species in these four groups also differ in six important morphological and life-history traits and their degree of invasiveness. Combining spatiotemporal distribution data with life-history trait information provides valuable insight into the processes driving biological invasions and facilitates identification of species most likely to become invasive in the future.

AB The study of leaf functional trait relationships, the so-called leaf economics spectrum(1,2), is based on the assumption of high-light conditions (as experienced by sunlit leaves). Owing to the exponential decrease of light availability through canopies, however, the vast majority of the world's vegetation exists in at least partial shade. Plant functional traits vary in direct dependence of light availability(3), with different traits varying to different degrees, sometimes in conflict with expectations from the economic spectrum(3). This means that the derived trait relationships of the global leaf economic spectrum are probably dependent on the extent to which observed data in existing large-scale plant databases represent high-light conditions. Here, using an extensive worldwide database of within-canopy gradients of key physiological, structural and chemical traits(3), along with three different global trait databases(4,5), we show that: (1) accounting for light-driven trait plasticity can reveal novel trait relationships, particularly for highly plastic traits (for example, the relationship between net assimilation rate per area (A(a)) and leaf mass per area (LMA)); and (2) a large proportion of leaf traits in current global plant databases reported as measured in full sun were probably measured in the shade. The results show that even though the majority of leaves exist in the shade, along with a large proportion of observations, our current understanding is too focused on conditions in the sun.

AB The Upper Mississippi River System, including the Illinois River, has been invaded by a number of nonnative species including silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitirx and bighead carp H. nobilis, collectively referred to here as Asian carps. Silver carp densities in the Illinois River have increased dramatically and now represent some of the highest densities of wild silver carp anywhere in the world. Asian carps have the potential to alter existing ecosystems by consuming planktonic resources and therefore, could have the ability to alter existing fish communities as most fishes are dependent on planktonic resources during early development. However, identifying the relationship of fish community structure to the establishment of Asian carps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Using long-term fish community data collected by the Upper Mississippi River Restoration's Long Term Resource Monitoring element, we investigate changes in fish community structure pre- and post-establishment of Asian carps. Significant differences in the pre- and post-establishment communities were observed for the majority of gears and habitats. Species contributing to changes between establishment periods included most sportfish species and catostomids, which were less abundant post-establishment of Asian carps, while shortnose gar, grass carp, and emerald shiner were more abundant. While our analyses show Asian carps are likely contributing to major differences in fish community structure, future research and long-term monitoring should investigate the mechanisms and interactions responsible for community changes as well as identifying any potential concurrent or confounding factors such as changes in river hydrology or sedimentation.

AB Soaring throughput, plummeting costs, and increased sensitivity for assaying degraded or low-concentration DNA are driving a revolution in the way that we monitor biodiversity. Arguably the biggest game-changer' is environmental DNA (eDNA), which refers to free-floating DNA released by organisms into their environment. Rare or elusive species can be detected with greater sensitivity and accuracy using eDNA than by most conventional methods, and we have the capability to screen and describe whole communities, as well as perform targeted monitoring of single species. This paper discusses the basic approaches for molecular monitoring of biodiversity, provides case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques, and considers any challenges and limitations that could impact molecular biological recording. It is argued that eDNA surveys offer exciting new opportunities to engage the public in biological recording and that molecular approaches will complement conventional surveys, enabling unprecedented insights into species distributions. Finally, with the number of eDNA studies increasing at a rapid pace, it is argued that there is a need to rapidly establish ways of managing molecular records. Integrating molecular records into existing biological records databases would enhance our understanding of species distributions and may be something that the Biological Records Centre should be considering to mark its landmark anniversary.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London.

AB Environmental selection and dispersal limitation are two of the primary processes structuring biotic communities in ecosystems, but little is known about these processes in shaping soil microbial communities during secondary forest succession. We examined the communities of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi in young, intermediate and old forests in a Chinese subtropical ecosystem, using 454 pyrosequencing. The EM fungal community consisted of 393 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), belonging to 21 EM fungal lineages, in which three EM fungal lineages and 11 EM fungal OTUs showed significantly biased occurrence among the young, intermediate and old forests. The EM fungal community was structured by environmental selection and dispersal limitation in old forest, but only by environmental selection in young, intermediate, and whole forests. Furthermore, the EM fungal community was affected by different factors in the different forest successional stages, and the importance of these factors in structuring EM fungal community dramatically decreased along the secondary forest succession series. This study suggests that different assembly mechanisms operate on the EM fungal community at different stages in secondary subtropical forest succession.

AB Public parks commonly contain important habitat for urban biodiversity, and they also provide recreation opportunities for urban residents. However, the extent to which dual outcomes for recreation and conservation can be achieved in the same spaces remains unclear. We examine whether greater levels of (i) tree cover (i.e. park 'greenness') and (ii) native remnant vegetation cover (i.e. vegetation with high ecological value) attract or deter park visitors. This study is based on the park visitation behaviour of 670 survey respondents in Brisbane, Australia, detailing 1,090 individual visits to 324 urban parks. We first examined the presence of any clear revealed preferences for visiting parks with higher or lower levels of tree cover or remnant vegetation cover. We then examined the differences between each park visited by respondents and the park closest to their home, and used linear mixed models to identify socio-demographic groups who are more likely to travel further to visit parks with greater tree cover or remnant vegetation cover. Park visitation rates reflected the availability of parks, suggesting that people do not preferentially visit parks with greater vegetation cover despite the potential for improved nature-based experiences and greater wellbeing benefits. However, we discovered that people with a greater orientation towards nature (measured using the nature relatedness scale) tend to travel further for more vegetated parks. Our results suggest that to enhance recreational benefits from ecologically valuable spaces a range of social or educational interventions are required to enhance people's connection to nature.

AB Ungulate populations are important natural resources, associated with both costs and benefits. Conflicts have arisen between stakeholders who benefit from high ungulate numbers and those faced with the costs. Supplementary or diversionary feeding may potentially mitigate conflicts while maintaining harvest yields but can have conservation implications. We quantified the empirical evidence for whether the intended effects, and hence management goals, of feeding are met. We also examined whether any potential unintended consequences of feeding occur and under what conditions. We found clear evidence that supplementary feeding enhanced reproduction and population growth under certain conditions. By contrast, we found limited evidence of the effectiveness of diversionary feeding to protect crops, forestry, and natural habitats, with positive effects often undermined by increases in ungulate density. However, the use of diversionary feeding to reduce traffic collisions seems promising but requires further investigation. The unintended effects of feeding are typically complex, involving changes to demography, behavior, and vegetation with consequent cascading effects on other trophic levels, as well as exacerbated risks of disease transmission. Increased ungulate density is the primary driver behind these unintended effects, the consequences of which tend to increase with longevity of feeding and affect a range of stakeholders. We urge managers to take seriously the risks as well as the economic and ethical issues before deciding to feed ungulates. (c) 2014 The Wildlife Society.

AB Little consideration has been given to environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling strategies for rare species. The certainty of species detection relies on understanding false positive and false negative error rates. We used artificial ponds together with logistic regression models to assess the detection of African jewelfish eDNA at varying fish densities (0, 0.32, 1.75, and 5.25 fish/m(3)). Our objectives were to determine the most effective water stratum for eDNA detection, estimate true and false positive eDNA detection rates, and assess the number of water samples necessary to minimize the risk of false negatives. There were 28 eDNA detections in 324, 1-L, water samples collected from four experimental ponds. The best-approximating model indicated that the per-L-sample probability of eDNA detection was 4.86 times more likely for every 2.53 fish/m(3) (1 SD) increase in fish density and 1.67 times less likely for every 1.02 C (1 SD) increase in water temperature. The best section of the water column to detect eDNA was the surface and to a lesser extent the bottom. Although no false positives were detected, the estimated likely number of false positives in samples from ponds that contained fish averaged 3.62. At high densities of African jewelfish, 3-5 L of water provided a > 95% probability for the presence/absence of its eDNA. Conversely, at moderate and low densities, the number of water samples necessary to achieve a > 95% probability of eDNA detection approximated 42-73 and >100 L, respectively. Potential biases associated with incomplete detection of eDNA could be alleviated via formal estimation of eDNA detection probabilities under an occupancy modeling framework; alternatively, the filtration of hundreds of liters of water may be required to achieve a high (e. g., 95%) level of certainty that African jewelfish eDNA will be detected at low densities (i. e <0.32 fish/m(3) or 1.75 g/m(3)).

AB Whether fungal community structure depends more on historical factors or on contemporary factors is controversial. This study used culture-dependent and -independent (polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE)) methods to assess the influence of historical and contemporary factors on the distributions of fungi in the wetland sediments at 10 locations along the Changjiang River and at 10 other locations in China. The culture-dependent approach detected greater species diversity (177 operational taxonomic units (OTUs)) than PCR-DGGE analysis (145 OTUs), and the species in the genera of Penicillium (relative frequency 16.8%), Fusarium (15.4%), Aspergillus (7.6%), Trichoderma (5.8%) and Talaromyces (4.2%) were dominant. On the basis of DGGE data, fungal diversity along the Changjiang River increased from upstream to downstream; altitude explained 44.8% of this variation in diversity. And based on the data from all 20 locations, the fungal communities were geographically clustered into three groups: Southern China, Northern China and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Multivariate regression tree analysis for data from the 20 locations indicated that the fungal community was influenced primarily by location (which explained 61.8% of the variation at a large scale), followed by total potassium (9.4%) and total nitrogen (3.5%) at a local scale. These results are consistent with the concept that geographic distance is the dominant factor driving variation in fungal diversity at a regional scale (1000-4000 km), whereas environmental factors (total potassium and total nitrogen) explain variation in fungal diversity at a local scale (<1000 km).

AB Large mammalian carnivores are threatened by anthropogenic environmental impacts, particularly through habitat loss which often cause population declines. Understanding the extent of suitable habitat is therefore of great importance for carnivore conservation. The leopard (Panthera pardus) is a widespread and relatively common large carnivore, but the species is declining in large parts of its range. Using maximum entropy-based habitat models, we estimated the extent of suitable leopard habitat in South Africa, what variables that are associated with suitable leopard habitats, the extent of habitat that has been negatively impacted by human activity and the effectiveness of protected areas to capture suitable habitat. Suitable leopard habitat was highly fragmented. Although vegetation and physical variables were the most influential variables for habitat suitability, livestock farming primarily seem to underlie fragmentation. We suggest that the sustainability of the South African leopard population depends on maintaining dispersal routes between areas with suitable habitat. This will require mitigation of humancarnivore conflict in habitat corridors, particularly mitigation strategies targeting conflict between carnivores and livestock farmers. Because most suitable habitat occurred outside of protected areas, we also recommend that leopard conservation efforts should focus on areas that are not legally protected.

AB Understanding the evolutionary histories of invasive species is critical to adopt appropriate management strategies, but this process can be exceedingly complex to unravel. As illustrated in this study of the worldwide invasion of the woodwasp Sirex noctilio, population genetic analyses using coalescent-based scenario testing together with Bayesian clustering and historical records provide opportunities to address this problem. The pest spread from its native Eurasian range to the Southern Hemisphere in the 1900s and recently to Northern America, where it poses economic and potentially ecological threats to planted and native Pinus spp. To investigate the origins and pathways of invasion, samples from five continents were analysed using microsatellite and sequence data. The results of clustering analysis and scenario testing suggest that the invasion history is much more complex than previously believed, with most of the populations being admixtures resulting from independent introductions from Europe and subsequent spread among the invaded areas. Clustering analyses revealed two major source gene pools, one of which the scenario testing suggests is an as yet unsampled source. Results also shed light on the microevolutionary processes occurring during introductions, and showed that only few specimens gave rise to some of the populations. Analyses of microsatellites using clustering and scenario testing considered against historical data drastically altered our understanding of the invasion history of S. noctilio and will have important implications for the strategies employed to fight its spread. This study illustrates the value of combining clustering and ABC methods in a comprehensive framework to dissect the complex patterns of spread of global invaders.

AB Integration of climate change aspects in biodiversity management is one the fundamental requirements for long term biodiversity conservation. The explicit modelling of the biodiversity in response to climate change is the primary requirement for making any adaptation strategy. With Himalayan ecosystem in mind and Rhododendron as the species of concern, the current paper models the biogeography of the genera Rhododendron which are found intermixed in their spatial distribution in Sikkim Himalayas, mainly tree varieties, in response to climate change. The modelling algorithm used in the paper is Maxent (maximum entropy) which has estimated the target probability distribution by finding the probability distribution of Maxent. After projection of modelled bioclimatic layers to future climate scenario of SRES-A1B in Maxent, it was found that the suitable bioclimatic envelope for Rhododendron has shrunk considerably under the envisaged climate change scenario. The results on extent and locations of Rhododendron distributions in both the current and future climate scenarios provide a deep insight to the conservation planners about the kind of strategy that needs to be adopted for conserving Rhododendrons in the face of climate change. The challenges observed while doing this analysis highlight the gaps and set the agenda for further research to make the predictions of climate change driven impact on biodiversity scientifically more robust.

AB Aim Predicting distribution patterns of whale sharks (Rhincodon typus, Smith 1828) in the open ocean remains elusive owing to few pelagic records. We developed multivariate distribution models of seasonally variant whale shark distributions derived from tuna purse-seine fishery data. We tested the hypotheses that whale sharks use a narrow temperature range, are more abundant in productive waters and select sites closer to continents than the open ocean.
   Location Indian Ocean.
   Methods We compared a 17-year time series of observations of whale sharks associated with tuna purse-seine sets with chlorophyll a concentration and sea surface temperature data extracted from satellite images. Different sets of pseudoabsences based on random distributions, distance to shark locations and tuna catch were generated to account for spatiotemporal variation in sampling effort and probability of detection. We applied generalized linear, spatial mixed-effects and Maximum Entropy models to predict seasonal variation in habitat suitability and produced maps of distribution.
   Results The saturated generalized linear models including bathymetric slope, depth, distance to shore, the quadratic of mean sea surface temperature, sea surface temperature variance and chlorophyll a had the highest relative statistical support, with the highest percent deviance explained when using random pseudoabsences with fixed effect-only models and the tuna pseudo-absences with mixedeffects models (e.g. 58% and 26% in autumn, respectively). Maximum Entropy results suggested that whale sharks responded mainly to variation in depth, chlorophyll a and temperature in all seasons. Bathymetric slope had only a minor influence on the presence.
   Main conclusions Whale shark habitat suitability in the Indian Ocean is mainly correlated with spatial variation in sea surface temperature. The relative influence of this predictor provides a basis for predicting habitat suitability in the open ocean, possibly giving insights into the migratory behaviour of the world's largest fish. Our results also provide a baseline for temperature-dependent predictions of distributional changes in the future.

AB Background: The establishment rate of invasive alien insect species has been increasing worldwide during the past century. This trend has been widely attributed to increased rates of international trade and associated species introductions, but rarely linked to environmental change. To better understand and manage the bioinvasion process, it is crucial to understand the relationship between global warming and establishment rate of invasive alien species, especially for poikilothermic invaders such as insects.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We present data that demonstrate a significant positive relationship between the change in average annual surface air temperature and the establishment rate of invasive alien insects in mainland China during 1900-2005. This relationship was modeled by regression analysis, and indicated that a 1 degrees C increase in average annual surface temperature in mainland China was associated with an increase in the establishment rate of invasive alien insects of about 0.5 species year(-1). The relationship between rising surface air temperature and increasing establishment rate remained significant even after accounting for increases in international trade during the period 1950-2005. Moreover, similar relationships were detected using additional data from the United Kingdom and the contiguous United States.
   Conclusions/Significance: These findings suggest that the perceived increase in establishments of invasive alien insects can be explained only in part by an increase in introduction rate or propagule pressure. Besides increasing propagule pressure, global warming is another driver that could favor worldwide bioinvasions. Our study highlights the need to consider global warming when designing strategies and policies to deal with bioinvasions.

AB Aim Temporal transferability is an important issue when habitat models are used beyond the time frame corresponding to model development, but has not received enough attention, particularly in the context of habitat monitoring. While the combination of remote sensing technology and habitat modelling provides a useful tool for habitat monitoring, the effect of incorporating remotely sensed data on model transferability is unclear. Therefore, our objectives were to assess how different satellite-derived variables affect temporal transferability of habitat models and their usefulness for habitat monitoring.
   Location Wolong Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province, China.
   Methods We modelled giant panda habitat with the maximum entropy algorithm using panda presence data collected in two time periods and four different sets of predictor variables representing land surface phenology. Each predictor variable set contained either a time series of smoothed wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) or 11 phenology metrics, both derived from single-year or multi-year (i.e. 3-year) remotely sensed imagery acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We evaluated the ability of models obtained with these four variable sets to predict giant panda habitat within and across time periods by using threshold-independent and threshold-dependent evaluation methods and five indices of temporal transferability.
   Results Our results showed that models developed with the four variable sets were all useful for characterizing and monitoring giant panda habitat. However, the models developed using multi-year data exhibited significantly higher temporal transferability than those developed using single-year data. In addition, models developed with phenology metrics, especially when using multi-year data, exhibited significantly higher temporal transferability than those developed with the time series.
   Main conclusions The integration of land surface phenology, captured by high temporal resolution remotely sensed imagery, with habitat modelling constitutes a suitable tool for characterizing wildlife habitat and monitoring its temporal dynamics. Using multi-year phenology metrics reduces model complexity, multicollinearity among predictor variables and variability caused by inter-annual climatic fluctuations, thereby increasing the temporal transferability of models. This study provides useful guidance for habitat monitoring through the integration of remote sensing technology and habitat modelling, which may be useful for the conservation of the giant panda and many other species.

AB Plant litter often decomposes faster in the habitat from which it was derived (i.e. home) than when placed in foreign habitats (i.e. away), which has been called the home-field advantage (HFA) of litter decomposition. We tested whether the HFA of litter decomposition is driven by decomposer communities being specialized at decomposing litter in their home habitat, by reciprocally transplanting litter from grassland to early-successional forest. Unexpectedly, we found an overall disadvantage for at-home decomposition despite large differences in litter quality (lignin:N) between the two habitats. We found more evidence for habitat specialization among secondary decomposers (mites) than the primary decomposers (bacteria and fungi), suggesting that soil animals may be important in driving HFA patterns where they do exist. Grass litter decomposition in forest slowed down and became more fungal-based, while tree litter decomposition in grassland increased yet showed no shift to being bacterially-based, relative to 'at home' decomposition. This suggests a biological explanation for why a positive HFA was not observed. Our results highlight that both environmental context and soil biology can play an important and sometimes counter-intuitive role in modifying decomposition. A better understanding of the interaction between all three primary drivers of decomposition (the environment, litter quality and soil organisms) is necessary for reliable prediction of decomposition at global scales.

AB Fisheries scientists and managers are increasingly engaging with fishers' knowledge (FK) to provide novel information and improve the legitimacy of fisheries governance. Disputes between the perceptions of fishers and scientists can generate conflicts for governance, but can also be a source of new perspectives or understandings. This paper compares artisanal trap fishers' reported current catch rates with landings data and underwater visual census (UVC). Fishers' reports of contemporary `normal' catch per day tended to be higher than recent median landings records. However, fishers' reports of `normal' catch per trap were not significantly different from the median CPUE calculated from landings data, and reports of `good' and `poor' catch rates were indicative of variability observed in landings data. FK, landings and UVC data all gave different perspectives of trends over a ten-year period. Fishers' perceptions indicated greater declines than statistical models fitted to landings data, while UVC evidence for trends varied between sites and according to the fish assemblage considered. Divergence in trend perceptions may have resulted from differences in the spatial, temporal or taxonomic focus of each dataset. Fishers may have experienced and understood behavioural changes and increased fishing power, which may have obscured declines from landings data. Various psychological factors affect memory and recall, and may have affected these memory-based estimates of trends, while different assumptions underlying the analysis of both interview data and conventional scientific data could also have led to qualitatively different trend perceptions. Differing perspectives from these three data sources illustrate both the potential for 'cognitive conflicts' between stakeholders who do not rely on the same data sources, as well as the importance of multiple information sources to understand dynamics of fisheries. Collaborative investigation of such divergence may facilitate learning and improve fisheries governance.

AB Field experiments were conducted in 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 to evaluate the relative performance of synthetic (black polyethylene) and Organic (paddy husk and straw) mulches on soil and plant water status vis-a-vis N uptake in wheat in a semi-arid environment of India. Scope of better utilization of soil moisture was documented through all the mulches, especially during initial crop growth stages, when the moisture content was 1-3% higher in mulches. Soil temperature was more moderate under organic mulches. Paddy husk recorded significantly higher plant biomass, while the effect of mulching in enhancing root growth was clearly documented. Organic mulches produced more roots (25 and 40% higher root weight and root length densities compared to no-mulch) in sub-surface (>0.15 m) layers, probably due to greater retention of soil moisture in deeper layers and relatively narrow range of soil temperature changes under these systems. Incremental N dose significantly improved all the plant parameters in both mulch and no-mulch treatments. Grain yield was 13-21 % higher under mulch and so with increasing N levels. Nitrogen uptake was higher in organic mulches and also with higher N doses, while polyethylene mulch showed mixed trend, Mulches were effective in reducing 3-11% crop water use and improved its efficiency by 25%. Grain yield and biomass were well-correlated with leaf area index (r = 0.87 and 0.91, respectively) and water use was better correlated with root length than its weight. Results indicated substantial improvement in water and N use efficiency and crop growth in wheat under surface mulching, and the organic mulches, especially rice husk performed better than synthetic mulches.

AB P>1. Quantitative palaeolimnology has traditionally sought to quantify species-environment relationships to use alterations in biological assemblages to reflect past environmental change. Transfer functions have used regression techniques, such as weighted averaging, to define taxon optima and tolerance for a single chemical or biological variable.
   2. Cladoceran assemblages and their sub-fossil remains in shallow lakes are shaped by a combination of interacting factors. Partial constrained ordination of sub-fossil cladoceran assemblages from 39 shallow lakes (29 in Norfolk, U.K. and 10 in Denmark) indicated that both zooplanktivorous fish (ZF) density and submerged macrophyte abundance significantly influenced community composition. These dual structuring forces precluded the use of a transfer function as one of the key assumptions of this approach was not met, namely that environmental variables apart from the variable being modelled have negligible influence on species distribution or that there is a linear relationship between the two. Separate transfer functions for ZF and macrophyte abundance were developed but had poor performance diagnostics with low bootstrapped r2, high root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and large bias.
   3. To obviate the problem of multiple structuring forces a multivariate regression tree (MRT) was employed, which allows for more than one explanatory variable within a model. The MRT analysis defined six groups with discrete ranges of ZF and macrophyte densities. The technique identified critical values or 'break points' in ZF and macrophyte abundances which result in significant alterations in the sub-fossil cladoceran assemblage. In addition, the MRT groups had different summer mean values for chlorophyll-a, Secchi depth, total phosphorus and nitrate-nitrogen.
   4. The predictive abilities of the model were assessed by comparing the observed versus predicted MRT group membership. In general group membership was reliably predicted, suggesting sub-fossil cladoceran assemblages reliably reflect ZF and macrophyte density in shallow lakes. For a relatively small number of sites there were differences between the observed and predicted MRT group membership. These failures of prediction may result, at least in part, from the disparity of the time period represented by the environmental data and the surface sediment cladoceran assemblage.

AB Aim
   We developed predictive models of coral reef fish species richness and abundance that account for both broad-scale environmental gradients and fine-scale biotic processes, such as dispersal, and we compared the importance of absolute geographical location (i.e. geographical coordinates) versus relative geographical location (i.e. distance to domain boundaries).
   Location
   Great Barrier Reef, Australia.
   Methods
   Four annual surveys of coral reef fishes were combined with a 0.01 degrees-resolution grid of environmental variables including depth, sea surface temperature, salinity and nutrient concentrations. A principal component-based method was developed to select candidate predictors from a large number of correlated variables. Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) were used to gauge the respective importance of the different spatial and environmental predictors. An error covariance matrix was included in the models to account for spatial autocorrelation.
   Results
   (1) Relative geographical descriptors, represented by distances to the coast and to the barrier reef, provided the highest-ranked single model of species richness and explained up to 36.8% of its deviance. (2) Accounting for spatial autocorrelation doubled the deviance in abundance explained to 71.9%. Sea surface temperature, salinity and nitrate concentrations were also important predictors of abundance. Spatially explicit predictions of species richness and abundance were robust to variation in the spatial scale considered during model calibration.
   Main conclusions
   This study demonstrates that distance-to-domain boundaries (i.e. relative geographical location) can offer an ecologically relevant alternative to geographical coordinates (i.e. absolute geographical location) when predicting biodiversity patterns, providing a proxy for multivariate and complex environmental processes that are often difficult or expensive to estimate.

AB Warmer water. changes in stream flow, and the increasing frequency and intensity of other disturbances are among the factors associated with climate change that are likely to impact native trout populations ill the western USA. We examined how three of these summer temperatures, uncharacteristic winter flooding, and increased wildfires-are likely to affect broad-scale population persistence among, three subspecies of cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii. Our results suggest that as much 73% of the habitat currently occupied by Bonneville cutthroat trout O. c. utah. 65% of that occupied by westslope cutthroat trout O. c lewisi, and 29% of that occupied by Colorado River cutthroat trout O. c. pleuriticus will be at high risk from one or more of the these three factors. Within the next 50 years. wildfire, floods, and other disturbances may have a greater impact on population persistence than increasing water temperature alone. Our results also suggest that the risk will vary substantially within subspecies. For each subspecies, our analyses identified large portions of their ranges where all populations either currently fail to meet basic Persistence criteria, are at high risk from climate change, or both, indicating a high likelihood of losing the genetic and life history diversity in those areas. Stress from climate change is likely to compound existing problems associated with habital degradation and introgression existing problems associated with habitat degradation and introgression from introduced salmonids. Recognition of the increased risk from climate change may warrant altering the management paradigm of isolation and require increased control efforts for invasive nonnative species. Regardless of the management avenue chosen, more populations are likely to become isolated and vulnerable in the near future. Our results argue for immediate restoration actions within Certain subbasins to increase the resistance and resilience at-risk populations and habitats to additional disturbances caused by rapid climate change.

AB Climate envelope models (CEMs) are widely used to forecast future shifts in species ranges under climate change, but these models are rarely validated against independent data, and their fundamental assumption that climate limits species distributions is rarely tested. Here, we use the data on the introduction of five South African dung beetle species to Australia to test whether CEMs developed in the native range can predict distribution in the introduced range, where the confounding effects of dispersal limitation, resource limitation and the impact of natural enemies have been removed, leaving climate as the dominant constraint. For two of the five species, models developed in the native range predict distribution in the introduced range about as well as models developed in the introduced range where we know climate limits distribution. For the remaining three species, models developed in the native range perform poorly, implying that non-climatic factors limit the native distribution of these species and need to be accounted for in species distribution models. Quantifying relevant non-climatic factors and their likely interactions with climatic variables for forecasting range shifts under climate change remains a challenging task.

AB Supportive breeding is a strategy consisting in maintaining a pool of locally-adapted wild genitors in captivity whose offspring are released in the wild at an early developmental stage. In this study, we tested the utility of this strategy in preventing phenotypic and genetic divergences between captive-bred and wild animals that could be detrimental for wild populations. Combining microsatellite analyses, morphological measurements and behavioural trials in the laboratory, we compared the progeny of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) born in captivity with individuals born in the wild. At all these levels, we found significant differences between the progeny of the two groups. Specifically, allelic frequencies significantly differed between groups, with captive-bred fish tending to be less variable with lower heterozygosity and allelic richness values. The shape of wild-born fish was also different from that of the captive-group, particularly in the depth of the head and the length of the pectoral fins. Finally, captive-bred individuals were, on average, more aggressive than wild-born fish. We demonstrated that this difference was strongly dependent upon the environment as captive-bred fish were more aggressive only when together with their wild conspecifics or with an exotic competitor, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Overall, our results showed that both phenotypic and genetic changes can arise even if genitors share a common brood-stock and after only a few months of rearing in a controlled environment. We conclude that the progeny produced in such supportive breeding programs does not meet the criteria necessary to ensure preserving the genetic and ecological integrity of wild populations.

AB Aim To present a method that assesses the influence of environmental variables, including climate, substrate, topography, and anthropogenic disturbances, on the distribution of Andean forest at the tree line, and to compare this forest distribution between areas.
   Location Sangay National Park, on the eastern slopes of the Andes in central Ecuador.
   Methods A logistic regression model was built using topographical variables and environmental indices, derived from a digital elevation model, to explain forest cover, derived from a Landsat ETM image, in a zone around the average tree line altitude.
   Results The model shows that after altitude, which can explain about 80% of forest cover, wetness has the next strongest effect (areas accumulating water, but also cold air, were devoid of forest, resulting in inverted tree lines), followed by eastness (western slopes had forest to higher altitudes). Application of the model in two nearby areas showed that the real tree line was lower than the predicted tree line in both areas, probably owing mainly to macroclimatic differences in one area, and partly also to human land use in the other. The locations with the largest deviations could be the focus of further research concerning human impacts on tree line vegetation.
   Main conclusions The tree line is located at lower altitudes on east-facing slopes, which may be because high levels of radiation are received by east-facing slopes in the clear mornings, resulting in the photoinhibition of tree seedlings in the paramo. In spite of the limitations of the quality and resolution of the remote sensing data, the presented method provides indications for important ecological factors at the tree line. The method also allows the detection of differences in tree line position between areas, which may reflect climatic differences or the location of anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Over recent decades wild rabbit populations have undergone a sharp decline in Spain with consequent negative impact both on a game-based economy, and on the conservation of threatened species that depend on rabbits. We investigated the relationships between rabbit population change and habitat and game management in central-southern Spain. To determine recent rabbit population changes we revisited 60 localities during summer 2002 to repeat surveys previously carried out in 1993. Each survey consisted of 4-km walked transects to record indices of rabbit abundance. The percentage of vegetation cover and of different soil types were also estimated during these transects. In the same areas, the type and intensity of game management practices were obtained by interviewing hunting managers, hunters or gamekeepers. Rabbit populations were stable or increasing only in 26.6% of the studied populations, more commonly in areas with soft soils where warren building is easier for rabbits and where rabbits were an important game species and managed to increase their numbers. Although we could not establish causality, habitat management and predator removal were the main management practices related to rabbit population change. Rabbit scarcity in Spain constitutes a serious problem for conservation, so hunters, researchers and policy makers need to reach a consensus to establish a long-term program to monitor rabbit population trends and share results obtained, especially when intense manage programs are being carried out to improve rabbit abundance.

AB This study is one of the first to show that invasive plant-induced changes in the soil microbial community can negatively impact native plant performance. This greenhouse experiment tested whether soil microbial communities specific to the rhizospheres of an invasive grass (Aegilops triuncialis) and two native plants (Lasthenia californica and Plantago erecta) affected invasive and/or native plant performance. Each of these species were grown in separate pots for 2 months to prime the soils with plant-specific rhizosphere microbial communities. Each plant species was then planted in native- and invasive-primed soil, and effects on plant performance were monitored. At 5 months, differences in microbial biomarker fatty acids between invaded and native soils mirrored previous differences found in field-collected soil. L. californica performance was significantly reduced when grown in invaded soil compared to native soil (flowering date was delayed, aboveground biomass decreased, specific root length increased, and root mass ratio increased). In contrast, P. erecta and A. triuncialis performance were unaffected when grown in invaded vs native soil. These results suggest that in some cases, invasion-induced changes in the soil microbial community may contribute to a positive feedback loop, leading to the increased dominance of invasive species in an ecosystem.

TI Understanding the geographic distributions of apomictic plants: a case
   for a pluralistic approach
SO PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY
LA English
DT Review
AB Asexual organisms usually have larger, and in the Northern Hemisphere, more northern distributions than their sexual relatives. This phenomenon, called geographical parthenogenesis, has been attributed to predispositions in certain taxa, advantages of polyploidy and/or hybrid origin, advantages of uniparental reproduction, introgression of apomixis into sexuals, niche differentiation of clones, and biotic interactions. Here we focus on the role of uniparental reproduction in colonisation, and the importance of different developmental pathways, i.e. autonomous apomixis which does not require pollination and fertilisation of endosperm nuclei for successful seed set, and pseudogamous apomixis which does. A literature survey suggests that geographical parthenogenesis occurs frequently in species with autonomous apomixis, while the correlation with pseudogamy is poorly documented. However, taxonomic patterns (e. g. predominance of Asteraceae) and also methodological bias may influence estimates of frequencies of geographical parthenogenesis. We demonstrate that a flow cytometric seed screen (FCSS) is a powerful method for assessing pseudogamous vs. autonomous apomixis. We show that population genetic studies provide insights into the genetic diversity of apomicts, but do not give strong support for uniparental reproduction being the only explanation of geographical parthenogenesis. Molecular studies help elucidate the evolutionary and biogeographical history of apomictic complexes, and we conclude that multidisciplinary studies are needed to understand fully the phenomenon of geographical parthenogenesis.

AB The node-density effect is an artifact of phylogeny reconstruction that can cause branch lengths to be underestimated in areas of the tree with fewer taxa. Webster, Payne, and Pagel (2003, Science 301:478) introduced a statistical procedure (the "delta" test) to detect this artifact, and here we report the results of computer simulations that examine the test's performance. In a sample of 50,000 random data sets, we find that the delta test detects the artifact in 94.4% of cases in which it is present. When the artifact is not present (n = 10,000 simulated data sets) the test showed a type I error rate of approximately 1.69%, incorrectly reporting the artifact in 169 data sets. Three measures of tree shape or "balance" failed to predict the size of the node-density effect. This may reflect the relative homogeneity of our randomly generated topologies, but emphasizes that nearly any topology can suffer from the artifact, the effect not being confined only to highly unevenly sampled or otherwise imbalanced trees. The ability to screen phylogenies for the node-density artifact is important for phylogenetic inference and for researchers using phylogenetic trees to infer evolutionary processes, including their use in molecular clock dating.

AB Understanding temporal and spatial distribution of surface air temperature (SAT) at the landscape scale is essential in assessing the potential ecological conditions for ecological restoration and in making decisions for regional management in the Qilian mountains, northwest China. Based on the measurement of air temperature, this study developed a linear regression relationship between the monthly mean SAT and elevation and locational/topographic factors. On average over the year, the model had a higher accuracy to predict SAT in the southern Qilian mountainous terrain of the Heihe River Basin. The study also compared the built linear regression model with geostatistical methods (i.e., ordinary kriging, splines and inverse distance weight), generally, the predictions errors obtained by the geostatistical methods were larger than that by regression method. The worst results were produced by spline. It was noteworthy that for several months (i.e. growing seasons) ordinary kriging yielded smaller prediction errors than the linear regression of temperature against elevation and locational/topographic factors did. We selected the OK method to estimate the SAT in the growing seasons, because accurately estimating surface air temperature during the ecologically meaningful time period was very important to model future ecological processes. Modeled SAT increased from northeast to southwest with highest value occurring in the Yinglou gorge, the outlet of Heihe River in the study area. Temporally, highest SAT value, ranging from 9.2 to 18.7 degrees C, appeared in the July, and the lowest SAT value, from 3.3 to 13.3 degrees C, was seen in May. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB The San Pedro River in the southwestern United States retains a natural flood regime and has several reaches with perennial stream flow and shallow ground water. However, much of the river flows intermittently. Urbanization-linked declines in regional ground-water levels have raised concerns over the future status of the riverine ecosystem in some parts of the river, while restoration-linked decreases in agricultural ground-water pumping are expected to increase stream flows in other parts. This study describes the response of the streamside herbaceous vegetation to changes in stream flow permanence. During the early summer dry season, streamside, herbaceous cover and species richness declined continuously across spatial gradients of flow permanence, and composition shifted from hydric to mesic species at sites with more intermittent flow. Hydrologic threshold values were evident for one plant functional group: Schoenoplectus acutus, Juncus torreyi, and other hydric riparian plants declined sharply in cover with loss of perennial stream flow. In contrast, cover of mesic riparian perennials (including Cynodon dactylon, an introduced species) increased at sites with intermittent flow. Patterns of hydric and mesic riparian annuals varied by season: in the early summer dry season their cover declined continuously as flow became more intermittent, while in the late summer wet season their cover increased as the flow became more intermittent. Periodic drought at the intermittent sites may increase opportunities for establishment of these annuals during the monsoonal flood season. During the late summer flood season. stream flow was present at most sites, and fewer vegetation traits were correlated with flow permanence; cover and richness were correlated with other environmental factors including site elevation and substrate nitrate level and particle size. Although perennial-flow and intermittent-flow sites support different streamside plant communities, all of the plant functional groups are abundant at perennial-flow sites when viewing the ecosystem at broader spatial and temporal scales: mesic riparian perennials are common in the floodplain zone adjacent to the river channel and late-summer hydric and mesic annuals are periodically abundant after large floods.

AB Isoenzyme-based studies have identified 3 taxa/species/'phylogenetic complexes' as agents of visceral leishmaniasis in Sudan: L. donovani, L. infantum and "L. archibaldi". However, these observations remain controversial. A new chitinase gene phylogeny was constructed in which stocks of all 3 putative species isolated in Sudan formed a monophyletic clade. In order to construct a more robust classification of the L. donovani complex, a panel of 16 microsatellite markers was used to describe 39 stocks of these 3 species. All "L. donovani complex" stocks from Sudan were again found to form a single monophyletic clade. L. donovani ss stocks from India and Kenya were found to form 2 region-specific clades. The partial sequence of the glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) gene of 17 L. donovani complex stocks was obtained. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the GOT gene appeared to underlie the isoenzyme classification. It was concluded that isoenzyme-based identification is unsafe for stocks isolated in L. donovani endemic areas and identified as L. infantum. It was also concluded that the name L. archibaldi is invalid and that only a single visceralizing species, Leishmania donovani, is found in East Africa.

AB We sequenced 704 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control-region nucleotides and genotyped 11 autosomal microsatellites (STR) in 617 European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) samples, aiming to infer the species' phylogeographical structure. The mtDNA sequences were split in three distinct haplogroups, respectively, named: Clade West, sampled mainly in Iberia; Clade East, sampled mainly in Greece and in the Balkans; and Clade Central, which was widespread throughout Europe, including the eastern countries and Iberia, but not Greece. These clades might have originated in distinct Iberian and Balkanic refuges during the penultimate or the last glaciations. Clades East and West contributed little to the current postglacial mtDNA diversity in central Europe, which apparently was recolonized mainly by haplotypes belonging to Clade Central. A unique subclade within Clade Central grouped all the haplotypes sampled from populations of the Italian subspecies C. c. italicus. In contrast, haplotypes sampled in central and southern Spain joined both Clade Central and Clade West, suggesting that subspecies C. c. garganta has admixed origin. STR data support a genetic distinction of peripheral populations in north Iberia and southern Italy, and show the effects of anthropogenic disturbance in fragmented populations, which were recently reintroduced or restocked and not may be in mutation-drift equilibrium. Roe deer in central Europe are mainly admixed, while peripheral populations in north Portugal, the southern Italian Apennines and Greece represent the remains of refugial populations and should be managed accordingly.

AB A three-step protocol described elsewhere is used to obtain a map of butterfly species density in Portugal on a 50x50 km grid. First, all available faunistic information was compiled and analysed to explore the historic patterns of butterfly sampling in Portugal, and to determine which grid cells are sufficiently prospected to produce reliable estimates of species richness. Then, we relate the estimated species richness scores from these areas to a set of environmental and spatial variables by means of General Linear Models, obtaining a function to extrapolate of species density scores to the rest of Portugal. Finally, the model is validated, results explored and outliers identified and deleted. Any spatial autocorrelation remaining in the residuals is examined. Lastly, model parameters are recalculated in absence of deleted outliers, and the resulting function is used to predict species richness scores throughout mainland Portugal. A highly-predictive function based on some variables previously related to butterfly composition at macro-scale, such as number of sunny days per year, temperature or environmental heterogeneity, was obtained. However, in Portugal those variables are highly spatially structured along a steep latitudinal gradient, leading to difficulty in ascertaining if the latitudinal gradient detected by our analysis is due to macroecological or historic effects. Information on European and Iberian butterfly assemblages and causal processes are discussed in the light of the patterns observed. Then, previous information obtained on Portuguese scarabs is added to identify conservation areas, biogeographically important for both insect groups. Finally, the main drawbacks and advantages of this approach to mapping biodiversity for conservation are discussed briefly.

AB Crenate broomrape is a major constraint for legume production in Mediterranean and East Asian countries. Resistance to this parasitic weed is scarce in many legumes but is common in chickpea germ plasm. A detailed in vitro study has shown that resistance in chickpea is the result of the combination of at least two mechanisms. First, and most importantly, the two chickpea lines studied have been identified with low rates of stimulant production. Once germination is induced by exogenous applications of the synthetic germination stimulant GR24, thus overcoming the primary resistance mechanism in these lines, a second resistance mechanism is apparent. This is evidenced by a darkening of host cell tissue in contact with the broomrape radicle, leading to failure of establishment, which was frequently observed in the chickpea accessions. Anatomical studies have shown that this apparently "hypersensitive" response does not correspond with the death of host cells in contact with the parasite cells but corresponds to blocking and death of the penetration structures of the parasite.

AB Museum specimens from the late 19th and early 20th centuries were surveyed for the single nucleotide polymorphism identified previously and used to diagnose populations of the federally threatened Northeastern Beach Tiger Beetle Cicindela d. dorsalis (Coleoptera: Carabidae). Widespread polymorphism was revealed throughout the historical range of this species, suggesting a relatively recent anthropogenic character fixation event associated with the extinction and fragmentation of populations. Implications for the phylogenetic species criterion and for the reintroduction of individuals to formerly occupied sites are discussed.

AB Microsatellite analysis of the shortfin mako, shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) revealed very weak evidence of population structure. Samples collected from the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific, South Pacific, and Atlantic, and Pacific coasts of South Africa were screened at four microsatellite loci. Multilocus measures of population subdivision were much lower than expected (F-ST = 0.0014, P = 0.1292; R-ST = 0.0029, P = 0.019). Power analysis revealed that the study had a high level of power (>0.995) to detect the magnitude of FST expected based on a previous study of mtDNA and assumptions of equal male and female dispersal. Thus, integrating the results from microsatellite- and mitochondrial-based studies may provide evidence for gender-biased dispersal for the shortfin mako.

AB Giant Galapagos tortoises represent an interesting model for the study of patterns of genetic divergence and adaptive differentiation related to island colonization events. Recent mitochondrial DNA work elucidated the evolutionary history of the species and helped to clarify aspects of nomenclature. We used 10 microsatellite loci to assess levels of genetic divergence among and within island populations. In particular, we described the genetic structure of tortoises on the island of Isabela, where discrimination of different taxa is still subject of debate. Individual island populations were all genetically distinct. The island of Santa Cruz harboured two distinct populations. On Isabela, populations of Volcan Wolf, Darwin and Alcedo were significantly different from each other. On the other hand, Volcan Wolf showed allelic similarity with the island of Santiago. On Southern Isabela, lower genetic divergence was found between Northeast Sierra Negra and Volcan Alcedo, while patterns of gene flow were recorded among tortoises of Cerro Azul and Southeast Sierra Negra. These tortoises have endured heavy exploitation during the last three centuries and recently attracted much concern due to the current number of stochastic and deterministic threats to extant populations. Our study complements previous investigation based on mtDNA diversity and provides further information that may help devising tortoise management plans.

AB The phylogeography of an endangered salmonid, European grayling (Thymallus thymallus), was studied based on analysis of 17 nuclear microsatellite DNA loci. In agreement with earlier mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies, phylogenetic relationships of the populations suggested that northern Europe was colonized from two distinct Pleistocene refugia. Furthermore, microsatellites revealed highly supported grouping of mainland Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, German and Slovenian populations, suggesting that grayling from the northwestern and central Europe have descended from their southern conspecifics. The level of divergence between populations was substantial, even across short geographical distances. Although this was in part due to postglacial colonization patterns and contemporary barriers for gene flow, the high divergence estimates between hydrologically connected sampling locations implied efficient interpopulation reproductive isolation. Microsatellites revealed that the populations exhibited, on average, only 3.5 (+/-2.2) alleles per locus, indicating that T. thymallus has strikingly low levels of intrapopulation genetic diversity as compared with other freshwater fish species. Accordingly, as indicated by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), only 49.1-58.0% of the total grayling microsatellite diversity resided within populations. A latitudinal genetic diversity gradient, potentially resulting from glaciation-mediated founder events, was not evident. Alternatively, it is possible that grayling display limited dispersal behaviour/capability, leading to low long-term effective population sizes and, consequently, depauperate intrapopulation polymorphism, These findings have implications for conservation of T. thymallus. Importantly, they exemplify that microsatellites can be highly informative for intraspecific phylogeography studies dealing with substantial divergence scales.

AB The deleterious effects of inbreeding have long been known, and inbreeding can increase the risk of extinction for local populations in metapopulations. However, other consequences of inbreeding in metapopulations are still not well understood. Here we show the presence of strong inbreeding depression in a rockpool metapopulation of the planktonic freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna, which reproduces by cyclical parthenogenesis. We conducted three experiments in real and artificial rockpools to quantify component,,; of inbreeding depression in the presence and the absence of competition between clonal lines of selfed and outcrossed genotypes. In replicated asexual populations, we recorded strong selection against clones produced by selling in competition with clones produced by outcrossing. In contrast, inbreeding depression was much weaker in single-clone populations, that is, in the absence of competition between inbred and outbred clones. The finding of a competitive advantage of the outbred genotypes in this metapopulation suggests that if rockpool populations arc inbred, hybrid offspring resulting from crosses between immigrants and local genotypes might have a strong selective advantage. This would increase the effective gene flow in the metapopulation. However, the finding of low inbreeding depression in the monoclonal populations suggests that inbred and outbred genotypes might have about equal chances of establishing new populations.

Given its invasive success. we hypothesized this species may require less energy and/or use energy more efficiently for biomass construction than co-occurring noninvasive plant species. We measured leaf construction cost (CC), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), and leaf organic nitrogen and carbon content of L salicaria and the five most abundant cooccurring species, Parthenocissus quinquefolia, Erigeron philadelphicus, Asclepias syriaca, Spiraea latifolia, and Solidago graminifolia, along dammed ponds in the Black Rock Forest, Cornwall, New York, USA. Lythrum salicaria. which was highly abundant (2.52 individuals/m(2)), exhibited significantly lower area-based leaf CC (44.47 +/- 4.24 g glucose/m(2) leaf) than relatively less abundant species, suggesting energetics may influence its invasive success. Conversely, least abundant Solidago graminifolia (0.67 individuals/m(2)) exhibited the significantly highest leaf CC per unit leaf area (141.87 +/- 39.21 g glucose/m(2) leaf). Overall, a negative correlation between species abundance and area-based leaf CC (r(2) = 0.73) indicated low energy requirements and/or high energy efficiency may influence relative abundance in the plant species studied. As it correlates with species abundance in this study, CC may be a useful tool for evaluating invasive potential.

AB Highly variable loci can provide insight into the recognition of species, evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) and management units (MUs). In general, the ESU and MU categories are thought to be reflective of adaptive differences between them. Here we examine this premise by presenting a comprehensive examination of genetic variation for both microsatellite loci and a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, thought to be of adaptive significance, in the endangered Sonoran topminnow. The extent of variation for the microsatellite loci and the MHC gene within the 13 populations of the Gila topminnow is highly correlated, suggesting that nonselective factors have played an important role in influencing variation within and between populations for the MHC locus. Therefore, using all of these loci, we found that the eight natural populations of the Gila topminnow fell into two different ESUs, one of which had four different MUs. The source of the Boyce Thompson sample, a population that was used extensively for restocking, appeared to be Monkey Spring. The source of the Watson Wash population also appeared to be Monkey Spring (or Boyce Thompson). The newly colonized Santa Cruz River population, which had the most genetic variation of any Gila topminnow population, appeared to descend primarily from Sonoita Creek populations. The Yaqui topminnow, presently considered another subspecies of the Sonoran topminnow, was very distinct for-both microsatellite (only two of 25 alleles found in the Yaqui were in any of the Gila topminnow samples) and MHC alleles (nonoverlapping sets of alleles for the two groups). As a result, it appeared that the taxonomic status of the two subspecies should be re-evaluated and that full species status for Gila and Yaqui topminnows was appropriate. There was evidence for the importance of long-term selection at the MHC locus in the higher rate of nonsynonymous than synonymous substitution. In addition, there appeared to have been a duplication of the MHC locus that was present in most of the fish in six of the natural populations of the Gila topminnow.

AB Partitioning within-species genetic diversity is fundamental to conservation of the bioheritage, current viability, and evolutionary potential of individual taxa. We conducted a hierarchical analysis of genetic diversity in Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) and bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) involving analysis of hybrid zones between Dolly Varden and bull trout, analysis of phylogenetic structure within species across their native ranges using mitochondrial DNA, and a microsatellite DNA survey of population subdivision of bull trout within single watersheds. Our analyses documented hybridization and some introgression between Dolly Varden and bull trout across a geographically widespread zone of secondary contact between the two species. Both species were subdivided into two major mtDNA lineages, and one lineage in Dolly Varden may have arisen through introgression with bull trout. Bull trout have low levels of microsatellite diversity within populations, but there was substantial interpopulation variation in allele frequencies. Allele frequency distributions suggested that recent, severe bottlenecks occur frequently in bull trout populations. Our results illustrate partitioning of genetic variation at distinct levels of biological organization (species, phylogeographic lineages, local populations), and we address how such nested variation is fundamental to conservation of biodiversity.

AB 1. Gas exchange is strongly seasonal in temperate deciduous forests; however, virtually no studies have described measurements made at the leaf scale through the whole growing season. This level of detail is important to understanding processes as substantial differences may occur within the canopy between species and between sun and shade leaves.
   2. Gas exchange was measured weekly throughout the growing season in leaves of Oak (Quercus robur) and Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) trees at Wytham Woods, UK. In Q. robur sun, shade and intermediate leaves were sampled on each occasion.
   3. Acer pseudoplatanus came into leaf before Q. robur and commenced net assimilation (A) earlier. Maximum irradiance saturated photosynthetic rates (A(max)) in Q. robur were reached approximately 50 days after budburst and were maintained until approximately 20 days before abscission. Acer pseudoplatanus lost its leaves before Q. robur in the autumn and showed no seasonal trend in A(max). The lag between budburst and attainment of maximum photosynthetic rate in Q. robur was substantial and represented a quarter of the potential growing season.
   4. A(max) of A. pseudoplatanus (3.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) sun leaves was substantially lower than that of Q. robur (10.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) despite A. pseudoplatanus being a fast-growing species. The earlier flushing of A. pseudoplatanus leaves in the spring could not completely compensate for this. It is likely that other variables, such as total leaf area, are responsible for the high growth rate of A. pseudoplatanus, rather than high photosynthetic rates.
   5. Shade leaves of Q. robur had lower A(max) and mean A than sun leaves; their quantum efficiency was also lower. Consistent with this, sun leaves had a higher nitrogen content per unit area, resulting from a lower specific leaf area (SLA).
   6. Week to week variations in solar radiation influenced A; this could be described by a non-rectangular hyperbola. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) decreased in conditions of high vapour pressure deficit (VPD). However, this did not decrease A as high VPD was associated with high solar radiation and the stimulation of photosynthesis caused by high photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) more than compensated for the reduction by VPD.

AB Spatial patterns of settlement and abundance of older life stages were examined for three species of damselfish in the genus Dascyllus by monitoring natural colonization of standard amounts of initially empty juvenile microhabitat (anemones for D. trimaculatus; branching coral for D. flavicaudus and D. aruanus) transplanted to a series of sites within lagoons of Moorea, French Polynesia. Large spatial differences in larval colonization were observed, which were temporally consistent but different among the species. At the whole-island scale, D. trimaculatus settled primarily on the northern shore, while settlement of the other two species was greatest at the southern end. The three species also showed different patterns of settlement within lagoons: D. aruanus settled mainly nearer to shore, D. flavicaudus primarily on offshore lagoon portions and D. trimaculatus colonized equally across the lagoons. Among sites around the island, the relative abundance of order juveniles after 10 months was a curvilinear function of the relative abundance of settlers for two species (D. trimaculatus and D. flavicaudus). There was no relationship between patterns of settlement and abundance of older juveniles for D. aruanus, although juvenile abundance was inversely related to that of juvenile D. flavicaudus. At the within-lagoon scale, settlement mirrored almost exactly the relative abundance of older lifestages of D. trimaculatus and D. flavicaudus, whereas there was just a qualitative match for D. aruanus. A competition experiment revealed that juvenile D. flavicaudus had a greater effect on population growth of D. aruanus than vice versa, and this mechanism helped explain why the modification of settlement patterns was greatest in D. aruanus. Interspecific variation in abundance of older stages was shaped to differing extents by both patterns of larval delivery and subsequent density-dependent processes involving competition for shelter space.

AB Portions of the large ribosomal subunit RNA gene (28S rDNA) encompassing the D1 and the D7 region were obtained from 16 dipteran species and families to reconstruct early phylogenetic events in the order Diptera. For outgroup comparison, the corresponding sequences were used from representative taxa of the Siphonaptera, Mecoptera, and Lepidoptera. A subset of 488 unambiguously alignable sites was analyzed with respect to important sequence evolution parameters. We found (1) sequence variability is significantly higher in double-stranded sites than in single-stranded sites, (2) transitions are close to saturation in most pairwise sequence comparisons, (3) significant substitution rate heterogeneity exists across sites, and (4) significant substitution rate heterogeneity exists among lineages. Tree reconstruction was carried out with the neighbor joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods. Four major subgroups are consistently and robustly supported: the Brachycera, the Culicomorpha, the Tipulomorpha sensu stricto, and the hitherto controversial Bibionomorpha sensu late, which includes the families Sciaridae, Mycetophilidae, Cecidomyiidae, Bibionidae, Scatopsidae, and Anisopodidae. The phylogenetic relationships within or among these subclades and the positions of the families Psychodidae and Trichoceridae were not robustly resolved. These results support the view that the mouthparts of extant dipteran larvae evolved from a derived sound state characterized by subdivided and obliquely moving mandibles. Furthermore sequence divergence and the paleontological record consistently indicate that a period of rapid cladogenesis gave rise to the major dipteran subgroups.

AB Crops of lupin (Lupinus angustifolius us L. cv. Gungurru) and wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Kulin or Spear) sown close to the break of the season and 3-6 weeks later were grown on a duplex soil at East Beverley, WA, over 3 seasons. The overall aim of the work was to examine the influence of time of sowing on growth and water use of the crops, and this paper reports their growth and yield.
   Early sowing resulted in greater shoot weight of all crops (up to 2.8 t/ha for lupin and 1.7 t/ha for wheat at maturity) and grain yield of lupin, but grain yield of wheat was increased in only 1 of the 3 seasons. The principal effect of the delayed sowing was to reduce the duration of linear growth; the rate of the initial exponential phase was slightly reduced by later serving as was the rate of growth during the linear phase in lupin (by about 1.5 g/m(2) . day) but not in wheat. Late sowing generally reduced both the number of pods/ears per unit area and the number of grains per pod/ear. Doubling the density of sowing in one of the seasons had no effects on the shoot weight and grain yield of lupin with early or late sowing but decreased those of wheat.
   Downward root growth of early-sown crops averaged 5.2 mm/day for lupin and 8.7 mm/day for wheat in the 3 seasons and ceased at about 0.8 m; time of sowing had no effect on these measures. Root weight at flowering was greater in lupin than in wheat crops, and root weight of lupin was about 0.5 of total plant weight during vegetative growth compared with 0.25-0.3 in wheat. Typically, only 5-6% of the root length of both crop species was present in the clay layer at flowering irrespective of sowing time.
   The proportion of radiation intercepted reached a higher maximum value for early-sown crops (about 0.75 in 1991 and 0.90 in 1992) than late-sown crops (about 0.60 in 1991 and 0.8 in 1992). The conversion coefficients of radiation to dry matter were very similar (about 1.8 g/MJ) for both species, but the greater partitioning of dry matter to roots in lupin than wheat meant that conversion coefficients for shoot dry matter were greater in wheat (1.43-1.68 g/MJ) than in lupin (0.93-1.16 g/MJ).
   The results demonstrate that early sowing produced larger crops of both lupin and wheat; this resulted in larger lupin yields, but yield of wheat was affected by disease and drought during grain filling.

AB A big-leaf model of C-3-canopy mass and energy exchange was used to predict hourly CO2 and O-3 uptake by a mixed deciduous Quercus-Acer (oak-maple) stand in central Massachusetts, USA. The model is based on canopy-radiation interactions, leaf mesophyll metabolism (photosynthetic electron transport, carboxylation and oxygenation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate [RuP2] by RuP2 carboxylase/oxygenase [Rubisco], and respiration), physical transport conductances of mass and heat above and within the canopy, conductances of mass at the leaf surface and in the mesophyll, and mass and energy exchange at the soil surface (forest floor). Predictions of hourly CO2 and O-3 uptake were compared to independent whole-forest CO2 and O-3 exchange measurements made by the eddy correlation method during a 68 day period in the summer and early autumn of 1992. Predicted hourly CO2 exchange rate was strongly correlated (r approximate to +0.91) with measured hourly CO2 exchange, but mean day-time predicted whole-forest CO2 uptake was c. 13% (c. 1.13 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) greater than CO2 uptake measured by eddy correlation. The model tended to overpredict CO2 uptake during late afternoon, but was accurate during the rest of the day. Predicted and measured O-3 uptake rates also were positively correlated (r approximate to +0.76). The diurnal patterns of predicted and measured O-3 uptake indicated that stomatal conductance (g(s)) was accurately predicted during the morning, but in the afternoon the model overpredicted g(s). This pattern was consistent with the overprediction of afternoon CO2 uptake, and suggested that a feedback inhibition of photosynthesis occurred in the afternoon. This might have been related to source-sink imbalance following several hours of photosynthesis. On the whole, and in spite of the simplifications inherent in the big-leaf representation of the canopy, the model is useful for predicting forest-environment interactions and for interpreting mass and energy exchange measurements.

AB Assessing the impacts of land use/cover change (LUCC) on the aeolian process is crucial for improving regional ecosystem services and sustainable development. The objective of the study were to 1) examine the spatiotemporal patterns of the soil wind erosion modulus (SWEM) in China from 1990 to 2015, and 2) reveal the contributions of LUCC to SWEM dynamics. The annual SWEM derived by the revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ) was analyzed at regional and sub-regional scales using statistical analysis. The impacts of various LUCCs on SWEM were further assessed in each county. The results showed that the regions that experienced severe wind erosion (SWEM > 50 t/(ha.a)) accounted for 8.91% of all of China. The average SWEM generally decreased by half from 1990 to 2015. Large SWEM differences were found among various land use/cover types. The SWEM from desert was two times or higher than that from sparse grass, cropland, and woodland; moreover, that of dense grass was the lowest in arid/semiarid areas. The conversion of grassland/woodland to cropland and desert expansion during 1990-2000 induced a net increase in total soil wind erosion of approximately 1205 x 10(4)t. With the implementation of ecological projects starting in the early 2000s, woodland/grassland was reconverted from cropland, and the eco-restoration of sparse grass and desert induced a net decrease in wind erosion of 278 x 10(4)t. All these indicated that anthropogenic activities in ecological projects had positive impacts in terms of reducing aeolian erosion intensity. We suggest that ecorestoration should be protected and consolidated in the future. Adaptive management is required to control wind erosion and improve ecosystem services and human wellbeing for people in China. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reducing nitrogen inputs, in particular nitrate, to groundwater is becoming increasingly important to fulfil requirements of the European Water Framework Directive. When developing management plans for mitigation measures at larger scales, complex hydro-biogeochemical models reach their limits due to data availability and spatial discretization. To circumvent this problem, the spatial distribution of nitrate concentration in groundwater is estimated using a parsimonious GIS-based statistical approach. Point nitrate concentrations and spatial environmental data as predictors are used to train statistical models. In order to compile the spatial predictors with the respective monitoring sites, different designs of contributing areas (buffer zones) and their effects on the performance of different statistical models are investigated. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) are compared in terms of the predictive performance of each model according to various objective functions. We determine the most influential spatial predictors used in the respective models. After training the models with a subset of the data, we then predict the spatial nitrate distribution in groundwater for the entire federal state of Hesse, Germany on a 1 x 1 km grid by only the spatial environmental data. The Random Forest model outperforms the other models (R-2 = 0.54), relying on hydrogeological units, the percentage of arable land and the nitrogen balance as the three most influencing predictors based on a 1000 m circular contributing area. The use of exclusively spatial available predictors is a big step forward in the prediction of nitrate in groundwater on regional scale. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: As increasingly fragmented and isolated populations of threatened species become subjected to climate change, invasive species and other stressors, there is an urgent need to consider adaptive potential when making conservation decisions rather than focussing on past processes. In many cases, populations identified as unique and currently managed separately suffer increased risk of extinction through demographic and genetic processes. Other populations currently not at risk are likely to be on a trajectory where declines in population size and fitness soon appear inevitable.
   Results: Using datasets from natural Australian mammal populations, we show that drift processes are likely to be driving uniqueness in populations of many threatened species as a result of small population size and fragmentation. Conserving and managing such remnant populations separately will therefore often decrease their adaptive potential and increase species extinction risk.
   Conclusions: These results highlight the need for a paradigm shift in conservation biology practise; strategies need to focus on the preservation of genetic diversity at the species level, rather than population, subspecies or evolutionary significant unit. The introduction of new genetic variants into populations through in situ translocation needs to be considered more broadly in conservation programs as a way of decreasing extinction risk by increasing neutral genetic diversity which may increase the adaptive potential of populations if adaptive variation is also increased.

AB Anthropogenic activities are substantially changing coastal wetland ecosystems globally. In developing countries such as China, a number of anthropogenic factors associated with rapid population growth and economic development threaten coastal wetlands. In China, notably, coastal wetlands have been increasingly lost to reclamations that are widely adopted to meet the increasing demand for land under rapid economic development. Coastal wetland management requires understanding the patterns of and the mechanisms underlying such human impacts. In this special issue, we synthesize current understanding of environmental changes and human impacts on China' coastal wetlands, focusing on reclamation. Coastal human activities in China are found to change shoreline evolution and wetland hydrology, to deteriorate soil and water quality, to alter vegetation succession, benthic animal and microbial communities, and fisheries, and to impair ecosystem functioning and services. For some of those impacts, new models and indices are developed or applied. We also outline key research areas that should be further studied for effective management of coastal wetlands and successful wetland restoration. We suggest that developing a multi-objective, multi-scenario, and multi-scale framework of integrated management will be crucial to the success of China's coastal wetland conservation with increasing human dominance of the nation's coasts.

AB Linking fecal indicator bacteria concentrations in large mixed-use watersheds back to diffuse human sources, such as septic systems, has met limited success. In this study, 64 rivers that drain 84% of Michigan's Lower Peninsula were sampled under baseflow conditions for Escherichia coli, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (a human source-tracking marker), landscape characteristics, and geochemical and hydrologic variables. E. coli and B. thetaiotaomicron were routinely detected in sampled rivers and an E. coli reference level was defined (1.4 log(10) most probable number.100mL(-1)). Using classification and regression tree analysis and demographic estimates of wastewater treatments per watershed, septic systems seem to be the primary driver of fecal bacteria levels. In particular, watersheds with more than 1,621 septic systems exhibited significantly higher concentrations of B. thetaiotaomicron. This information is vital for evaluating water quality and health implications, determining the impacts of septic systems on watersheds, and improving management decisions for locating, constructing, and maintaining on-site wastewater treatment systems.

AB This study sought to identify climate-change thermal-stress refugia for reef corals in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. A species distribution modeling approach was used to identify refugia for 12 coral species that differed considerably in their local response to thermal stress. We hypothesized that the local response of coral species to thermal stress might be similarly reflected as a regional response to climate change. We assessed the contemporary geographic range of each species and determined their temperature and irradiance preferences using a k-fold algorithm to randomly select training and evaluation sites. That information was applied to downscaled outputs of global climate models to predict where each species is likely to exist by the year 2100. Our model was run with and without a 1 degrees C capacity to adapt to the rising ocean temperature. The results show a positive exponential relationship between the current area of habitat that coral species occupy and the predicted area of habitat that they will occupy by 2100. There was considerable decoupling between scales of response, however, and with further ocean warming some winners' at local scales will likely become losers' at regional scales. We predicted that nine of the 12 species examined will lose 24-50% of their current habitat. Most reductions are predicted to occur between the latitudes 5-15 degrees, in both hemispheres. Yet when we modeled a 1 degrees C capacity to adapt, two ubiquitous species, Acropora hyacinthus and Acropora digitifera, were predicted to retain much of their current habitat. By contrast, the thermally tolerant Porites lobata is expected to increase its current distribution by 14%, particularly southward along the east and west coasts of Australia. Five areas were identified as Indian Ocean refugia, and seven areas were identified as Pacific Ocean refugia for reef corals under climate change. All 12 of these reef-coral refugia deserve high-conservation status.

AB Reciprocal interaction between plant and soil (plant-soil feedback, PSF) can determine plant community structure. Understanding which traits control interspecific variation of PSF strength is crucial for plant ecology. Studies have highlighted either plant-mediated nutrient cycling (litter-mediated PSF) or plant-microbe interaction (microbial-mediated PSF) as important PSF mechanisms, each attributing PSF variation to different traits. However, this separation neglects the complex indirect interactions between the two mechanisms. We developed a model coupling litter- and microbial-mediated PSFs to identify the relative importance of traits in controlling PSF strength, and its dependency on the composition of root-associated microbes (i.e. pathogens and/or mycorrhizal fungi). Results showed that although plant carbon: nitrogen (C:N) ratio and microbial nutrient acquisition traits were consistently important, the importance of litter decomposability varied. Litter decomposability was not a major PSF determinant when pathogens are present. However, its importance increased with the relative abundance of mycorrhizal fungi as nutrient released from the mycorrhizal-enhanced litter production to the nutrient-depleted soils result in synergistic increase of soil nutrient and mycorrhizal abundance. Data compiled from empirical studies also supported our predictions. We propose that the importance of litter decomposability depends on the composition of root-associated microbes. Our results provide new perspectives in plant invasion and trait-based ecology.

AB The potential of using maximum entropy modeling for landslide susceptibility mapping is investigated in this paper. Although the maximum entropy model has been applied widely to species distribution modeling in ecology, its applicability to other kinds of predictive modeling such as landslide susceptibility mapping has not yet been investigated fully. In the present case study of Boeun in Korea, multiple environmental factors including continuous and categorical data were used as inputs for maximum entropy modeling. From the optimal setting test based on cross-validation, the effective feature type for continuous data representation was found to be a hinge feature and its combination with categorical data showed the best predictive performance. Factor contribution analysis indicated that distances from lineaments and slope layers were the most influential factors. From interpretations on a response curve, steeply sloping and weathered areas that consisted of excessively drained granite residuum soils were very susceptible to landslides. Predictive performance of maximum entropy modeling was slightly better than that of a logistic regression model which has been used widely to assess landslide susceptibility. Therefore, maximum entropy modeling is shown to be an effective prediction model for landslide susceptibility mapping.

AB Direct gradient analyses in spatial genetics provide unique opportunities to describe the inherent complexity of genetic variation in wildlife species and are the object of many methodological developments. However, multicollinearity among explanatory variables is a systemic issue in multivariate regression analyses and is likely to cause serious difficulties in properly interpreting results of direct gradient analyses, with the risk of erroneous conclusions, misdirected research and inefficient or counterproductive conservation measures. Using simulated data sets along with linear and logistic regressions on distance matrices, we illustrate how commonality analysis (CA), a detailed variance-partitioning procedure that was recently introduced in the field of ecology, can be used to deal with nonindependence among spatial predictors. By decomposing model fit indices into unique and common (or shared) variance components, CA allows identifying the location and magnitude of multicollinearity, revealing spurious correlations and thus thoroughly improving the interpretation of multivariate regressions. Despite a few inherent limitations, especially in the case of resistance model optimization, this review highlights the great potential of CA to account for complex multicollinearity patterns in spatial genetics and identifies future applications and lines of research. We strongly urge spatial geneticists to systematically investigate commonalities when performing direct gradient analyses.

AB Why are marine species where they are? The scientific community is faced with an urgent need to understand aquatic ecosystem dynamics in the context of global change. This requires development of scientific tools with the capability to predict how biodiversity, natural resources, and ecosystem services will change in response to stressors such as climate change and further expansion of fishing. Species distribution models and ecosystem models are two methodologies that are being developed to further this understanding. To date, these methodologies offer limited capabilities to work jointly to produce integrated assessments that take both food web dynamics and spatial-temporal environmental variability into account. We here present a new habitat capacity model as an implementation of the spatial-temporal model Ecospace of the Ecopath with Ecosim approach. The new model offers the ability to drive foraging capacity of species from the cumulative impacts of multiple physical, oceanographic, and environmental factors such as depth, bottom type, temperature, salinity, oxygen concentrations, and so on. We use a simulation modeling procedure to evaluate sampling characteristics of the new habitat capacity model. This development bridges the gap between envelope environmental models and classic ecosystem food web models, progressing toward the ability to predict changes in marine ecosystems under scenarios of global change and explicitly taking food web direct and indirect interactions into account.

AB AimSpecies distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used to address numerous questions in ecology, biogeography, conservation biology and evolution. Surprisingly, the crucial step of selecting the most relevant variables has received little attention, despite its direct implications for model transferability and uncertainty. Here, we aim to address this with a continent-wide, evaluation of which climate predictors provided the most accurate SDMs for bird distributions.
   LocationConterminous United States.
   MethodsFor 243 species, we used yearly data since 1971 (from the North American Breeding Bird Survey) to run SDMs (six different algorithms) with combinations of six relatively uncorrelated climate predictors (selected from 22 widely used climate variables). We then estimated the importance of each predictor - both spatially and over a 40-year time period - by comparing the accuracy of the model obtained with or without a given predictor.
   ResultsThree temperature-related variables (annual potential evapotranspiration, mean annual temperature and growing degree days) produced significantly more accurate SDMs than any other predictors. Among precipitation predictors, annual precipitation provided the most accurate results. Albeit only rarely used in SDMs, the moisture index performed similarly strongly. Interestingly, predictors that summarize average annual climate produced more accurate distributions than seasonal predictors, despite distinct seasonal movements in most species considered. Encouragingly, spatial and temporal (over 40years) evaluation of variables yielded very similar results.
   Main conclusionsThe approach presented here allowed us to identify the statistically most relevant predictors for birds in the USA and can be applied to other taxa and/or in different parts of the world. Appropriately selecting the most relevant predictors of species distributions at large spatial scale is vital to identifying ecologically meaningful relationships that provide the most accurate predictions under climate change or biological invasions.

AB Both arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and root hairs play important roles in plant uptake of water and mineral nutrients. To reveal the relative importance of mycorrhiza and root hairs in plant water relations, a bald root barley (brb) mutant and its wild type (wt) were grown with or without inoculation of the AM fungus Rhizophagus intraradices under well-watered or drought conditions, and plant physiological traits relevant to drought stress resistance were recorded. The experimental results indicated that the AM fungus could almost compensate for the absence of root hairs under drought-stressed conditions. Moreover, phosphorus (P) concentration, leaf water potential, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency were significantly increased by R. intraradices but not by root hairs, except for shoot P concentration and photosynthetic rate under the drought condition. Root hairs even significantly decreased root P concentration under drought stresses. These results confirm that AM fungi can enhance plant drought tolerance by improvement of P uptake and plant water relations, which subsequently promote plant photosynthetic performance and growth, while root hairs presumably contribute to the improvement of plant growth and photosynthetic capacity through an increase in shoot P concentration.

AB Understanding of the role of body mass in structural-functional relationships is pressing, particularly because species losses often occur non-randomly with respect to body size. Our study examined the effects of dung beetle body mass on dung removal at two levels. First, we used the lab experiment to evaluate the efficiency of eight dung beetle species belonging to two functional groups (tunnelers, dwellers) on dung removal. Second, the same species employed in the lab were used in field mesocosms to examine the effects of the two functional groups on dung removal maintaining realistic differences in the total body mass between tunneler and dweller assemblages. Furthermore, the experimental assemblages contained one and four species within each functional group, so the effect of body mass heterogeneity was examined. We used a statistical approach (offset method) which took into account a priori constraints due to the study design allowing us to analyse the effect of larger species in mesocosm style experiments. Body size played a crucial role in dung removal: large beetles were more efficient than small ones and the percentage of removed dung increased with higher body mass heterogeneity. Tunnelers were more efficient than dwellers over both short and long time periods (one month and one year). Significant effects of dwellers were found only after one year. Moreover, our study showed that not including the body mass as an offset in the model resulted in sometimes different results, as the offset expresses dung removal independently of the body mass. This approach confirmed that body size is likely a pivotal factor controlling dung removal efficiency at multiple levels, from single species to overall dung beetle assemblages. Even though other specific traits should be examined, this study has begun to address the consequences of losing individuals with specific traits that are especially sensitive to perturbations.

AB The persistence of sexual reproduction in the face of competition from asexual invaders is more likely if asexual lineages are produced infrequently or have low fitness. The generation rate and success of new asexual lineages will be influenced by the proximate mechanisms underlying transitions to asexuality. As such, characterization of these mechanisms can help explain the distribution of reproductive modes among natural populations. Here, we synthesize the literature addressing proximate causes of transitions from sexual to asexual reproduction in plants and animals. In cyclical and facultatively asexual taxa, individual mutations can cause obligate asexuality. The evolution of asexuality in obligately sexual groups is more complex, requiring the simultaneous acquisition of two traits generally controlled by different genetic factors: unreduced gamete formation and spontaneous development of unfertilized gametes. At least three pre-adaptations' could favour transitions to obligate asexuality in obligate sexuals. First, linkage among loci affecting separate key components of asexuality facilitates its spread, with evidence for these linkage blocks in plants. Second, asexuality should evolve more readily in haplodiploids; support for this hypothesis comes from two examples where a single locus causes transitions to asexuality. Third, standing genetic variation for the production of unreduced gametes could facilitate transitions to asexuality, but whether the ability to produce unreduced gametes contributes to the evolution of obligate asexuality remains unclear. We close by reviewing the associations between asexuality, hybridization and polyploidy, and argue that current data suggest that hybridization is more likely to play a causal role in transitions to asexuality than polyploidy.

AB To ensure sustainable agricultural water use in water shortage regions, practices of deficit irrigation should be adopted. This study investigated the performance of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under limited water supply from 2005 to 2011, a six-season field test on the North China Plain. The test was comprised of four treatments: rain-fed, single irrigation applied at sowing to obtain a good level of soil moisture at the start of crop growth (I1s), single irrigation applied during recovery to jointing (I1r), and full irrigation supplied as three irrigations (control, I3). The results showed that grain yield was significantly correlated with rainfall before heading and with evapotranspiration (ET) after heading (P < 0.01) under rain-fed conditions. The average contribution of soil water stored before sowing to seasonal ET was 90, 103, and 145 mm for rain-fed, I1s, and I1r, respectively, during the six seasons. A smaller root length density (RLD), which restricted utilization of deep soil water by the crop, was one of the reasons for the lower yield with rain-fed and I1s treatments compared with the I1r treatment in dry seasons. The results also showed that the limited irrigation applied from recovery to jointing stage (Treatment I1r) significantly promoted vegetative growth and more efficient soil water use during the reproductive (post-heading) stage, resulting in a 21.6 % yield increase compared with that of the I1s treatment. And although the average yield of the I1r treatment was 14 % lower than that of the full irrigation treatment, seasonal irrigation was reduced by 120-140 mm. With smaller penalties in yield and a larger reduction in applied irrigation, I1r could be considered a feasible irrigation practice that could be used in the NCP for conservation of groundwater resources.

AB The present overview paper reviews knowledge on plant metabolism under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (e[CO2]) with regard to underpinning options for the management of crop production systems and the selection of crop traits beneficial for future conditions.
   Better understanding of intra-specific variability in responses to e[CO2] is of great importance to breed or select best possible genotypes for future conditions. Yield increases per 100 mu L-1 increase in [CO2] varied between none and over 30% among varieties of important crops. Carbon source-sink relationships are believed to play a major role in determining the ability of a plant to utilise e[CO2] and avoid downward acclimation of photosynthesis upon prolonged e[CO2] exposure. Corresponding traits (e.g. tillering capacity, stem carbohydrate storage capacity, or seed size and numbers) are currently under investigation in Free Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) facilities, such as AGFACE (Australian Grains FACE).
   The stimulatory effect of e[CO2] on plant growth is dependent on adequate nutrient supply. For example, N concentrations in plant tissues generally decrease under e[CO2], which in leaves is commonly related to a decrease in Rubisco concentration and activity, and therefore linked to photosynthetic downward acclimation. This effect is also of direct concern for food production where decreased N and protein content can have negative effects on product quality (e.g. grain protein). Plant nutrient metabolism appears to adjust to a new physiological equilibrium under e[CO2] which limits the extent to which nutrient application can ameliorate the situation. What the control points are for an adjustment of plant N metabolism is unclear. Rubisco metabolism in leaves, N assimilation, N translocation or N uptake are all potential key steps that may be inhibited or downregulated under e[CO2]. To achieve the best possible growth response whilst maintaining product quality, it is important to understand plant nutrient metabolism under e[CO2].
   Comparatively little is known about mechanisms of potential changes in plant stress tolerance under e[CO2]. Defence metabolites such as antioxidants are, in part, directly linked to primary carbohydrate mechanism and so potentially impacted by e[CO2]. It is unknown whether photoprotective and antioxidative defence systems, key to plant stress tolerance, will be affected, and if so, whether the response will be strengthened or weakened by e[CO2]. Better understanding of underlying principles is particularly important because it is virtually impossible to test all possible stress factor combinations with e[CO2] in realistic field settings.

AB Models of species distributions are increasingly being used to address a variety of problems in conservation biology. In many applications, perfect or constant detectability of species, given presence, is assumed. While this problem has been acknowledged and addressed through the development of occupancy models, we still know little regarding whether addressing the potential for imperfect detection improves the predictive performance of species distribution models in nature. Here, we contrast logistic regression models of species occurrence that do not correct for detectability to hierarchical occupancy models that explicitly estimate and adjust for detectability, and maximum entropy models that attempt to circumvent the detectability problem by using data from known presence locations only. We use a large-scale, long-term monitoring database across western Montana and northern Idaho to contrast these models for nine landbird species that cover a broad spectrum in detectability. Overall, occupancy models were similar to or better than other approaches in terms of predictive accuracy, as measured by the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and Kappa, with maximum entropy tending to provide the lowest predictive accuracy. Models varied in the types of errors associated with predictions, such that some model approaches may be preferred over others in certain situations. As expected, predictive performance varied across a gradient in species detectability, with logistic regression providing lower relative performance for less detectable species and Maxent providing lower performance for highly detectable species. We conclude by discussing the advantages and limitations to each approach for developing large-scale species distribution models.

AB Human impacts through habitat destruction, introduction of invasive species and climate change are increasing the number of species threatened with extinction. Decreases in population size simultaneously lead to reductions in genetic diversity, ultimately reducing the ability of populations to adapt to a changing environment. In this way, loss of genetic polymorphism is linked with extinction risk. Recent advances in sequencing technologies mean that obtaining measures of genetic diversity at functionally important genes is within reach for conservation programs. A key region of the genome that should be targeted for population genetic studies is the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). MHC genes, found in all jawed vertebrates, are the most polymorphic genes in vertebrate genomes. They play key roles in immune function via immune-recognition and -surveillance and host-parasite interaction. Therefore, measuring levels of polymorphism at these genes can provide indirect measures of the immunological fitness of populations. The MHC has also been linked with mate-choice and pregnancy outcomes and has application for improving mating success in captive breeding programs. The recent discovery that genetic diversity at MHC genes may protect against the spread of contagious cancers provides an added impetus for managing and protecting MHC diversity in wild populations. Here we review the field and focus on the successful applications of MHC-typing for conservation management. We emphasize the importance of using MHC markers when planning and executing wildlife rescue and conservation programs but stress that this should not be done to the detriment of genome-wide diversity.

AB Cattle, sheep and goats were domesticated about 10,000 years ago, spread out of the domestication centers in Europe, Asia, and Africa during the next few thousands years, and gave many populations locally adapted. After a very long period of soft selection, the situation changed dramatically 200 years ago with the emergence of the breed concept. The selection pressure strongly increased, and the reproduction among breeds was seriously reduced, leading to the fragmentation of the initial gene pool. More recently, the selection pressure was increased again via the use of artificial insemination, leading to a few industrial breeds with very high performances, but with low effective population sizes. Beside this performance improvement of industrial breeds, genetic resources are being lost, because of the replacement of traditional breeds by high performance industrial breeds at the worldwide level, and because of the loss of genetic diversity in these industrial breeds. Many breeds are already extinct, and genetic resources in cattle, sheep, and goats are thus highly endangered, particularly in developed countries. The recent development of next generation sequencing technologies opens new avenues for properly characterizing the genetic resources, not only in the very diverse domestic breeds, but also in their wild relatives. Based on sound genetic characterization, urgent conservation measures must be taken to avoid an irremediable loss of farm animal genetic resources, integrating economical, sociological, and political parameters.

AB Mediterranean streams are characterized by water flow changes caused by floods and droughts. When intermittency occurs in river ecosystems, hydrologic connectivity is interrupted and this affects benthic, hyporheic and flowing water compartments. Organic matter use and transport can be particularly affected during the transition from wet to dry and dry to wet conditions. In order to characterize the changes in benthic organic matter quantity and quality throughout a drying and rewetting process, organic matter, and enzyme activities were analyzed in the benthic accumulated material (biofilms growing on rocks and cobbles, leaves, and sand) and in flowing water (dissolved and particulate fractions). The total polysaccharide, amino acid, and lipid content in the benthic organic matter were on average higher in the drying period than in the rewetting period. However, during the drying period, peptide availability decreased, as indicated by decreases in leucine aminopeptidase activity, as well as amino acid content in the water and benthic material, except leaves; while polysaccharides were actively used, as indicated by an increase in beta-glucosidase activity in the benthic substrata and an increase in polysaccharide content of the particulate water fraction and in leaf material. During this process, microbial heterotrophs were constrained to use the organic matter source of the lowest quality (polysaccharides, providing only C), since peptides (providing N and C) were no longer available. During the flow recovery phase, the microbial community rapidly recovered, suggesting the use of refuges and/or adaptation to desiccation during the previous drought period. The scouring during rewetting was responsible for the mobilization of the streambed and loss of benthic material, and the increase in high quality organic matter in transport (at that moment, polysaccharides and amino acids accounted for 30% of the total DOC). The dynamics of progressive and gradual drought effects, as well as the fast recovery after rewetting, might be affected by the interaction of the individual dynamics of each benthic substratum: sand sediments and leaves providing refuge for microorganisms and organic matter storage, while on cobbles, an active bacterial community is developed in the rewetting. Since global climate change may favor a higher intensity and frequency of droughts in streams, understanding the effects of these disturbances on the materials and biota could contribute to reliable resource management. The maintenance of benthic substrata heterogeneity within the stream may be important for stream recovery after droughts.

AB Tasmanian reef communities within "no-take" marine protected areas (MPAs) exhibited direct and indirect ecological changes that increasingly manifested over 16 years, eventually transforming into communities not otherwise present in the regional seascape. Data from 14 temperate and subtropical Australian MPAs further demonstrated that ecological changes continue to develop in MPAs over at least two decades, probably much longer. The continent-scale study additionally showed recently established MPAs to be consistently located at sites with low resource value relative to adjacent. shed reference areas. This outcome was presumably generated by sociopolitical pressures and planning processes that aim to systematically avoid locations with valuable resources, potentially compromising biodiversity conservation goals. Locations that were formerly highly. shed are needed within MPA networks if the networks are to achieve conservation aims associated with (1) safeguarding all regional habitat types, (2) protecting threatened habitats and species, and (3) providing appropriate reference benchmarks for assessing impacts of fishing. Because of long time lags, the ubiquity of fishing impacts, and the relatively recent establishment of MPAs, the full impact of fishing on coastal reefs has yet to be empirically assessed.

AB Current predictions regarding the ecological consequences of climate change on animal populations are generally autecological and species-specific, and/or non-mechanistic extrapolations of recent short-term patterns. To better understand and predict the effects of climate change on the distribution of species and the abundance of populations we offer a novel, broad theoretical framework. Climate-induced changes in trophic structure may actually be more predictable than effects on individual species. The logic is that there are general differences in climatic sensitivity among trophic levels - specifically, that as one moves up trophic levels, there is an increase in the temperature sensitivity of vital rates. More precisely, we provide: (1) a formal mathematical definition of distribution limits that is both operational and conceptual, introducing the concept DL50, defined as the geographic and climatic isoline representing an equilibrium occupancy of half of the suitable habitats; (2) a matrix of the possible changes in trophic structure from climate change and the general theoretical consequences; and (3) a new idea that predicts broad effects of climatic warming on trophic systems. Our intention is to help meet the challenge of developing and testing general theoretical models that can predict which species will be winners and losers in ecological time, which evolutionary traits will be favoured or selected against, and what will be consequences for ecosystem structure and function.

AB Historical photographs document that during the last century, forests have expanded upwards by 60-80 m into former tundra of the pristine Ural mountains. We assessed how the shift of the high-altitude treeline ecotone might affect soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. On the gentle slopes of Mali Iremel in the Southern Urals, we (1) determined the differences in SOM stocks and properties from the tundra at 1360 m above sea level (a.s.l.) to the subalpine forest at 1260 m a.s.l., and (2) measured carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization from tundra and forest soils at 7 and 20 degrees C in a 6-month incubation experiment. C stocks of organic layers were 3.6 +/- 0.3 kg C m(-2) in the tundra and 1.9 +/- 0.2 kg C m(-2) in the forest. Mineral soils down to the bedrock stored significantly more C in the forest, and thus, total soil C stocks were slightly but insignificantly greater in the forest (+3 kg C m(-2)). Assuming a space for time approach based on tree ages suggests that the soil C sink due to the forest expansion during the last century was at most 30 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Diffuse reflective infrared spectroscopy and scanning calorimetry revealed that SOM under forest was less humified in both organic and mineral horizons and, therefore, contained more available substrate. Consistent with this result, C mineralization rates of organic layers and A horizons of the forest were two to four times greater than those of tundra soils. This difference was similar in magnitude to the effect of increasing the incubation temperature from 7 to 20 degrees C. Hence, indirect climate change effects through an upward expansion of forests can be much larger than direct warming effects (Delta 0.3 K across the treeline). Net N mineralization was 2.5 to six times greater in forest than in tundra soils, suggesting that an advancing treeline likely increases N availability. This may provide a nutritional basis for the fivefold increase in plant biomass and a tripling in productivity from the tundra to the forest. In summary, our results suggest that an upward expansion of forest has small net effects on C storage in soils but leads to changes in SOM quality, accelerates C cycling and increases net N mineralization, which in turn might stimulate plant growth and thus C sequestration in tree biomass.

AB As ribulose 1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activity limits light-saturated photosynthesis under present atmospheric condition, the effects of an overexpression of RBCSon Rubisco content and photosynthesis were examined in the leaves at different positions in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Rubisco content in the transformant was significantly greater in the uppermost, fully expanded leaves but decreased to levels similar to those in wild-type plants in the lower leaves. The mRNA levels of total RBCS and rbcL in these leaves were much less than those in the expanding leaves, where Rubisco synthesis is active, suggesting commensurately low level of synthesis. Although the activation state of Rubisco was lower in the uppermost, fully expanded leaves of the transformant, it recovered to its full level in the lower leaves. As a result, the photosynthetic rate did not differ in leaves at the same position between the transformant and the wild type. Similarly, whole plant biomass did not differ between these genotypes. Thus, we conclude that although the overexpression of RBCS led to an enhancement of Rubisco protein content in the uppermost, fully expanded leaves, it does not result in increased photosynthetic rates or plant biomass, because of an apparent down-regulation in its activation state.

AB Some plant species show constant rates of respiration and photosynthesis measured at their respective growth temperatures (temperature homeostasis), whereas others do not. However, it is unclear what species show such temperature homeostasis and what factors affect the temperature homeostasis. To analyze the inherent ability of plants to acclimate respiration and photosynthesis to different growth temperatures, we examined 11 herbace-ous crops with different cold tolerance. Leaf respiration (R(area)) and photosynthetic rate (P(area)) under high light at 360l l(1) CO(2) concentrations were measured in plants grown at 15 and 30C. Cold-tolerant species showed a greater extent of temperature homeostasis of both R(area) and P(area) than cold-sensitive species. The underlying mechanisms which caused differences in the extent of temperature homeostasis were examined. The extent of temperature homeostasis of P(area) was not determined by differences in leaf mass and nitrogen content per leaf area, but by differences in photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE). Moreover, differences in PNUE were due to differences in the maximum catalytic rate of Rubisco, Rubisco contents and amounts of nitrogen invested in Rubisco. These findings indicated that the temperature homeostasis of photosynthesis was regulated by various parameters. On the other hand, the extent of temperature homeostasis of R(area) was unrelated to the maximum activity of the respiratory enzyme (NAD-malic enzyme). The R(area)P(area) ratio was maintained irrespective of the growth temperatures in all the species, suggesting that the extent of temperature homeostasis of R(area) interacted with the photosynthetic rate andor the homeostasis of photosynthesis.

AB The species composition of benthic diatoms was related to environmental conditions in streams throughout the western US to develop diatom traits, indicators for assessment of biological condition and indicators for diagnosing stressors. We hypothesized that indicators based on species traits determined for subsets of streams with similar natural landscape features would be more precisely related to environmental conditions than would be indicators calculated based on species traits for all Streams in the data set. The ranges of many environmental conditions were wide among western streams, and these conditions covaried greatly along a major environmental gradient characterized by positive correlations among % watershed disturbed by agricultural and urban land uses (% WD), conductivity, total N, total P, and % fine sediments. Species traits were calculated for 242 diatom taxa. Weighted average (WA) methods were used to define species environmental optima, and regression approaches were used to determine whether species were sensitive or tolerant to environmental conditions indicated by % WD, total P, total N, a nutrient multivariate index, pH, conductivity, % fine sediments, % embeddedness, and a watershed disturbance multivariate index. Indicators based on WA optima and sensitive/tolerant traits were highly correlated with these environmental conditions. Natural and anthropogenic conditions varied greatly among classes of streams grouped by climate regions, but indicators developed for the entire western US were consistently more accurate than were regional indicators. Indicators for individual stressors, such as total P, conductivity, and % embeddedness, were highly correlated with values of respective stressors, but covariation among all indicators and stressors indicated that only 1 environmental gradient was reliably reflected by the indicators. Thus, robust indicators of the biological condition of diatom assemblages were developed for streams of the western US, but development of stressor-specific indicators will require application of additional analytical approaches.

AB Predictive species distribution models have become increasingly common in conservation management. Among them, envelope-based approaches like the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) are particularly advantageous, as they require only presence data. Based on the assumption that the absolute frequency of species presence is a direct indicator of habitat suitability (HS), habitat suitability indices (HSI) are computed. However, this assumption may be misleading when the scarcity of optimal habitat forces most of the individuals to live in suboptimal conditions. This often happens when the environmental conditions in the study area represent only a marginal part of the species fundamental niche.
   In this study we propose three new HS algorithms for ENFA models, which address such 'edge of niche' situations. The first algorithm (area-adjusted median, M-a) takes the availability of environmental conditions in the study area into account, the second (median + extremum, M-e) addresses situations where the species' optimum is at or beyond the extremum of the investigated environmental gradient, and the third (area-adjusted median + extremum, M-ae) combines both approaches. These algorithms were applied to two populations of capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), situated in different positions relative to the environmental gradient represented in the respective study area, and compared with the classical median algorithm (M). We evaluated the models using cross-validation and a comparison with an expert model based on external data.
   In both study areas, the HS maps obtained with the three new algorithms differed visibly from those calculated with the median algorithm. Cross-validation and comparison with external data showed that the new algorithms always provided better models, with the extremum-based algorithms (M-e and M-ae) performing best. We conclude that the new algorithms can extend the applicability of ENFA-models to a broader range of conservation relevant species by improving HS calculations for skewed species-habitat relationships in marginal habitats.

AB Disturbance is integral to the organisation of riverine ecosystems. Fluctuating low flows caused by supra-seasonal drought and water management periodically dewater habitat patches, potentially creating heterogeneity in the taxonomic composition and successional dynamics of benthic communities. The frequency of disturbance induced by low flows is contingent upon the topography of the river bed and thus varies among patches. We investigated whether the frequency of patch dewatering influenced the structure and temporal dynamics of benthic algal communities attached to the upper surfaces of stones in stream mesocosms (4 m(2)). In a 693-day disturbance experiment, we applied short dewatering disturbances (6 days) at high (33-day cycles) and low frequencies (99-day cycles) and compared algal assemblages with undisturbed controls at 21 endpoints. In the absence of disturbance, epilithic space was dominated by the green encrusting alga Gongrosira incrustans. However, drying disturbances consistently reduced the dominance of the green alga, and crust abundance decreased with increasing disturbance frequency, thereby opening space for a diversity of mat-forming diatoms. The response of mat diatoms to disturbance varied markedly during the experiment, from strong reductions in the abundance of loosely attached mats in mid-late 2000 to the exploitation of open space by closely adhering mats in 2001. Contrary responses were attributed to changes in the species composition of mat diatoms, which influenced the physiognomy and hence stress-resistance and resilience of the assemblage. Our results indicate that patchy dewatering of habitat patches during periods of low flow influences the successional dynamics of algae, thereby creating distinctive mosaics on the stream bed.

AB The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is currently threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation, and human persecution. Its dietary specialization, habitat isolation, and reproductive constraints have led to a perception that this is a species at an "evolutionary dead end," destined for deterministic extinction in the modem world. Here we examine this perception by a comprehensive investigation of its genetic diversity, population structure, and demographic history across its geographic range. We present analysis of 655 base pairs of mitochondrial (mt) control region (CR) DNA and 10 microsatellite loci for samples from its 5 extant mountain populations (Qinling, Minshan, Qionglai, Liangshan, and Lesser Xiangling). Surprisingly, extant populations display average to high levels of CR and microsatellite diversity compared with other bear species. Genetic differentiation among populations was significant in most cases but was markedly higher between Qinling and the other mountain ranges, suggesting, minimally, that the Qinling population should comprise a separate management unit for conservation purposes. Recent demographic inference using in icrosate I lite markers demonstrated a clear genetic signature for population decline starting several thousands years ago or even futher back in the past, and being accelerated and enhanced by the expansion of human populations. Importantly, these data suggest that the panda is not a species at an evolutionary "dead end," but in common with other large carnivores, has suffered demographically at the hands of human pressure. Conservation strategies should therefore focus on the restoration arid protection of wild habitat and the maintenance of the currently substantial regional genetic diversity, through active management of disconnected populations.

AB The identity of Colletotrichum acutatum as the causal pathogen of grape ripe-rot, which causes yield loss and a bitter taint that lowers wine quality in Australian subtropical wine-grape regions, was confirmed using species-specific primers. Cultural, morphological and molecular methods (RAPD-PCR and sequencing of parts of the 5.8S-ITS regions and the beta-tubulin-2 gene) were used to determine the phylogenetic relationships of Australian C. acutatum isolates from wine grapes and other horticultural crops. A combination of RAPD-PCR and beta-tubulin-2 gene data showed that all wine-grape ripe-rot isolates from northern regions of New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland belong to a proposed new C. acutatum group (A9), together with isolates from Australian strawberry, mango, blueberry and olive. The 5.8S-ITS sequences for these grape pathogens were identical to published sequences for an isolate from Cyclamen (the Netherlands) and differed by 1 bp from isolates from Capsicum (Taiwan) and orange (Costa Rica). The grape ripe-rot isolates from the Shoalhaven Valley (southern NSW) were clustered within two other C. acutatum groups: A2 and A5. In vitro infection studies showed that Australian C. acutatum isolates from almond, blueberry, chilli, grape, mango, olive, strawberry and tomato were able to infect grape and could also infect blueberry and strawberry, indicating a lack of host specificity. This lack of host specificity, the genetic similarity with non-grape isolates, and the fact that many of the non-grape hosts were isolated from wine-growing regions, suggest the potential for cross-infection between grape and other horticultural crops.

AB Forest integrity has been proposed as one conservation endpoint that integrates desirable characteristics such as natural biodiversity, stand structure and continuity. Although its defining criteria are still under discussion, any surrogates must effectively represent or predict their status, and be easier to measure than the criteria themselves. Bryophytes have been proposed as such surrogates, because they are important components of forest integrity, and considerable research indicates that some groups are sensitive to the changes associated with specific forest management regimes. The objectives of this paper are (1) to review the issues in determining indicators of forest integrity, including desirable qualities in such indicators, (2) to review the state of knowledge concerning bryophytes as components of forest integrity (i.e. their responses to forest management practices), and (3) to assess bryophytes as potential indicators of forest integrity, in terms of both qualities desirable in indicators and our understanding of bryophyte response patterns. Although bryophytes possess some characteristics that suggest potential indicator value, many challenges prevent their reliable application. I highlight key areas in which research is required to identify operational bryophyte indicators of forest integrity. Along with a standardized protocol to select and calibrate such indicators, we urgently require strategic research to compile data on undisturbed reference forests on which to base selection of endpoints; species-specific ecological tolerances, with consideration of complex interactions; mechanisms of response to disturbance, with consideration of temporal aspects; population viability thresholds; and recruitment effects on community assembly. Whether we succeed in finding bryophyte indicators of forest integrity, this research would also provide the data to monitor and interpret the integrity of the bryophyte community.

AB Patterns of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation were used to analyse the population genetic structure of southwestern Indian Ocean green turtle (Chelonia mydas) populations. Analysis of sequence variation over 396 bp of the mtDNA control region revealed seven haplotypes among 288 individuals from 10 nesting sites in the Southwest Indian Ocean. This is the first time that Atlantic Ocean haplotypes have been recorded among any Indo-Pacific nesting populations. Previous studies indicated that the Cape of Good Hope was a major biogeographical barrier between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans because evidence for gene flow in the last 1.5 million years has yet to emerge. This study, by sampling localities adjacent to this barrier, demonstrates that recent gene flow has occurred from the Atlantic Ocean into the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope. We also found compelling genetic evidence that green turtles nesting at the rookeries of the South Mozambique Channel (SMC) and those nesting in the North Mozambique Channel (NMC) belong to separate genetic stocks. Furthermore, the SMC could be subdivided in two different genetic stocks, one in Europa and the other one in Juan de Nova. We suggest that this particular genetic pattern along the Mozambique Channel is attributable to a recent colonization from the Atlantic Ocean and is maintained by oceanic conditions in the northern and southern Mozambique Channel that influence early stages in the green turtle life cycle.

AB Many plant and animal aggregations have size hierarchies within which a variety of sizes of individuals, from large to small, can be found. Size hierarchies are thought to indicate the existence of competition amongst individuals within the aggregation, but determining their exact cause is difficult. The key to understanding size hierarchies lies in first quantifying the pattern of size and growth of individuals. We conducted a quantitative investigation of pattern in the size hierarchy of the clown anemonefish Amphiprion percula, in Madang Lagoon, Papua New Guinea. Here, groups of A. percula occupy sea anemones (Heteractis magnifica) that provide protection from predators. Within each anemone there is a single group composed of a breeding pair and zero to four non-breeders. Within each group there is a single size hierarchy; the female is largest (rank 1), the male is second largest (rank 2), and the non-breeders get progressively smaller (ranks 3-6). We demonstrate that individuals adjacent in rank are separated by body size ratios whose distribution is significantly different from the distribution expected under a null model-the growth of individuals is regulated such that each dominant ends up being about 1.26 times the size of its immediate subordinate. We show that it is decisions about growth at the individual level that generate the size hierarchy at the group level, and thereby determine maximum group size and population size. This study provides a new perspective on the pattern, causes and consequences of size hierarchies.

AB Global average surface temperatures have increased rapidly over the last 100 years and there is accumulating evidence that climate change is already causing shifts in species' distributions. We use extensive abundance data and expected range shifts across altitudinal gradients to predict changes in total population size of rainforest birds of Australian tropical rainforests in response to climate warming. According to our most conservative model scenario, 74% of rainforest birds of north-eastern Australia are predicted to become threatened (including 26 critically endangered species) as a result of projected mid-range warming expected within the next 100 years. Extinction risk varies according to where along the altitudinal gradient a species is currently most abundant. Upland birds are most affected and are likely to be immediately threatened by even small increases in temperature. In contrast, there is a capacity for the population size of lowland species to increase, at least in the short term.

AB Vehicular emissions of NOx and NH3 result in elevated concentrations of nitrogen at roadside verges. To determine the extent that vehicular nitrogen emissions, disturbance and management affect the vegetation composition of road verges, a survey of 92 verges in Scotland was carried out with sites stratitied by background nitrogen deposition and road type. NOx and NH3 concentrations were monitored at 15 key sites for a year, and showed a decreasing gradient with increasing distance from the road. Ellenberg fertility indices of the vegetation communities also showed a general decrease with increasing distance from the road, but there was no straightforward correlation with NOx and NH3 air concentrations between sites. Cover of bare ground, ruderal species and salt-tolerant species were highest at the verge edge. The proximity of the verge to traffic is important both in terms of NOx and NH3 gradients, but also for deposited salt, grit and physical disturbance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The genetic differentiation of the European lobster (Homarus gammarus) was investigated in 3,283 individuals from 44 population samples throughout its geographical distribution (Norway to Greece) by means of polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of a 3-kb mitochondrial DNA segment. Ninety composite haplotypes were revealed with the number of haplotypes in each population sample ranging from 4 to 31. Private haplotypes were found at very low frequencies. The global exact test of sample differentiation based on composite haplotype frequencies was statistically significant. F-ST analyses also showed significant heterogeneity among the European lobster population samples (F-ST=0.078, P<0.001). This differentiation was mainly due to the population samples from northern Norway, the Netherlands, and the Mediterranean Sea. These samples differentiated from the rest due to reduced gene diversity rather than to unique haplotypes. The relationships among these samples were illustrated with cluster analyses; four major distinct groups were evident: Mediterranean, northern Norway, Netherlands, and the remaining Atlantic samples. Based on the low degree of differentiation revealed in the European lobster and its limited capacity for dispersal, the most probable hypothesis is that all populations have been established from a common refuge after the end of the last Ice Age, that is, within the past 15,000 years. The results of this study show that mitochondrial DNA is a powerful tool for the determination of the genetic structure among lobster samples, which is important for a proper management policy designed to protect and to cultivate this species.

DT Article
ID MICROBIAL BIOMASS; RIBOSOMAL-RNA; ROOTS; COLONIZATION; BACTERIA; DNA
AB The diversity and functional type of plants can affect the microbial biomass in the soil, its respiratory activity and the diversity of its bacterial population. We have studied these effects in microcosms of reconstituted limestone grassland containing (i) a 12-species mixture of graminoids and forbs, (ii) a monoculture of the sedge Carex flacca, (iii) a monoculture of the grass Festuca ovina, and (iv) similar soil without plants. Microbial biomass was significantly greater in soil under monocultures of F. ovina than in the other microcosms. Basal respiration was largest in the F. ovina and mixed-species treatments where values were more than double those in the C. flacca and bare soil microcosms. The basal respiration was strongly linearly related to plant productivity (r=0.89). Analysis of the active bacterial population by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA revealed its diversity to be significantly greater in the C. flacca and bare soil treatments than in the F. ovina or mixed-species microcosms. This suggests that the functional type of plants has a strong influence on the composition of the bacterial community. We hypothesize that the discriminating functional attribute leading to a reduction of bacterial diversity in these microcosms was the presence in the F. ovina and mixed-plant communities of an active arbuscular-mycorrhizal mycelium that is absent from bare soil and monocultures of C. flacca.

ID WATER RELATIONS; MAIZE; GROWTH; SOIL
AB Improving the water capturing capacity of its large and deep root system is required to stabilize the yield of upland rice in drought-prone areas in the tropics. For the improvement of the root system through breeding and soil management, it is critical to understand the relative importance of genotypic and environmental effect and their interaction on the root development under various soil conditions and agronomic management. This study aimed to quantify and characterize the effect of genotype and environment, soils and N application levels ( 0 and 90 kg N ha(-1)) in the variations of the traits related to the size and distribution of the root system at the flowering stage using 11 rice genotypes in upland fields in southern Luzon in the Philippines. The results indicated that, among the root traits, the genotypic factor accounted for the largest portion of variation for the number of nodal roots, specific root weight (SRW), and R/S ratio, whereas the environmental effect was relatively large for deep root length ratio (DRR) and total root dry weight (RDW). Especially, the DRR, the ratio of root length at deeper than 30 cm per unit area to the RDW, was strongly affected by the site. Nitrogen application increased RDW without a substantial change in the R/S ratio and DRR. On the other hand, significant genotypic variations of RDW and DRR were obtained, which may imply the opportunity for the genetic improvement. Japonica upland varieties showed a large RDW (90 - 111 g m(-2)) associated with high R/S ratio (0.18 - 0.23) and a high SRW (0.26-0.27 mg cm(-1)), whereas aus (Dular) and indica (Vandana) upland varieties had a large DRR (12.5 - 13.8 m g(-1)) with a medium R/S ratio (0.14 - 0.17), suggesting an efficient formation of a deep root system with a limited biomass allocation to the roots. In addition, the analysis of G x E interaction term for RDW by an Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) model indicated that the response to soil conditions also differed between these groups. This indicated that proper deployment of genotype to the given soil conditions is also important to maximize the expression of genotypic potentials.

AB The net primary productivity (NPP) of a plant community is often positively and linearly related to the amount of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by its canopy (APAR). The slope of this relationship is governed by the efficiency (epsilon) of APAR use in biomass production (NPP = APAR x epsilon). This intuitive model offers a promising means of generating large-scale NPP estimates, but its utility is compromised by our inability to explain considerable differences in epsilon across species, functional groups, and environments. Using data from the literature, we examined the possibility, that variation in epsilon was governed largely by two chemical and morphological characteristics of the vegetation, canopy nitrogen content (N-canopy) and the canopy average for leaf mass per unit area (M-area). Specifically, we hypothesized that epsilon was positively related to the quotient Of Ncanopy (adjusted for the fraction of incident PAR absorbed by the canopy,f(PAR)) and M-area. This epsilon index accounts for the dependence of light utilization on the quantity of photosynthetic "machinery" (N-canopy) and its inherent efficiency, which is inversely related to M-area. Across a wide array of C-3 species, functional groups and environments, epsilon (based on aboveground NPP) was strongly and positively related to [N-canopy/f(PAR)]/M-area (r(2) = 0.85, P < 0.0001). Adoption of the index as a basis for estimating epsilon could improve APAR-based predictions of terrestrial NPP, agricultural crop yield and vegetation responses to global change.

AB Seedlings of Eucalyptus grandis were grown at five different rates of nitrogen supply. Once steady-state growth rates were established, a detailed set of CO2 and water vapour exchange measurements were made to investigate the effects of leaf nitrogen content (N), as determined by nitrogen supply rate, on leaf structural, photosynthetic, respiratory and stomatal properties. Gas exchange data were used to parametrize the Farquhar-von Caemmerer photosynthesis model. Leaf mass per area (LMA) was negatively correlated to N. A positive correlation was observed between both day (R-d) and night respiration (R-n) and N when they were expressed on a leaf mass basis, but no correlation was found on a leaf area basis. An R-d/R-n ratio of 0.59 indicated a significant inhibition of dark respiration by light. The maximum net CO2 assimilation rate at ambient CO2 concentration (A(max)), the maximum rate of potential electron transport (J(max)) and the maximum rate of carboxylation (V-cmax) significantly increased with N, particularly when expressed on a mass basis. Although the maximum stomatal conductance to CO2 (g(scmax)) was positively correlated with A(max), there was no relationship between gscmax and N. Leaf N content influenced the allocation of nitrogen to photosynthetic processes, resulting in a decrease of the J(max)/V-cmax ratio with increasing N. It was concluded that leaf nitrogen concentration is a major determinant of photosynthetic capacity in Eucalyptus grandis seedlings and, to a lesser extent, of leaf respiration and nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic processes, but not of stomatal conductance.

AB Polymorphism at five microsatellite loci were screened to determine the genetic variability and the temporal stability of population structure in natural populations of European hake (Merluccius merluccius, L.) within the Bay of Biscay. In addition, the control region (900 bp) and two protein coding genes (ATPase, subunits 6 and 8, 842 bp and a partial sequence of the ND1, 800 bp) of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were sequenced from geographically distant populations from the extremes of the species range. One hundred individuals from either side of a supposed stock boundary within the bay were collected in autumn 1997. This sampling strategy was repeated during hake spawning seasons in late spring of 1998 and 1999. Low levels of population subdivision were found between putative populations within years. Similarly, low levels of differentiation were found between autumn 1997 northern samples and spring 1998 southern samples which were collected 7 months later on spawning grounds. These results are discussed in relation to ecological, behavioural and oceanographic information. Sampling effects, which may influence these results, are also discussed. Theta (theta) estimates were significantly different from zero in every other pairwise comparison between geographical areas (north and south of the Bay of Biscay) and between years within the same area (P < 0.05). Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) does not confirm the temporal persistence of population structure. These results are discussed in relation to variance in reproductive success, and temporal spawning patterns, which. may exist within the bay. mtDNA variability was very low between geographically distant samples from Norway and the Mediterranean Sea with only 10 variable sites found in a total of 2542 bp of mtDNA, these differences being exclusively in the D-loop.

The pathogenicity of the Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellate is unknown at this time, but its growth characteristics and in vitro food preferences are similar to those of P, piscicda. The SSU sequences of these species were aligned with the other full-length dinoflagellate sequences, as well as those of representative apicomplexans and Perkinsus species, the groups most closely related to dinoflagellates. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp,, P, piscicida, and the Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellate are closely related and group into the class Blastodiniphyceae, as does A, ocellatum. None of the species examined were closely related to the apicomplexans or to Perkinsus marinus, the parasite that causes "Dermo disease" in oysters. The overall phylogenetic analyses largely supported the current class and subclass groupings within the dinoflagellates.

AB Tip-up mounds, pits, and other microsites created by hurricanes may promote diversity in many forests by providing opportunities for different species to regenerate. To see if we could detect differences in microsite preference among closely related species, we studied the regeneration of three sympatric Betula species on five types of microsites on experimental mound-pit complexes. Microsites were created by pulling down canopy trees to simulate damage from past hurricanes in southern New England. Seeds were collected in litter traps and experimentally released over mounds and pits to determine effects of microtopography on fine-scale dispersal patterns. The fate of naturally germinating seedlings was monitored on the disturbed site, and seedlings were also transplanted onto microsites to examine growth patterns, causes of mortality, and leaf-level physiology.
   Seed rain onto the disturbed site was abundant and spatially heterogeneous because of scattered residual canopy trees and surviving uprooted trees. Seeds tended to disperse away from vertically oriented surfaces of mounds and to accumulate in pits. Most seedlings germinated on scarified level areas rather than on mounds or in pits, but mounds became more favorable for germination the second year following disturbance. Two fundamentally different types of mortality were observed in transplanted seedlings. Extrinsic factors such as frost heaving, burial by soil and litter, and browsing were dominant on some microsites. Mortality due to these factors occurred primarily during the winter and was unrelated to seedling size. On other microsites, resource limitation (low light levels and lack of water or nutrients) was the major cause of death. Small seedlings were most susceptible to mortality on these microsites, and most deaths occurred during the growing season.
   White birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) exhibited the fastest growth and most flexible photosynthetic response to changing light levels but suffered greatest mortality on shaded microsites. Black birch (B. lenta L.) showed increased leaf area ratio in shaded conditions. Yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis Britt.) was least flexible and grew more slowly than the other species but was best able to survive on shaded microsites. All species attained maximum maximum growth on tip-up mounds. After three growing seasons, the tallest seedlings reached nearly 3 m above the forest floor, enabling us to predict which individuals would ultimately reach the canopy to complete the regeneration process.

AB 1 The pattern of three types of herbivory, meristem damage by molluscs, grazing by roe deer and leaf damage by invertebrates, and their effects on survival, growth and fruit production in the perennial herb Lathyrus vernus were examined in 11 plots in east Sweden during 4 seasons.
   2 All three types of herbivory varied among plots but only leaf damage varied among years. Within patches, the amounts of grazing and leaf damage were size-dependent although no type of damage increased with decreased inter-neighbour distance. Once an individual had suffered meristem or leaf damage there was an increased risk of the same kind of damage occurring in the following year.
   3 Damage of meristems and vertebrate grazing reduced survival, growth and fruit production of L. vernus individuals. Leaf damage reduced only survival and fruit production.
   4 Meristem damage by molluscs had the most severe effects on the performance of L. vernus individuals in contrast to the general proposition that vertebrates and insects are the most important herbivores. This may be because such attacks delay the onset of assimilation thus missing part of the most favourable growing season.

   ENRICHMENT; MODELS; PLANTS
AB Four eucalypt species were selected to represent two ecologically disparate groups which would be expected to contrast in seedling vigour and in the nature of growth responses to CO2 X nitrogen supply. Eucalyptus camaldulensis and E. cypellocarpa were taken as examples of fast-growing species with a wide distribution, that develop into large trees. By contrast, E. pauciflora and E. pulverulenta become smaller trees, and show a more limited distribution.
   Seedlings were established in pots (5 L) of a loamy soil and supplied with nutrient solution containing either 1.2 or 6.0 mM NO3- in both ambient (33 Pa) and CO2-enriched (66 Pa) greenhouses. Analysis of growth response to treatments (2 X 2 factorial) was based on destructive harvest of plants sampled on four occasions over 84 days for E. camaldulensis and E. cypellocarpa, and 100 days for E. pulverulenta and E. pauciflora.
   A positive CO2 X N interaction on plant dry mass and leaf area was expressed in all species throughout the study period. In E. camaldulensis and E. cypellocarpa, plant mass was doubled by high N at 33 Pa CO2, compared with a three to four-fold increase at 66 Pa to reach 34 g by final harvest. In E. pulverulenta and E. pauciflora, slower growth resulted in about 50% less mass at a given age, but relative increases due to CO2 and N were of a similar order.
   A distinction can be made between N and CO2 effects on growth processes as follows. When trees were grown on low N, elevated CO2 increased nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) at both leaf and whole plant levels. On high N, leaf NUE was increased in E. camaldulensis and E. cypellocarpa, but decreased in E. pulverulenta and E. pauciflora. Whole plant NUE showed no consistent response to elevated CO2 when plants were supplied high N.
   Net assimilation rate (NAR) was increased by elevated CO2 in all species on either N treatment. Moreover, high N increased NAR under either CO2 treatment in all species. There was a positive N X CO2 interaction on NAR in E. camaldulensis and E. cypellocarpa, but not in E. pulverulenta and E. pauciflora.
   Growth indices for E. camaldulensis and E. cypellocarpa species, and especially E. camaldulensis, generally exceeded those for E. pulverulenta and E. pauciflora in terms of NAR, leaf NUE, N-enhancement of CO2 effects on leaf area and biomass, and non-structural carbohydrate content of foliage.

   DYNAMICS; POPULATIONS; PATTERNS
AB Sampling frequency and methods can potentially affect estimates of demographic rates in population studies. To determine the effects of various sampling protocols on estimating recruitment rate, the rate of larval settlement by the coral reef damselfish Dascyllus albisella Gill to an experimental grid of coral heads was monitored over several intervals by either removing newly settled larvae (recruits) at each census, or not. By sampling every 5 h during two 24-h periods, it was found that most recruits (75% on Day 1 and 81% on Day 2) settled between dusk and dawn. Coral heads that already supported conspecific juvenile groups attracted more recruits than empty coral heads during both 24-h periods, although this was statistically significant on Day 2 only. Subsequent tagging of recruits from 1 to 19 days after settlement revealed that movement between coral heads was negligible after the 1st day postsettlement, but apparent mortality was high over the same period. The settlement rate of larvae to the coral grid during a 19-day period was estimated by employing three protocols of census frequency and recruit removal. This suggested that frequent sampling with recruit removal would most closely estimate true settlement rate for D. albisella and probably other species, while less frequent censuses without recruit removal may provide closer estimates of the size of the recruit cohort that will enter the juvenile population. Considerable variation exists in the sampling protocols used by researchers studying settlement rate in damselfishes and I caution against directly comparing results among these studies.

AB Root architecture of five warm-season and five cool-season grasses was compared.  The cool-season grasses had significantly more primary and secondary roots than warm-season grasses, and the diameter of primary, secondary, and tertiary roots of cool-season grasses was significantly smaller than that of warm-season grasses.  Soil microorganisms, mycorrhizae, and P fertilization did not affect root number or diameter of the cool-season grasses; root number of warm-season grasses did respond to mycorrhizae and P fertilization, but not soil microorganisms.  Specific root length of cool-season grasses was not altered by mycorrhizae, soil microbes, or P fertilization, and was significantly greater than that of warm-season grasses, particularly those inoculated with mycorrhizae.  Topological analysis of root architecture revealed that mycorrhizal symbiosis inhibited root branching in warm-season grasses but had no effect on rooting strategy of cool-season grasses.  In contrast, P fertilization did not substantially alter root branching in warm- or cool-season grasses.  Apparently, root architecture of the mycorrhizal-dependent warm-season grasses is quite plastic, allowing energy expenditure for root development to be conserved; the root architecture of the less mycorrhizal-dependent cool-season grasses appears to be fixed and does not alter to accommodate the symbiosis.

AB In simulation-based realization of complex systems, we are forced to address the issue of computational complexity. One critical issue that must be addressed is the approximation of reality using surrogate models to replace expensive simulation models of engineering problems. In this paper, we critically review over 200 papers. We find that a framework for selecting appropriate surrogate modeling methods for a given function with specific requirements has been lacking. Having such a framework for surrogate model users, specifically practitioners in industry, is very important because there is very limited information about the performance of different models before applying them on the problem. Our contribution in this paper is to address this gap by creating practical guidance based on a trade-off among three main drivers, namely, size (how much information is necessary to compute the surrogate model), accuracy (how accurate the surrogate model must be) and computational time (how much time is required for the surrogate modeling process). Using the proposed guidance a huge amount of time is saved by avoiding time-consuming comparisons before selecting the appropriate surrogate model. To make this contribution, we review the state-of-the-art surrogate modeling literature to answer the following three questions: (1) What are the main classes of the design of experiment (DOE) methods, surrogate modeling methods and model-fitting methods based on the requirements of size, computational time, and accuracy? (2) Which surrogate modeling method is suitable based on the critical characteristics of the requirements of size, computational time and accuracy? (3) Which DOE is suitable based on the critical characteristics of the requirements of size, computational time and accuracy? Based on these three characteristics, we find six different qualitative categories for the surrogate models through a critical evaluation of the literature. These categories provide a framework for selecting an efficient surrogate modeling process to assist those who wish to select more appropriate surrogate modeling techniques for a given function. It is also summarized in Table 4 and Figs. 2, 3. MARS, response surface models, and kriging are more appropriate for large problems, acquiring less computation time and high accuracy, respectively. Also, Latin Hypercube, fractional factorial designs and D-Optimal designs are appropriate experimental designs. Our contribution is to propose a qualitative evaluation and a mental model which is based on quantitative results and findings of authors in the published literature. The value of such a framework is in providing practical guide for researchers and practitioners in industry to choose the most appropriate surrogate model based on incomplete information about an engineering design problem. Another contribution is to use three drivers, namely, computational time, accuracy, and problem size instead of using a single measure that authors generally use in the published literature.

AB The decreasing cost and increasing scope and power of emerging genomic technologies are reshaping the field of molecular ecology. However, many modern genomic approaches (e.g., RAD-seq) require large amounts of high-quality template DNA. This poses a problem for an active branch of conservation biology: genetic monitoring using minimally invasive sampling (MIS) methods. Without handling or even observing an animal, MIS methods (e.g., collection of hair, skin, faeces) can provide genetic information on individuals or populations. Such samples typically yield low-quality and/or quantities of DNA, restricting the type of molecular methods that can be used. Despite this limitation, genetic monitoring using MIS is an effective tool for estimating population demographic parameters and monitoring genetic diversity in natural populations. Genetic monitoring is likely to become more important in the future as many natural populations are undergoing anthropogenically driven declines, which are unlikely to abate without intensive adaptive management efforts that often include MIS approaches. Here, we profile the expanding suite of genomic methods and platforms compatible with producing genotypes from MIS, considering factors such as development costs and error rates. We evaluate how powerful new approaches will enhance our ability to investigate questions typically answered using genetic monitoring, such as estimating abundance, genetic structure and relatedness. As the field is in a period of unusually rapid transition, we also highlight the importance of legacy data sets and recommend how to address the challenges of moving between traditional and next-generation genetic monitoring platforms. Finally, we consider how genetic monitoring could move beyond genotypes in the future. For example, assessing microbiomes or epigenetic markers could provide a greater understanding of the relationship between individuals and their environment.

AB Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is an important factor for tracking global carbon cycle to tackle the impact of climate change. Among all available remote sensing data and methods, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in combination with decision tree based machine learning algorithms has produced favourable results in estimating higher biomass values. Suitability of this method for dense tropical forests has not been properly checked with an adequate number of studies. In this study, aboveground biomass was estimated for two major tree species, Shorea robusta, and Tectona grandis, of Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, a tropical forest situated in northern India. Aboveground biomass was estimated by combining C-band SAR data from Sentinel-1A satellite, texture images generated from Sentinel-1A data, vegetation indices produced using Sentinel-2A data and ground inventory plots. Decision tree-based machine learning algorithms were used in place of parametric regression models for establishing a relationship between fields measured values and remotely sensed parameters. Using random forest model with a combination of vegetation indices with SAR backscatter as predictor variables shows the best result for S. robusta forest, with a coefficient of determination value of 0.71 and an RMSE value of 105.027 t/ha. In T. grandis forest best result can be found in the same combination but for stochastic gradient boosted model with a coefficient of determination value of 0.6 and an RMSE value of 79.45 t/ha. This study shows that Sentinel series satellite data has exceptional capabilities in estimating dense forest AGB and machine learning algorithms can be very helpful to do so.

AB Climate change and biological invasions are threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services worldwide. It has now been widely acknowledged that climate change will affect biological invasions. A large number of studies have investigated predicted shifts and other changes in the geographic ranges of invasive alien species related to climate change using modeling approaches. Yet these studies have provided contradictory evidence, and no consensus has been reached. We conducted a systematic review of 423 modeling case studies included in 71 publications that have examined the predicted effects of climate change on those species. We differentiate the approaches used in these studies and synthesize their main results. Our results reaffirm the major role of climate change as a driver of invasive alien species distribution in the future. We found biases in the literature both regarding the taxa, toward plants and invertebrates, and the areas of the planet investigated. Despite these biases, we found for the plants and vertebrates studied that climate change will more frequently contribute to a decrease in species range size than an increase in the overall area occupied. This is largely due to oceans preventing terrestrial invaders from spreading poleward. In contrast, we found that the ranges of invertebrates and pathogens studied are more likely to increase following climate change. An important caveat to these findings is that researchers have rarely considered the effects of climate change on transport, introduction success, or the resulting impacts. We recommend closing these research gaps, and propose additional avenues for future investigations, as well as opportunities and challenges for managing invasions under climate change.

AB The contemporary state of functional traits and species richness in plant communities depends on legacy effects of past disturbances. Whether temporal responses of community properties to current environmental changes are altered by such legacies is, however, unknown. We expect global environmental changes to interact with land-use legacies given different community trajectories initiated by prior management, and subsequent responses to altered resources and conditions. We tested this expectation for species richness and functional traits using 1814 survey-resurvey plot pairs of understorey communities from 40 European temperate forest datasets, syntheses of management transitions since the year 1800, and a trait database. We also examined how plant community indicators of resources and conditions changed in response to management legacies and environmental change. Community trajectories were clearly influenced by interactions between management legacies from over 200years ago and environmental change. Importantly, higher rates of nitrogen deposition led to increased species richness and plant height in forests managed less intensively in 1800 (i.e., high forests), and to decreases in forests with a more intensive historical management in 1800 (i.e., coppiced forests). There was evidence that these declines in community variables in formerly coppiced forests were ameliorated by increased rates of temperature change between surveys. Responses were generally apparent regardless of sites' contemporary management classifications, although sometimes the management transition itself, rather than historic or contemporary management types, better explained understorey responses. Main effects of environmental change were rare, although higher rates of precipitation change increased plant height, accompanied by increases in fertility indicator values. Analysis of indicator values suggested the importance of directly characterising resources and conditions to better understand legacy and environmental change effects. Accounting for legacies of past disturbance can reconcile contradictory literature results and appears crucial to anticipating future responses to global environmental change.

AB Restoration aims to return ecosystem services, including the human health benefits of exposure to green space. The loss of such exposure with urbanization and industrialization has arguably contributed to an increase in human immune dysregulation. The Biodiversity and Old Friends hypotheses have described the possible mechanisms of this relationship, and suggest that reduced exposure to diverse, beneficial microorganisms can result in negative health consequences. However, it is unclear whether restoration of biodiverse habitat can reverse this effect, and what role the environmental microbiome might have in such recovery. Here, we propose the Microbiome Rewilding Hypothesis, which specifically outlines that restoring biodiverse habitats in urban green spaces can rewild the environmental microbiome to a state that enhances primary prevention of human disease. We support our hypothesis with examples from allied fields, including a case study of active restoration that reversed the degradation of the soil bacterial microbiome of a former pasture. This case study used high-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA to assess the quality of a restoration intervention in restoring the soil bacterial microbiome. The method is rapid, scalable, and standardizable, and has great potential as a monitoring tool to assess functional outcomes of green-space restoration. Evidence for the Microbiome Rewilding Hypothesis will help motivate health professionals, urban planners, and restoration practitioners to collaborate and achieve co-benefits. Co-benefits include improved human health outcomes and investment opportunities for biodiversity conservation and restoration.

AB Managing ecosystem services in the context of global sustainability policies requires reliable monitoring mechanisms. While satellite Earth observation offers great promise to support this need, significant challenges remain in quantifying connections between ecosystem functions, ecosystem services, and human well-being benefits. Here, we provide a framework showing how Earth observation together with socioeconomic information and model -based analysis can support assessments of ecosystem service supply, demand, and benefit, and illustrate this for three services. We argue that the full potential of Earth observation is not yet realized in ecosystem service studies. To provide guidance for priority setting and to spur research in this area, we propose five priorities to advance the capabilities of Earth observation -based monitoring of ecosystem services.

AB Different tree species influence litter decomposition directly through species-specific litter traits, and indirectly through distinct modifications of the local decomposition environment. Whether these indirect effects on decomposition are influenced by tree species diversity is presently not clear.
   We addressed this question by studying the decomposition of two common substrates, cellulose paper and wood sticks, in a total of 209 forest stands of varying tree species diversity across six major forest types at the scale of Europe.
   Tree species richness showed a weak but positive correlation with the decomposition of cellulose but not with that of wood. Surprisingly, macroclimate had only a minor effect on cellulose decomposition and no effect on wood decomposition despite the wide range in climatic conditions among sites from Mediterranean to boreal forests. Instead, forest canopy density and stand-specific litter traits affected the decomposition of both substrates, with a particularly clear negative effect of the proportion of evergreen tree litter.
   Our study suggests that species richness and composition of tree canopies modify decomposition indirectly through changes in microenvironmental conditions. These canopy-induced differences in the local decomposition environment control decomposition to a greater extent than continental-scale differences in macroclimatic conditions.

AB Mammal species have made the transition to the marine environment several times, and their lineages represent one of the classical examples of convergent evolution in morphological and physiological traits. Nevertheless, the genetic mechanisms of their phenotypic transition are poorly understood, and investigations into convergence at the molecular level have been inconclusive. While past studies have searched for convergent changes at specific amino acid sites, we propose an alternative strategy to identify those genes that experienced convergent changes in their selective pressures, visible as changes in evolutionary rate specifically in the marine lineages. We present evidence of widespread convergence at the gene level by identifying parallel shifts in evolutionary rate during three independent episodes of mammalian adaptation to the marine environment. Hundreds of genes accelerated their evolutionary rates in all three marine mammal lineages during their transition to aquatic life. These marine-accelerated genes are highly enriched for pathways that control recognized functional adaptations in marine mammals, including muscle physiology, lipid-metabolism, sensory systems, and skin and connective tissue. The accelerations resulted from both adaptive evolution as seen in skin and lung genes, and loss of function as in gustatory and olfactory genes. In regard to sensory systems, this finding provides further evidence that reduced senses of taste and smell are ubiquitous in marine mammals. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of identifying genes underlying convergent organism-level characteristics on a genomewide scale and without prior knowledge of adaptations, and provides a powerful approach for investigating the physiological functions of mammalian genes.

AB With anthropogenic impacts rapidly advancing into deeper waters, there is growing interest in establishing deep-sea marine protected areas (MPAs) or reserves. Reserve design depends on estimates of connectivity and scales of dispersal for the taxa of interest. Deep-sea taxa are hypothesized to disperse greater distances than shallow-water taxa, which implies that reserves would need to be larger in size and networks could be more widely spaced; however, this paradigm has not been tested. We compiled population genetic studies of deep-sea fauna and estimated dispersal distances for 51 studies using a method based on isolation-by-distance slopes. Estimates of dispersal distance ranged from 0.24 km to 2028 km with a geometric mean of 33.2 km and differed in relation to taxonomic and life-history factors as well as several study parameters. Dispersal distances were generally greater for fishes than invertebrates with the Mollusca being the least dispersive sampled phylum. Species that are pelagic as adults were more dispersive than those with sessile or sedentary lifestyles. Benthic species from soft-substrate habitats were generally less dispersive than species from hard substrate, demersal or pelagic habitats. As expected, species with pelagic and/or feeding (planktotrophic) larvae were more dispersive than other larval types. Many of these comparisons were confounded by taxonomic or other life-history differences (e.g. fishes being more dispersive than invertebrates) making any simple interpretation difficult. Our results provide the first rough estimate of the range of dispersal distances in the deep sea and allow comparisons to shallow-water assemblages. Overall, dispersal distances were greater for deeper taxa, although the differences were not large (0.3-0.6 orders of magnitude between means), and imbalanced sampling of shallow and deep taxa complicates any simple interpretation. Our analyses suggest the scales of dispersal and connectivity for reserve design in the deep sea might be comparable to or slightly larger than those in shallow water. Deep-sea reserve design will need to consider the enormous variety of taxa, life histories, hydrodynamics, spatial configuration of habitats and patterns of species distributions. The many caveats of our analyses provide a strong impetus for substantial future efforts to assess connectivity of deep-sea species from a variety of habitats, taxonomic groups and depth zones.

AB Identification of discrete and unique assemblages of individuals or populations is central to the management of exploited species. Advances in population genomics provide new opportunities for re-evaluating existing conservation units but comparisons among approaches remain rare. We compare the utility of RAD-seq, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and a microsatellite panel to resolve spatial structuring under a scenario of possible trans-Atlantic secondary contact in a threatened Atlantic Salmon, Salmo salar, population in southern Newfoundland. Bayesian clustering indentified two large groups subdividing the existing conservation unit and multivariate analyses indicated significant similarity in spatial structuring among the three data sets. mtDNA alleles diagnostic for European ancestry displayed increased frequency in southeastern Newfoundland and were correlated with spatial structure in all marker types. Evidence consistent with introgression among these two groups was present in both SNP data sets but not the microsatellite data. Asymmetry in the degree of introgression was also apparent in SNP data sets with evidence of gene flow towards the east or European type. This work highlights the utility of RAD-seq based approaches for the resolution of complex spatial patterns, resolves a region of trans-Atlantic secondary contact in Atlantic Salmon in Newfoundland and demonstrates the utility of multiple marker comparisons in identifying dynamics of introgression.

AB Aim Determining which species are more prone to extinction is vital for conserving Earth's biodiversity and for providing insight into macroevolutionary processes. This paper utilizes the Pliocene to Recent fossil record of mollusks to identify determinants of species' extinction over the past three million years of Earth history.
   Location Western Atlantic.
   Methods We focus on 92 bivalve and gastropod species that lived during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP; similar to 3.264-3.025 Ma) and have either since gone extinct or are still extant. We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) to assess the vulnerability of these species to extinction as a function of both fundamental (FN) and realized ( RN) niche breadth proxies, geographic range size, and amount of suitable area available to them during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; similar to 21 Ka).
   Results Geographic range size emerged as a key predictor of extinction for the studied mollusk species, with RN breadth and amount of suitable area available during the LGM as secondary predictors. By contrast, FN breadth was not a significant predictor of extinction risk.
   Main conclusions The failure to recover FN breadth as a predictor of extinction may suggest that extinction resistance is achieved when species are more successful in filling the geographic extent of their fundamental tolerances. That is, when it comes to species' survival, being a generalist or specialist sensu stricto may be secondary to the unique historical, dispersal, and biotic constraints that dictate a species' occupation of suitable environments, and consequently of geographic space, at a particular time. Identifying the factors that promote extinction is important because of the time-intensive nature of estimating extinction risk for individual species and populations, and because of the rising concerns about the future of marine ecosystems and biodiversity.

AB We provide a review and synthesis of key findings in phylogeographic research on terrestrial animals in the Aegean archipelago (Greece) and surrounding regions (Greek mainland, southern Balkans and Asia Minor). A critical review of more than 100 phylogeographic articles on 76 animal genera (30 invertebrates and 46 vertebrates) that have been published so far for the region leads to the recognition of three types of distribution patterns: old colonizers' diversified in the Aegean before the formation of the mid-Aegean Trench (MAT - i.e. before 9Mya), post-MAT colonizers that arrived to the Aegean in late Miocene and Pliocene and new colonizers that inhabited the region in the Pleistocene or even the Holocene. Several problems, mainly regarding the use of calibration points and/or molecular clock rates for clade chronology, have been identified in many analyses. Despite the large amount of phylogeographic work concerning the Aegean and surrounding regions, many groups remain unstudied (especially invertebrates, micro-organisms, fungi and plants), and many issues still remain unresolved. The relative roles of extinction, speciation, dispersal and vicariance, as well as the effects of adaptive and non-adaptive components of diversification, need further analyses with modern tools that can provide deeper insights. A more detailed reconstruction of the palaeogeography of the region is also of prime importance. The critical views presented herein may prove useful also for the evaluation of similar work in other regions.

AB For climate change projections to be useful, the magnitude of change must be understood relative to the magnitude of uncertainty in model predictions. We quantified the signal-to-noise ratio in projected distributional responses of boreal birds to climate change, and compared sources of uncertainty. Boosted regression tree models of abundance were generated for 80 boreal-breeding bird species using a comprehensive data set of standardized avian point counts (349 629 surveys at 122 202 unique locations) and 4-km climate, land use, and topographic data. For projected changes in abundance, we calculated signal-to-noise ratios and examined variance components related to choice of global climatemodel (GCM) and two sources of species distribution model (SDM) uncertainty: sampling error and variable selection. We also evaluated spatial, temporal, and interspecific variation in these sources of uncertainty. The mean signal-to-noise ratio across species increased over time to 2.87 by the end of the 21st century, with the signal greater than the noise for 88% of species. Across species, climate change represented the largest component (0.44) of variance in projected abundance change. Among sources of uncertainty evaluated, choice of GCM (mean variance component = 0.17) was most important for 66% of species, sampling error (mean = 0.12) for 29% of species, and variable selection (mean = 0.05) for 5% of species. Increasing the number of GCMs from four to 19 had minor effects on these results. The range of projected changes and uncertainty characteristics across species differed markedly, reinforcing the individuality of species' responses to climate change and the challenges of one-size-fits-all approaches to climate change adaptation. We discuss the usefulness of different conservation approaches depending on the strength of the climate change signal relative to the noise, as well as the dominant source of prediction uncertainty.

AB As habitat loss accelerates, there is pressing need to preserve plant genetic diversity in ex situ conservation collections. Population structure (i.e. subdivision), which is common in plants, may be an important consideration when planning such collections because it results in locally restricted alleles or traits, which have high conservation, ecological, or economic value. Nonetheless, common protocols for ex situ collections do not consider population structure. To help inform collection decisions, we utilize computer simulations with different levels of realistic hierarchical population structure to evaluate the expected performance of an array of sample sizes and several spatial distributions of sampled populations. We quantify how population structure affects the expected probability of capturing alleles (especially rare alleles). We also test the effect of family-level structure due to pollen pool composition (e.g., sibling clusters). Our findings suggest that when range-wide population structure exists, the spatial distribution of sampled populations is crucial: sampling one population per region (dispersed sampling) captured up to 175% more alleles than sampling all populations in one region (constrained sampling), and nearly as much as sampling all existing populations. The spatial effect is strongest for poorly-connected (low gene flow) species. Under realistic population structure, moderate sampling (25-30 individuals per population) from few but widely-spaced populations performs optimally; this differs from previous recommended guidelines that do not consider structure. There is smaller effect of the pollen pool composition on collection performance. We conclude that seed collection plans should incorporate spatial considerations, especially for poorly-connected taxa. Our simulation approach can be extended to particular species and other spatial patterns. We use the butternut tree as a case study for collection planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Aim Cities represent an ideal study system for assessing how intensive land-use change and biotic interchange have altered beta diversity at broad geographic extents. Here we test the hypothesis that floras in cities located in disparate regions of the globe are being homogenized by species classified as invasive (naturalized species that have spread over a large area) or as a European archaeophyte (species introduced into Europe before ad 1500 from the Mediterranean Basin). We also test the prediction that the global influences of European activities (colonization, agriculture, commerce) have supported this outcome. Location One hundred and ten cities world-wide. Methods We examined the richness and composition of urban floras among European (n=85) and non-European cities (n=25) for species classified as native or non-native, or further classified as European archaeophyte or invasive. We modelled how geographic, climatic and anthropogenic factors were related to compositional similarity between European and non-European cities. Results We found that most plants in the cities we examined, particularly non-European cities, were native and unique to each city. Non-native species were similarly unique, but occurred in much lower proportions relative to natives. Although European archaeophytes and invasive species also occurred in lower proportions, they had similar compositions among cities. European archaeophytes were most prevalent in European cities, but were most similar among non-European cities. Contrasting European and non-European cities, geography and climate were most relevant for native and invasive species, whereas climate and agriculture were most relevant for European archaeophytes. Main conclusions Cities in disparate regions of the globe retain regionally distinct native and non-native plant assemblages, while invasive species, and especially European archaeophytes, were associated with lower beta diversity among cities. These findings suggest that intensive land-use change and biotic interchange, shaped through European influences, have had a world-wide effect on the beta diversity of urban plant assemblages.

AB Seasonal droughts are predictable components of arid-land stream hydrology, and many arid-land aquatic taxa have adapted to their extreme environment. However, climate change is altering this predictable hydrology, producing longer and more severe droughts and creating novel disturbance regimes for resident organisms. The hydrologic transitions from flowing stream to fragmented pools to dry stream bed are frequently associated with steep decreases in taxonomic and functional diversity, referred to as thresholds of biodiversity loss. Less is known about how taxa respond between these thresholds, as fragmented pools gradually dry and abiotic conditions intensify. While an increasingly extreme environment may be expected to reduce taxonomic and trait richness, species adapted to predictable seasonal fragmentation may be resistant to declining water levels until all surface water is lost. We used aquatic mesocosms to test two competing hypotheses of the relationship between richness and pool drying for arid-land stream invertebrates: (i) the drought vulnerability hypothesis (richness gradually decreases with drying) and (ii) the drought resistance hypothesis (richness remains constant until complete drying occurs). We inoculated replicate mesocosms with aquatic invertebrates from arid-land streams in Arizona, U.S.A., and applied three drying treatments representing a continuum of drying stress commonly observed in local streams during the summer dry season (water depths: 10, 7 and 1cm). Mesocosms were covered to restrict dispersal and colonisation processes and to isolate resistance (in situ survival of species) from resilience (community recovery following disturbance). After 45days, we destructively sampled all invertebrates in the mesocosms and calculated various taxonomic and functional trait metrics. Taxonomic richness and composition did not differ between drying treatments, providing strong support for the drought resistance hypothesis. Severe drying was associated with lower invertebrate abundances and higher densities than the moderate and control treatments. This finding suggests that density-dependent processes generated by decreased available habitat may be more important determinants of community composition during droughts than abiotic stress in this system. We observed a near-complete overlap of trophic traits (body size and functional feeding group) and resistance traits (respiration mode and diapause) among the three treatments. This high functional redundancy may provide a buffer against changes to ecosystem functioning, even in cases of severe-drying-induced habitat contraction and fragmentation.

AB Pollen records from large lakes have been used for quantitative palaeoclimate reconstruction, but the influences that lake size (as a result of species-specific variations in pollen dispersal patterns that smaller pollen grains are more easily transported to lake centre) and taphonomy have on these climatic signals have not previously been systematically investigated. We introduce the concept of pollen source area to pollen-based climate calibration using the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau as our study area. We present a pollen data set collected from large lakes in the arid to semi-arid region of central Asia. The influences that lake size and the inferred pollen source areas have on pollen compositions have been investigated through comparisons with pollen assemblages in neighbouring lakes of various sizes. Modern pollen samples collected from different parts of Lake Donggi Cona (in the north-eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau) reveal variations in pollen assemblages within this large lake, which are interpreted in terms of the species-specific dispersal and depositional patterns for different types of pollen, and in terms of fluvial input components. We have estimated the pollen source area for each lake individually and used this information to infer modern climate data with which to then develop a modern calibration data set, using both the multivariate regression tree (MRT) and weighted-averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) approaches. Fossil pollen data from Lake Donggi Cona have been used to reconstruct the climate history of the north-eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The meanannual precipitation was quantitatively reconstructed using WA-PLS: extremely dry conditions are found to have dominated the LGM, with annual precipitation of around 100 mm, which is only 32% of present-day precipitation. A gradually increasing trend in moisture conditions during the Late Glacial is terminated by an abrupt reversion to a dry phase that lasts for about 1000 yr and coincides with "Heinrich event 1" in the North Atlantic region. Subsequent periods corresponding to the Bolling/Allerod interstadial, with annual precipitation (P-ann) of about 350 mm, and the Younger Dryas event (about 270 mm P-ann) are followed by moist conditions in the early Holocene, with annual precipitation of up to 400 mm. A drier trend after 9 cal. ka BP is followed by a second wet phase in the middle Holocene, lasting until 4.5 cal. ka BP. Relatively steady conditions with only slight fluctuations then dominate the late Holocene, resulting in the present climatic conditions. The climate changes since the LGM have been primarily driven by deglaciation and fluctuations in the intensity of the Asian summer monsoon that resulted from changes in the Northern Hemisphere summer solar insolation, as well as from changes in the North Atlantic climate through variations in the circulation patterns and intensity of the westerlies.

AB This paper provides an overview of the measuring capabilities of IJ_Rhizo, an ImageJ macro that measures scanned images of washed root samples. IJ_Rhizo is open-source, platform-independent and offers a simple graphic user interface (GUI) for a main audience of non-programmer scientists. Being open-source based, it is also fully modifiable to accommodate the specific needs of the more computer-literate users. A comparison of IJ_Rhizo's performance with that of the widely used commercial package WinRHIZO (TM) is discussed.
   We compared IJ_Rhizo's performance with that of the commercial package WinRHIZO (TM) using two sets of images, one comprising test-line images, the second consisting of images of root samples collected in the field. IJ_Rhizo and WinRHIZO (TM) estimates were compared by means of correlation and regression analysis.
   IJ_Rhizo "Kimura" and WinRHIZO (TM) "Tennant" were the length estimates that were best linearly correlated with each other. Correlation between average root diameter estimates was weaker, due to the sensitivity of this parameter to thresholding and filtering of image background noise.
   Overall, IJ_Rhizo offers new opportunities for researchers who cannot afford the cost of commercial software packages to carry out automated measurement of scanned images of root samples, without sacrificing accuracy.

AB 1. The relative importance of food supply and predation as determinants of animal population density is a topic of enduring debate among ecologists. To address it, many studies have tested the potential effects of food on population density by experimentally supplementing natural populations, with much focus on terrestrial vertebrates, especially small mammals.
   2. Here we perform a meta-analysis of such experiments, testing two complementary hypotheses: (i) small mammal populations are bottom-up limited and (ii) population increases in response to food supplementation are constrained by predation, a top-down limitation.
   3. In the 148 experiments recorded, food supplementation had an overall positive and significant effect, increasing population densities by 1.5-fold. Larger population increases occurred when predation was reduced and populations were open to immigration. Predation appeared to be unimportant when populations were closed to immigration. Immigration was the major mechanism underlying increases in abundance by increasing local population density and crowding. Contributions of increased reproductive rate could be detected, but were minor compared to immigration, and no effects were detected from survival.
   4. Our analyses support the view that animal population density is determined by both bottom-up and top-down forces. They also suggest the possibility that food supplementation experiments might unintentionally create ecological traps by aggregating both prey and predators in small areas of the landscape. We suggest an alternative experimental design to increase the contribution that food supplementation experiments can make in future.

AB 1. Models of the regulatory behaviour of organisms are fundamental to a strong physiologically-based understanding of species' responses to global environmental change. Biophysical models of heat and water exchange in organisms (biophysical ecology) and nutritionally-explicit models for understanding feeding behaviour and its fitness consequences (the Geometric Framework of nutrition, GF) are providing such an underpinning. However, temperature, water and nutrition interact in fundamental ways in influencing the responses of the organism to their environment, and a priority is to develop an integrated approach for conceptualising and measuring these interactions.
   2. Ideally, such an approach would be based on a thermodynamically-formalized energy and mass budgeting approach that is sparsely parameterised and sufficiently general to apply across a range of situations and organisms. Here we illustrate how mass-balance aspects of Dynamic Energy Budget theory can be applied to obtain first-principles estimates of fluxes of O-2, CO2, H2O and nitrogenous waste.
   3. Then, using an herbivorous lizard (Egernia cunninghami) as a case study, we demonstrate how these estimates can be integrated with heat/water exchange models and environmental data to provide a holistic understanding of how foraging strategy, food availability, habitat and weather interact with heat, water and nutrient/energy budgets across the life-cycle.
   4. The analysis shows the potential importance of the water balance in affecting the energy budgets of 'dry skinned' ectotherms, especially early in ontogeny, and highlights a significant gap in our knowledge of the physiological and behavioural traits that affect water balance when compared with our knowledge of thermal traits.
   5. In general, the modelling approach we describe can provide the thermodynamically-constrained stage on which other evolutionary and ecological interactions play out; the 'thermodynamic niche'. This in turn provides a solid foundation from which to tackle key questions about organismal responses to environmental change.

AB Grafting is nowadays regarded as a rapid tool aimed at increasing environmental stress tolerance of fruit vegetables. In cultivation systems oversupply of cations, saline or drought conditions and the type of the growing system can easily cause potassium (le) deficiency and thus, lead to a damage of physiological processes. The hypothesis was raised that rootstocks alleviate stress symptoms of tomato at moderate deficient K supply (4 mM) compared with regular (8 mM) in the nutrient solution. Moreover, the long-term response of grafted plants ('Classy', 'Piccolino') was studied to quantify the effectiveness of rootstocks ('Maxifort' and 'Brigeor') in mitigating K+ stress particularly on tomato yield and fruit quality attributes, such as appearance, firmness, taste and health promoting compounds. K+ deficiency resulted in a reduction of root growth, yield, fruit appearance, and carotenoids. On the other hand, firmness and concentration on single and total fruit sugars increased. In most of the characteristics negatively affected by low K+ supply, grafting was able to alleviate these effects. Thus, rootstocks improved root growth and morphology, yield, concentration of carotenoids and also titratable acids in fruits especially at low ICE supply. The portion of blossom end rot was reduced. However, the alleviation depended on the rootstock scion combination. Possible reasons of the rootstock effects were discussed, such as change in dry matter partitioning in favour of the fruits, improved Ca2+ availability and transport, increased photosynthesis and associated relationship between sugar and synthesis of ascorbic acid and carotenoids.

AB Remotely sensed datasets are increasingly being used to model habitat suitability for a variety of taxa. We review habitat suitability models (HSMs) developed for both plants and animals that include remote sensing predictor variables to determine how these variables could affect model projections. For models focused on plant species habitat, we find several instances of unintentional bias in HSMs of vegetation due to the inclusion of remote sensing variables. Notably, studies that include continuous remote sensing variables could be inadvertently mapping actual species distribution instead of potential habitat due to unique spectral or temporal characteristics of the target species. Additionally, HSMs including categorical classifications are rarely explicit about assumptions of habitat suitability related to land cover, which could lead to unintended exclusion of potential habitat due to current land use. Although we support the broader application of remote sensing in general, we caution developers of HSMs to be aware of introduced model bias. These biases are more likely to arise when remote sensing variables are added to models simply because they improve accuracy, rather than considering how they affect the model results and interpretation. When including land cover classifications as predictors, we recommend that modellers provide more explicit descriptions of how habitat is defined (e.g., is deforested land considered suitable for trees?). Further, we suggest that continuous remote sensing variables should only be included in habitat models if authors can demonstrate that their inclusion characterizes potential habitat rather than actual species distribution. Use of the term 'habitat suitability model' rather than 'species distribution model' could reduce confusion about modelling goals and improve communication between the remote sensing and ecological modelling communities.

AB The Mediterranean Sea is a semienclosed basin connected with the open sea mainly through the Strait of Gibraltar. Due to the circulation pattern and the long residence time ranging between 80 and 100 years, the Mediterranean Sea is a sensitive environment to eutrophication pressures. The main body of water of the Mediterranean is characterized by very low nutrient concentrations, and therefore, the Mediterranean is classified among the most oligotrophic (very poor waters in nutrients) seas of the world's oceans. However, some coastal areas, mainly in the northern part of the basin, receive excessive loads of nutrients from sewage effluents, river fluxes, aquaculture farms, fertilizers, and industrial facilities, showing intense eutrophic phenomena with many adverse effects for the marine ecosystem and humans. Various national and international authorities, in addition to monitoring, have taken legal and administrative measures to mitigate eutrophication trends in the area. The Mediterranean environment is a good paradigm of integration of extensive legal framework, scientific knowledge, and administrative practices. The Barcelona Convention, the Mediterranean Action Plan, and European Union Directives on water quality and coastal management, together with scientific information derived from international research programs in the Mediterranean, provide a sound background for practical actions in eutrophication problems. In the present work, the problem of coastal eutrophication in the Mediterranean is reviewed in connection with public policies of the Mediterranean States based on national and international legislation and scientific knowledge on Mediterranean oceanography-ecology and actions coordinated by international bodies. These common actions and practices on coastal management are also discussed in relation to the need for sustainable development and protection of the coastal zone in the Mediterranean Sea.

AB Understanding how specific environmental factors shape gene flow while disentangling their importance relative to the effects of geographical isolation is a major question in evolutionary biology and a specific goal of landscape genetics. Here, we combine information from nuclear microsatellite markers and ecological niche modelling to study the association between climate and spatial genetic structure and variability in Engelmann oak (Quercus engelmannii), a wind-pollinated species with high potential for gene flow. We first test whether genetic diversity is associated with climatic niche suitability and stability since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Second, we use causal modelling to analyse the potential influence of climatic factors (current and LGM niche suitability) and altitude in the observed patterns of genetic structure. We found that genetic diversity is negatively associated with local climatic stability since the LGM, which may be due to higher immigration rates in unstable patches during favourable climatic periods and/or temporally varying selection. Analyses of spatial genetic structure revealed the presence of three main genetic clusters, a pattern that is mainly driven by two highly differentiated populations located in the northern edge of the species distribution range. After controlling for geographic distance, causal modelling analyses showed that genetic relatedness decreases with the environmental divergence among sampling sites estimated as altitude and current and LGM niche suitability. Natural selection against nonlocal genotypes and/or asynchrony in reproductive phenology may explain this pattern. Overall, this study suggests that local environmental conditions can shape patterns of genetic structure and variability even in species with high potential for gene flow and relatively small distribution ranges.

AB The remarkable diversity of mating patterns and sexual systems in flowering plants has fascinated evolutionary biologists for more than a century. Enduring questions about this topic include why sexual polymorphisms have evolved independently in over 100 plant families, and why proportions of self- and cross-fertilization often vary dramatically within and among populations. Important new insights concerning the evolutionary dynamics of plant mating systems have built upon a strong foundation of theoretical models and innovative field and laboratory experiments. However, as the pace of advancement in this field has accelerated, it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to follow developments outside their primary area of research expertise.
   In this Viewpoint paper we highlight three important themes that span and integrate different subdisciplines: the changes in morphology, phenology, and physiology that accompany the transition to selfing; the evolutionary consequences of pollen pool diversity in flowering plants; and the evolutionary dynamics of sexual polymorphisms. We also highlight recent developments in molecular techniques that will facilitate more efficient and cost-effective study of mating patterns in large natural populations, research on the dynamics of pollen transport, and investigations on the genetic basis of sexual polymorphisms. This Viewpoint also serves as the introduction to a Special Issue on the Evolution of Plant Mating Systems. The 15 papers in this special issue provide inspiring examples of recent discoveries, and glimpses of exciting developments yet to come.

AB Climate change is leading to a redistribution of marine species, altering ecosystem dynamics as species extend or shift their geographic ranges polewards with warming waters. In marine systems, range shifts have been observed in a wide diversity of species and ecosystems and are predicted to become more prevalent as environmental conditions continue to change. Large-scale shifts in the ranges of marine species will likely have dramatic socio-economic and management implications. Australia provides a unique setting in which to examine the range of consequences of climate-induced range shifts because it encompasses a diverse range of ecosystems, spanning tropical to temperate systems, within a single nation and is home to global sea surface temperature change 'hotspots' (where range shifts are particularly likely to occur). We draw on global examples with a particular emphasis on Australian cases to evaluate these consequences. We show that in Australia, range shifts span a variety of ecosystem types, trophic levels, and perceived outcomes (i.e., negative versus positive). The effect(s) of range shifts on socio-economic change variables are rarely reviewed, yet have the potential to have positive and/or negative effects on economic activities, human health and ecosystem services. Even less information exists about potential management responses to range-shifting species. However, synthesis of these diverse examples provides some initial guidance for selecting effective adaptive response strategies and management tools in the face of continuing climate-mediated range shifts.

AB The exact nature of the relationship among species range sizes, speciation, and extinction events is not well understood. The factors that promote larger ranges, such as broad niche widths and high dispersal abilities, could increase the likelihood of encountering new habitats but also prevent local adaptation due to high gene flow. Similarly, low dispersal abilities or narrower niche widths could cause populations to be isolated, but such populations may lack advantageous mutations due to low population sizes. Here we present a large-scale, spatially explicit, individual-based model addressing the relationships between species ranges, speciation, and extinction. We followed the evolutionary dynamics of hundreds of thousands of diploid individuals for 200,000 generations. Individuals adapted to multiple resources and formed ecological species in a multidimensional trait space. These species varied in niche widths, and we observed the coexistence of generalists and specialists on a few resources. Our model shows that species ranges correlate with dispersal abilities but do not change with the strength of fitness trade-offs; however, high dispersal abilities and low resource utilization costs, which favored broad niche widths, have a strong negative effect on speciation rates. An unexpected result of our model is the strong effect of underlying resource distributions on speciation: in highly fragmented landscapes, speciation rates are reduced.

AB The wolf Canis lupus, the most widespread of the four species of large carnivores in Europe, after centuries of population decline and eradication, is now recovering in many countries. Wolves contribute to regulating prey-predator dynamics and interact with human activities, mainly livestock farming and ungulate hunting. Although wolves are protected in most European countries, illegal or incidental killing is widespread.
   Wolf populations do not show any apparent phylogeographic structuring worldwide. Molecular and morphological studies of historical samples showed evidence of wolf ecomorph extinctions, coinciding with the great Pleistocene faunal turnover.
   Extant populations show recurrent long-range dispersal during cycles of expansion and recolonization. Demographically stable populations, in contrast, seem to be characterized by very limited gene flow.
   Despite the potential for dispersal and ecological flexibility, landscape genetic approaches have demonstrated the existence of genetically distinct wolf populations, which originated through habitat and prey specializations.
   Small isolated wolf populations may suffer from inbreeding depression, although selection for heterozygotes and the rescue effect can foster rapid population recovery. Population structure and dynamics is efficiently monitored by non-invasive genetic methods, which are also useful to identify wolf x dogCanis lupus familiaris hybridization.
   Despite technical advances and a better knowledge of wolf biology, wolf conservation is largely dependent on humans, and on the solution of conflicts with stakeholders.

AB The hyporheic zone (HZ) is thought to serve multiple functions for lotic invertebrates, but its role in the persistence of benthic assemblages after disturbances ('hyporheic refuge hypothesis', HRH) has never been clearly demonstrated since its initial proposal in 1953. Water exchanges through the HZ appear to be crucial in determining most hyporheic processes and subsequently, in controlling directly or indirectly the distribution of hyporheic assemblages. At present, it seems that the distribution of hyporheic refugia would also be controlled by hyporheic flowpaths, explaining the non-uniform response to the HRH documented in the literature. In light of recent developments in hyporheic hydrology, it is timely to propose research directions for understanding the distribution and patchiness of hyporheic refugia. This review proposes a framework of hypotheses, based on the recognition of hyporheic flowpaths across several scales and predicting the highest refugial capacity in large-scale upwelling zones. Outcomes from this framework include the development of physical indicators measuring the ability of the HZ to protect invertebrates, the identification of river areas demonstrating the highest refuge capacity (hyporheic hotspots) and the promotion in restoration projects of suitable hydrologic exchanges for enhancing the development of hyporheic hotspots.

AB P>1. Comprehensive knowledge of the fundamental spatial ecology of marine species is critical to allow the identification of key habitats and the likely sources of anthropogenic threats, thus informing effective conservation strategies.
   2. Research on migratory marine vertebrates has lagged behind many similar terrestrial animal groups, but studies using electronic tagging systems and molecular techniques offer great insights.
   3. Marine turtles have complex life history patterns, spanning wide spatio-temporal scales. As a result of this multidimensional complexity, and despite extensive effort, there are no populations for which a truly holistic understanding of the spatial aspects of the life history has been attained. There is a particular lack of information regarding the distribution and habitats utilized during the first few years of life.
   4. We used satellite tracking technology to track individual turtles following nesting at the green turtle Chelonia mydas nesting colony at Poilao Island, Guinea Bissau; the largest breeding aggregation in the eastern Atlantic.
   5. We further contextualize these data with pan-Atlantic molecular data and oceanographic current modelling to gain insights into likely dispersal patterns of hatchlings and small pelagic juveniles.
   6. All adult turtles remained in the waters of West Africa, with strong connectivity demonstrated with Banc D'Arguin, Mauritania.
   7. Despite shortcomings in current molecular markers, we demonstrate evidence for profound sub-structuring of marine turtle stocks across the Atlantic; with a high likelihood based on oceanographic modelling that most turtles from Guinea-Bissau are found in the eastern Atlantic.
   8. Synthesis and applications. There is an increased need for a better understanding of spatial distribution of marine vertebrates demonstrating life histories with spatio-temporal complexity. We propose the synergistic use of the technologies and modelling used here as a working framework for the future rapid elucidation of the range and likely key habitats used by the different life stages from such species.

AB The Chinese Central government's policy to re-vegetate large areas of the Loess Plateau is currently being rapidly implemented at the provincial, prefecture, county, township, and village levels of government. Managers at these five levels of government need access to information to assist them to plan the land use change prior to performing on-ground activities. To this end, the suitability of 38 predominately native species in the 113,000 km(2) Coarse Sandy Hilly Catchments (CSHC) has been mapped at a 100 m resolution. In this data-sparse region, this was achieved by using a five-variable spatial overlay approach as we were able to readily access the required environmental variables and rule-set defining the species' requirements (or tolerances). As the rules did not consider optimal growth they were possibly 'too inclusive', so the spatial extent of areas suggested for re-planting was refined by defining 'target areas' for trees, shrubs and grasses based on precipitation, aspect, landform, and slope. In the land-use planning criteria developed here we suggest that hill-slopes and gullies with slopes greater than or equal to 15 degrees (defined from a 100 m resolution DEM) be left for natural Succession. Due to lateral flow of water, sediment and nutrients from these steep slope and gullies, further prioritising re-vegetation target areas to the zone adjacent to and down slope from these steep portions of the landscape reduces sediment entering the river network with a minimal decrease of regional stream flow. These two functions (mapping species suitability and locating where priority and target re-vegetation activities should be undertaken) are available at a 100 m resolution for the entire CSHC by accessing a bilingual decision support tool called ReVegIH (Re-Vegetation Impacts on Hydrology). Finally, an ecohydrological model was used to simulate changes in average annual stream flow originating from the CSHC based on implementing the 'target' and 'priority' area re-vegetation activities within the constraints of two land limits.

AB 1. The bottlenose dolphins of Doubtful Sound, New Zealand are a declining population at the southern limit of the species' range, exposed to impacts from tourism and habitat modification. Patterns in apparent annual survival were analysed from photographic resightings of naturally marked adults (1990 to 2008) and calves within the first year of life (1994 to 2008) using capture-recapture models.
   2. The most parsimonious model for adults provided a time-invariant, sex-invariant estimate of survival (phi(a(1990-2008)) = 0.9374; 95% CI: 0.9170-0.9530), marginally lower than prior estimates for wild bottlenose dolphins.
   3. The most parsimonious model for calves indicated a significant time-variant decline in survival from an estimate similar to other populations (phi(c(1994-2001)) = 0.8621; 95% CI: 0.6851-0.9473) to a current estimate that is, to our knowledge, the lowest recorded for free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (phi(c(2002-2008)) = 0.3750; 95% CI: 0.2080-0.5782).
   4. Information theoretic evidence ratios suggested that observed patterns in calf survival were 22 times more likely to be explained by a decline coincident with the opening of a second tailrace tunnel for a hydroelectric power station than by a decline in any other year or across multiple years.
   5. Projections using an age-structured stochastic population model indicated that the current level of calf survival was unsustainable (population decline: 100% of model runs; population extinction: 41.5% of model runs) and was a key factor in the observed population decline in Doubtful Sound.

AB Theory for optimal allocation of foliar nitrogen (ONA) predicts that both nitrogen concentration and photosynthetic capacity will scale linearly with gradients of insolation within plant canopies. ONA is expected to allow plants to efficiently use both light and nitrogen. However, empirical data generally do not exhibit perfect ONA, and light-use optimization per se is little explored. The aim was to examine to what degree partitioning of nitrogen or light is optimized in the crowns of three tropical canopy tree species.
   Instantaneous photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) incident on the adaxial surface of individual leaves was measured along vertical PPFD gradients in tree canopies at a frequency of 0.5 Hz over 9-17 d, and summed to obtain the average daily integral of PPFD for each leaf to characterize its insolation regime. Also measured were leaf N per area (N-area), leaf mass per area (LMA), the cosine of leaf inclination and the parameters of the photosynthetic light response curve [photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), dark respiration (R-d), apparent quantum yield (phi) and curvature (theta)]. The instantaneous PPFD measurements and light response curves were used to estimate leaf daily photosynthesis (A(daily)) for each leaf.
   Leaf N-area and A(max) changed as a hyperbolic asymptotic function of the PPFD regime, not the linear relationship predicted by ONA. Despite this suboptimal nitrogen partitioning among leaves, A(daily) did increase linearly with PPFD regime through co-ordinated adjustments in both leaf angle and physiology along canopy gradients in insolation, exhibiting a strong convergence among the three species.
   The results suggest that canopy tree leaves in this tropical forest optimize photosynthetic use of PPFD rather than N per se. Tropical tree canopies then can be considered simple 'big-leaves' in which all constituent 'small leaves' use PPFD with the same photosynthetic efficiency.

AB Whilst there is a wealth of empirical studies that indicate negative ecosystem consequences of biodiversity loss, much debate remains over the existence, strength and importance of the same patterns in natural systems. We used a gradient of organic enrichment as a means of defining non-random species loss in the marine benthos and, using partial linear regression, determined the relative importance of macrofaunal biodiversity and the abiotic environment in affecting a benthic ecosystem process (bioturbation intensity; indicated by sediment mixing depth), that is important in mediating benthic functioning. Of the abiotic and biotic variables tested (n = 8), species richness and sediment total organic carbon (TOC) content together explained 65%, of the variability in this ecosystem process, with more than half of this variability explained solely by species richness. Importantly, the relative importance of biodiversity decreased at low levels of species richness and/or high levels of TOC. These results have profound implications for manipulative field experiments, where environmental factors are likely to dominate ecosystem processes, because the extent and importance of biological mediation could be underestimated. Our results also revealed that a large proportion of the explained variability in the ecosystem process is explained by the underlying reciprocal relationship (shared variability) between biodiversity and sediment TOC, highlighting the importance of species-environment interactions. If we are to fully appreciate the role of biodiversity in natural systems, Our findings suggest that the intimate relationship between species and their environment. needs to be more prominently featured in future studies that consider the ecosystem consequences of biodiversity loss,

AB Although the application of population and evolutionary genetic theory and methods to address issues of conservation relevance has a long history, the formalization of conservation genetics as a research field is still relatively recent. One of the periodic catalysts for increased research effort in the field has been advances in molecular technologies, leading to an increasingly wider variety of molecular markers for application in conservation genetic studies. To date, genetic methods have been applied in conservation biology primarily as selectively neutral molecular tools for resolving questions of conservation relevance. However, there has been renewed interest in complementing the analysis of neutral markers with the assessment of loci that may be directly involved in responses to processes such as environmental change, with a view to identifying the genes involved in them. These kinds of studies are now possible due to the increase in availability of genomic resources for nonmodel organisms, and there will likely be an even more rapid increase in the near future due to the advent of new ultra-high throughput-sequencing technologies. This review considers the implications of the most recent developments in genomic technologies and their potential for contributing to the conservation of populations and species. Three "conservation genomics" case studies are presented (Atlantic salmon, Salmo sala; the butterfly, Melitaea cinxia; and the California condor, Gymnogyps californianus) in order to demonstrate the diversity of applications now possible. While it is clear that genomics approaches in conservation will not replace other tried-and-true methods, these recent developments open up an exciting new range of possibilities that will enable further diversification of the application of genomics in conservation biology.

AB The main aims of this study are: (1) to test if temperature and related parameters are the primary determinants of the regional distribution of macrofungi (as is commonly recognized for plants); (2) to test if the success of modelling fungal distribution patterns depends on species and distribution characteristics; and (3) to explore the potential of using herbarium data for modelling and predicting fungal species' distributions.
   The study area, Norway, spans 58-71 degrees N latitude and 4-32 degrees E longitude, and embraces extensive ecological gradients in a small area.
   The study is based on 1020 herbarium collections of nine selected species of macrofungi and a set of 75 environmental predictor variables, all recorded in a 5 x 5-km grid covering Norway. Primarily, generalized linear model (GLM; logistic regression) analyses were used to identify the environmental variables that best accounted for the species' recorded distributions in Norway. Second, Maxent analyses (using variables identified by GLM) were used to produce predictive potential distribution maps for these species.
   Variables relating to temperature and radiation were most frequently included in the GLMs, and between 24.8% and 59.8% of the variation in single-species occurrence was accounted for. The fraction of variation explained by the GLMs ranged from 41.6% to 59.8% for species with restricted distributions, and from 24.8% to 39.3% for species with widespread/scattered and intermediate distributions. The two-step procedure of GLM followed by Maxent gave predictions with very high values for the area under the curve (0.927-0.997), and maps of potential distribution were generally credible.
   We show that temperature is a key factor governing the distribution of macrofungi in Norway, indicating that fungi may respond strongly to global warming. We confirm that modelling success depends partly on species and distribution characteristics, notably on how the distribution relates to the extent of the study area. Our study demonstrates that the combination of GLM and Maxent may be a fruitful approach for biogeography. We conclude that herbarium data improve insight into factors that control the distributions of fungi, of particular value for research on fleshy fungi (mushrooms), which have largely cryptic life cycles.

AB One particular challenge in reducing the loss of biodiversity by 2010, as agreed on at the Earth Summit in 2002, is to assign conservation tasks to geographic or administrative entities (e.g., countries or regions) on different geographical scales. To identify conservation tasks, it is imperative to determine the importance of a specific area for the global survival of a species. So far, these national or subnational responsibilities for the conservation of species have been included differently in methods prioritizing conservation. We reviewed how 12 European and 3 non-European methods determined national conservation responsibilities and evaluated the international importance of a biological population. Different countries used different methodologies, which made a direct comparison of assessments of national responsibilities among countries extremely difficult Differences existed in the importance criteria used. Criteria included population decline, range reduction, rarity status, degree of isolation of a population, endemism, proportional distribution, and geographic location. To increase comparability, it is imperative to develop criteria for which data are generally available and to standardize the methodology among countries. A standardized method would allow conservation decisions to be based on the conservation status of a species and on the responsibility of a geographic or administrative entity for the survival of a species. We suggest that such a method should use a scalable index of proportional distribution, taxonomic status, and the distribution pattern of a taxon or species as key elements. Such a method would allow for the creation of hierarchical lists and would be highly relevant for parts of the world with multiple political jurisdictions or state unions and for nations with regional governmental structures. Conservation priorities could then be reasonably set by combining national responsibility assessments with the international conservation status of a species.

AB To evaluate the sufficiency of US federal critical habitat designations and a proposed conservation plan in promoting the long-term persistence of the endangered plant AStragalus albens, patterns of genetic diversity and landscape connectivity were examined. A. albens harbors substantial genetic variation and shows no evidence of historic bottlenecks, suggesting little risk of extinction due to genetic homogeneity (A = 2.40; P = 0.50) or inbreeding (f = -0.08) within occurrences. Low genetic differentiation among occurrences (theta(p) = 0.01) indicates relatively high gene flow or little genetic drift. The 91 patches of A. albens were connected into a single network at a distance of 2100 m; 94% of patches were < 1000 m from at least one other patch. Managing ecological conditions that maintain large population sizes and connectivity among populations throughout the species' ecological and geographic ranges will most likely conserve existing diversity. Both reserve networks partially accomplish these goals by including most extant occurrences and > 89% of the aerial extent of the species, including the largest populations, and capturing all detected alleles. However, both conservation networks fail to conserve occurrences from one portion of the species' range, possibly speeding loss of unique local adaptations. in addition, connectivity of the whole network is reduced with the 65 patches designated as critical habitat being connected at a distance of 6200 m and the proposed reserve sites being connected at a distance of 9500 m. Although total network connectivity would be reduced, connectivity at scales most relevant to gene flow (e.g., < 1000 m) remains sufficiently in tact to provide a relatively promising outlook for species persistence.

AB Aim We investigated whether climate change has affected the potential feeding activity of a winter active larva, the pine processionary moth (PPM), Thaumetopoea pityocampa L., and whether it may explain its range expansion.
   Location The study area is France and, at a smaller scale, the Paris Basin.
   Methods We used a statistical model derived from Huchon and Demolin [1970 Revue Forestiere Francaise (special issue: La lutte biologique en foret), 220-234] to test whether their model, updated with climate change, could explain the observed range expansion. Since Battisti and colleagues have recently shown that climate could affect survival of the PPM through its effect on feeding activity, we also developed a mechanistic model based on larval feeding requirements (night air temperature above 0 degrees C and temperature inside the nest above 9 degrees C on the preceding day). We reconstructed the geographical distribution of feeding activity and we compared the resulting change with the PPM range expansion.
   Results The statistical model did not successfully predict the observed expansion but the mechanistic model showed considerable change in the feeding activity of the PPM. In the Paris Basin, the PPM border coincided with a zone unfavourable for feeding activity in the period 1992-96. Feeding conditions became more favourable in the period 2001-04, and the PPM succeeded in crossing this zone. Over larger temporal and spatial scales improved feeding conditions in the north-western part of France were forecast by the mechanistic model.
   Main conclusions (1) The range distribution of the PPM in the Paris Basin is no longer limited by unfavourable feeding conditions. (2) The pattern of range expansion of the PPM is now governed mainly by its dispersal capabilities and host tree distribution. (3) At the country scale, this approach gives an approximate prediction of the potential distribution of the PPM, though the model may not be reliable in mountainous regions.

AB Mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers were applied to infer the phylogeography, intraspecific diversity and dynamics of the distributional history of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) with focus on its central and northern European distribution range. Phylogenetic and nested clade analyses revealed at least four major mtDNA lineages, which evolved in geographical isolation during the Pleistocene. These lineages should be recognized as the basic evolutionary significant units (ESUs) for grayling in central and northern Europe. In addition, and in contrast to previous work on grayling, the results of Bayesian analysis of individual admixture coefficients, two-dimensional scaling analysis and spatial analysis of molecular variance provided evidence for a high level of admixture among major lineages in contact zones between drainages (e.g. the low mountain range of Germany), most likely resulting from glacial perturbations and ancient river connections between drainages during the Pleistocene glaciations. Even within river systems, a high level of differentiation among populations was revealed as indicated by the microsatellite data. Grayling sampled from 29 sites displayed high levels of differentiation (overall F-ST = 0.367), a high number of private alleles and high bootstrap support for the genetic distance-based population clusters across 12 loci. We specifically discuss our results in context of phylogeograpic studies on other European freshwater fish species with habitat preferences similar to those of grayling. Our study shows that both large-scale phylogeographical and detailed genetic analyses on a fine scale are mandatory for developing appropriate conservation guidelines of endangered species.

AB We conducted a demographic and genetic study to investigate the effects of fragmentation due to the establishment of an exotic softwood plantation on populations of a small marsupial carnivore, the agile antechinus (Antechinus agilis), and the factors influencing the persistence of those populations in the fragmented habitat. The first aspect of the study was a descriptive analysis of patch occupancy and population size, in which we found a patch occupancy rate of 70% among 23 sites in the fragmented habitat compared to 100% among 48 sites with the same habitat characteristics in unfragmented habitat. Mark-recapture analyses yielded most-likely population size estimates of between 3 and 85 among the 16 occupied patches in the fragmented habitat. Hierarchical partitioning and model selection were used to identify geographic and habitat-related characteristics that influence patch occupancy and population size. Patch occupancy was primarily influenced by geographic isolation and habitat quality (vegetation basal area). The variance in population size among occupied sites was influenced primarily by forest type (dominant Eucalyptus species) and, to a lesser extent, by patch area and topographic context (gully sites had larger populations). A comparison of the sex ratios between the samples from the two habitat contexts revealed a significant deficiency of males in the fragmented habitat. We hypothesise that this is due to male-biased dispersal in an environment with increased dispersal-associated mortality. The population size and sex ratio data were incorporated into a simulation study to estimate the proportion of genetic diversity that would have been lost over the known timescale since fragmentation if the patch populations had been totally isolated. The observed difference in genetic diversity (gene diversity and allelic richness at microsatellite and mitochondrial markers) between 16 fragmented and 12 unfragmented sites was extremely low and inconsistent with the isolation of the patch populations. Our results show that although the remnant habitat patches comprise approximately 2% of the study area, they can support non-isolated populations. However, the distribution of agile antechinus populations in the fragmented system is dependent on habitat quality and patch connectivity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We sequenced most of the mitochondrial genome of the sawfly Perga condei (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Symphyta: Pergidae) and tested different models of phylogenetic reconstruction in order to resolve the position of the Hymenoptera within the Holometabola, using mitochondrial genomes. The mitochondrial genome sequenced for P. condei had less compositional bias and slower rates of molecular evolution than the honeybee, as well as a less rearranged genome organization. Phylogenetic analyses showed that, when using mitochondrial genomes, both adequate taxon sampling and more realistic models of analysis are necessary to resolve relationships among insect orders. Both parsimony and Bayesian analyses performed better when nucleotide instead of amino acid sequences were used. In particular, this study supports the placement of the Hymenoptera as sister group to the Mecopterida. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Distribution patterns of epibenthic assemblages, sea urchins and fishes were assessed in NE Sardinia (Mediterranean Sea) in shallow (4 to 7 m depth) rocky habitats with 2 rock-type substrates, i.e. limestone and granite, to examine possible differences related to the mineralogical composition of rocks. Sessile organisms and sea urchins were sampled in situ within quadrats. Fishes were assessed by visual census transects. Sessile epibenthic assemblages significantly differed between granite and limestone substrates, and the number of epibenthic sessile taxa was greater on limestone. Average cover of the algae mat (unidentified mixture of filamentous and mucilaginous algae) was significantly greater on granite than limestone, while no significant differences were detected in total cover or in the average cover of the remaining most common epibenthic taxa. Densities of sea urchins (i.e. Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula) did not differ between the 2 rock types. Fish assemblages were significantly different between granite and limestone rock substrates. Labrids of the genus Symphodus and Serranus scriba were more abundant on granite, whereas Serranus cabrilla, Parablennius rouxi, Gobius bucchichi and Thalassoma pavo showed greater densities on limestone. Sarpa salpa (the most important herbivorous fish in the Mediterranean sublittoral) did not show any significant difference between granite and limestone substrates. These results suggest that rock type may have the potential to influence marine assemblages, probably through direct effects on epibenthic organisms (e.g. the presence of quartz and substrate texture, both related to the mineralogical features of rocks), and indirect effects on fishes (e.g. the influence of the structure of the epibenthic cover). These results suggest a possible role of the mineralogical composition of rocks in 'bottom-up' processes influencing marine assemblages in shallow sublittoral rocky habitats in the Mediterranean, where direct effects on sessile organisms (e.g. macroalgae) may cascade up through the entire community and affect higher trophic levels (e.g. carnivorous fishes). However, extensive experimental work is needed before drawing any conclusion about the specific processes determining the patterns we observed.

AB We used mitochondrial DNA control-region and microsatellite data to infer the evolutionary history and past demographic changes in 332 rock partridges (Alectoris graeca ) sampled from throughout the species' distribution range, with the exception of the central Balkans region. Maternal and biparental DNA markers indicated concordantly that rock partridge populations are structured geographically (mtDNA phi(ST) = 0.86, microsatellite F (ST) = 0.35; R (ST) = 0.31; P < 0.001). Phylogenetic analyses of 22 mtDNA haplotypes identified two major phylogroups (supported by bootstrap values = 93%), splitting partridges from Sicily vs. all the other sampled populations at an average Tamura-Nei genetic distance of 0.035, which corresponds to 65% of the average distance between closely related species of Alectoris . Coalescent estimates of divergence times suggested that rock partridges in Sicily were isolated for more than 200 000 years. This deep subdivision was confirmed by multivariate, Bayesian clustering and population assignment analyses of microsatellite genotypes, which supported also a subdivision of partridges from the Alps vs. populations in the Apennines, Albania and Greece. Partridges in the Apennines and Albania-Greece were probably connected by gene flow since recently through a late Pleistocene Adriatic landbridge. Deglaciated Alps were probably colonized by distinct and, perhaps, not yet sampled source populations. Bottleneck and mismatch analyses indicate that rock partridges have lost variability through past population declines, and did not expand recently. Deglaciated areas could have been recolonized without any strong demographic expansion. Genetic data partially supported subspecies subdivisions, and allowed delimiting distinct conservation units. Rock partridges in Sicily, formally recognized as A. g. whitakeri , met the criteria for a distinct evolutionary significant unit.

AB Aim The purpose of this study was to quantify relationships between conifer species distributions and climatic and biophysical variables, in order to provide better insight into the potential for redistribution of species on the landscape in response to climatic change.
   Location Data are from 10,653 georeferenced sites in Washington State, USA, along a longitudinal gradient from west of the crest of the Cascade Range to the beginnings of the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, and across two physiographic provinces, the Northern Cascades, characterized by steep, rugged topography, and the Okanogan Highlands, presenting moderate slopes and broad rounded summits.
   Methods Tree data were drawn from the USDA Forest Service Area Ecology Program database, collected in mature, undisturbed stands. We compared simple climatic variables (annual temperature, growing-degree days, annual and seasonal precipitation) to biophysical variables (soil, hydrologic, and solar radiation) derived from climatic variables. Climatic and biophysical variables were taken from the output of climatological and hydrological simulation models and estimated for each plot in the tree database. Generalized linear models were used, for each of fourteen tree species, at multiple spatial extents, to estimate the probability of occurrence of that species as a function of climatic and biophysical predictors. Models were validated by a combination of bootstrapping and estimating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
   Results For the majority of species, we were able to fit variables representing both moisture and temperature gradients, and in all but a few cases these models identified a unimodal response of species occurrence to these gradients. In some cases the ecological/environmental niche of a species had been clearly captured by the model, whereas in others a longer gradient in the predictor variable(s) would be needed. Responses of most species were consistent across three spatial scales.
   Main conclusions By identifying the ecological niches of multiple species, we can forecast their redistribution on the landscape in response to climatic change, evaluate the predictions of simulation models, and alert managers to particularly sensitive or vulnerable ecosystems and landscapes.

AB 1. The responses of night-time dark respiration (R-d) to temperature and leaf characteristics were measured through the canopies of tree species from two distinct forests - an oak-dominated deciduous forest in north-eastern USA, and a conifer-dominated temperate rainforest in New Zealand. These were chosen to examine the extent to which canopy level changes in dark respiration can be applied across forest biomes, and the appropriateness of scaling rules to calculations of whole-canopy carbon efflux.
   2. The response of respiration to temperature differed significantly between species and with height in the canopy. This involved changes in both R-d at a reference temperature, and the extent to which R-d increased with temperature (described by the energy of activation, E-o, or the change in R-d over a 10 degreesC range, Q(10)). E-o ranged from 25 (lower-canopy leaves) to 53.8 kJ mol(-1) K-1 (upper-canopy leaves) in the deciduous forest, and from 24-37 kJ mol(-1) K-1 in the temperate rainforest site.
   3. Relationships between respiratory and leaf characteristics indicated that the instantaneous rate of respiration covaries with soluble sugar concentration and leaf nitrogen, but the temperature response of respiration (E-o or Q(10)) appears to be driven by leaf N.
   4. Scaling leaf respiratory carbon loss to the whole-canopy level indicated that simplifying assumptions regarding the variation in respiration and its temperature response with canopy height tend to underestimate carbon loss if the assumptions are based on lower-canopy leaf physiology, but overestimate carbon loss if the assumptions are based on upper-canopy physiology. Thus, canopy-level differences in leaf respiratory characteristics should be considered in modelling efforts attempting to estimate whole-canopy respiration.

AB Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are uniquely responsible for converting nucleotides to deoxynucleotides in all dividing cells. The three known classes of RNRs operate through a free radical mechanism but differ in the way in which the protein radical is generated. Class I enzymes depend on oxygen for radical generation, class 11 uses adenosylcobalamin, and the anaerobic class III requires S-adenosylmethionine and an iron-sulfur cluster. Despite their metabolic prominence, the evolutionary origin and relationships between these enzymes remain elusive. This gap in RNR knowledge can, to a major extent, be attributed to the fact that different RNR classes exhibit greatly diverged polypeptide chains, rendering homology assessments inconclusive. Evolutionary studies of RNRs conducted until now have focused on comparison of the amino acid sequence of the proteins, without considering how they fold into space. The present study is an attempt to understand the evolutionary history of RNRs taking into account their three-dimensional structure. We first infer the structural alignment by superposing the equivalent stretches of the three-dimensional structures of representatives of each family. We then use the structural alignment to guide the alignment of all publicly available RNR sequences. Our results support the hypothesis that the three RNR classes diverged from a common ancestor currently represented by the anaerobic class III. Also, lateral transfer appears to have played a significant role in the evolution of this protein family.

AB A greenhouse study compared six warm season turfgrasses common bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.], 'Tifway' hybrid bermudagrass (C. dactylon x transvaalensis), centipedegrass (Eremochloa ophiuroides (Munro) Hack.), 'Raleigh' St. Augustinegrass [Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walter) Kuntze], 'Meyer' zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Stead.), and 'Emerald' zoysiagrass (Z. japonica X tenulfolia) for NO(3)-N leaching and N use efficiency. Sod was established in sand-filled columns and managed under worst-case conditions to promote nitrate leaching. Ammonium nitrate was applied at 50 kg N ha I on seven dates, with the final application labeled with IN. Leachate samples were collected and analyzed for NO(3)-N and NH(4)-N and clippings were analyzed for total N. Leaching losses were high following the first N application, ranging from 48 to 100% of the NO(3)-N and 4 to 16% of the NH(4)-N applied. Nitrate loss from subsequent applications was reduced substantially, while NH(4) leaching was essentially eliminated. There were significant differences among species for leachate NO(3)-N concentration and cumulative N leached, with St. Augustinegrass being the most effective and Meyer zoysiagrass the least effective at minimizing NO(3) leaching. Nitrogen recovery by the turf ranged from 63% for Meyer zoysiagrass to 84% for hybrid bermudagrass. Root length density (RLD) varied significantly among species at depths >30 cm, and was negatively correlated with NO(3) leaching loss. These results document differences between the warm season turfgrasses for NO(3) leaching potential, possibly related to root distribution, and emphasize that species selection is an important factor in minimizing environmental impacts from turfgrass management.

   RESPONSES
AB Environmental stresses affect plant growth and performance in nature. Host plant quality in turn affects herbivore performance and population dynamics. In view of these interactions, two major hypotheses were formulated. The plant stress hypothesis proposes that physiologically stressed plants become more susceptible to herbivores. The plant vigour hypothesis proposes that plants that grow vigorously are favourable to herbivores. Here we test the plant stress/plant vigour hypotheses for a leaf miner, Agromyza nigripes (Diptera, Agromyzidae), on the grass Holcus lanatus. We assessed larval performance (survival, developmental time, pupal mass) on grasses growing under different levels of nutrients (Hoagland solution) and drought stress, under controlled field and greenhouse conditions. Plant vigour and nutrient content were high on soils with an intermediate nutrient concentration and lower under drought stress and soil nutrient shortage and overdose. Larval performance was also highest on wet soils with intermediate nutrient supply. The results of the mining flies support the plant vigour hypothesis (density, survival and development better on vigorous plants). Herbivore performance is higher on leaves with a higher protein content.

AB The flora and fauna of Europe are linked by a common biogeographic history, most recently the Pleistocene glaciations that restricted the range of most species to southern refugial populations. Changes in population size and migration, as well as selection, have all left a signature on the genetic differentiation. Thus, three paradigms of postglacial recolonization have been described, inferred from the patterns of DNA differentiation. Yet some species, especially wide-ranging carnivores, exhibit little population structuring between the proposed refugia, although relatively few have been studied due to the difficulty of obtaining samples. Therefore, we investigated mitochondrial variation in pine martens, Martes martes, in order to understand the extent to which they were affected by glacial cycles, and compared the results with an analysis of sequences from polecats, Mustela putorius. A general lack of ancient lineages, and a mismatch distribution that is consistent with an expanding population, is evidence that the present-day M. martes and Mu. putorius in central and northern Europe colonized from a single European refugium following a recent glaciation. There has also been interspecific mitochondrial introgression between M. martes and the sable M. zibellina in Fennoscandia.

AB Soilless plant growth systems are widely used as a means to save irrigation water and to reduce groundwater contamination. While nutrient concentrations in the growth medium are depleted due to uptake by the plants, salinity and toxic substances accumulate due to transpiration. A theoretical model is suggested, to simulate nutrient uptake by plants grown in soilless cultures with recycled solutions. The model accounts for salinity accumulation with time and plant growth, and its effects on uptake of the different nutrients by means of interaction with Na and Cl ions. The sink term occurs due to uptake by a growing root system. Influx as a function of the ion concentration is according to Michaelis-Menten active mechanisms for K+, NO3--N, NH4+-N, PO4-P, Ca2+, Mg2+ and SO42-, whose influx parameters are affected by Na and Cl-, but not with time (age). Sodium influx is passive above a critical concentration. Sum of cations-anions concentrations is balanced by Cl- to maintain electro-neutrality of the growth solution. Salinity (by means of Na concentration) suppresses root and leaf growth, which further effect uptake and transpiration. The model accounts for instantaneous transpiration losses, during daytime only and its effect on uptake of nutrients and plant development due to salt accumulation. The model was tested against NO3- and K+ uptake by plants associated with cumulative transpiration and with different NaCl salinity levels. Deviations from observed K+ uptake should be attributed to the salinity tolerance of the plants. In a study with data obtained from published literature, the model indicated that nutrient depletion and salinity buildup might be completely different with fully grown-up plants (that do not grow) and plants that grow with time. Depletion of different nutrients are according to their initial concentration and plant uptake rate, but also affected by their interactions with Na and Cl ions.

AB Most molecular phylogenetic studies of vertebrates have been based on DNA sequences of mitochondrial-encoded genes. MtDNA evolves rapidly and is thus particularly useful for resolving relationships among recently evolved groups. However, it has the disadvantage that all of the mitochondrial genes are inherited as a single linkage group so that only one independent gene tree can be inferred regardless of the number of genes sequenced. Introns of nuclear genes are attractive candidates for independent sources of rapidly evolving DNA: they are pervasive, most of their nucleotides appear to be unconstrained by selection, and PCR primers can be designed for sequences in adjacent exons where nucleotide sequences are conserved. We sequenced intron 7 of the beta-fibrinogen gene (beta-fibint7) for a diversity of woodpeckers and compared the phylogenetic signal and nucleotide substitution properties of this DNA sequence with that of mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome b (cyt b) from a previous study. A few indels (insertions and deletions) were found in the beta-fibint7 sequences, but alignment was not difficult, and the indels were phylogentically informative. The beta-fibint7 and cyt b gene trees were nearly identical to each other but differed in significant ways from the traditional woodpecker classification. Cyt 6 evolves 2.8 times as fast as beta-fibint7 (14.0 times as fast at third codon positions). Despite its relatively slow substitution rate, the phylogenetic signal in beta-fibint7 is comparable to that in cyt b for woodpeckers, because beta-fibint7 has less base composition bias and more uniform nucleotide substitution probabilities. As a consequence, compared with cyt b, beta-fibint7 nucleotide sites are expected to enter more distinct character states over the course of evolution and have fewer multiple substitutions and lower levels of homoplasy. Moreover, in contrast to cyt b, in which nearly two thirds of nucleotide sites rarely vary among closely related taxa, virtually all beta-fibint7 nucleotide sites appear free of selective constraints, which increases informative sites per unit sequenced. However, the estimated gamma distribution used to model rate variation among sites suggests constraints on some beta-fibint7 sites. This study suggests that introns will be useful for phylogenetic studies of recently evolved groups.

AB Pituophis melanoleucus (gopher, bull, and pine-snakes) is among the most widely distributed polytypic species complexes in North America, with most authors recognizing from a single transcontinental species (the melanoleucus complex, composed of 15 subspecies) to four (monotypic and polytypic) species. We used mitochondrial gene sequences from the two middle American species, P. deppei and P. lineaticollis, and from 13 subspecies from most of the range of the melanoleucus complex to test various phylogenetic hypotheses for Pituophis. Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods identified the same major clades within Pituophis and indicated that two segments of the melanoleucus complex, the lodingi-melanoleucus-mugitus eastern pinesnake clade and the affinis-annectens-bimaris-catenifer-deserticola-sayi-ruthveni vertebralis clade from central and western United States and northern Mexico, represent divergent, allopatric lineages with no known intergradation zone. We recognize each of these two groupings as a different species. Our data also indicate that some ruthveni are more closely related to sayi than to other ruthveni. Nonetheless, ruthveni is an allopatric taxon diagnosable from its closest relatives by a combination of morphometric characters, and because it is likely that at least some of these traits are independent and genetically inherited, we interpret this as evidence that ruthveni has attained the status of independent evolutionary lineage, despite the fact that it retains strong genetic affinities with sayi. The endemic Baja Californian gopher snakes (bimaris and vertebralis) are considered by some taxonomists as a different species, P. vertebralis, but we discovered that these serpents belong to two different clades and hence we do not agree with the recognition of P. vertebralis as presently defined. In summary, we believe that three distinct species are included in the melanoleucus complex, Pituophis melanoleucus (sensu stricto), P. catenifer, and P. ruthveni, and that their recognition better represents the evolutionary diversity within this species complex, (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB Nucleotide sequences of exon 28 of the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) were analyzed for a representative sampling of rodent families and eutherian orders, with one marsupial sequence as outgroup. The aim of this study was to test if inclusion of an increased taxonomic diversity in molecular analyses would shed light on three uncertainties concerning rodent phylogeny: (1) relationships between rodent families, (2) Rodentia monophyly, and (3) the sister group relationship of rodents and lagomorphs. The results did not give evidence of any particular rodent pattern of molecular evolution relative to a general eutherian pattern. Base compositions and rates of evolution of vWF sequences of rodents were in the range of placental variation. The 10 rodent families studied here cluster in five clades: Hystricognathi, Sciuridae and Aplodontidae (Sciuroidea), Muridae, Dipodidae, and Gliridae. Among hystricognaths, the following conclusions are drawn: a single colonization event in South America by Caviomorpha, a paraphyly of Old World and New World porcupines, and an African origin for Old World porcupines. Despite a broader taxonomic sampling diversity, we did not obtain a robust answer to the question of Rodentia monophyly, but in the absence of any other alternative, we cannot reject the hypothesis of a single origin of rodents. Moreover, the phylogenetic position of Lagomorpha remains totally unsettled.

AB Photosynthetic characteristics of 1- and 2-year-old needles were determined in excised shoots of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) with an open gas exchange system. We used the nonlinear least mean squares method to derive values for quantum yield of electron transport (alpha), maximum carboxylation velocity (V-cmax), and maximum electron transport rate (J(max)), from photosynthetic response curves to light and CO2. Crown height had no significant effect on any of the parameters; however, V-cmax and J(max), as well as a were 43, 26 and 35% higher, respectively, in 1-year-old needles than in 2-year-old needles. The main effect of irradiance on needles was a small decline in leaf concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus from the top to the bottom of the canopy. Only J(max) demonstrated a linear relationship with both nitrogen content (R-2 = 0.42) and irradiance at the shoot level. Because needle age accounted for most of the variability in photosynthesis, we incorporated needle age into the photosynthesis model of Farquhar et al. (1980). The modified model underestimated the daily assimilation rate of 1-year-old needles in the field, especially when assimilation rates were high.

AB We hypothesized that photoinhibition of shade-developed leaves of deciduous hardwood saplings would limit their ability to acclimate photosynthetically to increased irradiance, and we predicted that shade-tolerant sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) would be more susceptible to photoinhibition than intermediately shade-tolerant red oak (Quercus rubra L.). After four weeks in a canopy gap, photosynthetic rates of shade-developed leaves of both species had increased in response to the increase in irradiance, although final acclimation was more complete in red oak. However, photoinhibition occurred in both species, as indicated by short-term reductions in maximum rates of net photosynthesis and the quantum yield of oxygen evolution, and longer-term reductions in the efficiency of excitation energy capture by open photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers (dark-adapted F-v/F-m) and the quantum yield of PSII in the light (phi(PSII)). The magnitude and duration of this decrease were greater in sugar maple than in red oak, suggesting greater susceptibility to photoinhibition in sugar maple. Photoinhibition may have resulted from photodamage, but it may also have involved sustained rates of photoprotective energy dissipation (especially in red oak). Photosynthetic acclimation also appeared to be linked to an ability to increase leaf nitrogen content. Limited photosynthetic acclimation in shade-developed sugar maple leaves may reflect a trade-off between shade-tolerance and rapid acclimation to a canopy gap.

AB Temporal variability in the size, age, and biochemical composition of newly settled fish of 2 tropical reef species, Pomacentrus amboinensis and P. nagasakiensis, were examined over 3 recruitment seasons in the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Juveniles of both species were more variable in composition (CV: 32.2 to 35.8%) than size (CV: 5.1 to 5.3%) and age (CV: 7.2 to 8.4%) at settlement. Overall, P. amboinensis settled over a range of ages from 15 to 23 d, while the larval duration of P. nagasakiensis ranged from 16 to 24 d. The biochemical composition of both species varied among lunar recruitment pulses. Strong interannual differences in the composition (principally carbohydrate and protein) of P. amboinensis juveniles were detected. This variability in nutritional condition of newly settled fish has important implications for future patterns of post-settlement growth and development. P. amboinensis and P. nagasakiensis settling during a single lunar recruitment episode (pulse) differed in length, body depth, and weight. On average P. nagasakiensis were 2 mm longer and 0.03 g heavier at settlement than P. amboinensis. P. nagasakiensis attained this larger size at settlement by means of a higher average growth rate during the larval period. Juveniles of both pomacentrid species settling at the same time were very similar in nutritional condition. Fish settling in the first pulse of the recruitment season weighed less and contained less lipid than recruits settling in the following month. This suggests that the effect of processes in the pelagic environment controlling the accumulation of energy reserves in juvenile stages of reef fish are not necessarily species specific.

AB The degree to which local-scale spatial variation in larval supply predicted subsequent patterns in juvenile densities was examined for a planktivorous damselfish (Dascyllus trimaculatus) at Moorea, French Polynesia. D. trimaculatus young settle from the plankton to sea anemones, where they remain until becoming free-ranging adults. Daily settlement onto anemones without fish was estimated at several sites in a lagoon for one 14-day period and compared with patterns in the density of juveniles that had accrued after 10 successive settlement periods. Spatial variation attributable to larval supply occurred mostly among individual anemones, between the halves of each study site, and among different locations in the lagoon. In contrast, there was relatively little variation at any spatial scale in the density of young after 10 settlement pulses. Several mechanisms were examined that could account for the observed reduction in spatial variance through time, and three involving interactions with young already present were implicated. First, settlement was not independent of residents (the density of young already on an anemone); compared with the absence of fish, settlement was facilitated at low and inhibited at high densities of residents. Second, older juveniles moved among local anemones, and the immigration and emigration rates per capita varied with density on an anemone. Finally, per capita mortality during the first few days after settlement was density-dependent. These findings emphasize the critical need to distinguish among effects that arise from the delivery of larvae, the availability of appropriate habitat, and interactions that affect fish at settlement and immediately thereafter.

AB The present study explores the potential contribution of the energy requirements associated with nocturnal carbohydrate export to (1) the fraction of dark respiration correlating with leaf nitrogen concentration and (2) the dark respiration of mature source leaves. To this end, we determined the nocturnal carbohydrate-export rates from leaves with an optimal nitrogen supply, and the correlation between the nitrogen concentration and the dark respiration of leaves. The specific energy costs of carbohydrate export from starch-storing source leaves were determined both experimentally and theoretically. The present estimate of the specific energy cost involved in carbohydrate export as obtained by linear regression (0.70 mol CO2 [mol sucrose](-1)), agrees well with both literature data obtained by different methods (0.47 to 1.26 mol CO2 [mol sucrose](-1)) and the theoretically calculated range for starch-storing species (0.40 to 1.20 mol CO2 [mel sucrose](-1)). The conversion of starch in the chloroplast to sucrose in the cytosol is a major energy-requiring process. Maximally 42 to '107'% of the slope of the relationship between respiration rate and organic nitrogen concentration of primary bean leaves, may be ascribed to the energy costs associated with nocturnal export of carbohydrates. Total energy costs associated with export were derived from the product of the specific costs of carbohydrate export and the export rates, either measured on full-grown (primary) leaves of potato and bean or derived from the literature. These export costs account, on average, for 29% of the dark respiration rate in starch-storing species. We conclude that nocturnal carbohydrate export is a major energy-requiring process in starch-storing species.

AB On the basis of detailed numerical simulations, Field (1983. Oecologia 56, 341-347) stated that total canopy photosynthesis will be a maximum for a fixed total canopy leaf nitrogen provided the derivative partial derivative A/partial derivative N, where A is photosynthetic rate and N is leaf nitrogen concentration, has the same value throughout the canopy. This paper uses the calculus of variations to formally prove Field's assertion. It shows that if the single-leaf light response is a first-degree homogeneous function of both light-saturated photosynthetic rate A(max) and intensity I of photosynthetically active radiation and if A(max) is linearly related to N, then the optimal distribution of leaf nitrogen is linearly related to the decline in I with canopy depth, and A(max) is proportional to this decline. The nature of photosynthetic gains due to optimisation of canopy nitrogen distribution is illustrated numerically for a simple model canopy. It is found that, for canopies with fixed mean leaf nitrogen, canopy photosynthesis is approximately proportional to canopy leaf area index (LAI), and the gain due to canopy optimisation compared with a uniform canopy is small for shallow canopies but pronounced for deep canopies. It is also found that, for canopies with fixed total leaf nitrogen, there is a canopy LAI which maximises canopy photosynthesis, and that this LAI and the corresponding canopy photosynthesis are approximately proportional to total canopy nitrogen.

AB Spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were isolated from two soils of field trials at INRA-Bordeaux (France) polluted by long-term application of a zinc-polluted sewage sludge (S2 soil) or treated with cadmium nitrate (Cd40 soil) and from corresponding unpolluted soils (F and Cd0 soils). These AM fungi were tested for their tolerance to Cd and Zn added as salt solutions with increasing concentrations (0 to 10 mg L(-1)) in a simple spore germination device.
   According to preliminary identification the predominant species in S2 and F cultures was Glomus mosseae, whereas Cd40 and Cd0 cultures contained a mixture of at least G. mosseae and G. etunicatum. Germination of Cd40 spores was more tolerant to Cd and Zn than for Cd0 spores, with EC(50) values of 73 and 158 mu mol L(-1) added Cd and Zn corresponding to approximately 10 and 13 mu mol L(-1) remaining in solution in the device. The S2 spores from the sludge contaminated soil were more tolerant to Zn (EC(50) = 87 mu mol L(-1)), but not to Cd (EC(50) = 7.5 mu mol L(-1)), than the spores from the farmyard manure-treated F soil (EC(50) = 38 and 8.8 mu mol L(-1), respectively). Thus, S2 culture exhibited a specific tolerance to Zn, which was lower than the unspecific tolerance of Cd40 culture to both Cd and Zn, despite the much higher Zn availability in S2 soil.
   These results indicate that AM fungi from different soils may differ in their metal susceptibility and that both metal specific and unspecific tolerance mechanisms may be selected in metal polluted soils.

AB Alternative ecological models make different predictions about the long-term influences of recruitment, mortality and density upon the demography and abundance of populations of coral reef fishes. Recent validation of protocols for aging tropical fish to year-class provided the basis for testing some of these predictions. Specifically, we assessed the influence of recruitment variability on populations by comparing age structures for two species of damselfish (Pomacentus moluccensis and P. wardi) with long-term (9 year) recruitment records from seven coral reefs located on the southern Great Barrier Reef. Detailed comparisons are given for two reefs: Wistari, which was a high recruitment reef for P. wardi and a low recruitment reef for P. moluccensis, and Lady Musgrave, which displayed the opposite pattern. Both species lived longer on Wistari relative to Lady Musgrave suggesting that longevity is controlled by local predator populations independent of conspecific density. On Wistari, where turnover was lower, the age structures of both species were positively correlated with the initial sizes of the corresponding year-classes (for the 9 youngest cohorts). On Lady Musgrave, clear relationships were only evident for the 4/5 most recent year-classes because of the depletion of older cohorts. Most age structures contained evidence of one or more dominant cohorts among the older age classes attributable to strong recruitment in the past. Age-specific mortality schedules varied between reefs; a linear model provided the best fit in all cases although those from -Wistari had little slope and high variability relative to populations from Lady Musgrave. The mortality schedules for P. wardi contained possible evidence of compensatory responses among cohorts but these patterns were weak and ambiguous compared to the influence of temporal and spatial variability in recruitment on age structure and abundance. The latter was able to account for 90% of the variability in abundance observed across species and reefs for the full data set. These comparisons indicate that the abundances of both species were determined by variable patterns of recruitment interacting with relatively uniform and non-compensatory mortality. Consequently, coral reefs that received higher recruitment of either species simply accumulated more fish with no evidence of saturation from the highest levels observed over a 9-year period.

AB The effect of nitrogen supply during growth on the contribution of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco; EC 4.1.1.39) to the control of photosynthesis was examined in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). Transgenic plants transformed with antisense rbcS to produce a series of plants with a progressive decrease in the amount of Rubisco were used to allow the calculation of the flux-control coefficient of Rubisco for photosynthesis (C(R)). Several points emerged from the data: (i) The strength of Rubisco control of photosynthesis, as measured by C(R), was altered by changes in the short-term environmental conditions. Generally, C(R) was increased in conditions of increased irradiance or decreased CO2. (ii) The amount of Rubisco in wild-type plants was reduced as the nitrogen supply during growth was reduced and this was associated with an increase in C(R). This implied that there was a specific reduction in the amount of Rubisco compared with other components of the photosynthetic machinery. (iii) Plants grown with low nitrogen and which had genetically reduced levels of Rubisco had a higher chlorophyll content and a lower chlorophyll a/b ratio than wild-type plants. This indicated that the nitrogen made available by genetically reducing the amount of Rubisco had been re-allocated to other cellular components including light-harvesting and electron-transport proteins. It is argued that there is a "luxury" additional investment of nitrogen into Rubisco in tobacco plants grown in high nitrogen, and that Rubisco can also be considered a nitrogen-store, all be it one where the opportunity cost of the nitrogen storage is higher than in a non-functional storage protein (i.e. it allows for a slightly higher water-use efficiency and for photosynthesis to respond to temporarily high irradiance).

AB Plant stress theory predicts and many observational studies support the notion that abiotic stress can increase plant quality and benefit the performance of phytophagous insects.  Paradoxically, numerous experiments contradict this assumption.  To test the theory, we conducted experiments to determine the influence of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) stress on pinyon sawfly (Neodiprion edulicolis) performance.  In a natural pinyon population, we transferred first-instar sawfly larvae to 41 trees divided into four groups of 11; each group received either water, fertilizer, water and fertilizer, or no supplements.  Upon completion of their penultimate larval instar, we collected sawflies and determined their fecundity and sex ratios.  Although sex ratios are rarely used to estimate insect performance in natural systems, we believe that their sensitivity to changes in plant quality may play an overlooked role in insect-plant interactions.
   Most of our results refuted theoretical predictions, because sawflies performed better on trees receiving both water and fertilizer.  However, in some cases, sawflies did benefit from pinyon stress.  We contend that "simultaneous plant stress," such as low precipitation while the insect is feeding or ovipositing, can reduce performance.  In contrast, "sustained plant stress," such as chronically poor soil conditions or prolonged drought, can benefit insect performance.  These different effects on herbivores may parsimoniously explain some discrepancies between theoretical and empirical plant stress studies.

AB Previously it was reported that significant amounts of the tomato phenolic, chlorogenic acid, were oxidized in the digestive system of generalist feeders Spodoptera exigua and Helicoverpa zea. The covalent binding of the oxidized phenolic (i.e., quinone) to dietary protein exerts a strong antinutritive effect against larvae.  In this study, we examined the fate of ingested chlorogenic acid in larval Manduca sexta, a leaf-feeding specialist of solanaceous plants.  Significant amounts of chlorogenic acid were bound to excreted protein by M. sexta when larvae fed on tomato foliage.  However, in the case of M. sexta we suggest that the strong alkalinity and detergency of the midgut may minimize the antinutritive effects of oxidized phenolics.  The solubility of tomato leaf protein is significantly greater at pH 9.7, representative of the midgut of M. sexta, than at pH 8.0, representative of the midguts of H. zea and S. exigua.  We suggest that this increase in solubility would compensate for any loss in bioavailability of essential amino acids caused by the covalent binding of chlorogenic acid to amino acids.  Furthermore, lysolecithin, a surfactant likely to contribute to the detergent properties of the midgut fluid, was shown to enhance protein solubility as well as inhibit polyphenol oxidase activity.  The adaptive significance of gut alkalinity and detergency is discussed.

AB Understanding the relationship between the geographical distribution of taxa and their environmental conditions is a key concept in ecology and conservation. The use of ensemble modelling methods for species distribution modelling (SDM) have been promoted over single algorithms such as Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). Nevertheless, we suggest that in cases where data, technical support or computational power are limited, for example in developing countries, single algorithm methods produce robust and accurate distribution maps. We fit SDMs for 114 Egyptian medicinal plant species (nearly all native) with a total of 14,396 occurrence points. The predictive performances of eight single-algorithm methods (maxent, random forest (rf), support-vector machine (svm), maxlike, boosted regression trees (brt), classification and regression trees (cart), flexible discriminant analysis (fda) and generalised linear models (glm)) were compared to an ensemble modelling approach combining all eight algorithms. Predictions were based originally on the current climate, and then projected into the future time slice of 2050 based on four alternate climate change scenarios (A2a and B2a for CMIP3 and RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 for CMIP5). Ensemble modelling, MaxEnt and rf achieved the highest predictive performances based on AUC and TSS, while svm and cart had the poorest performance. There is high similarity in habitat suitability between MaxEnt and ensemble predictive maps for both current and future emission scenarios, but lower similarity between rf and ensemble, or rf and MaxEnt. We conclude that single-algorithm modelling methods, particularly MaxEnt, are capable of producing distribution maps of comparable accuracy to ensemble methods. Furthermore, the ease of use, reduced computational time and simplicity of methods like MaxEnt provides support for their use in scenarios when the choice of modelling methods, knowledge or computational power is limited but the need for robust and accurate conservation predictions is urgent.

AB Plant interactions and feedbacks with soil microorganisms play an important role in sustaining the functions and stability of terrestrial ecosystems, yet the effects of tree species diversity on soil microbial community in forest ecosystems are still not well understood. Here, we examined the effects of tree species richness (1-12 species) and the presence of certain influential tree species (sampling effect) on soil bacterial and fungal communities in Chinese subtropical forests, using high-throughput Illumine sequencing for microbial identification. We observed that beta rather than alpha diversities of tree species and soil microorganisms were strong coupled. Multivariate regression and redundancy analyses revealed that the effects of tree species identity dominated over tree species richness on the diversity and composition of bacterial and fungal communities in both organic and top mineral soil horizons. Soil pH, nutrients and topography were always identified as significant predictors in the best multivariate models. Tree species have stronger effect on fungi than bacteria in organic soil, and on ectomycorrhizal fungi than saprotrophic fungi in mineral topsoil. Concluding, tree species identity, along with abiotic soil and topographical conditions, were more important factors determining the soil microbial communities in subtropical forests than tree diversity per se.

AB Extreme drought is increasing in frequency and intensity in many regions globally, with uncertain consequences for the resistance and resilience of ecosystem functions, including primary production. Primary production resistance, the capacity to withstand change during extreme drought, and resilience, the degree to which production recovers, vary among and within ecosystem types, obscuring generalized patterns of ecological stability. Theory and many observations suggest forest production is more resistant but less resilient than grassland production to extreme drought; however, studies of production sensitivity to precipitation variability indicate that the processes controlling resistance and resilience may be influenced more by mean annual precipitation (MAP) than ecosystem type. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis to investigate primary production resistance and resilience to extreme drought in 64 forests and grasslands across a broad MAP gradient. We found resistance to extreme drought was predicted by MAP; however, grasslands (positive) and forests (negative) exhibited opposing resilience relationships with MAP. Our findings indicate that common plant physiological mechanisms may determine grassland and forest resistance to extreme drought, whereas differences among plant residents in turnover time, plant architecture, and drought adaptive strategies likely underlie divergent resilience patterns. The low resistance and resilience of dry grasslands suggests that these ecosystems are the most vulnerable to extreme drought - a vulnerability that is expected to compound as extreme drought frequency increases in the future.

AB There is an urgent need for more ecologically realistic models for better predicting the effects of climate change on species' potential geographic distributions. Here we build ecological niche models using MAXENT and test whether selecting predictor variables based on biological knowledge and selecting ecologically realistic response curves can improve cross-time distributional predictions. We also evaluate how the method chosen for extrapolation into nonanalog conditions affects the prediction. We do so by estimating the potential distribution of a montane shrew (Mammalia, Soricidae, Cryptotis mexicanus) at present and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Because it is tightly associated with cloud forests (with climatically determined upper and lower limits) whose distributional shifts are well characterized, this species provides clear expectations of plausible vs. implausible results. Response curves for the MAXENT model made using variables selected via biological justification were ecologically more realistic compared with those of the model made using many potential predictors. This strategy also led to much more plausible geographic predictions for upper and lower elevational limits of the species both for the present and during the LGM. By inspecting the modeled response curves, we also determined the most appropriate way to extrapolate into nonanalog environments, a previously overlooked factor in studies involving model transfer. This study provides intuitive context for recommendations that should promote more realistic ecological niche models for transfer across space and time.

AB Many species have undergone dramatic population size declines over the past centuries. Although stochastic genetic processes during and after such declines are thought to elevate the risk of extinction, comparative analyses of genomic data from several endangered species suggest little concordance between genome-wide diversity and current population sizes. This is likely because species-specific life-history traits and ancient bottlenecks overshadow the genetic effect of recent demographic declines. Therefore, we advocate that temporal sampling of genomic data provides a more accurate approach to quantify genetic threats in endangered species. Specifically, genomic data from predecline museum specimens will provide valuable baseline data that enable accurate estimation of recent decreases in genome-wide diversity, increases in inbreeding levels, and accumulation of deleterious genetic variation.

AB Assessing the impacts of urban expansion on ecosystem services (ESs) is fundamental to understanding urban sustainability. However, little is known about the intensity of simultaneous losses of ESs over time caused by urban expansion. Taking Beijing as an example, this study sought to simulate the historical and potential impacts of urban expansion on the simultaneous losses of main ESs. We projected the impacts of urban expansion on the simultaneous losses of main ESs from 1990 to 2013 and simulated the potential impacts from 2013 to 2040 by combining ES mapping models, an urban expansion model and statistical methods. The results show that food production, water conservation, habitat quality, carbon storage, and air quality regulation in Beijing from 2013 to 2040 will decrease by 20.70%, 8.69%, 6.45%, 5.76%, and 3.92%, respectively. Meanwhile, the simultaneous losses of water conservation, habitat quality, carbon storage, and air quality regulation will be aggravated. Increases in the replacement of forest land by urban land will be the main cause for the aggravation of simultaneous losses of ESs. From 2013 to 2040, 11.08% of expanded urban land will replace forest land, which is much higher than the 3.24% change from 1990 to 2013. Thus, more attention should be paid to protecting forest land and cropland with high ES values in rapidly urbanized regions.

AB Bayesian methods have become very popular in molecular phylogenetics due to the availability of user-friendly software for running sophisticated models of evolution. However, Bayesian phylogenetic models are complex, and analyses are often carried out using default settings, which may not be appropriate. Here we summarize the major features of Bayesian phylogenetic inference and discuss Bayesian computation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, the diagnosis of an MCMC run, and ways of summarizing the MCMC sample. We discuss the specification of the prior, the choice of the substitution model and partitioning of the data. Finally, we provide a list of common Bayesian phylogenetic software packages and recommend appropriate applications.

AB The increasing global concern about wildfires, mostly caused by people, has triggered the development of human-caused fire occurrence models in many countries. The premise is that better knowledge of the underlying factors is critical for many fire management purposes, such as operational decision-making in suppression and strategic prevention planning, or guidance on forest and land-use policies. However, the explanatory and predictive capacity of fire occurrence models is not yet widely applied to the management of forests, fires or emergencies. In this article, we analyse the developments in the field of human-caused fire occurrence modelling with the aim of identifying the most appropriate variables and methods for applications in forest and fire management and civil protection. We stratify our worldwide analysis by temporal dimension (short-term and long-term) and by model output (numeric or binary), and discuss management applications. An attempt to perform a meta-analysis based on published models proved limited because of non-equivalence of the metrics and units of the estimators and outcomes across studies, the diversity of models and the lack of information in published works.

AB Biological invasions are a major driver of global change, for which models can attribute causes, assess impacts and guide management. However, invasion models typically focus on spread from known introduction points or non-native distributions and ignore the transport processes by which species arrive. Here, we developed a simulation model to understand and describe plant invasion at a continental scale, integrating repeated transport through trade pathways, unintentional release events and the population dynamics and local anthropogenic dispersal that drive subsequent spread. We used the model to simulate the invasion of Europe by common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), a globally invasive plant that causes serious harm as an aeroallergen and crop weed. Simulations starting in 1950 accurately reproduced ragweed's current distribution, including the presence of records in climatically unsuitable areas as a result of repeated introduction. Furthermore, the model outputs were strongly correlated with spatial and temporal patterns of ragweed pollen concentrations, which are fully independent of the calibration data. The model suggests that recent trends for warmer summers and increased volumes of international trade have accelerated the ragweed invasion. For the latter, long distance dispersal because of trade within the invaded continent is highlighted as a key invasion process, in addition to import from the native range. Biosecurity simulations, whereby transport through trade pathways is halted, showed that effective control is only achieved by early action targeting all relevant pathways. We conclude that invasion models would benefit from integrating introduction processes (transport and release) with spread dynamics, to better represent propagule pressure from native sources as well as mechanisms for long-distance dispersal within invaded continents. Ultimately, such integration may facilitate better prediction of spatial and temporal variation in invasion risk and provide useful guidance for management strategies to reduce the impacts of invasion.

AB Drosophila suzukii is an invasive insect pest which has major impacts on small fruit production throughout North America. Current control programs use frequent applications of broad-spectrum insecticides. To prevent resistance, modes of action must be rotated. This study examines the acute and residual efficacy of rotational treatment programs designed to meet the needs of commercial growers in the southeastern United States, a region which experiences significant precipitation throughout the growing season. All insecticide applications had greater adult acute mortality than controls, and some had residual efficacy for three or more days after treatment. Programs had no residual effects at seven days after treatment. Within programs, organophosphates (phosmet and malathion) and pyrethroids (zeta-cypermethrin and fenpropathrin) were the most effective. Some programs also resulted in less offspring production by D. suzukii in bioassays and reduced field infestation compared to controls. Results show that effective, season-long rotational chemical treatment programs can be designed to minimize crop damage, meet exportation requirements and manage for resistance. Understanding the effect of regional climate on the performance of individual insecticide treatments and their efficacy will be critical for widespread implementation of effective control programs for D. suzukii.

AB The ecosystem services concept (ES) is becoming a cornerstone of contemporary sustainability thought. Challenges with this concept and its applications are well documented, but have not yet been systematically assessed alongside strengths and external factors that influence uptake. Such an assessment could form the basis for improving ES thinking, further embedding it into environmental decisions and management.
   The Young Ecosystem Services Specialists (YESS) completed a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities Threats (SWOT) analysis of ES through YESS member surveys. Strengths include the approach being interdisciplinary, and a useful communication tool. Weaknesses include an incomplete scientific basis, frameworks being inconsistently applied, and accounting for nature's intrinsic value. Opportunities include alignment with existing policies and established methodologies, and increasing environmental awareness. Threats include resistance to change, and difficulty with interdisciplinary collaboration. Consideration of SWOT themes suggested five strategic areas for developing and implementing ES.
   The ES concept could improve decision-making related to natural resource use, and interpretation of the complexities of human-nature interactions. It is contradictory - valued as a simple means of communicating the importance of conservation, whilst also considered an oversimplification characterised by ambiguous language. Nonetheless, given sufficient funding and political will, the ES framework could facilitate interdisciplinary research, ensuring decision-making that supports sustainable development.

AB Aim Impacts of non-native species have motivated development of risk assessment tools for identifying introduced species likely to become invasive. Here, we develop trait-based models for the establishment and impact stages of freshwater fish invasion, and use them to screen non-native species common in international trade. We also determine which species in the aquarium, biological supply, live bait, live food and water garden trades are likely to become invasive. Results are compared to historical patterns of non-native fish establishment to assess the relative importance over time of pathways in causing invasions.
   Location Laurentian Great Lakes region.
   Methods Trait-based classification trees for the establishment and impact stages of invasion were developed from data on freshwater fish species that established or failed to establish in the Great Lakes. Fishes in trade were determined from import data from Canadian and United States regulatory agencies, assigned to specific trades and screened through the developed models.
   Results Climate match between a species' native range and the Great Lakes region predicted establishment success with 75-81% accuracy. Trophic guild and fecundity predicted potential harmful impacts of established non-native fishes with 75-83% accuracy. Screening outcomes suggest the water garden trade poses the greatest risk of introducing new invasive species, followed by the live food and aquarium trades. Analysis of historical patterns of introduction pathways demonstrates the increasing importance of these trades relative to other pathways. Comparisons among trades reveal that model predictions parallel historical patterns; all fishes previously introduced from the water garden trade have established. The live bait, biological supply, aquarium and live food trades have also contributed established non-native fishes.
   Main conclusions Our models predict invasion risk of potential fish invaders to the Great Lakes region and could help managers prioritize efforts among species and pathways to minimize such risk. Similar approaches could be applied to other taxonomic groups and geographic regions.

AB Whale-watching activities can induce behavioral changes that may negatively affect cetacean populations. However, these changes may vary depending on species, populations and environmental features. It is important to determine inter-specific variation in cetacean responses to stressors in order to identify the best metrics for evaluation of consequences of anthropogenic disturbance. We used meta-analyses to assess the consistency of cetacean responses to whale-watching vessels across a pool of suitable studies covering a variety of species and sites. We analyzed several metrics to capture cetacean heterogeneous responses and to explore their reliability across species. We found disruptions of activity budget and of path directionality as the most consistent responses towards whale-watching vessels. In a similar manner across species, animals were more likely to travel and less likely to rest and forage in the presence of vessels. Cetaceans also showed a tendency to increase path sinuosity (deviation index) and decrease path linearity (directness index) during boat interactions. We also explored the influence of socio-ecological factors on behavioral response but found no consistent results among studies. Further population-specific studies should address the potential long-term consequences of these behavioral responses to inform management of the whale-watching industry.

AB Habitats have substantial influence on the distribution and abundance of animals. Animals' selective movement yields their habitat use. Animals generally are more abundant in habitats that are selected most strongly.
   Models of habitat selection can be used to distribute animals on the landscape or their distribution can be modelled based on data of habitat use, occupancy, intensity of use or counts of animals. When the population is at carrying capacity or in an ideal-free distribution, habitat selection and related metrics of habitat use can be used to estimate abundance.
   If the population is not at equilibrium, models have the flexibility to incorporate density into models of habitat selection; but abundance might be influenced by factors influencing fitness that are not directly related to habitat thereby compromising the use of habitat-based models for predicting population size.
   Scale and domain of the sampling frame, both in time and space, are crucial considerations limiting application of these models. Ultimately, identifying reliable models for predicting abundance from habitat data requires an understanding of the mechanisms underlying population regulation and limitation.

AB The effects of using alternative sets of climatic predictor variables on the performance, spatial predictions and future projections of species distribution models (SDMs) and its consequences on extinction risk estimates have remained insufficiently studied.
   Here, we modelled the present and future potential distributions of 13 species of Heliotropium sect. Cochranea, a plant group with a centre of diversity in the Atacama Desert. We developed and applied a sequential procedure, starting from climate monthly variables, to derive six alternative sets of climatic predictor variables. We used them to fit models with eight modelling techniques within an ensemble forecasting framework, and derived climate change projections for each of them. We evaluated the effects of using these alternative sets of predictor variables on performance, spatial predictions and projections of SDMs using Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM). Our Results show that the use of different sets of climatic predictor variables did not have a significant effect on overall metrics of model performance, but had significant effects on present and future spatial predictions and extinction risk estimates. This form of uncertainty in model-based estimates of extinction risk may need to be better acknowledged and quantified in future SDM studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forest fires in the Alps might become more hazardous in the future due to their linkage to high temperatures and drought periods. To understand the driving forces and the actual distribution patterns of forest fires is crucial to adapt to those future challenges. We used the province Tyrol in Austria as a case study area. We tested two machine learning algorithms (MaxEnt and RandomForests) for their capability in use with historic fire data and environmental datasets. Presence-only data of 399 forest fires between 1993 and 2011 was compared with a range of topography, vegetation, climate and socio-economic datasets, in order to find out the main driving parameters of the spatial forest fire distribution and to delimit areas of particular fire danger. The results of both algorithms were compared for agreement and differences.
   Both algorithms delivered broadly similar results; climate (number of days above a certain fire weather index) and anthropogenic parameters (distance to buildings, population density) are the most important parameters in the current alpine fire regime. The models slightly disagreed on the role of forest type and of topography. Joined model results show a strong concentration of potential fire danger along the main valleys and in the drier Tyrolean Upland. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Species distribution models are increasingly used to address conservation questions, so their predictive capacity requires careful evaluation. Previous studies have shown how individual factors used in model construction can affect prediction. Although some factors probably have negligible effects compared to others, their relative effects are largely unknown. We introduce a general 'virtual ecologist' framework to study the relative importance of factors involved in the construction of species distribution models. We illustrate the framework by examining the relative importance of five key factors - a missing covariate, spatial autocorrelation due to a dispersal process in presences/absences, sample size, sampling design and modelling technique - in a real study framework based on virtual plants in a mountain landscape at regional scale, and show that, for the parameter values considered here, most of the variation in prediction accuracy is due to sample size and modelling technique. Contrary to repeatedly reported concerns, spatial autocorrelation has only comparatively small effects. This study shows the importance of using a nested statistical framework to evaluate the relative effects of factors that may affect species distribution models.

AB Disruption to species-interaction networks caused by irruptions of herbivores and mesopredators following extirpation of apex predators is a global driver of ecosystem reorganization and biodiversity loss. Most studies of apex predators' ecological roles focus on effects arising from their interactions with herbivores or mesopredators in isolation, but rarely consider how the effects of herbivores and mesopredators interact. Here, we provide evidence that multiple cascade pathways induced by lethal control of an apex predator, the dingo, drive unintended shifts in forest ecosystem structure. We compared mammal assemblages and understorey structure at seven sites in southern Australia. Each site comprised an areawhere dingoes were poisoned and an area without control. The effects of dingo control on mammals scaled with body size. Activity of herbivorous macropods, arboreal mammals and a mesopredator, the red fox, were greater, but understorey vegetation sparser and abundances of small mammals lower, where dingoes were controlled. Structural equation modelling suggested that both predation by foxes and depletion of understorey vegetation by macropods were related to small mammal decline at poisoned sites. Our study suggests that apex predators' suppressive effects on herbivores and mesopredators occur simultaneously and should be considered in tandem in order to appreciate the extent of apex predators' indirect effects.

AB Due to climate change an increase in the intra-annual precipitation variability including extreme drought and heavy rainfall events is predicted to impact major ecosystem processes. Evidence suggests that crop and forage production will be affected by altered climate variability. Due to the growing human population and rising demand for high quality animal feed it is necessary to determine the consequence of increased precipitation variability on forage yield and quality in order to adapt or implement compensation strategies against possible negative effects.
   Here, we present data from a field experiment in which a temperate European grassland was subjected to altered intra-annual precipitation variability (low, medium, high) in interaction with management strategies namely fertilization and alteration of harvest date (delay by 10 days). We measured forage yield and root length, quantified parameters of forage quality (crude protein, crude fiber, crude ash, crude fat, sugar, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), in vitro gas production) and estimated relative feed value, net energy for lactation and metabolizable energy. Additionally, we tested the influence of seasonality of extreme weather events on the responsiveness of forage yield and quality to management strategies.
   Increased intra-annual precipitation variability decreased forage yield of the grassland. Furthermore, the proportion of functional groups was altered toward less grass and more forb biomass with amplified precipitation variability. Increased crude protein content and reduced fiber content (crude fiber, NDF, ADF) with increasing precipitation variability improved the relative feed values. Crude protein content was enhanced by fertilization during drought but reduced by delayed harvest after the drought period. Fertilization reduced losses in grassland annual yield caused by extreme precipitation. Management strategies proved less effective if precipitation variability occurred later in the season than earlier in the season.
   A nitrogen dilution effect (decreased plant nitrogen concentration with increasing shoot biomass) likely influenced the grassland crude protein contents under altered precipitation regimes and might have masked possible effects of precipitation variability on plant nitrogen and therefore on quality of grassland species. Nevertheless, alterations in the plant community composition and plant senescence seem to be the main drivers of forage quality change. Fertilization during drought periods and harvest delay after drought periods were only partially successful as management strategies to sustain forage production in more extreme precipitation regimes of the future. Further strategies need to be developed that acknowledge the shift in plant species compositions as the main driver of changes in forage quality in the face of changing precipitation patterns.

AB In future decades, coastal ecosystems are expected to be exposed to increased risk of experiencing adverse consequences related to climate change, exacerbated by human induced pressures. The seagrass Zostera noltii forms meadows mainly within the intertidal zone, leading it to be particularly vulnerable to seawater temperature increase and sea level rise (SLR). Considering the presently declining situation and the predicted scenarios of increasing seawater temperature and SLR by the end of the 21st century, we assessed the response of Z. noltii to climate change (i) accounting for changes in seawater temperature at its entire biogeographical range level; and (ii) under SLR scenarios at estuary level (Oka estuary, Basque Country, south-eastern Bay of Biscay). Objectives were addressed coupling habitat suitability models with climate change simulations. By the end of the 21st century, seawater temperature increase will trigger a northward distributional shift of 888 km in the suitable habitat of the species, and a retreat of southernmost populations. The loss of southernmost populations due to climate change may imply future conservation problems. In contrast, SLR and derived changes in current velocities are expected to induce the landward migration of the species in the Oka estuary, increasing the available suitable intertidal areas (14-18%) to limits imposed by anthropogenic barriers. This modelling approach could lead to an advanced understanding of the species' response to climate change effects; moreover, the information generated might support conservation actions towards the sites where the habitat would remain suitable for the species under climate change.

AB The federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is the focus of intensive conservation efforts that have led to much forested land being reserved as habitat for the owl and associated wildlife species throughout the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Recently, however, a relatively new threat to spotted owls has emerged in the form of an invasive competitor: the congeneric barred owl (S. varia). As barred owls have rapidly expanded their populations into the entire range of the northern spotted owl, mounting evidence indicates that they are displacing, hybridizing with, and even killing spotted owls. The range expansion by barred owls into western North America has made an already complex conservation issue even more contentious, and a lack of information on the ecological relationships between the 2 species has hampered recovery efforts for northern spotted owls. We investigated spatial relationships, habitat use, diets, survival, and reproduction of sympatric spotted owls and barred owls in western Oregon, USA, during 2007-2009. Our overall objective was to determine the potential for and possible consequences of competition for space, habitat, and food between these previously allopatric owl species. Our study included 29 spotted owls and 28 barred owls that were radio-marked in 36 neighboring territories and monitored over a 24-month period. Based on repeated surveys of both species, the number of territories occupied by pairs of barred owls in the 745-km(2) study area (82) greatly outnumbered those occupied by pairs of spotted owls (15). Estimates of mean size of home ranges and core-use areas of spotted owls (1,843ha and 305ha, respectively) were 2-4 times larger than those of barred owls (581ha and 188ha, respectively). Individual spotted and barred owls in adjacent territories often had overlapping home ranges, but interspecific space sharing was largely restricted to broader foraging areas in the home range with minimal spatial overlap among core-use areas. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank discrete-choice models representing alternative hypotheses about the influence of forest conditions, topography, and interspecific interactions on species-specific patterns of nighttime resource selection. Spotted owls spent a disproportionate amount of time foraging on steep slopes in ravines dominated by old (>120 yr) conifer trees. Barred owls used available forest types more evenly than spotted owls, and were most strongly associated with patches of large hardwood and conifer trees that occupied relatively flat areas along streams. Spotted and barred owls differed in the relative use of old conifer forest (greater for spotted owls) and slope conditions (steeper slopes for spotted owls), but we found no evidence that the 2 species differed in their use of young, mature, and riparian-hardwood forest types. Mean overlap in proportional use of different forest types between individual spotted owls and barred owls in adjacent territories was 81% (range=30-99%). The best model of habitat use for spotted owls indicated that the relative probability of a location being used was substantially reduced if the location was within or in close proximity to a core-use area of a barred owl. We used pellet analysis and measures of food-niche overlap to determine the potential for dietary competition between spatially associated pairs of spotted owls and barred owls.
   We identified 1,223 prey items from 15 territories occupied by spotted owls and 4,299 prey items from 24 territories occupied by barred owls. Diets of both species were dominated by nocturnal mammals, but diets of barred owls included many terrestrial, aquatic, and diurnal prey species that were rare or absent in diets of spotted owls. Northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus), woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes, N. cinerea), and lagomorphs (Lepus americanus, Sylvilagus bachmani) were primary prey for both owl species, accounting for 81% and 49% of total dietary biomass for spotted owls and barred owls, respectively. Mean dietary overlap between pairs of spotted and barred owls in adjacent territories was moderate (42%; range=28-70%). Barred owls displayed demographic superiority over spotted owls; annual survival probability of spotted owls from known-fate analyses (0.81, SE=0.05) was lower than that of barred owls (0.92, SE=0.04), and pairs of barred owls produced an average of 4.4 times more young than pairs of spotted owls over a 3-year period. We found a strong, positive relationship between seasonal (6-month) survival probabilities of both species and the proportion of old (>120 yr) conifer forest within individual home ranges, which suggested that availability of old forest was a potential limiting factor in the competitive relationship between these 2 species. The annual number of young produced by spotted owls increased linearly with increasing distance from a territory center of a pair of barred owls, and all spotted owls that attempted to nest within 1.5km of a nest used by barred owls failed to successfully produce young. We identified strong associations between the presence of barred owls and the behavior and fitness potential of spotted owls, as shown by changes in movements, habitat use, and reproductive output of spotted owls exposed to different levels of spatial overlap with territorial barred owls. When viewed collectively, our results support the hypothesis that interference competition with barred owls for territorial space can constrain the availability of critical resources required for successful recruitment and reproduction of spotted owls. Availability of old forests and associated prey species appeared to be the most strongly limiting factors in the competitive relationship between these species, indicating that further loss of these conditions can lead to increases in competitive pressure. Our findings have broad implications for the conservation of spotted owls, as they suggest that spatial heterogeneity in vital rates may not arise solely because of differences among territories in the quality or abundance of forest habitat, but also because of the spatial distribution of a newly established competitor. Experimental removal of barred owls could be used to test this hypothesis and determine whether localized control of barred owl numbers is an ecologically practical and socio-politically acceptable management tool to consider in conservation strategies for spotted owls.

AB Invertebrate pest invasions and outbreaks are associated with high social, economic, and ecological costs, and their significance will intensify with an increasing pressure on agricultural productivity as a result of human population growth and climate change. New molecular genetic and genomic techniques are available and accessible, but have been grossly underutilized in studies of invertebrate pest invasions, despite that they are useful tools for applied pest management and for understanding fundamental features of pest invasions including pest population demographics and adaptation of pests to novel and/or changing environments. Here, we review current applications of molecular genetics and genomics in the study of invertebrate pest invasions and outbreaks, and we highlight shortcomings from the current body of research. We then discuss recent conceptual and methodological advances in the areas of molecular genetics/genomics and data analysis, and we highlight how these advances will further our understanding of the demographic, ecological, and evolutionary features of invertebrate pest invasions. We are now well equipped to use molecular data to understand invertebrate dispersal and adaptation, and this knowledge has valuable applications in agriculture at a time when these are critically required.

AB Behavioural change in response to anthropogenic activities is often assumed to indicate a biologically significant effect on a population of concern. Disturbances can affect individual health through lost foraging time or other behaviours, which will impact vital rates and thus the population dynamics. However, individuals may be able to compensate for the observed shifts in behaviour, leaving their health and thus their vital rates and population dynamics, unchanged. We developed a mathematical model simulating the complex social, spatial, behavioural and motivational interactions of coastal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Moray Firth, Scotland, to assess the biological significance of increased rate of behavioural disruptions caused by vessel traffic. We explored a scenario in which vessel traffic increased from 70 to 470 vessels a year in response to the construction of a proposed offshore renewables' facility. Despite the more than sixfold increase in vessel traffic, the dolphins' behavioural time budget, spatial distribution, motivations and social structure remain unchanged. We found that the dolphins are able to compensate for their immediate behavioural response to disturbances by commercial vessels. If the increased commercial vessel traffic is the only escalation in anthropogenic activity, then the dolphins' response to disturbance is not biologically significant, because the dolphins' health is unaffected, leaving the vital rates and population dynamics unchanged. Our results highlight that behavioural change should not automatically be correlated with biological significance when assessing the conservation and management needs of species of interest. This strengthens the argument to use population dynamics targets to manage human activities likely to disturb wildlife.

AB Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) small subunit (RBCS) is encoded by a nuclear RBCS multigene family in many plant species. The contribution of the RBCS multigenes to accumulation of Rubisco holoenzyme and photosynthetic characteristics remains unclear. T-DNA insertion mutants of RBCS1A (rbcs1a-1) and RBCS3B (rbcs3b-1) were isolated among the four Arabidopsis RBCS genes, and a double mutant (rbcs1a3b-1) was generated. RBCS1A mRNA was not detected in rbcs1a-1 and rbcs1a3b-1, while the RBCS3B mRNA level was suppressed to similar to 20% of the wild-type level in rbcs3b-1 and rbcs1a3b-1 leaves. As a result, total RBCS mRNA levels declined to 52, 79, and 23% of the wild-type level in rbcs1a-1, rbcs3b-1, and rbcs1a3b-1, respectively. Rubisco contents showed declines similar to total RBCS mRNA levels, and the ratio of Rubisco-nitrogen to total nitrogen was 62, 78, and 40% of the wild-type level in rbcs1a-1, rbcs3b-1, and rbcs1a3b-1, respectively. The effects of RBCS1A and RBCS3B mutations in rbcs1a3b-1 were clearly additive. The rates of CO2 assimilation at ambient CO2 of 40 Pa were reduced with decreased Rubisco contents in the respective mutant leaves. Although the RBCS composition in the Rubisco holoenzyme changed, the CO2 assimilation rates per unit of Rubisco content were the same irrespective of the genotype. These results clearly indicate that RBCS1A and RBCS3B contribute to accumulation of Rubisco in Arabidopsis leaves and that these genes work additively to yield sufficient Rubisco for photosynthetic capacity. It is also suggested that the RBCS composition in the Rubisco holoenzyme does not affect photosynthesis under the present ambient [CO2] conditions.

AB Forest fires are a recurrent management problem in the Western Ghats of India. Although most fires occur during the dry season, information on the spatial distribution of fires is needed to improve fire prevention. We used the MODIS Hotspots database and Maxent algorithm to provide a quantitative understanding of the environmental controls regulating the spatial distribution of forest fires over the period 2003-07 in the entire Western Ghats and in two nested subregions with contrasting characteristics. We used hierarchical partitioning to assess the independent contributions of climate, topography and vegetation to the goodness-of-fit of models and to build the most parsimonious fire susceptibility model in each study area. Results show that although areas predicted as highly prone to forest fires were mainly localised on the eastern slopes of the Ghats, spatial predictions and model accuracies differed significantly between study areas. We suggest accordingly a two-step approach to identify: first, large fire-prone areas by paying special attention to the climatic conditions of the monsoon season before the fire season, which determine the fuels moisture content during the fire season; second, the most vulnerable sites within the fire-prone areas using local models mainly based on the type of vegetation.

AB Landscape restoration through revegetation is being increasingly used in the conservation management of degraded landscapes. To effectively plan restoration programs information is required on how the landscape context of revegetation influences biodiversity gains. Here, we investigate the relative influence of patch area and connectivity on bird species richness and abundance within urban revegetation patches in Brisbane, Australia. We carried out bird surveys at 20 revegetation sites, and used hierarchical partitioning and model selection to test the relative importance of patch area (the area of revegetation including all directly connected remnant vegetation) and landscape connectivity (the vegetated area connected by less than 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m and 50 m cleared gaps). We controlled for a number of possible confounding variables within the hierarchical partitioning procedure. Both the hierarchical partitioning and model selection procedures indicated that connectivity had an important influence on bird species richness. Patch area in combination with connectivity were important influencing factors on overall bird abundance. We also carried out the hierarchical partitioning procedure for bird abundance data within a range of feeding guilds, yielding results specific to species groups. Overall our data suggest that greater connectivity enhances the habitat area that colonists can arrive from (resulting in greater species richness), whereas increased patch area allows for increased abundance by expanding the habitat available to species already present in a patch. A combined approach where connectivity and overall habitat area is enhanced across the landscape is likely to be necessary to meet long-term conservation objectives. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB P>Odontocete depredation involves stealing or damaging bait or prey already captured by fishing gear. The increase in depredation is of concern for small stocks of cetaceans because interactions with fishing gear can lead to serious injury or mortality through entanglement or ingestion. Using long-term data sets available for the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) community in Sarasota Bay, Florida, we investigated recreational fishing gear interactions by (1) examining temporal patterns in depredation and associated behaviors from 2000 to 2007; (2) quantifying the behavior of dolphins that depredate or engage in associated behaviors; and (3) identifying factors associated with the rise in depredation locally. The number of incidents of dolphins (primarily adult males) interacting with recreational anglers and boaters increased following 2004. Depredation and associated behaviors increased during red tide lags and tourist seasons during times of prey depletion and heightened angler and boater activity. Dolphins with a history of fishing gear interactions shifted away from natural activity patterns and were more likely to be within 50 m of fishing lines. Recreational fishing gear interactions were attributed to a two percent population decline in Sarasota Bay in 2006 and need to be considered along with other cumulative human impacts in the development of conservation measures for dolphins.

AB Environmental policy and in particular the European water legislation, in the framework of the EU Groundwater Directive, has started to consider groundwater not only as a resource but as a living ecosystem. A precondition for comprehensive groundwater protection is thus the assessment of the biological and ecological state. The assessment of ecosystems requires consideration of ecological criteria, which so far are not available for groundwater systems. In the framework of a national project, the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) supports a consortium of scientists and stakeholders from water boards and regional environmental authorities to develop a first concept for an ecological assessment scheme for groundwater ecosystems. The attempts towards an integrative concept include the following steps: (i) selection of appropriate biological and ecological parameters, (ii) typology of groundwater ecosystems, (iii) derivation of a reference status (Leitbild) and natural background values for biological variables, (iv) identification of potential bioindicators and definition of threshold values, and (v) development of an assessment model. These proposed steps are discussed on the basis of a data set from two groundwater landscapes in Southern Germany. Investigations considered three different spatial units, i.e. the habitat unit at the local scale, and the aquifer type unit as well as the landscape unit at the regional scale. Fauna as well as bacterial communities could provide valuable ecological information on the ecosystems status. The paper reviews 'state of the art' knowledge and evaluates the near future perspectives for the development and implementation of groundwater ecosystems assessment programmes.

AB Reduced, or bottlenecked, populations are more prone to adverse events. Thus, the detection of genetic bottleneck signatures in wildlife is an important issue for conservation. BOTTLENECK 1.2.02 is a software commonly used for detecting genetic characteristics of past bottlenecks. Here we test the efficiency with which this software detects bottlenecks in two koala populations of known history. The sign test performed well for both populations, particularly under the infinite alleles model for mutation. This suggests this model could be the more realistic for marsupial microsatellites than other mutation models. Under the allele frequency distribution test, the two populations falsely appeared to be at mutation/drift equilibrium. However, this test could detect the bottleneck when only imperfect repeat microsatellites were included in the analysis. We thus recommend further investigation of imperfect repeat microsatellites, which could be more powerful for bottleneck detection. These results underline the cautious approach researchers and conservationists should take when studying the past of unknown populations.

AB We focused on the functional guild of methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB) as model organisms to get deeper insights into microbial biogeography. The pmoA gene was used as a functional and phylogenetic marker for MOB in two approaches: (i) a pmoA database (> 4000 sequences) was evaluated to obtain insights into MOB diversity in Italian rice paddies, and paddy fields worldwide. The results show a wide geographical distribution of pmoA genotypes that seem to be specifically adapted to paddy fields (e.g. Rice Paddy Cluster 1 and Rice Paddy Cluster 2). (ii) On the smaller geographical scale, we designed a factorial experiment including three different locations, two rice varieties and two habitats (soil and roots) within each of three rice fields. Multivariate analysis of terminal restriction fragment analysis profiles revealed different community patterns at the three field sites, located 10-20 km apart. Root samples were characterized by high abundance of type I MOB whereas the rice variety had no effect. With the agronomical practice being nearly identical, historical contingencies might be responsible for the field site differences. Considering a large reservoir of viable yet inactive MOB cells acting as a microbial seed bank, environmental conditions might have selected and activated a different subset at a time thereby shaping the community.

AB The accurate measurement of the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock in Australian grazing lands is important due to the major role that SOC plays in soil productivity and the potential influence of soil C cycling on Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. However, the current sampling methodologies for SOC stock are varied and potentially conflicting. It was the objective of this paper to review the nature of, and reasons for, SOCvariability; the sampling methodologies commonly used; and to identify knowledge gaps for SOC measurement in grazing lands. Soil C consists of a range of biological materials, in various SOC pools such as dissolved organic C, micro- and meso-fauna (microbial biomass), fungal hyphae and fresh plant residues in or on the soil (particulate organic C, light-fraction C), the products of decomposition (humus, slow pool C) and complexed organic C, and char and phytoliths (inert, passive or resistant C); and soil inorganic C (carbonates and bicarbonates). Microbial biomass and particulate or light-fraction organic C are most sensitive to management or land-use change; resistant organicCand soil carbonates are least sensitive. TheSOCpresent at any location is influenced by a series of complex interactions between plant growth, climate, soil type or parent material, topography and site management. Because of this, SOCstock andSOCpools are highly variable on both spatial and temporal scales. This creates a challenge for efficient sampling. Sampling methods are predominantly based on design-based (classical) statistical techniques, crucial to which is a randomised sampling pattern that negates bias. Alternatively a model-based (geostatistical) analysis can be used, which does not require randomisation. Each approach is equally valid to characterise SOC in the rangelands. However, given that SOC reporting in the rangelands will almost certainly rely on average values for some aggregated scale (such as a paddock or property), wecontend that the design-based approach might be preferred. Wealso challenge soil surveyors and their sponsors to realise that: (i) paired sites are the most efficient way of detecting a temporal change inSOCstock, but destructive sampling and cumulative measurement errors decrease our ability to detect change; (ii) due to (i), an efficient sampling scheme to estimate baseline status is not likely to be an efficient sampling scheme to estimate temporal change; (iii) samples should be collected as widely as possible within the area of interest; (iv) replicate of laboratory analyses is a critical step in being able to characterise temporal change. Sampling requirements for SOC stock in Australian grazing lands are yet to be explicitly quantified and an examination of a range of these ecosystems is required in order to assess the sampling densities and techniques necessary to detect specified changes in SOC stock and SOC pools. An examination of techniques that can help reduce sampling requirements (such as measurement of the SOC fractions that are most sensitive to management changes and/ or measurement at specific times of the year-preferably before rapid plant growth-to decrease temporal variability), and new technologies for in situ SOC measurement is also required.

AB The use of sequence polymorphism from individual mitochondrial genes to infer past demography has recently proved controversial because of the recurrence of selective sweeps acting over genes and the need for unlinked multilocus data sets. However, comparative analyses using several species for one gene and/or multiple genes for one species can serve as a test for potential selective effects and clarify our understanding of historical demographic effects. This study compares nucleotide polymorphisms in mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I across seven deep-sea hydrothermal vent species that live along the volcanically active East Pacific Rise. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method, developed to trace shared vicariant events across species pairs, indicates the occurrence of two across species divergence times, and suggests that the present geographical patterns of genetic differentiation may be explained by two periods of significant population isolation. The oldest period dates back 11.6 Ma and is associated with the vent limpet Lepetodrilus elevatus, while the most recent period of isolation is 1.3 Ma, which apparently affected all species examined and coincides with a transition zone across the equator. Moreover, significant negative Tajima's D and star-like networks were observed for all southern lineages, suggesting that these lineages experienced a concomitant demographic and geographical expansion about 100 000-300 000 generations ago. This expansion may have initiated from a wave of range expansions during the secondary colonization of new sites along the Southern East Pacific Rise (founder effects below the equator) or recurrent bottleneck events because of the increase of eruptive phases associated with the higher spreading rates of the ridge in this region.

AB Despite the widely accepted importance of the hyporheic zone as a habitat for stream macroinvertebrates during floods, few data exist regarding community composition and distribution during periods of low flow or drought in perennial streams. Integrating research on hyporheic invertebrates with results from a long-term study of a UK river provided the opportunity to examine how benthic and hyporheic macroinvertebrate communities respond to inter-annual variability ill river flow and periods of groundwater drought. Changes in the riverine macroinvertebrate community associated with low flow included a reduction in species richness and the number of individuals per sample, particularly aquatic insects. The hyporheic community was characterized by a relatively homogeneous composition during a period of severe low flow, punctuated by short-term changes associated with variation in water temperature rather than changes in discharge. We present a conceptual model of the processes influencing benthic and hyporheic invertebrates under low-flow conditions. Previous studies have seldom integrated these two assemblages and their interactions. The model presented highlights the potential importance of surface water and hyporheic zone linkages for riverine invertebrate communities under a range of flow conditions.

AB 1. Experiments that directly manipulate species diversity often report a positive diversity effect on productivity, whereas observations of natural communities reveal various productivity-diversity relationships and nutrient addition to natural plant communities generally results in negative productivity-diversity relationships.
   2. We hypothesize that this apparent paradox may be potentially explained by the reduced roles of complementarity and positive selection effects, and the increased importance of competitive exclusion in natural communities compared to diversity-manipulation experiments. This hypothesis arises from the difference in species distribution and abundance patterns between immature synthetically assembled communities in diversity-manipulation experiments and more mature natural communities.
   3. Our hypothesis applies best to small-scale studies within homogenous habitats and complements the environmental heterogeneity hypothesis that explains diversity-productivity patterns across heterogeneous habitats.
   4. Synthesis. Our analysis highlights important differences between synthetic communities in diversity-manipulation experiments and natural communities that may translate into different diversity-productivity patterns, and cautions against indiscriminate extrapolations of results of diversity-manipulation experiments to natural communities.

AB Genetic sampling is increasingly used as a tool by wildlife biologists and managers to estimate abundance and density of species. Typically, DNA is used to identify individuals captured in an array of traps ( e. g., baited hair snares) from which individual encounter histories are derived. Standard methods for estimating the size of a closed population can be applied to such data. However, due to the movement of individuals on and off the trapping array during sampling, the area over which individuals are exposed to trapping is unknown, and so obtaining unbiased estimates of density has proved difficult. We propose a hierarchical spatial capture-recapture model which contains explicit models for the spatial point process governing the distribution of individuals and their exposure to ( via movement) and detection by traps. Detection probability is modeled as a function of each individual's distance to the trap. We applied this model to a black bear ( Ursus americanus) study conducted in 2006 using a hair-snare trap array in the Adirondack region of New York, USA. We estimated the density of bears to be 0.159 bears/km(2), which is lower than the estimated density (0.410 bears/km(2)) based on standard closed population techniques. A Bayesian analysis of the model is fully implemented in the software program WinBUGS.

AB Background: Theory predicts that lower dispersal, and associated gene flow, leads to decreased genetic diversity in small isolated populations, which generates adverse consequences for fitness, and subsequently for demography. Here we report for the first time this effect in a well-connected natural butterfly metapopulation with high population densities at the edge of its distribution range.
   Results: We demonstrate that: (1) lower genetic diversity was coupled to a sharp decrease in adult lifetime expectancy, a key component of individual fitness; (2) genetic diversity was positively correlated to the number of dispersing individuals (indicative of landscape functional connectivity) and adult population size; (3) parameters inferred from capture-recapture procedures (population size and dispersal events between patches) correlated much better with genetic diversity than estimates usually used as surrogates for population size (patch area and descriptors of habitat quality) and dispersal (structural connectivity index).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that dispersal is a very important factor maintaining genetic diversity. Even at a very local spatial scale in a metapopulation consisting of large high-density populations interconnected by considerable dispersal rates, genetic diversity can be decreased and directly affect the fitness of individuals. From a biodiversity conservation perspective, this study clearly shows the benefits of both in-depth demographic and genetic analyses. Accordingly, to ensure the long-term survival of populations, conservation actions should not be blindly based on patch area and structural isolation. This result may be especially pertinent for species at their range margins, particularly in this era of rapid environmental change.

AB Coral reefs are consistently and increasingly subject to acute disturbance events that often lead to a reduction in live coral cover with concomitant effects on the diversity and abundance of coral reef fishes, Here we examine changes in both hard coral and reef-fish assemblages over 15 yr following major losses of coral from exposed reefs in 2 widely separated sectors of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. While the rate and extent of increase in coral cover (from <15 to >60%) was similar in the 2 sectors, differences in the rugosity of the underlying reef framework influenced the structure of fish communities. Soon after disturbance, when coral cover was very low and the limestone reef framework constituted most of the surface relief, the relatively featureless substrate on reefs of the southern sector supported fewer fish species than reefs of the northern sector, which had a more rugose substrate. At first, northern reefs also had a higher proportion of herbivorous fish species, presumably because the more complex reef surface provided shelter and allowed them to exploit the abundant algal turf. With increasing coral cover, coral colonies came to provide most of the surface relief in both sectors, and species richness and the trophic structure of the fish communities converged. Variation in the cover of branching corals explained significant variation in the fish communities in both sectors over time, reflecting the importance of this growth form to small coral-associated fishes. These results show that the recovery of the coral community and the complexity of underlying reef framework interact to determine the functional structure of associated fish communities despite differences in regional settings.

AB Deep misunderstandings still besiege taxonomy after more than 200 years of fruitful output. It has been asserted in this journal that taxonomy should be integrative and conform to a series of restrictive guidelines. We show that taxonomy has been integrative for most of its history although, in our sense, integrative does not mean the indiscriminate pooling of any source of data. The guidelines proposed are not founded in good scientific rationale and can have, if followed, a detrimental effect not only on taxonomy, but also on biology as a whole.

AB Our failure to understand or predict evolutionary dynamics under climatic change precludes much conservation planning. Evolution may reduce extinction under global warming, but few studies have explored how genetic covariation, the norm for most quantitative traits, will affect the course of evolution under rapid climatic change. To draw attention to and begin to fill this gap, we draw from the population genetics literature and explore climate-driven evolution using a multi-trait model under two qualitative scenarios of climate change. Under a monotonic change in the mean environment and a change in the amplitude and frequency of a periodic environment, we show that the angle between the direction of the largest genetic covariation and the selection gradient is important in determining a population's fitness decline, or lag load. When the environment changes monotonically in the direction of the greatest covariation, the population is able to more closely track the changing environment resulting in a lower lag load. in contrast, when the environment changes in a direction of low covariation, the ability of the population to track the changing environment is lower, and the population experiences a higher lag load. In a periodic environment, populations suffer a higher lag load under increased environmental amplitude than under increased frequency. These observations suggest that populations where the angle between the largest genetic covariation and the selection gradient is large, as well as populations experiencing an increased magnitude of environmental extremes, may be vulnerable to extinctions and genetic bottlenecks and may benefit from conservation efforts that enhance the preservation of genetic diversity. To make specific predictions of evolutionary trajectories and obtain estimates of lag loads for natural populations, climatic changes have to be quantified in terms of fitness landscapes and genetic covariation among climate-related traits must be measured. We performed an extensive review of the literature and found only 24 studies that quantify covariation in traits involving climate. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organic matter inputs, transport, and storage, ecosystem metabolism, and organic C turnover length were measured in a forested Mediterranean 3(rd)-order stream (Fuirosos) over a period of 3 y. Meteorological patterns influenced the organic matter dynamics of Fuirosos through 2 pathways: summer weather and flood pulses. Summer rains affected the timing of litter fall and the extent of flow intermittency, which gave rise to accumulations of organic matter in the streambed in dry years. With the onset of flow, these organic matter accumulations were the energy sources for considerable ecosystem respiration (similar to 30 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)). Interflood periods punctuated by flood pulses determined cycles of steady accumulation and abrupt removal of stored organic matter. During the interflood periods, the efficiency of organic matter processing increased continuously. The seasonal changes in the riparian forest influenced the ecological consequences of the flood pulses. Resilience of the ecosystem, measured in terms of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration, strongly depended on the supply of benthic organic matter and light availability, both of which were seasonally variable in the deciduous riparian forest.

AB 1. Floods are major disturbances to stream ecosystems that can kill or displace organisms and modify habitats. Many studies have reported changes in fish assemblages after a single flood, but few studies have evaluated the importance of timing and intensity of floods on long-term fish assemblage dynamics.
   2. We used a 10-year dataset to evaluate the effects of floods on fishes in Kings Creek, an intermittent prairie stream in north-eastern, Kansas, U.S.A. Samples were collected seasonally at two perennial headwater sites (1995-2005) and one perennial downstream flowing site (1997-2005) allowing us to evaluate the effects of floods at different locations within a watershed. In addition, four surveys during 2003 and 2004 sampled 3-5 km of stream between the long-term study sites to evaluate the use of intermittent reaches of this stream.
   3. Because of higher discharge and bed scouring at the downstream site, we predicted that the fish assemblage would have lowered species richness and abundance following floods. In contrast, we expected increased species richness and abundance at headwater sites because floods increase stream connectivity and create the potential for colonisation from downstream reaches.
   4. Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) was used to select among candidate regression models that predicted species richness and abundance based on Julian date, time since floods, season and physical habitat at each site. At the downstream site, AIC weightings suggested Julian date was the best predictor of fish assemblage structure, but no model explained > 16% of the variation in species richness or community structure. Variation explained by Julian date was primarily attributed to a long-term pattern of declining abundance of common species. At the headwater sites, there was not a single candidate model selected to predict total species abundance and assemblage structure. AIC weightings suggested variation in assemblage structure was associated with either Julian date or local habitat characteristics.
   5. Fishes rapidly colonised isolated or dry habitats following floods. This was evidenced by the occurrence of fishes in intermittent reaches and the positive association between maximum daily discharge and colonisation events at both headwater sites.
   6. Our study suggests floods allow dispersal into intermittent habitats with little or no downstream displacement of fishes. Movement of fishes among habitats during flooding highlights the importance of maintaining connectivity of stream networks of low to medium order prairie streams.

AB Knowledge of the spatial distribution of plant species is essential to conservation and forest managers in order to identify high priority areas such as vulnerable species and habitats, and designate areas for reserves, refuges and other protected areas. A reliable map of the diversity of plant species over the landscape is an invaluable tool for such purposes. In this study, the number of species, the exponent Shannon and the reciprocal Simpson indices, calculated from 141 quadrat sites sampled in a tropical forest were used to compare the performance of several spatial interpolation techniques used to prepare a map of plant diversity, starting from sample ( point) data over the landscape. Means of mapped classes, inverse distance functions, kriging and co-kriging, both, applied over the entire studied landscape and also applied within vegetation classes, were the procedures compared. Significant differences in plant diversity indices between classes demonstrated the usefulness of boundaries between vegetation types, mapped through satellite image classification, in stratifying the variability of plant diversity over the landscape. These mapped classes, improved the accuracy of the interpolation methods when they were used as prior information for stratification of the area. Spatial interpolation by co-kriging performed among the poorest interpolators due to the poor correlation between the plant diversity variables and vegetation indices computed by remote sensing and used as covariables. This indicated that the latter are not suitable covariates of plant diversity indices. Finally, a within- class kriging interpolator yielded the most accurate estimates of plant diversity values. This interpolator not only provided the most accurate estimates by accounting for the indices' intra-class variability, but also provided additional useful interpretations of the structure of spatial variability of diversity values through the interpretation of their semi-variograms. This additional role was found very useful in aiding decisions in conservation planning.

AB Surveys of genetic variation within cosmopolitan marine species often uncover deep divergences, indicating historical separation and potentially cryptic speciation. Based on broad geographic (coastal eastern North America, Gulf of Mexico, western Africa, Australia, and Hawaii) and temporal sampling (1991-2003), mitochondrial (control region [CR] and cytochrome oxidase I [COI]) and nuclear gene (lactate dehydrogenase A intron 6 [LDHA6]) variation among 76 individuals was used to test for cryptic speciation in the scalloped hammerhead, Sphyrna lewini (Griffith and Smith). CR and COI gene trees confirmed previous evidence of divergence between Atlantic and Indo-Pacific scalloped hammerhead populations; populations were reciprocally monophyletic. However, the between-basin divergence recorded in the mtDNA genome was not reflected in nuclear gene phylogenies; alleles for LDHA6 were shared between ocean basins, and Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations were not reciprocally monophyletic. Unexpectedly, CR, COI, and LDHA6 gene trees recovered a deep phylogenetic partition within the Atlantic samples. For mtDNA haplotypes, which segregated by basin, average genetic distances were higher among Atlantic haplotypes (CR: D (HKY)=0.036, COI: D-GTR=0.016) than among Indo-Pacific haplotypes (CR: D-HKY=0.010, COI: D-GTR=0.006) and approximated divergences between basins for CR (D-HKY=0.036 within Atlantic; D-HKY=0.042 between basins). Vertebral counts for eight specimens representing divergent lineages from the western north Atlantic were consistent with the genetic data. Coexistence of discrete lineages in the Atlantic, complete disequilibrium between nuclear and mitochondrial alleles within lineages and concordant partitions in genetic and morphological characters indicates reproductive isolation and thus the occurrence of a cryptic species of scalloped hammerhead in the western north Atlantic. Effective management of large coastal shark species should incorporate this important discovery and the inference from sampling that the cryptic scalloped hammerhead is less abundant than S. lewini, making it potentially more susceptible to fishery pressure.

AB Small-scale fisheries are important in Laos, where rural people heavily depend upon Mekong River and tributary fish stocks for their livelihoods. Increasing pressures from human exploitation and habitat disturbance, however, have raised serious concerns about the potential depletion of various species. This has led to the establishment of large numbers of Fish Conservation Zones (FCZs) or "no-take" fish sanctuaries in southern Laos based on a "community-based fisheries co-management" framework. This study uses the local ecological knowledge (LEK) of fishers to assess the effectiveness of village-managed FCZs in enhancing fish stocks in the mainstream Mekong River in Khong District, Champasak Province. Focus group interviews about species that are believed to have benefited from different FCZs are compared with parameters such as FCZ area, age, depth, localized gradient, water velocity, and the presence of wetland forests nearby. The results suggest that no one aspect is likely to account for variations in fish stocks; rather, it is the interaction between numerous factors that has the largest impact. Secondly, the results indicate that microhabitat diversity and protection are critical for maintaining and enhancing Mekong fisheries. Deep-water pools are particularly important as dry season refuges for many fish species, and FCZ depth may be the single most important environmental factor affecting the success of FCZs in the Mekong River, FCZs have the most potential to benefit relatively sedentary species, but may also benefit highly migratory species, given the right conditions. This study shows that integrated approaches to stock assessment that employ LEK and scientific fisheries management have considerable potential for improving Mekong capture-fisheries management.

AB In a field study, we compared anatomy and diurnal gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence in sunlit mature leaves of Macaranga gigantea (Reichb. f. and Zoll.) Muell. seedlings, saplings, an adult tree and suckers originating from stumps. We tested the hypothesis that the pattern of resource use shifts across various life stages with ontogenetic changes in leaf anatomy and physiology. Among leaves of different developmental stages, seedling leaves were the smallest and thinnest, whereas adult tree leaves were the largest and thickest, and the air space within the lamina was largest in seedling leaves and smallest in adult tree leaves. Photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) was higher in seedling and sapling leaves than in adult tree leaves. Mean PNUE in seedling leaves was 1.6 times that in adult tree leaves. Nevertheless, among the developmental stages, net photosynthetic rate (P-n) per unit leaf area was lowest in seedling leaves because they have the lowest nitrogen (N) content per unit leaf area. In situ water vapor stomatal conductance (g(s)) at a given leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit was highest in sapling leaves, suggesting that they have a high hydraulic efficiency per unit leaf area. Among developmental stages, intrinsic water-use efficiency (P-n/g(s)) and photochemical capacity of photosystem II were lowest in seedling leaves. Sapling leaves had the highest N concentration and P per unit dry mass and the highest g,, indicating that the gradual transition from the seedling stage to the sapling stage is accompanied by an accumulation of N in plant bodies and the development of hydraulic systems to counteract unfavorable environmental stresses. The properties of adult tree leaves (low PNUE, high carbon:N ratio, small and dense cells and thick lamina) indicate that, during the transition from the sapling stage to the adult tree stage, the priority of resource use in leaves gradually shifts from enhancement of photosynthetic performance to defense against herbivory and mechanical damage. Leaf morphology and physiology were coordinated with the differences in resource use at each life stage.

AB Aim Predictions of aquatic ecosystem change with global warming require basic data that accurately reflect the environmental conditions underlying species distributions. However, in remote arctic areas such baseline data are scarce. We assess the influence of environmental variables on chironomid distribution and taxon richness in shallow, isothermal lakes in a poorly studied arctic region. We pay particular attention to community variation along the treeline ecotonal zone where many environmental variables change abruptly in a relatively small area.
   Location Lake transect in Finnish Lapland spanning from boreal coniferous forest to arctic tundra.
   Methods Chironomid assemblages were determined from surface-sediment samples of 50 shallow (< 10 m) natural lakes. Abundance and taxon richness data were related to 24 limnological variables using canonical ordination techniques (DCA, CCA, RDA). A Monte Carlo permutation procedure was used to assess the explanatory power of single variables. Between-vegetation zone differences of richness were tested for statistical significance using one-way ANOVA.
   Results In total, 7771 chironomid head capsules were identified, consisting of 13 species, 10 species groups, four subgenera, 41 genera, four genus groups, five types and three with uncertain taxonomic affiliation. A hump-shaped relationship between taxon richness and elevation was noted along the study transect with a peak in taxon richness occurring in mountain birch woodland lakes at middle elevations, decreasing then towards both warmer and colder ends of the elevation/temperature gradient. Of the individual parameters, sediment organic content, total organic carbon, pH, and lake-specific air temperature accounted for the greatest amount of variation in the chironomid data.
   Main conclusions Maximum taxon richness occurred at mid-elevations where aquatic algae also reached their maximum diversity. This area coincides with an ecotonal transitional zone, which seems more likely to account for the peak in species richness. Our study demonstrates that the factors most strongly affecting chironomids in Finnish Lapland (i.e. temperature, and ecosystem features) are those that with great probability will also change as a result of future climate change. This will likely have an effect on the distribution of chironomids in subarctic and arctic areas.

Due to their unique position at the root-soil interface, AMF have been described as 'keystone mutualists' in ecosystems. Despite the importance of AMF in ecosystems, few studies exist that examine the seasonality of external hyphae and their exuded products ( e. g. glomalin), the AMF variables directly related to ecosystem function through their contributions to soil aggregation. This study examined seasonal dynamics of several soil variables, with a specific interest in the seasonality of external hyphae and glomalin, a glycoprotein produced by AMF, which is correlated with soil aggregate stability. Here we measured glomalin concentrations and external AMF and non-AMF hyphal length, as well as soil moisture, percent fungal root colonization ( AMF and non-AMF), and root length in soil in an intermountain grassland in western Montana over one growing season ( 13 time points). Of the glomalin pools and hyphal lengths measured, significant seasonal changes occurred for total glomalin (TG; 24.5% change), immunoreactive easily extractable glomalin (IREEG; 53.8% change), and AM hyphal length (107% change). Prior studies on glomalin in natural systems have not considered seasonal effects. The small seasonal change in glomalin pools lends further support to the hypothesis that glomalin is relatively stable in soils, and suggests that one-time sampling may be sufficient to satisfactorily capture this response variable. However, the generality of this observation has yet to be tested in a wider range of ecosystems.

AB The synchronized spawning of corals in many parts of the Indo-Pacific represents a huge injection of biological material into the waters around reefs. Much of this material is consumed by fishes and filter-feeding invertebrates in the 5 or so days following spawning. The present study is the first to document the effect of the consumption of coral propagules on a population of facultatively planktivorous fish and the transference of physiological condition across generations. The study compares two populations of the damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis that fed to differing degrees on coral propagules for 5 days after the annual mass spawning of corals at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Wind blew coral slicks over the outer lagoon to the inner lagoon some 1.5 km away. While coral propagules were abundant in the water column in the windward location, they were scarce by the time the water mass reached the inner lagoon. Behavioral observations 2-5 days after coral spawning showed that a significantly higher proportion of P. amboinensis was feeding on coral propagules in the windward location than in the inner lagoon location. Windward location females consumed coral propagules almost exclusively and had fuller guts than females from the inner lagoonal location. Five days after the mass coral spawning, windward location females had a higher condition factor and a larger liver mass relative to body mass compared to females within the inner lagoon or females from both locations 2 months later. Fish eggs laid by the windward location females soon after coral spawning yielded larvae that had 25% larger yolk sacs and 100% larger oil globules than did larvae produced from the females from the inner lagoon location, or larvae produced at either location prior to or well after coral spawning in 2 previous years. Larger yolk sacs and oil globules have been shown to have direct survival benefits in the transition from endogenous to exogenous feeding. A feeding experiment conducted on patch reefs showed that diet supplementation of breeding females with a high lipid food for just 5 min per day was sufficient to significantly increase yolk-sac sizes of newly hatched larvae. Evidence suggests that females gain a fitness advantage from feeding on coral spawn and that this is passed on to their offspring.

AB We investigated pollination biology and breeding systems in hybridizing populations of Pitcairnia albiflos and P. staminea: both species are endemic to rocky outcrops at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. These species are morphologically distinct and easily recognized by floral color: white in P. albiflos and red in P. staminea. Putative hybrids show a large range of intermediate pink floral colors. The showy hermaphroditic flowers offer pollen and nectar that attract many visitors including bees. butterflies. hawk moths, and bats. Although the flowers of both parental species and hybrids open at night, only P. albiflos had other adaptations for nocturnal pollination. Flowering times overlapped during three consecutive years of observation. Bees visited both species and putative hybrids. Cross-pollinations were performed within and among parental species and hybrids in a greenhouse using plants transplanted from the field. Pitcairnia staminea and hybrids are self-compatible and could be spontaneously self-pollinated, whereas P. albiflos, though self-compatible. needs pollinators services for self-pollination. Facultative agamospermy was found in the parental species. Prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive barriers between these taxa were weak. Reciprocal hand-pollinations between parental species and with hybrids yielded high fruit sets with viable seeds. Evaluations of fruit set, seed set, seed germination, and pollen viability were undertaken to compare the fitness of the hybrids relative to their parents. The hybrids showed equivalent fitness, except for lower pollen viability. Some conservation implications are noted.

AB Invertebrate species possess one or two Na+ channel genes, yet there are 10 in mammals. When did this explosive growth come about during vertebrate evolution? All mammalian Na+ channel genes reside on four chromosomes. It has been suggested that this came about by multiple duplications of an ancestral chromosome with a single Na+ channel gene followed by tandem duplications of Na+ channel genes on some of these chromosomes. Because a large-scale expansion of the vertebrate genome likely occurred before the divergence of teleosts and tetrapods, we tested this hypothesis by cloning Na+ channel genes in a teleost fish. Using an approach designed to clone all of the Na+ channel genes in a genome, we found six Na+ channel genes. Phylogenetic comparisons show that each teleost gene is orthologous to a Na+ channel gene or gene cluster on a different mammalian chromosome, supporting the hypothesis that four Na+ channel genes were present in the ancestors of teleosts and tetrapods. Further duplications occurred independently in the teleost and tetrapod lineages, with a greater number of duplications in tetrapods. This pattern has implications for the evolution of function and specialization of Na+ channel genes in vertebrates. Sodium channel genes also are linked to homeobox (Hox) gene clusters in mammals. Using our phylogeny of Na+ channel genes to independently test between two models of Hox gene evolution, we support the hypothesis that Hox gene clusters evolved as (AB) (CD) rather than (D[A(BC)]).

AB Loss of genetic variation in small, isolated populations is commonly observed at neutral or nearly neutral loci. In this study, the loss of genetic variation was assessed in island populations for a locus of major histocompatibility complex (Mhc), a locus shown to be under the influence of balancing selection. A total of 36 alleles was found at the second exon of RT1.Ba in 14 island and two mainland populations of Rattus fuscipes greyii. Despite this high overall diversity, a substantial lack of variation was observed in the small island populations, with 13 islands supporting only one to two alleles. Two populations, Waldegrave and Williams Islands, showed moderately high levels of heterozygosity (52-56%) which were greater than expected under neutrality suggesting the action of balancing selection. However, congruence between the level of variation at this Mhc locus and in previous allozyme electrophoresis and mitochondrial DNA studies highlights the dominant influence of genetic drift and population factors, such as bottlenecks and structuring in the founding population in the loss of genetic variation in these small, isolated populations.

AB We measured leaf respiration in 18 eastern deciduous forest tree species to determine if there were differences in temperature-respiration response functions among species or among canopy positions. Leaf respiration rates were measured in situ and on detached branches for Acer pensylvanicum L., A. rubrum L., Betula spp. (B. alleghaniensis Britt. and B. lenta L.), Carya glabra (Mill.) Sweet, Cornus florida L., Fraxinus spp. (primarily F. americana L.), Liriodendron tuliptfera L., Magnolia fraseri Walt., Nyssa sylvatica Marsh., Oxydendrum arboreum L., Platanus occidentalis L., Quercus alba L., Q. coccinea Muenchh., Q. prinus L., Q. rubra L., Rhododendron maximum L., Robinia psuedoacacia L., and Tilia americana L. in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA. Dark respiration was measured on fully expanded leaves at 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C with an infrared gas analyzer equipped with a temperature-controlled cuvette. Temperature-respiration response functions were fit for each leaf. There were significant differences in response functions among species and by canopy position within species. These differences were observed when respiration was expressed on a mass, nitrogen, or area basis. Cumulative nighttime leaf respiration was calculated and averaged over ten randomly selected nights for each leaf. Differences in mean cumulative nighttime respiration were statistically significant among canopy positions and species. We conclude that effects of canopy position and species on temperature-respiration response functions may need to be considered when making estimates of whole-tree or canopy respiration.

AB The relationships between leaf structure, nitrogen concentration and CO2 assimilation rate (A) were studied far 14 grass species grown in the laboratory under non-limiting nutrient conditions. Structural features included leaf thickness and density, and the proportion of leaf volume occupied by different types of tissue (mesophyll, epidermis, vessels and sclerenchyma). Relationships were assessed for data expressed per unit leaf area and fresh mass. The latter was found to be closely related to leaf volume, which allowed us to use A per unit leaf fresh mass (A(fm)) as a surrogate of A per unit leaf volume. Assimilation rate per unit leaf area (A(a)) was positively correlated with leaf thickness and with the amount of mesophyll per unit leaf area; the relationship with leaf nitrogen content per unit area was only marginally significant. A(fm) was negatively correlated with leaf thickness and positively with fresh mass-based leaf organic nitrogen concentration. A multiple regression involving these two variables explained 81 %, of the variance in A(fm). The value of A(fm) was also significantly related to the proportion of mesophyll in the leaf volume, but surprisingly the correlation was negative. This was because thin leaves with high A(fm) and nitrogen concentration had proportionally more mechanically supportive tissues than thick ones; as a consequence, they also had a lower proportion of mesophyll. These data suggest that, in addition to leaf nitrogen, leaf thickness has a strong impact on CO2 assimilation rate for the grass species studied.

AB A conceptual model of resource acquisition and allocation within a generalized, individual plant growing vegetatively in competition with others is presented. The model considers C and N acquisition, synthesis of assimilates and their transport and partitioning, growth of new tissues, reserve formation and recycling, and losses due to root exudation and respiration. These processes are regulated by the relative size of the C and N substrate pools in shoot and roots, in relation to meristematic sink strength. Translocation and allocation patterns are represented according to the Minchin phloem transport model, The current model is used to consider the impact of competition on resource acquisition and allocation, first by considering a plant growing in isolation and its response to manipulation of light, CO, and N supplies. Secondly, competitive plants are introduced and the direct effects on plant responses in terms of resource depletion are considered separately from indirect effects such as potential changes in the quality of resources available (e,g, light quality or soil N sources), In the past, many studies of plant competition have not established the importance of these indirect effects because they have not established all the processes involved in competition. This model can be used to interpret responses of whole plants to their neighbours in terms of the relative importance of both the direct and indirect effects of competition.

This column lysimeter study examined the effect of root architecture on NO3 leaching from two genotypes of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris Huds.) differing in rooting characteristics. Ammonium nitrate was applied (50 kg N ha(-1)) and the columns were irrigated dth 1, 2 or 3 em day(-1) (Exp. 1) or irrigation was delayed 1, 3 or 5 d (Exp. 2). In Exp. 1, leachate NO3 concentrations and total N leached from the shallow-rooted (SR) genotype were approximately twice those from the deep-rooted (DR) genotype. An average of 38 and 18% of the applied N leached from the SR and DR genotypes, respectively. Cumulative leaching losses increased with irrigation depth. In Exp. 2, NO3 leaching was reduced 90% or more by increasing the time period for immobilization from 1 to 5 d. Recovery of applied N-15 in the tissue averaged 87% after 2 mo. Absorption of NO3 and NH4 was measured in nutrient solution culture. The SR genotype had significantly higher uptake rates than DR for both forms of N, expressed on a root weight basis. Collectively these data indicate that a deep-rooted turfgrass absorbs N more efficiently than a shallow-rooted turf, reducing the concentration and total amount of NO3 leached. The effect is apparently not due to differences in N uptake, but rather to rooting patterns. Environmental conditions and management practices that affect roofing depth and density may thus affect N nutrition and NO3 leaching.

AB Previous studies of photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO2 have focused on the most recently expanded, sunlit leaves in the canopy. We examined acclimation in a vertical profile of leaves through a canopy of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The crop was grown at an elevated CO2 partial pressure of 55 Pa within a replicated field experiment using free-air CO2 enrichment. Cas exchange was used to estimate in vivo carboxylation capacity and the maximum rate of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate-limited photosynthesis. Net photosynthetic CO2 uptake was measured for leaves in situ within the canopy. Leaf contents of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), light-harvesting-complex (LHC) proteins, and total N were determined. Elevated CO2 did not affect carboxylation capacity in the most recently expanded leaves but led to a decrease in lower, shaded leaves during grain development. Despite this acclimation, in situ photosynthetic CO2 uptake remained higher under elevated CO2. Acclimation at elevated CO2 was accompanied by decreases in both Rubisco and total leaf N contents and an increase in LHC content. Elevated CO2 led to a larger increase in LHC/Rubisco in lower canopy leaves than in the uppermost leaf. Acclimation of leaf photosynthesis to elevated CO2 therefore depended on both vertical position within the canopy and the developmental stage.

AB Kalmia angustifolia L. is an ericaceous shrub that frequently invades black spruce (Picea mariana Mill.) clear-cuts in central Newfoundland. Field observations suggest that on many sites where K. angustifolia grows, black spruce seedlings become chlorotic and stunted. Previous laboratory research has suggested that allelochemicals of K. angustifolia affect the growth and development of black spruce as well as the growth of certain ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi associated with black spruce. Black spruce seedlings close to (< 1 m) and far from (> 1 m) K. angustifolia were sampled from a clear-cut in central Newfoundland. The ECM community structure, degree of mycorrhizal infection, height, mass, root:shoot ratio, and the foliar concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg of spruce seedlings growing close to and far from K. angustifolia were examined. Seedlings close to K. angustifolia had significantly lower foliar concentrations of N and P, had a lower rate of mycorrhizal infection, and were more frequently associated with Phialocephala dimorphospora, Kendrick, a potential root pathogen of black spruce, than seedlings growing far from K. angustifolia. There were positive linear relationships between black spruce foliar N concentration and total seedling height and biomass for seedlings growing away from K. angustifolia, but not far seedlings in close proximity to K. angustifolia. Hypotheses suggesting possible roles for nutrient competition, allelopathy, and K. angustifolia's ability to increase the occurrence of the pseudomycorrhizal P. dimorphospora on black spruce are proposed.

AB The root system of a sugar cane crop on an Ultisol in northeastern Brazil was examined throughout the plant and first ratoon crop cycles, using both coring and minirhizotron methods.  Total root masses (living plus dead, 0.9-1.1 kg m-2) and live root lengths (14.0-17.5 km m-2) were greater during the ratoon cycle than at the end of the plant cane cycle (0.75 kg m-2 and 13.8 km m-2, respectively).  Root die-back during the two weeks following ratoon harvest was estimated to be 0.15 kg m-2, about 17% of the total root mass.  Root die-back after the plant cane harvest was lower because fire was not used at this harvest and soil humidity was higher under the accumulated litter.  A small amount of fine roots proliferated in the litter layer, amounting to 1% of the total mass and 3% of the total length.  Root turnover could not be accurately assessed from minirhizotron observations due to variation in the relationship between coring data and the minirhizotron data with both time and soil depth.

AB Changes in Earth's climate are accelerating, prompting increasing calls to ensure that investments in ecological restoration and nature conservation accommodate such changes. To acknowledge this need, we propose the term "ecological renovation" to describe ecological management and nature conservation actions that actively allow for environmental change. To evaluate and progress the development of ecological renovation and related intervention options in a climate change context, we reviewed the literature and established a typology of options that have been proposed. We explored how these options address emerging principles underpinning climate-adapted conservation goals and whether the balance of approaches reflected in our typology is likely to be sufficient given expected rapid rates of climate change. Our typology recognizes a matrix of 23 intervention option types arranged on the basis of underpinning ecological mechanisms ("ameliorate changing conditions" or "build adaptive capacity") on one axis, and the nature of the tools used to manipulate them ("low regrets" or "climate targeted") on the other. Despite a burgeoning literature since 2008, we found that the majority of effort has consistently focused on low-regrets adaptation approaches that aim to build adaptive capacity. This is in many ways desirable, but a paradigm shift enabling greater attention to climate-targeted approaches is likely to be needed as climate change accelerates. When assessed against five emerging principles for setting nature conservation goals in a changing climate, only one option type could deliver to all five, and we identified a conflict between climate-targeted options and "wildness" values that calls for deeper evaluation. Importantly, much of the inference in the 473 reviewed studies was drawn from ecological reasoning and modeling, with only 16% offering new empirical evidence. We also noted significant biases toward North America and Europe, forest ecosystems, trees, and vertebrates. To address these limitations and help shift the paradigm toward humans as "renovators" rather than "restorers" of a prior world, we propose that ecological researchers contribute by (1) informing societal discourse toward adapting nature conservation goals to climate change, (2) adjusting and upscaling conservation planning to accommodate this suite of climate-adapted goals, and (3) reconceptualizing experimental approaches to increase empirical evidence and expedite innovation of tools to address change.

AB We propose a practical concept that distinguishes the particular kind of weaponry that has evolved to be used in combat between individuals of the same species and sex, which we term intrasexually selected weapons (ISWs). We present a treatise of ISWs in nature, aiming to understand their distinction and evolution from other secondary sex traits, including from 'sexually selected weapons', and from sexually dimorphic and monomorphic weaponry. We focus on the subset of secondary sex traits that are the result of same-sex combat, defined here as ISWs, provide not previously reported evolutionary patterns, and offer hypotheses to answer questions such as: why have only some species evolved weapons to fight for the opposite sex or breeding resources? We examined traits that seem to have evolved as ISWs in the entire animal phylogeny, restricting the classification of ISW to traits that are only present or enlarged in adults of one of the sexes, and are used as weapons during intrasexual fights. Because of the absence of behavioural data and, in many cases, lack of sexually discriminated series from juveniles to adults, we exclude the fossil record from this review. We merge morphological, ontogenetic, and behavioural information, and for the first time thoroughly review the tree of life to identify separate evolution of ISWs. We found that ISWs are only found in bilateral animals, appearing independently in nematodes, various groups of arthropods, and vertebrates. Our review sets a reference point to explore other taxa that we identify with potential ISWs for which behavioural or morphological studies are warranted. We establish that most ISWs come in pairs, are located in or near the head, are endo- or exoskeletal modifications, are overdeveloped structures compared with those found in females, are modified feeding structures and/or locomotor appendages, are most common in terrestrial taxa, are frequently used to guard females, territories, or both, and are also used in signalling displays to deter rivals and/or attract females. We also found that most taxa lack ISWs, that females of only a few species possess better-developed weapons than males, that the cases of independent evolution of ISWs are not evenly distributed across the phylogeny, and that animals possessing the most developed ISWs have non-hunting habits (e.g. herbivores) or are faunivores that prey on very small prey relative to their body size (e.g. insectivores). Bringing together perspectives from studies on a variety of taxa, we conceptualize that there are five ways in which a sexually dimorphic trait, apart from the primary sex traits, can be fixed: sexual selection, fecundity selection, parental role division, differential niche occupation between the sexes, and interference competition. We discuss these trends and the factors involved in the evolution of intrasexually selected weaponry in nature.

AB The ratio of carbon (C) that is invested into microbial growth to organic C taken up is known as microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), which is influenced by environmental factors such as soil temperature and soil moisture. How microbes will physiologically react to short-term environmental changes is not well understood, primarily due to methodological restrictions. Here we report on two independent laboratory experiments to explore short-term temperature and soil moisture effects on soil microbial physiology (i.e. respiration, growth, CUE, and microbial biomass turnover): (i) a temperature experiment with 1-day pre-incubation at 5, 15 and 25 degrees C at 60% water holding capacity (WHC), and (ii) a soil moisture/oxygen (O-2) experiment with 7-day pre-incubation at 20 degrees C at 30%, 60% WHC (both at 21% O-2) and 90% WHC at 1% O-2. Experiments were conducted with soils from arable, pasture and forest sites derived from both silicate and limestone bedrocks. We found that microbial CUE responded heterogeneously though overall positively to short-term temperature changes, and decreased significantly under high moisture level (90% WHC)/suboxic conditions due to strong decreases in microbial growth. Microbial biomass turnover time decreased dramatically with increasing temperature, and increased significantly at high moisture level (90% WHC)/suboxic conditions. Our findings reveal that the responses of microbial CUE and microbial biomass turnover to short-term temperature and moisture/O-2 changes depended mainly on microbial growth responses and less on respiration responses to the environmental cues, which were consistent across soils differing in land use and geology.

AB As urbanization processes, the increasing direct runoff caused by land use change has become a major challenge for urban hydrological system. In this study, the impact of urbanization on direct runoff in the Shenyang urban area was investigated using a modified Soil Conservation Service Curve Number model combined with remote sensing. Urban functional zone (UFZ) was used as the basic unit for hydrological analysis. The hydrological changes in runoff were analyzed by calculating the runoff difference between the current condition and the pre-urbanization condition. Moran's I was used to estimate the spatial autocorrelation of the entire area. Then we assessed the relative influence and marginal effects of factors affecting direct runoff using boosted regression trees (BRT). Our results showed that direct runoff was significantly related to urbanization. Under current conditions, direct runoff increment depth affected by urbanization in the study area was 68.02 mm. For different UFZs, high-density residential, business and industrial zones tended to have large runoff volumes and high runoff coefficients. Through flooding hazard analysis, we found about 6.53% of the study area fell into a significant hazard category. The industrial zone had largest area of significant hazard land (40.97 km(2)) and the business zone had the largest significant hazard percentage (21.19%). Moran's I results illustrated that the high-high clusters in Shenyang were mainly concentrated in the urban center. BRT analysis indicated that runoff had the strongest correlation with rainfall (52.07%), followed by impervious ratio (27.28%), normalized difference vegetation index (14.31%), antecedent 5-day rainfall (3.02%), and UFZs (1.70%). The industrial zone, business zone and high-density residential zone tend to have greater influence on runoff. Our study could present method for recognizing hotspots of direct runoff in large city, and may provide potential implications for green infrastructure selection and urban planning.

AB Current sustainability challenges - including biodiversity loss, pollution and land-use change require new ways of understanding, acting in and caring for the landscapes we live in. The concept of stewardship is increasingly used in research, policy and practice to articulate and describe responses to these challenges. However, there are multiple meanings and framings of stewardship across this wide user base that reflect different disciplinary purposes, assumptions and expertise, as well as a long history of use in both academic and lay contexts. Stewardship may therefore be considered a 'boundary object'; that is, a conceptual tool that enables collaboration and dialogue between different actors whilst allowing for differences in use and perception. This paper seeks to map out the multiple meanings of stewardship in the literature and help researchers and practitioners to navigate the challenges and opportunities that come with using the term. We provide the first qualitative systematic review of stewardship, and identify four distinct meanings of the concept in the literature: Ethic, Motivation, Action and Outcome. We then develop a novel framework for thinking through and connecting these multiple meanings, centered around three dimensions: care, knowledge and agency. This framework is used to identify the care dimension and relational approaches as important areas for future stewardship research. In these efforts - and for scholars engaging with the stewardship concept more broadly - this paper can act as a helpful 'centering device', connecting practitioners, policy-makers and researchers from multiple disciplines in pursuit of sustainability.

AB The release of toxic organic pollutants and heavy metals by primitive electronic waste (e-waste) processing to waterways has raised significant concerns, but little is known about their potential ecological effects on aquatic biota especially microorganisms. We characterized the microbial community composition and diversity in sediments sampled along two rivers consistently polluted by e-waste, and explored how community functions may respond to the complex combined pollution. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that Proteobacteria (particularly Deltaproteobacteria) dominated the sediment microbial assemblages followed by Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloraflexi and Firmicutes. PICRUSt metagenome inference provided an initial insight into the metabolic potentials of these e-waste affected communities, speculating that organic pollutants degradation in the sediment might be mainly performed by some of the dominant genera (such as Sulfuricurvum, Thiobacillus and Burkholderia) detected in situ. Statistical analyses revealed that toxic organic compounds contributed more to the observed variations in sediment microbial community structure and predicted functions (24.68% and 8.89%, respectively) than heavy metals (12.18% and 4.68%), and Benzo(a)pyrene, bioavailable lead and electrical conductivity were the key contributors. These results have shed light on the microbial assemblages in e-waste contaminated river sediments, indicating a potential influence of e-waste pollution on the microbial community structure and function in aquatic ecosystems.

AB Large fires account for the majority of burned area and are an important focus of fire management. However, 'large' is typically defined by a fire size threshold, minimizing the importance of proportionally large fires in less fire-prone ecoregions. Here, we defined 'large fires' as the largest 10% of wildfires by ecoregion (n = 175,222 wildfires from 1992 to 2015) across the United States (U.S.). Across ecoregions, we compared fire size, seasonality, and environmental conditions (e.g., wind speed, fuel moisture, biomass, vegetation type) of large human- and lighting-started fires that required a suppression response. Mean large fire size varied by three orders of magnitude: from 1 to 10 ha in the Northeast vs. >1000 ha in the West. Humans ignited four times as many large fires as lightning, and were the dominant source of large fires in the eastern and western U.S. (starting 92% and 65% of fires, respectively). Humans started 80,896 large fires in seasons when lightning-ignited fires were rare. Large human-started fires occurred in locations and months of significantly higher fuel moisture and wind speed than large lightning-started fires. National-scale fire policy should consider risks to ecosystems and economies by these proportionally large fires and include human drivers in large fire risk assessment.

AB Bacteria are one of the most abundant and diverse groups of micro-organisms and mediate many critical terrestrial ecosystem processes. Despite the crucial ecological role of bacteria, our understanding of their large-scale biogeography patterns across forests, and the processes that determine these patterns lags significantly behind that of macroorganisms. Here, we evaluated the geographic distributions of bacterial diversity and their driving factors across nine latitudinal forests along a 3,700-km north-south transect in eastern China, using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Four of 32 phyla detected were dominant: Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Chloroflexi (relative abundance>5%). Significant increases in bacterial richness and phylogenetic diversity were observed for temperate forests compared with subtropical or tropical forests. The soil organic matter (SOM) mineralisation rate (SOMmin, an index of SOM availability) explained the largest significant variations in bacterial richness. Variation partition analysis revealed that the bacterial community structure was closely correlated with environmental variables and geographic distance, which together explained 80.5% of community variation. Among all environmental factors, climatic features (MAT and MAP) were the best predictors of the bacterial community structure, whereas soil pH and SOMmin emerged as the most important edaphic drivers of the bacterial community structure. Plant functional traits (community weighted means of litter N content) and diversity resulted in weak but significant correlations with the bacterial community structure. Our findings provide new evidence of bacterial biogeography patterns from tropical to cold temperate forests. Additionally, the results indicated a close linkage among soil bacterial diversity, climate and SOM decomposition, which is critical for predicting continental-scale responses under future climate change scenarios and promoting sustainable forest ecosystem services.

AB The fate of peripheral forest tree populations is of particular interest in the context of climate change. These populations may concurrently be those where the most significant evolutionary changes will occur; those most facing increasing extinction risk; the source of migrants for the colonization of new areas at leading edges; or the source of genetic novelty for reinforcing standing genetic variation in various parts of the range. Deciding which strategy to implement for conserving and sustainably using the genetic resources of peripheral forest tree populations is a challenge.
   Here, we review the genetic and ecological processes acting on different types of peripheral populations and indicate why these processes may be of general interest for adapting forests and forest management to climate change. We particularly focus on peripheral populations at the rear edge of species distributions where environmental challenges are or will become most acute. We argue that peripheral forest tree populations are "natural laboratories" for resolving priority research questions such as how the complex interaction between demographic processes and natural selection shape local adaptation; and whether genetic adaptation will be sufficient to allow the long-term persistence of species within their current distribution.
   Peripheral populations are key assets for adaptive forestry which need specific measures for their preservation. The traditionally opposing views which may exist between conservation planning and sustainable forestry need to be reconciled and harmonized for managing peripheral populations. Based on existing knowledge, we suggest approaches and principles which may be used for the management and conservation of these distinctive and valuable populations, to maintain active genetic and ecological processes that have sustained them over time.

AB Leaf economics spectrum (LES) theory suggests a universal trade-off between resource acquisition and storage strategies in plants, expressed in relationships between foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), leaf mass per area (LMA), and photosynthesis. However, how environmental conditions mediate LES trait interrelationships, particularly at large biospheric scales, remains unknown because of a lack of spatially explicit data, which ultimately limits our understanding of ecosystem processes, such as primary productivity and biogeochemical cycles. We used airborne imaging spectroscopy and geospatial modeling to generate, to our knowledge, the first biospheric maps of LES traits, here centered on 76 million ha of Andean and Amazonian forest, to assess climatic and geophysical determinants of LES traits and their interrelationships. Elevation and substrate were codominant drivers of leaf trait distributions. Multiple additional climatic and geophysical factors were secondary determinants of plant traits. Anticorrelations between N and LMA followed general LES theory, but topo-edaphic conditions strongly mediated and, at times, eliminated this classic relationship. We found no evidence for simple P-LMA or N-P trade-offs in forest canopies; rather, we mapped a continuum of N-P-LMA interactions that are sensitive to elevation and temperature. Our results reveal nested climatic and geophysical filtering of LES traits and their interrelationships, with important implications for predictions of forest productivity and acclimation to rapid climate change.

AB Emerging development policies and lending standards call for consideration of ecosystem services when mitigating impacts from development, yet little guidance exists to inform this process. Here we propose a comprehensive framework for advancing both biodiversity and ecosystem service mitigation. We have clarified a means for choosing representative ecosystem service targets alongside biodiversity targets, identified servicesheds as a useful spatial unit for assessing ecosystem service avoidance, impact, and offset options, and discuss methods for consistent calculation of biodiversity and ecosystem service mitigation ratios. We emphasize the need to move away from area- and habitat-based assessment methods for both biodiversity and ecosystem services towards functional assessments at landscape or seascape scales. Such comprehensive assessments more accurately reflect cumulative impacts and variation in environmental quality, social needs and value preferences. The integrated framework builds on the experience of biodiversity mitigation while addressing the unique opportunities and challenges presented by ecosystem service mitigation. These advances contribute to growing potential for economic development planning and execution that will minimize impacts on nature and maximize human wellbeing. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Species distribution models (SDM) are a useful tool for predicting species range shifts in response to global warming. However, they do not explore the mechanisms underlying biological processes, making it difficult to predict shifts outside the environmental gradient where the model was trained. In this study, we combine correlative SDMs and knowledge on physiological limits to provide more robust predictions. The thermal thresholds obtained in growth and survival experiments were used as proxies of the fundamental niches of two foundational marine macrophytes. The geographic projections of these species' distributions obtained using these thresholds and existing SDMs were similar in areas where the species are either absent-rare or frequent and where their potential and realized niches match, reaching consensus predictions. The cold-temperate foundational seaweed Himanthalia elongata was predicted to become extinct at its southern limit in northern Spain in response to global warming, whereas the occupancy of southern-lusitanic Bifurcaria bifurcata was expected to increase. Combined approaches such as this one may also highlight geographic areas where models disagree potentially due to biotic factors. Physiological thresholds alone tended to over-predict species prevalence, as they cannot identify absences in climatic conditions within the species' range of physiological tolerance or at the optima. Although SDMs tended to have higher sensitivity than threshold models, they may include regressions that do not reflect causal mechanisms, constraining their predictive power. We present a simple example of how combining correlative and mechanistic knowledge provides a rapid way to gain insight into a species' niche resulting in consistent predictions and highlighting potential sources of uncertainty in forecasted responses to climate change.

AB Ecosystem accounting aims to provide a better understanding of ecosystem contributions to the economy in a spatially explicit way. Ecosystem accounting monitors ecosystem services and measures their monetary value using exchange values consistent with the System of National Accounts (SNA). We pilot monetary ecosystem accounting in a case study in Limburg province, the Netherlands. Seven ecosystem services are modelled and valued: crop production, fodder production, drinking water production, air quality regulation, carbon sequestration, nature tourism and hunting. We develop monetary ecosystem accounts that specify values generated by ecosystem services per hectare, per municipality and per land cover type. We analyse the relative importance of public and private ecosystem services. We found that the SNA-aligned monetary value of modelled ecosystem services for Limburg was around 112 million in 2010, with an average value of 508 per hectare. Ecosystem services with the highest values were crop production, nature tourism and fodder production. Due to the exclusion of consumer surplus in SNA valuation, calculated values are considerably lower than those typically found in welfare-based valuation approaches. We demonstrate the feasibility of valuing ecosystem services in a national accounting framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Shifts in species' ranges are one of the most frequently reported and globally ubiquitous impacts of climate change, with rates of movement being particularly high in the sea. The arrival of multiple range extending species can cause serious issues for natural resource managers; some species threaten ecosystem function while others present social and/or economic opportunities. An early indication of which species are potentially extending their ranges can provide useful guidance for managers regarding future investments in impact assessment, monitoring or potential management intervention. Given that scientific monitoring data on potential range shifting species are often sparse in the marine environment a rapid assessment that utilises and assimilates disparate data sources that vary in quality, quantity and collection methods is needed. Off the east coast of Tasmania surface waters have been warming at almost four times the global average and dozens of species range shifts have already been documented. Building on existing methods used in the early detection of invasive species, we developed a cost-effective and rapid screening assessment tool that uses monitoring data from a variety of sources, particularly from the citizen science program Redmap, to classify levels of confidence in potential range extensions over a three year time period (2009-2012) for a variety of marine species. From our assessment of 47 species, eight were classified with "high" confidence as potentially extending their ranges. The "high" confidence classification of these species suggests they should be a priority when investigating potential ecosystem and socio-economic impacts. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Despite the absence of major Quaternary glaciations in arid Northwest China, significant climatic oscillations definitely impacted the evolution of the biota in situ. Phylogeography has grown as a discipline because it has provided explicit tools for the study of geographical subdivision among populations. But phylogeographical application for arid Northwest China has begun to blossom, which has provided evidence that aridification played a significant role in the increase of genetic diversity and species diversification. The time frame corresponds with Pleistocene climatic oscillations, which caused extreme aridity and the expansion of sandy deserts. In the Asian desert flora subkingdom and Eurasian forest subkingdom of Northwest China, the recurrent phylogeographical scenarios, identified by different case studies, broadly agree with longstanding biogeographic, floristic, and topographic concepts: (i) aridification promoted diversification and speciation of desert plants; (ii) desert expansion caused habitat fragmentation; (iii) the Altay-Tianshan Mountains included glacial refugia for plants; (iv) population expansion and recolonization from glacial refugia occurred during the postglacial period; and (v) desert plants persistence and alpine plants retreat during climate oscillations. We discuss the main phylogeographical findings in light of molecular and paleo-environmental evidence, emphasizing notable gaps in our knowledge and outlining future research perspectives for disentangling the evolutionary history of this arid region's flora.

AB Acoustic monitoring can be an efficient, cheap, non-invasive alternative to physical trapping of individuals. Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods have been proposed to estimate calling animal abundance and density from data collected by a fixed array of microphones. However, these methods make some assumptions that are unlikely to hold in many situations, and the consequences of violating these are yet to be investigated. We generalize existing acoustic SECR methodology, enabling these methods to be used in a much wider variety of situations. We incorporate time-of-arrival (TOA) data collected by the microphone array, increasing the precision of calling animal density estimates. We use our method to estimate calling male density of the Cape Peninsula Moss Frog Arthroleptella lightfooti. Our method gives rise to an estimator of calling animal density that has negligible bias, and 95% confidence intervals with appropriate coverage. We show that using TOA information can substantially improve estimate precision. Our analysis of the A.lightfooti data provides the first statistically rigorous estimate of calling male density for an anuran population using a microphone array. This method fills a methodological gap in the monitoring of frog populations and is applicable to acoustic monitoring of other species that call or vocalize.

AB Population size and landscape connectivity are key determinants of population viability, yet no methods exist for simultaneously estimating density and connectivity parameters. Recently developed spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models provide a framework for estimating density of animal populations but thus far have not been used to study connectivity. Rather, all applications of SCR models have used encounter probability models based on the Euclidean distance between traps and animal activity centers, which implies that home ranges are stationary, symmetric, and unaffected by landscape structure. In this paper we devise encounter probability models based on "ecological distance," i.e., the least-cost path between traps and activity centers, which is a function of both Euclidean distance and animal movement behavior in resistant landscapes. We integrate least-cost path models into a likelihood-based estimation scheme for spatial capture-recapture models in order to estimate population density and parameters of the least-cost encounter probability model. Therefore, it is possible to make explicit inferences about animal density, distribution, and landscape connectivity as it relates to animal movement from standard capture-recapture data. Furthermore, a simulation study demonstrated that ignoring landscape connectivity can result in negatively biased density estimators under the naive SCR model.

AB Aim To measure the effects of including biotic interactions on climate-based species distribution models (SDMs) used to predict distribution shifts under climate change. We evaluated the performance of distribution models for an endangered marsupial, the northern bettong (Bettongia tropica), comparing models that used only climate variables with models that also took into account biotic interactions. Location North-east Queensland, Australia. Methods We developed separate climate-based distribution models for the northern bettong, its two main resources and a competitor species. We then constructed models for the northern bettong by including climate suitability estimates for the resources and competitor as additional predictor variables to make climate similar to+similar to resource and climate similar to+similar to resource similar to+similar to competition models. We projected these models onto seven future climate scenarios and compared predictions of northern bettong distribution made by these differently structured models, using a global metric, the I similarity statistic, to measure overlap in distribution and a local metric to identify where predictions differed significantly. Results Inclusion of food resource biotic interactions improved model performance. Over moderate climate changes, up to 3.0 similar to degrees C of warming, the climate-only model for the northern bettong gave similar predictions of distribution to the more complex models including interactions, with differences only at the margins of predicted distributions. For climate changes beyond 3.0 similar to degrees C, model predictions diverged significantly. The interactive model predicted less contraction of distribution than the simpler climate-only model. Main conclusions Distribution models that account for interactions with other species, in particular direct resources, improve model predictions in the present-day climate. For larger climate changes, shifts in distribution of interacting species cause predictions of interactive models to diverge from climate-only models. Incorporating interactions with other species in SDMs may be needed for long-term prediction of changes in distribution of species under climate change, particularly for specialized species strongly dependent on a small number of biotic interactions.

AB Spatial closures in the marine environment are widely accepted as effective conservation and fisheries management tools. Given increasing human-derived stressors acting on marine ecosystems, the need for such effective action is urgently clear. Here we explore mechanisms underlying the utility of marine reserves to reinstate trophic dynamics and to increase resilience of kelp beds against climate-driven phase shift to sea urchin barrens on the rapidly warming Tasmanian east coast. Tethering and tagging experiments were used to examine size-and shelter-specific survival of the range-extending sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii (Diadematidae) translocated to reefs inside and outside no-take Tasmanian marine reserves. Results show that survival rates of C. rodgersii exposed on flat reef substratum by tethering were approximately seven times (small urchins 10.1 times; large urchins 6.1 times) lower on protected reef within marine reserve boundaries (high abundance of large predatory-capable lobsters) compared to fished reef (large predatory lobsters absent). When able to seek crevice shelter, tag-resighting models estimated that mortality rates of C. rodgersii were lower overall but remained 3.3 times (small urchins 2.1 times; large urchins 6.4 times) higher in the presence of large lobsters inside marine reserves, with higher survival of small urchins owing to greater access to crevices relative to large urchins. Indeed, shelter was 6.3 times and 3.1 times more important to survival of small and large urchins, respectively, on reserved relative to fished reef. Experimental results corroborate with surveys throughout the range extension region, showing greater occurrence of overgrazing on high-relief rocky habitats where shelter for C. rodgersii is readily available. This shows that ecosystem impacts mediated by range extension of such habitat-modifying organisms will be heterogeneous in space, and that marine systems with a more natural complement of large and thus functional predators, as achievable within no-take reserves, will minimize local risk of phase shifts by reinstating size and habitat-specific predator-prey dynamics eroded by fishing. Importantly, our findings also highlight the crucial need to account for the influence of size dynamics and habitat complexity on rates of key predator-prey interactions when managing expectations of ecosystem-level responses within marine reserve boundaries.

Although previous studies have documented associations of human-caused fire ignitions with road corridors, less consideration has been given to understanding the multiple influences of roads on the fire regime at a broader landscape-scale. Therefore, we examined the difference between lightning- and human-caused fire ignitions in relation to forest road corridors and other anthropogenic and biophysical factors in the eastern Cascade Mountains of Washington State. We used geographical information systems and case-control logistic regression models to assess the relative importance of these explanatory variables that influence the locations of lightning versus human-caused ignitions.
   We found that human-caused ignitions were concentrated close to roads, in high road density areas, and near the wildland urban interface (WUI). In contrast, lightning-caused ignitions were concentrated in low road density areas, away from WUI, and in low population density areas. Lightning-caused ignitions were also associated with fuels and climatic and topographic factors. A weak but significant relationship between lightning-caused fire and proximity to gravel roads may be related to fuels near roads or to bias in detection and reporting of lightning-caused fires near roads. Although most small fires occurred in roaded areas, they accounted for only a small proportion of the total burned area. In contrast, the large fires in roadless and wilderness areas accounted for most of the burned area. Thus, from the standpoint of the total area burned, the effect of forest roads on restricting fire size is likely greater than the impact of roads on increasing fire ignitions. The results of our study suggest that roads and their edge effect area should be more widely acknowledged as a unique type of landscape effect in fire research and management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Global warming is affecting all major ecosystems, including temperate reefs where canopy-forming seaweeds provide biogenic habitat. In contrast to the rapidly growing recognition of how climate affects the performance and distribution of individuals and populations, relatively little is known about possible links between climate and biogenic habitat structure. We examined the relationship between several ocean temperature characteristics, expressed on time-scales of days, months and years, and habitat patch characteristics on 24 subtidal temperate reefs along a latitudinal gradient (Western Australia; similar to 34 to 27 degrees S). Significant temperature-related variation in habitat structure was observed, even though the total landscape cover of kelp and fucalean canopies did not change across the climate gradient: monospecific patches of kelp became increasingly dominant in warmer climates, at the expense of mixed kelp-fucalean canopies. The decline in mixed canopies was associated with an increase in the abundance of Sargassum spp., replacing a more diverse canopy of Scytothalia doryocarpa and several other large fucoids. There were no observed differences in the proportion of open gaps or gap characteristics. These habitat changes were most closely related to patterns in minimum temperatures and hot temperature thresholds (days >20 degrees C), presumably because temperate algae require cool periods for successful reproduction and recruitment (even if the adults can survive warmer temperatures). Although the observed habitat variation may appear subtle, similar structural differences have been linked to a range of effects on canopy-associated organisms through the provision of habitat and ecosystem engineering. Consequently, our study suggests that the magnitude of projected warming might cause changes in habitat structure and thereby indirectly affect numerous habitat-dependent plants and animals.

AB Agricultural intensification has led to dramatic losses in biodiversity over the past several decades. Many studies have shown the effects of intensification on vegetation or soil communities at field or local scales. However, the functional significance of biodiversity may only appear at larger spatial and temporal scales, due to exchanges among local ecosystems throughout a landscape. To examine how patterns of biodiversity loss are reflected at larger spatial scales, plant and soil biodiversity and associated indicators of ecosystem functions were assessed in riparian areas over a 150 km(2) agricultural landscape in the Sacramento Valley of California. Publicly-available GIS data were first used to classify and select sites over the range of soils, topography and plant community types. Representative sites from the landscape were sampled for soil physiochemical properties, as well as microbial, nematode, and plant communities. Higher agricultural intensification, based on field and landscape indices, was negatively correlated with richness and diversity of plant and soil taxa, and was related to indicators of ecosystem functions, such as increased soil nitrate and phosphorus loading, decreased riparian health ratings, and lower soil carbon, soil microbial biomass and soil food web structure. Both field- and landscape-scale factors played important roles in the measured losses. The study area was composed of a wide array of soils, vegetation, and land management, indicating that the observed trends transcended site-specific conditions.

AB The utility of microsatellite markers for inferring population size and trend has not been rigorously examined, even though these markers are commonly used to monitor the demography of natural populations. We assessed the ability of a linkage disequilibrium estimator of effective population size (N-e) and a simple capture-recapture estimator of abundance (N) to quantify the size and trend of stable or declining populations (true N = 100-10,000), using simulated Wright-Fisher populations. Neither method accurately or precisely estimated abundance at sample sizes of S = 30 individuals, regardless of true N. However, if larger samples of S = 60 or 120 individuals were collected, these methods provided useful insights into abundance and trends for populations of N = 100-500. At small population sizes (N = 100 or 250), precision of the N-e estimates was improved slightly more by a doubling of loci sampled than by a doubling of individuals sampled. In general, monitoring N-e proved a more robust means of identifying stable and declining populations than monitoring N over most of the parameter space we explored, and performance of the N-e estimator is further enhanced if the N-e/N ratio is low. However, at the largest population size (N = 10,000), N estimation outperformed N-e. Both methods generally required >= 5 generations to pass between sampling events to correctly identify population trend.

AB Increasing evidence shows that anthropogenic climate change is affecting biodiversity. Reducing or stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions may slow global warming, but past emissions will continue to contribute to further unavoidable warming for more than a century. With obvious signs of difficulties in achieving effective mitigation worldwide in the short term at least, sound scientific predictions of future impacts on biodiversity will be required to guide conservation planning and adaptation. This is especially true in Mediterranean type ecosystems that are projected to be among the most significantly affected by anthropogenic climate change, and show the highest levels of confidence in rainfall projections. Multiple methods are available for projecting the consequences of climate change on the main unit of interest - the species - with each method having strengths and weaknesses. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly applied for forecasting climate change impacts on species geographic ranges. Aggregation of models for different species allows inferences of impacts on biodiversity, though excluding the effects of species interactions. The modelling approach is based on several further assumptions and projections and should be treated cautiously. In the absence of comparable approaches that address large numbers of species, SDMs remain valuable in estimating the vulnerability of species. In this review we discuss the application of SDMs in predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with special reference to the species-rich South West Australian Floristic Region and South African Cape Floristic Region. We discuss the advantages and challenges in applying SDMs in biodiverse regions with high levels of endemicity, and how a similar biogeographical history in both regions may assist us in understanding their vulnerability to climate change. We suggest how the process of predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with SDMs can be improved and emphasize the role of field monitoring and experiments in validating the predictions of SDMs.

AB P>1. Identifying those areas suitable for recolonization by threatened species is essential to support efficient conservation policies. Habitat suitability models (HSM) predict species' potential distributions, but the quality of their predictions should be carefully assessed when the species-environment equilibrium assumption is violated.
   2. We studied the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra, whose numbers are recovering in southern Italy. To produce widely applicable results, we chose standard HSM procedures and looked for the models' capacities in predicting the suitability of a recolonization area. We used two fieldwork datasets: presence-only data, used in the Ecological Niche Factor Analyses (ENFA), and presence-absence data, used in a Generalized Linear Model (GLM). In addition to cross-validation, we independently evaluated the models with data from a recolonization event, providing presences on a previously unoccupied river.
   3. Three of the models successfully predicted the suitability of the recolonization area, but the GLM built with data before the recolonization disagreed with these predictions, missing the recolonized river's suitability and badly describing the otter's niche. Our results highlighted three points of relevance to modelling practices: (1) absences may prevent the models from correctly identifying areas suitable for a species spread; (2) the selection of variables may lead to randomness in the predictions; and (3) the Area Under Curve (AUC), a commonly used validation index, was not well suited to the evaluation of model quality, whereas the Boyce Index (CBI), based on presence data only, better highlighted the models' fit to the recolonization observations.
   4. For species with unstable spatial distributions, presence-only models may work better than presence-absence methods in making reliable predictions of suitable areas for expansion. An iterative modelling process, using new occurrences from each step of the species spread, may also help in progressively reducing errors.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Conservation plans depend on reliable models of the species' suitable habitats. In non-equilibrium situations, such as the case for threatened or invasive species, models could be affected negatively by the inclusion of absence data when predicting the areas of potential expansion. Presence-only methods will here provide a better basis for productive conservation management practices.

We measured rates of leaf photosynthesis, concentrations of N, ureides and protein in leaves of two soybean cultivars (Glycine max [L.] Merrill) differing in potential shoot biomass production, either associated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains, or amended with nitrate. Our results show that the C costs of biological N-2 fixation can be compensated by increased photosynthesis. Nodulated plants shifted N metabolism towards ureide accumulation at the start of the reproductive stage, at which time leaf N concentration of nodulated plants was greater than that of N-fertilized plants. The C sink strength of N-2 fixation increased photosynthetic N use efficiency at the beginning of plant development. At later stages, although average protein concentrations were similar between the groups of plants, maximum leaf protein of nodulated plants occurred a few days later than in N-fertilized plants. The chlorophyll content of nodulated plants remained high until the pod-filling stage, whereas the chlorophyll content of N-fertilized plants started to decrease as early as the flowering stage. These results suggest that, due to higher C sink strength and efficient N-2 fixation, nodulated plants achieve higher rates of photosynthesis and have delayed leaf senescence.

AB Flow is a key driver regulating processes and diversity in river systems across a range of temporal and spatial scales. In dryland rivers, variability in the timing and scale of floods has specific ecological significance, playing a major role in sustaining biotic diversity across the river-floodplain mosaic. However, longitudinal effects of floods are equally important, delivering water downstream through channels and wetland complexes. Interaction among spatially distributed wetlands, their connecting channel and floodplain geomorphology and the temporally variable flow events not only creates the spatial complexity in dryland rivers but also determines temporal persistence of wetlands. These act as hydrological 'sponges', absorbing water from upstream and needing to fill before releasing water downstream. Sequential high flow events are essential for the ecological persistence of riverine wetlands and the transmission of flows further downstream through the channel network. These flood sequences maintain aquatic refugia and drive booms in productivity sustaining aquatic and terrestrial biota over large spatial and temporal scales. Disrupting the sequence, with modified flow regimes and water removal for diversion (e. g. irrigation), significantly reduces the opportunity for wetland replenishment. As a result, the benefits of sequential flooding to the wetland 'sponges' and their biotic communities will be lost.

AB Seasonal movements between foraging, breeding, and overwintering sites occur in a wide variety of reptile species. Terrestrial snakes, lizards, and turtles migrate short distances (< 20 km) between seasonal habitats, whereas fully aquatic marine turtles migrate hundreds to thousands of kilometers between foraging and breeding areas. The purpose of this article is to summarize aspects of migratory physiology and behavior in reptiles, particularly with regards to energetics and sensory mechanisms for navigation and orientation. We discuss the influence of aerobic scope, endurance, and cost of transport on migratory capacity, the effects of temperature and circulating hormones on activity and behavior, and mechanisms of detecting and transducing environmental cues to successfully navigate and orient toward a goal during migration. Topics worthy of further research are highlighted in the text, and we conclude with a discussion of how information on migration patterns of reptiles may be used to manage and conserve threatened populations.

AB To examine the generality of population-level impacts of ancient vicariance identified for numerous arid-adapted animal taxa along the Baja peninsula, we tested phylogeographical hypotheses in a similarly distributed desert plant, Euphorbia lomelii (Euphorbiaceae). In light of fossil data indicating marked changes in the distributions of Baja floristic assemblages throughout the Holocene and earlier, we also examined evidence for range expansion over more recent temporal scales. Two classes of complementary analytical approaches - hypothesis-testing and hypothesis-generating - were used to exploit phylogeographical signal from chloroplast DNA sequence data and genotypic data from six codominant nuclear intron markers. Sequence data are consistent with a scenario of mid-peninsular vicariance originating c. 1 million years ago (Ma). Alternative vicariance scenarios representing earlier splitting events inferred for some animals (e.g. Isthmus of La Paz inundation, c. 3 Ma; Sea of Cortez formation, c. 5 Ma) were rejected. Nested clade phylo-geographical analysis corroborated coalescent simulation-based inferences. Nuclear markers broadened the temporal spectrum over which phylogeographical scenarios could be addressed, and provided strong evidence for recent range expansions along the north-south axis of the Baja peninsula. In contrast to previous plant studies in this region, however, the expansions do not appear to have been in a strictly northward direction. These findings contribute to a growing appreciation of the complexity of organismal responses to past climatic and geological changes - even when taxa have evolved in the same landscape context.

AB Question: Does the upward shift of species and accompanied increase in species richness, induced by climate change, lead to homogenization of Alpine summit vegetation?
   Location: Bernina region of the Swiss Alps.
   Methods: Based on a data set from previous literature we expand the analysis from species richness to beta-diversity and spatial heterogeneity. Species compositions of mountain summits are compared using a two-component heterogeneity concept including the mean and the variance of Sorensen similarities calculated between the summits. Non-metric multidimensional scaling is applied to explore developments of single summits in detail.
   Results: Both heterogeneity components (mean dissimilarity and variance) decrease over time, indicating a trend towards more homogeneous vegetation among Alpine summits. However, the development on single summits is not strictly unidirectional.
   Conclusions: The upward shift of plant species leads to homogenization of alpine summit regions. Thus, increasing alpha-diversity is accompanied by decreasing beta-diversity. Beta-diversity demands higher recognition by scientists as well as nature conservationists as it detects changes which cannot be described using species richness alone.

AB 1. The source of seed or plant material can have profound implications for the success of restoration efforts because most species exhibit adaptive genetic variation within their range. Understanding the geographical distribution of ecologically relevant genetic variation and the environmental factors driving adaptive divergence within species will help to ensure appropriate sourcing of material for ecological restoration.
   2. We present a study of geographical variation of ecologically important traits of the forest tree jarrah Eucalyptus marginata from a 15-year-old provenance trial in south-western Australia. We assessed trait variation in association with rainfall, latitude and slope position at the site of origin.
   3. Survival and stem diameter varied at the largest scale, between northern and southern jarrah forest provenances. Stem diameter also varied among rainfall zones, while latitude was a more important determinant of variation of reproductive traits (flowers and buds). None of the environmental variables accounted for significant variation of height, growth form or the presence of capsules. Slope position at the site of origin did not account for significant variation of any trait.
   4. Trees from low rainfall sites had smaller stem diameters, possibly reflecting selection for slower growth. Such a strategy could prevent drought stress and may explain why trees from the high rainfall southern jarrah forest, which showed the fastest growth, had the poorest survival at the drier northern trial site.
   5. Variation in the presence of buds and flowers among latitudinal divisions may be because of variation in flowering time, which has been observed previously among E. marginata populations. However, variation among replicate blocks within the trial suggests that the environment also strongly influences expression of these traits.
   6. Synthesis and applications. We have demonstrated divergence of several ecologically important traits in association with different types of environmental variation. Our findings support an argument for 'habitat matching' when sourcing material for restoration; however, differences among trait types in the distribution of variation highlight the need to consider environmental variation at a range of geographical scales. Consideration of ecologically important genetic variation within species is important and this information should be integrated into seed collection strategies for ecological restoration.

AB Multiple mating is thought to provide an opportunity for females to avoid the costs of genetic incompatibility by postcopulatory selection of compatible sperm haplotypes. Few studies have tested the genetic incompatibility hypothesis directly. Here we experimentally manipulated the compatibility of females with their mates using the gryllid cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus. We recorded the hatching success of eggs laid by females mated with two nonsibling males, two siblings, or one nonsibling male and one sibling. In contrast with two previous studies on crickets that have adopted this approach, the hatching success of eggs did not differ between females mated with two full siblings and females mated with two unrelated males, indicating that embryo viability was not a cost of inbreeding in this species. We assigned paternity to offspring produced by females mated to both a sibling and a nonsibling male using microsatellite markers. As in previous studies of this species, we were unable to detect any difference in the proportion of offspring sired by the 1st and the 2nd male to mate with a female when females were unrelated to their mates. However, in our experimental matings the proportion of offspring sired by the nonsibling male depended on his sequence position. Paternity was biased toward the nonsibling male when he mated first. Our data show that molecular analyses of paternity are essential to detect subtle mechanisms of postcopulatory sexual selection.

AB The separation of populations by ice sheets into large refugia can account for much of the genetic diversity found in present day populations. The evolutionary implications of small glacial refugia have not been as thoroughly explored. To examine refugial origins of North American mountain sheep Ovis spp., we analyzed a 604 bp portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region from 223 O. dalli and O. canadensis. Major refugia were identified in eastern Beringia and southern North America, and we found evidence for two smaller refugia situated between the Laurentide and Cordilleran glaciers. Our results are the first to demonstrate support for survival of any organism in the latter two refugia. These refugia also appear to have conserved a genetic signal that confirms past hybridization of O. dalli and O. canadensis.

AB Non- native common carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.) are the most abundant large-bodied fish in the Murray Darling Basin. The abundance of common carp larvae and young-of-the-year appears to increase after flooding, although the relative contribution of floodplain habitats compared to riverine areas remains unresolved. Larval nets were used monthly from September 2000 to January 2001 to identify common carp spawning and recruitment areas in the regulated Murray River and floodplain around the Barmah-Millewa forest. Five non-native and five native fish species comprising 136 111 individuals were collected, with common carp constituting 88% of the overall catch. Less than 1% of common carp, however, originated from the Murray River upstream of the Barmah-Millewa floodplain. Consequently, this floodplain appears to be a major source of common carp recruitment in the mid-Murray area. Conversely, eggs from large-bodied native fish were only present in the Murray River and not the Barmah floodplain. There are opportunities for common carp control in this area, to potentially reduce populations in a wider river reach. Implementation of common carp control measures in the Barmah-Millewa floodplain should be further investigated, particularly with regard to seasonal irrigation flows, obligatory migration routes and in the timing of future large-scale environmental water allocations.

AB Values of species richness are used widely to establish conservation and management priorities. Because inventory data, money, and time are limited, use of surrogates such as "indicator" species to estimate species richness has become common. Identifying sets of indicator species that might reliably predict species richness, especially across taxonomic groups, remains a considerable challenge. We used genetic algorithms and a Bayesian approach to explain individual and combined species richness of two taxonomic groups as a function of occurrence patterns of indicator species drawn from either both groups or one group. Genetic algorithms iteratively screen large numbers of potential models and predictor variables in a process that emulates natural selection. The best fitting models of bird species richness and butterfly species richness explained approximately 80% of deviances and included only indicator species from the same taxonomic group. Using species from both taxonomic groups as potential predictors did not improve model fit but slightly improved the parsimony (fewer predictors) of the model of bird species richness. The best model of combined species richness included five butterflies and one bird and explained 83% of deviance, whereas a model of combined species richness based on six butterflies as indicators explained 82% of deviance. A model of combined species richness based on birds alone explained 72% of deviance. We found that a small, common set of species could be used to predict separately the species richness of multiple taxonomic groups. We built models explaining approximately 70% of the deviance in species richness of birds and butterflies based on a common set of three bird species and three butterfly species. We also identified a set of six species of butterflies that predicted >66% of both bird species richness and butterfly species richness. Our approach is applicable to any assemblage or ecosystem, and may be useful both for estimating species richness and for gaining insight into mechanisms that influence diversity patterns.

AB Albacore (Thunnus alalunga) is a highly migratory pelagic species distributed in all tropical and temperate oceans. Recent analyses using both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA markers have demonstrated genetic subdivision within and between Atlantic and Pacific populations. However, although numerous biological differences have been reported for Atlantic and Mediterranean albacore, the genetic differentiation for these basins has not been demonstrated. We characterized 373 base pairs of nucleotide sequence from the mitochondrial DNA control region of 134 individuals collected in the Pacific (n = 30): the northeast (NE) Atlantic (n = 54) and the Mediterranean (n = 50). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed a small, but highly significant, proportion of genetic variation separating these three regions (Phi(st) = 0.041; P = 0.009), a pattern also supported by pairwise comparisons. These results demonstrate for the first time the genetic distinctiveness of the Mediterranean albacore from the NE Atlantic population giving support to the current management practices based on separate units. This outcome is concordant with reported migratory movements related to reproductive behavior between the NE Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, the phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences revealed the presence of a shallow genetic discontinuity with no geographic association. These two phylogroups are more likely the result of the demographic history of this species (i.e. long demographic stable history) as opposed to historical vicariance as has been proposed for other highly migratory fishes.

AB Accurate knowledge of the response of root turnover to a changing climate is needed to predict growth and produce carbon cycle models. A soil warming system and shading were used to vary soil temperature and received radiation independently in a temperate grassland dominated by Holcus lanatus L. Minirhizotrons allowed root growth and turnover to be examined non-destructively. In two short-term (8 week) experiments, root responses to temperature were seasonally distinct. Root number increased when heating was applied during spring, but root death increased during autumnal heating. An experiment lasting 12 months demonstrated that any positive response to temperature was short-lived and that over a full growing season, soil warming led to a reduction in root number and mass due to increased root death during autumn and winter. Root respiration was also insensitive to soil temperature over much of the year. In contrast, root growth was strongly affected by incident radiation. Root biomass, length, birth rate, number and turnover were all reduced by shading. Photosynthesis in H. lanatus exhibited some acclimation to shading, but assimilation rates at growth irradiance were still lower in shaded plants. The negative effects of shading and soil warming on roots were additive. Comparison of root data with environmental measurements demonstrated a number of positive relationships with photosynthetically active radiation, but not with soil temperature. This was true both across the entire data set and within a shade treatment. These results demonstrate that root growth is unlikely to be directly affected by increased soil temperatures as a result of global warming, at least in temperate areas, and that predictions of net primary productivity should not be based on a positive root growth response to temperature.

AB Root growth and crop yield can be affected by chemical modifications of the soil profile owing to lime and gypsum applications. A field trial was carried out on a dystrophic Clay Rhodic Hapludox in Ponta Grossa, Parana State, Brazil, aiming to evaluate the changes in the chemical soil properties and corn response to lime and gypsum applications at the installation of a no-tillage system. A randomized complete block design was used, with three replications, in a split-plot experiment. The main plots received dolomitic limestone treatments (no lime; 4.5 t ha(-1) of lime applied on the surface supplying the total demand, 113 of the total demand applied on the surface during three years; total demand incorporated into the soil) and the subplots received gypsum rates (0, 3, 6, and 9 t ha(-1)). The treatments with lime were applied in July 1998 and the rates of gypsum in October 1998. Corn was evaluated in the agricultural year of 2001/02. The applied surface liming, at full or split rates, provided a more accentuated soil acidity correction in the superficial layer (0-0.05 m), and there was a stronger reaction in the 0.05-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m layers, when lime was incorporated into the soil. Gypsum improved the subsoil, increasing the concentrations of Ca and S-SO42-, raised N, K, and Ca concentrations in the corn leaves, while it reduced the Mg concentration in soil and corn leaves. Liming and gypsum treatments did not affect the corn root growth. Liming (whether surface applied, at full or split rates, or incorporated into the soil) and gypsum increased the corn yield, due to an increase in the Ca soil saturation of the superficial layers. The application of gypsum associated to liming was an effective strategy to maximize grain yields.

AB Relating patterns of species abundance to the processes that determine them at local and regional spatial scales is one of the central aims of ecological research. To examine the relationship between distribution and growth in tropical rain forest, seasonal and annual changes in tree diameter of two tree species with contrasting distribution patterns, Celtis mildbraedii and Strombosia glaucescens, were monitored across topographic gradients in moist semi-deciduous and moist evergreen forest in Ghana over 2 years, 1997-9. Concurrent measurements were made of soil water availability, and during 1997/8, of rainfall, nutrient availability and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The two sites received similar, low, total rainfall during 1997/8, but soil water availability in the dry season at the evergreen site exceeded that at the semi-deciduous forest site. Soil water availability was higher during 1998/9 at both sites. During 1997/8, PAR was similar at the two sites. The evergreen site had soils of lower pH, available P, Mg, Ca and K concentrations than the semi-deciduous forest site. Water availability and the sand content of the soil increased and concentrations of total N and C decreased, from summit to valley positions at both sites. Celtis mildbraedii had significantly faster growth rates than S. glaucescens, and growth of both species was greater at the semi-deciduous than the evergreen forest site during the wet year (1998/9) but not during the dry year (1997/8). Celtis mildbraedii in semi-deciduous forest grew less in valley than summit and slope positions. We conclude that in the absence of a severe dry season, growth is higher in semi-deciduous than evergreen forest, and is related to the higher soil fertility in more seasonal forest. The patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that concentrations of available P and/or cations in the soil limit growth in evergreen forest, while concentrations of N in valley soils limit growth of C. mildbraedii in semi-deciduous forest. There was no evidence that variation in PAR influenced growth rates in these forests. A reduction in growth rate on less fertile soils may be a factor determining the distribution limit of dry forest species, such as C. mildbraedii, in evergreen forest.

AB 1. Animal populations, defined by geographical areas within a species' distribution where population dynamics are largely regulated by births and deaths rather than by migration from surrounding areas, may be the correct unit for wildlife management. However, in heterogeneous landscapes varying habitat quality may yield subpopulations with distinct patterns in resource use and demography significant to the dynamics of populations.
   2. To define the spatial population structure of polar bears Ursus maritimus in the Norwegian and western Russian Arctic, and to assess the existence of a shared population between the two countries, we analysed satellite telemetry data obtained from 105 female polar bears over 12 years.
   3. Using both cluster analyses and home-range estimation methods, we identified five population units inhabiting areas with different sea-ice characteristics and prey availability.
   4. The continuous distribution of polar bear positions indicated that the different subpopulations formed one continuous polar bear population in the Norwegian and western Russian Arctic. Hence, Norway and Russia have a shared management responsibility.
   5. The spatial population structure identified will provide a guide for evaluating geographical patterns in polar bear ecology, the dynamics of polar bear-seal relationships and the effects of habitat alteration due to climate change. The work illustrates the importance of defining population borders and subpopulation structure in understanding the dynamics and management of larger animals.

AB We reviewed the theory of conservation genetics, with special emphasis on the influence of haplodiploidy and other aspects of bee biology upon conservation genetic parameters. We then investigated the possibility that pollinator decline can be addressed in this way, using two meta-analytical approaches on genetic data from the Hymenoptera and the Lepidoptera. First, we compared levels of heterozygosity between the orders. As has been found previously, the haplodiploid Hymenoptera had markedly lower levels of genetic variation than the Lepidoptera. Bees had even lower levels, and bumble bees, in particular, often seemed almost monomorphic genetically. However, the statistically confounding effects of phylogeny render detailed interpretation of such data difficult. Second, we investigated patterns of gene flow among populations of these insects. Hymenoptera were far more likely to show genetic affects of population fragmentation than are Lepidoptera, even at similar geographic distances between populations. The reduced effective population sizes resulting from haplodiploidy probably contributed to this result. The proportion of species with low levels of gene flow did not vary among the different taxonomic groups within the Hymenoptera.

AB Examining patterns of genetic diversity has become an integral component of many management plans concerning endangered species, yet interpreting the processes underlying such patterns remains challenging. We demonstrate low genetic diversity in a critically endangered small mammal population. A common interpretation of this pattern would be that it is the result of a known, recent decline in this population. We test this interpretation and find it to be incorrect. Instead, by using museum voucher specimens, we show that the pattern of low genetic diversity is historical. This study demonstrates the importance of choosing appropriate reference groups by which to interpret modern levels of genetic diversity in endangered species. We conclude that analysis of archival specimens may be essential in cases where genetic diversity is driving conservation management decisions because it may allow us to distinguish the effects of low genetic diversity from the process of losing diversity. We recognize that this approach can be limited due to several sampling issues: archival material may not be available, statistical power needs to be evaluated, sample sizes and sequence lengths may be suboptimal due to intrinsic difficulties associated with amplification of degraded DNA. These issues are discussed and possible solutions identified. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the response to nitrogen (0 or 100 kg N/ha) of field-grown Muller-Thurgau grapevines grafted on six rootstocks (Kober 5BB, Teleki 5C, Teleki 8B, Selection Oppenheim 4, Couderc 3309, Ruggeri 140). Half the nitrogen was applied four weeks pre-flowering and half at the end of flowering. Glutamine accounted for over 85% of xylem nitrogen, indicating that most soil nitrogen was assimilated by way of vine root metabolism. Nitrogen supply increased the translocation of glutamine, glutamate, NO3-, NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and PO43- in the xylem sap and decreased the ratio of organic to inorganic nitrogen, V. berlandieri x V. riparia crosses generally resulted in higher xylem solute concentrations compared with other rootstocks, but were less effective in total nitrogen assimilation. High soil nitrogen increased vine leaf area by stimulating lateral-shoot growth, increased leaf chlorophyll, photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance, and delayed leaf senescence. There was no difference among rootstocks in scion leaf area, but rootstocks affected scion response to soil nitrogen level in terms of leaf chlorophyll content and leaf gas exchange; SO4 induced the strongest reaction to soil N, whereas Ru-140 elicited the least reaction. Chlorophyll content was highest for vines grafted on 5BB and lowest for C-3309. Photosynthesis response to both nitrogen and rootstock was regulated at the mesophyll level. There were few interactions between nitrogen and rootstocks, and their contribution to total variance was small relative to main effects. Thus, with the exception of SO4, differences due to rootstocks were mostly unaffected by soil nitrogen level.

AB In their search for generalizations, ecologists have postulated many concepts and processes. Some of these have become reified. Reification consists of accepting a designation as if it has empirical meaning when, in fact, its existence has either never been tested or it has been found empty. The distinction between a hypothesis and a reification is that hypotheses are created to be tested and replaced, whereas a reification is taken as an untestable axiom. When a research area loses its dynamism, its hypotheses become reifications. Conversely, if reifications are permitted to accumulate, they can destroy the dynamism of a research area. If a science retains an excess number of reifications, it stagnates and ultimately loses its status as a science. Reified concepts include the logistic equation (together with the theoretical constructs based on it), the idea of constant ecological efficiency, the concept of an integrated community, and certain aspects of species diversity, particularly in the context 'good', 'bad' and alien species.
   Also, there are reified metaphors, which, if taken seriously, can be obfuscatory. For example, natural communities have been likened to aeroplanes, and each. species to parts of an aeroplane. A metaphor is then constructed in which the removal of a species from a community is likened to the removal of an aeroplane part. Just as removal of one or more parts will cause the plane to crash, the metaphor asserts that the removal of one too many species from a community will result in collapse of the community. On closer examination, this is seen as empty. There is no 'aeroplane'.
   Also, the designation of certain kinds of species as good or bad - specifically, alien species are bad and 'native' species are good - is empty and misleading. While invasive species, in some cases, actually do damage native species, the generalization that invaders will reduce species diversity is not well founded.
   Fields that are required to focus on research defined by social needs, like ecology and medicine, rather than on scientific capabilities, like astronomy and hydrodynamics, generate reifications. Reifications are dangerous to the health of a research area and should be avoided. Only vigorous extirpation of reifications permits a field to preserve scientific integrity.

AB The production of auxins [indoleacetic acid (IAA) and related compounds] by Azospirillum brasilense and Klebsiella pneumoniae in culture media supplemented with tryptophan was investigated. Extracts from the supernatants of cultures incubated for different periods of time were partitioned into two fractions and each fraction was analysed separately by using HPLC, The chromatography was performed by using different optimized mobile phases and corresponding standards. Both N-fixing strains produced high quanti ties of extracellular IAA and tryptophol. The production of both compounds increased during the stationary phase of the culture. However, very low levels of indoleacetaldehyde and indolepyruvate produced by K. pneumoniae in the exponential phase of the culture, were only recorded when the samples were analysed immediately after the extraction. In addition, the effect of different concentrations of filter-sterilized culture supernatants of both strains on the development of rice roots grown in hydroponic culture medium was studied. Addition of the optimum concentrations (6-8%) of bacterial supernatants to such hydroponic cultures in creased root elongation, root surface area, root dry matter and development of lateral roots and root hairs compared to untreated roots. On the other hand, the addition of high concentrations of the supernatant (more than 10%) strongly inhibited root elongation, lateral root development, and caused root outgrowths, i.e. round nodule-like tumours.

AB Domain III of the mitochondrial 12S rDNA was examined in 51 tick species to test discrepancies between a previously published 16S mitochondrial rDNA phylogeny and phylogenies based on morphology and the 18S nuclear rDNA gene. There were 4 possible hypotheses. First, the 12S and the 16S genes support identical trees. Second, the 17S produces a unique phylogeny. If either hypothesis is valid, then additional genes would need to be examined to test morphological or 18S rDNA phylogenies. Third, the 12S tree, like the 16S tree, provides a weakly resolved phylogeny suggesting that neither gene is useful in resolving higher order relationships. Fourth, the 12S tree supports the morphological and 18S phylogenies, suggesting that the 16S is not useful for resolving higher ol del relationships. The results of the study support the 3rd hypothesis; both mitochondrial rDNA genes provided weak phylogenetic support among all but the most recently evolved groups of species. Although the 17S and 16S genes resolved intrageneric and intraspecific relationships, the lack of resolution among higher taxonomic groups appears to be caused by homoplasy arising from the high AT content and a high overall mutation rate in the tick mitochondrial genome.

AB Profiles of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area (N-area), and photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) were measured in an aspen, two jack pine, and two black spruce stands in the BOREAS northern study area. N-area decreased with decreasing %PAR in each stand, in all conifer stands combined (r = 0.52) and in all stands combined (r = 0.46). Understory alder had higher N-area for similar %PAR than did aspen early in the growing season. A(max) decreased with decreasing N-area except for the negative correlation between N-area and A(max) during shoot flush for jack pine. For the middle and late growing season data, N-area and A(max) had r values of 0.51 for all stands combined and 0.60 for all conifer stands combined. For similar N-area the aspen stand had higher A(max) than did the conifer stands. Photosynthetic capacity expressed as a percentage of A(max) at the top of the canopy (%A(max0)) decreased with %PAR similarly in all stands, but %A(max0) decreased at a much slower rate than did %PAR. To demonstrate the implications of the vertical distribution of A(max), three different assumptions were used to scale leaf A(max) to the canopy (A(can-max)): (1) constant A(max) with canopy depth, (2) A(max) scaled proportionally to %PAR, and (3) a linear relationship between A(max) and cumulative leaf area index derived from our data. The first and third methods resulted in similar A(can-max); the second was much lower. All methods resulted in linear correlations between normalized difference vegetation indices measured from a helicopter and A(can-max) (r = 0.97, 0.93, and 0.97, respectively), but the slope was strongly influenced by the scaling method.

AB The effect of liming on microbial activity and N transformations was examined in four very acidic, organic topsoils to help explain reports of poor growth of conifers on some such soils. Data were obtained from laboratory incubations and from a long-term field experiment. Liming to a pH near 6.5 caused soil respiration and microbial biomass to at least double in the first 4 d, mainly due to the proliferation of indigenous acid intolerant bacteria. Soil respiration then declined rapidly but microbial biomass less so, and in two soils, biomass remained significantly greater than the control beyond 101 d. Liming caused an initial increase in net N mineralization in all soils, but beyond 34 d, it became similar to or substantially less than the control. Nitrification in the limed soils increased rapidly at around 30 d. The greatest reduction in N mineralization occurred in two soils with the greatest C-to-N ratio. Immobilization of N in the microbial biomass could not account for the very small N mineralization rates observed in the long term, but a relatively small increase in the N concentration of the stableresidual soil organic matter could. Small net N mineralization rates in limed organic soils with a large C-to-N ratio that could persist for more than 10 y may cause N stress in single species stands of trees on plantation forest, but it is unlikely to decrease the growth of vegetation in species-rich communities.

AB Root research has been hampered by a lack of good methods and by the amount of time involved in making measurements. The use of the minirhizotron as a quantitative tool requires comparison with conventional destructive methods. This study was conducted in the greenhouse to compare the minirhizotron technique with core and monolith methods in quantifying barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and fababean (Vicia faba L.) root distribution. Plants were grown in boxes (80 cm long x 80 cm wide x 75 cm deep) in a hexagonal arrangement to minimize the effects of rooting anistrophy. Minirhizotron observations and destructive sampling to a depth of 70 cm using core and monolith methods were performed at the ripening growth stage. Total root length for the entire depth interval was generally higher in barley (159-309 m) than fababean (110-226 m). Significant correlation coefficients between monolith and core methods for root length density (RLD, cm cm-3) was observed in both crops (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.01). A method and depth interaction showed no significant differences in fababean RLD distribution measured by core and monolith methods. However, the RLD was different for the uppermost 40 cm depth in barley. The relationship for RLD between minirhizotron and core methods was significant only in barley (r = 0.77*). For both crops, estimates of RLD in the top 10-cm layer by the minirhizotron technique were lower than those by core and monolith techniques. In contrast, estimates of RLD were higher in fababean at a depth >30 cm. Destructive sampling still remains the method to quantify root growth in the 0-10 cm soil layer.

AB Vegetation restoration on degraded lands has been encouraged worldwide due to its ecological services and function of controlling soil erosion and improving carbon (C) stocks in terrestrial ecosystems. Although the processes of runoff and sediment detachment and transport are well recognized, the effects of vegetation restoration on organic C loss through soil erosion are not fully understood within a given landscape. This study conducted a synthesis from 66 sites to evaluate the effects of vegetation restoration on annual C loss induced by soil erosion across the key areas of the 'Grain for Green' Program (GGP) in the Loess Plateau, China. The results showed that vegetation restoration has significantly reduced the annual C loss in sediment and from runoff. Since 2000, a total of 8.6 x 10(6) ha degraded land has been converted to forests, shrubs and grasslands under the GGP, which has reduced runoff by 1.5 x 10(9) m(3) and is associated with 7.3 x 10(3) Mg C; furthermore, lost sediment has reduced by 348.7 Tg, which is associated with 1.8 Tg C per year, across the Loess Plateau. In the zone with a mean annual precipitation (MAP) < 550 mm, the degraded lands that have been converted to grasslands and shrubs have reduced more soil and water losses than have the lands that have been converted to forests; additionally, in the zone with a MAP > 550 mm, the degraded lands that have been converted to forests have less soil erosion than do the lands that have been converted to grasslands and shrubs. Moreover, C loss induced by soil erosion was mainly affected by plant cover, soil porosity, slope, land-use change, and rainfall intensity on the Loess Plateau. This study suggests that optimal vegetation restoration measures should be adopted based on local conditions to reduce C loss induced by soil erosion.

AB In developing countries, invasive alien species (IAS) threaten smallholder farmer production and the food security of subsistence growers, but economic impacts are widely under-reported. Here, the economic impacts of IAS that threaten smallholder mixed maize farming in eastern Africa are presented. Maize is important for most smallholders and is commonly grown with horticultural crops and other cereals which collectively provide nutrition and income. These crops are also important for national economies. Estimates of the economic impacts of five major IAS: Chilo partellus, Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease, Parthenium hysterophorus, Liriomyza spp. and Tuta absoluta on mixed maize smallholders in six countries gave current combined annual losses of US$0.9-1.1 billion; and future annual losses (next 5-10 years) of US$1.0-1.2 billion.

AB Robust tools are needed to prioritise the management of invasive non-native species (INNS). Risk assessment is commonly used to prioritise INNS, but fails to take into account the feasibility of management. Risk management provides a structured evaluation of management options, but has received little attention to date. We present a risk management scheme to assess the feasibility of eradicating INNS that can be used, in conjunction with existing risk assessment schemes, to support prioritisation. The Non-Native Risk Management scheme (NNRM) can be applied to any predefined area and any taxa. It uses semi-quantitative response and confidence scores to assess seven key criteria: Effectiveness, Practicality, Cost, Impact, Acceptability, Window of opportunity and Likelihood of re-invasion. Scores are elicited using expert judgement, supported by available evidence, and consensus-building methods. We applied the NNRM to forty-one INNS that threaten Great Britain (GB). Thirty-three experts provided scores, with overall feasibility of eradication assessed as 'very high' (8 species), 'high' (6), 'medium' (8), 'low' (10) and 'very low' (9). The feasibility of eradicating terrestrial species was higher than aquatic species. Lotic freshwater and marine species scored particularly low. Combining risk management and existing risk assessment scores identified six established species as priorities for eradication. A further six species that are not yet established were identified as priorities for eradication on arrival as part of contingency planning. The NNRM is one of the first INNS risk management schemes that can be used with existing risk assessments to prioritise INNS eradication in any area.

AB Background: The amount and structure of genetic diversity in dessert apple germplasm conserved at a European level is mostly unknown, since all diversity studies conducted in Europe until now have been performed on regional or national collections. Here, we applied a common set of 16 SSR markers to genotype more than 2,400 accessions across 14 collections representing three broad European geographic regions (North + East, West and South) with the aim to analyze the extent, distribution and structure of variation in the apple genetic resources in Europe.
   Results: A Bayesian model-based clustering approach showed that diversity was organized in three groups, although these were only moderately differentiated (F-ST = 0.031). A nested Bayesian clustering approach allowed identification of subgroups which revealed internal patterns of substructure within the groups, allowing a finer delineation of the variation into eight subgroups (F-ST = 0.044). The first level of stratification revealed an asymmetric division of the germplasm among the three groups, and a clear association was found with the geographical regions of origin of the cultivars. The substructure revealed clear partitioning of genetic groups among countries, but also interesting associations between subgroups and breeding purposes of recent cultivars or particular usage such as cider production. Additional parentage analyses allowed us to identify both putative parents of more than 40 old and/or local cultivars giving interesting insights in the pedigree of some emblematic cultivars.
   Conclusions: The variation found at group and subgroup levels may reflect a combination of historical processes of migration/selection and adaptive factors to diverse agricultural environments that, together with genetic drift, have resulted in extensive genetic variation but limited population structure. The European dessert apple germplasm represents an important source of genetic diversity with a strong historical and patrimonial value. The present work thus constitutes a decisive step in the field of conservation genetics. Moreover, the obtained data can be used for defining a European apple core collection useful for further identification of genomic regions associated with commercially important horticultural traits in apple through genome-wide association studies.

AB Wild pigs (Sus scrofa), also known as wild swine, feral pigs, or feral hogs, are one of the most widespread and successful invasive species around the world. Wild pigs have been linked to extensive and costly agricultural damage and present a serious threat to plant and animal communities due to their rooting behavior and omnivorous diet. We modeled the current distribution of wild pigs in the United States to better understand the physiological and ecological factors that may determine their invasive potential and to guide future study and eradication efforts. Using national-scale wild pig occurrence data reported between 1982 and 2012 by wildlife management professionals, we estimated the probability of wild pig occurrence across the United States using a logistic discrimination function and environmental covariates hypothesized to influence the distribution of the species. Our results suggest the distribution of wild pigs in the U.S. was most strongly limited by cold temperatures and availability of water, and that they were most likely to occur where potential home ranges had higher habitat heterogeneity, providing access to multiple key resources including water, forage, and cover. High probability of occurrence was also associated with frequent high temperatures, up to a high threshold. However, this pattern is driven by pigs' historic distribution in warm climates of the southern U.S. Further study of pigs' ability to persist in cold northern climates is needed to better understand whether low temperatures actually limit their distribution. Our model highlights areas at risk of invasion as those with habitat conditions similar to those found in pigs' current range that are also near current populations. This study provides a macro-scale approach to generalist species distribution modeling that is applicable to other generalist and invasive species.

AB Background. The diversification of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is shaped by its transmission history. We therefore used a population based province wide HIV drug resistance database in British Columbia (BC), Canada, to evaluate the impact of clinical, demographic, and behavioral factors on rates of HIV transmission.
   Methods. We reconstructed molecular phylogenies from 27 296 anonymized bulk HIV pol sequences representing 7747 individuals in BC-about half the estimated HIV prevalence in BC. Infections were grouped into clusters based on phylogenetic distances, as a proxy for variation in transmission rates. Rates of cluster expansion were reconstructed from estimated dates of HIV seroconversion.
   Results. Our criteria grouped 4431 individuals into 744 clusters largely separated with respect to risk factors, including large established clusters predominated by injection drug users and more-recently emerging clusters comprising men who have sex with men. The mean log(10) viral load of an individual's phylogenetic neighborhood (composed of 5 other individuals with shortest phylogenetic distances) increased their odds of appearing in a cluster by >2-fold per log(10) viruses per milliliter.
   Conclusions. Hotspots of ongoing HIV transmission can be characterized in near real time by the secondary analysis of HIV resistance genotypes, providing an important potential resource for targeting public health initiatives for HIV prevention.

AB Changes in the relative abundances of coral taxa during recovery from disturbance may cause shifts in essential ecological processes on coral reefs. Coral cover can return to pre-disturbance levels (coral recovery) without the assemblage returning to its previous composition (i.e., without reassembly). The processes underlying such changes are not well understood due to a scarcity of long-term studies with sufficient taxonomic resolution. We assessed the trajectories and time frames for coral recovery and reassembly of coral communities following disturbances, using modeled trajectories based on data from a broad spatial and temporal monitoring program. We studied coral communities at six reefs that suffered substantial coral loss and subsequently regained at least 50 % of their pre-disturbance coral cover. Five of the six communities regained their coral cover and the rates were remarkably consistent, taking 7-10 years. Four of the six communities reassembled to their pre-disturbance composition in 8-13 years. The coral communities at three of the reefs both regained coral cover and reassembled ten years. The trajectories of two communities suggested that they were unlikely to reassemble and the remaining community did not regain pre-disturbance coral cover. The communities that regained coral cover and reassembled had high relative abundance of tabulate Acropora spp. Coral communities of this composition appear likely to persist in a regime of pulse disturbances at intervals of ten years or more. Communities that failed to either regain coral cover or reassemble were in near-shore locations and had high relative abundance of Porites spp. and soft corals. Under current disturbance regimes, these communities are unlikely to re-establish their pre-disturbance community composition.

AB Species intolerant of changing climate might avoid extinction within refugia buffered from extreme conditions. Refugia have been observed in the fossil record but are not well documented or understood on ecological time scales. Using a 37-year record from the eastern Pacific across the two most severe El Nino events on record (1982-1983 and 1997-1998) we show how an exceptionally thermally sensitive reef-building hydrocoral, Millepora intricata, twice survived catastrophic bleaching in a deeper-water refuge (>11 m depth). During both events, M. intricata was extirpated across its range in shallow water, but showed recovery within several years, while two other hydrocorals without deep-water populations were driven to regional extinction. Evidence from the subfossil record in the same area showed shallow-water persistence of abundant M. intricata populations from 5000 years ago, through severe El Nino-Southern Oscillation cycles, suggesting a potential depth refugium on a millennial timescale. Our data confirm the deep refuge hypothesis for corals under thermal stress.

AB The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is well known for being of great importance in the evolution of montane species due to its unique geological history and landform configuration, climate complexity, and diversified habitats. The effect of environmental changes since the Quaternary on species diversification, population genetic structure, and demography under environmental change can be studied using phylogenetic and phylogeographical approaches. Birds are the most well-studied group of all terrestrial vertebrates with regard to their response to climatic changes over time. Herein, we briefly review the species diversification of birds in response to the uplift of the QTP, focusing on summarizing the different phylogeographical patterns of birds on the Plateau, its southeastern margin, and the Eastern Himalayas and the reasons underlying these patterns. Speciation was found to be closely related to the uplift of the QTP, with different patterns of intraspecific processes: (1) no divergence within a single refuge was identified in a restricted semi-continuous area of the eastern margin of the Plateau; (2) two divergent lineages with separated refugia were located at the south-eastern and north-eastern margins of the plateau; and (3) multiple divergent lineages within subregions were found in the Eastern Himalayas. Glacial movements and induced climate change are considered to be key factors in shaping these different patterns. The species distributed mainly in the heavily ice-covered platform regions of the Plateau experienced population expansion following the retreat of the extensive glaciations, whereas the species distributed on the ice-free edges of the plateau maintained their population size at a stable level. Demographic stresses on the edge species might have been mitigated by the milder climate in comparison to their platform-distributed counterparts. Various behavioral and ecological characteristics, including dispersal capacity, habitat preference, and elevation specificity, along with evolutionary history might have helped to shape these different phylogeographical patterns

AB Accurate species delimitation is a central assumption of biology that, in groups such as the Crocodylia, is often hindered by highly conserved morphology and frequent introgression. In Africa, crocodilian systematics has been hampered by complex regional biogeography and confounded taxonomic history. We used rigorous molecular and morphological species delimitation methods to test the hypothesis that the slender-snouted crocodile (Mecistops cataphractus) is composed of multiple species corresponding to the Congolian and Guinean biogeographic zones. Speciation probability was assessed by using 11 mitochondrial and nuclear genes, and cranial morphology for over 100 specimens, representing the full geographical extent of the species distribution. Molecular Bayesian and phylogenetic species delimitation showed unanimous support for two Mecistops species isolated to the Upper Guinean and Congo (including Lower Guinean) biomes that were supported by 13 cranial characters capable of unambiguously diagnosing each species. Fossil-calibrated phylogenetic reconstruction estimated that the species split +/- 6.5-7.5 Ma, which is congruent with intraspecies divergence within the sympatric crocodile genus Osteolaemus and the formation of the Cameroon Volcanic Line. Our results underscore the necessity of comprehensive phylogeographic analyses within currently recognized taxa to detect cryptic species within the Crocodylia. We recommend that the community of crocodilian researchers reconsider the conceptualization of crocodilian species especially in the light of the conservation ramifications for this economically and ecologically important group.

AB Mesophotic coral reefs (30-150 m) have recently received increased attention as a potential source of larvae (e.g., the refugia hypothesis) to repopulate a select subset of the shallow water (<30 m) coral fauna. To test the refugia hypothesis we used highly polymorphic Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers as a means to assess small-scale genetic heterogeneity between geographic locations and across depth clines in the Caribbean coral, Montastraea cavernosa. Zooxanthellae-free DNA extracts of coral samples (N = 105) were analyzed from four depths, shallow (3-10 m), medium (15-25 m), deep (30-50 m) and very deep (60-90 m) from Little Cayman Island (LCI), Lee Stocking Island (LSI), Bahamas and San Salvador (SS), Bahamas which range in distance from 170 to 1,600 km apart. Using AMOVA analysis there were significant differences in Phi(ST) values in pair wise comparisons between LCI and LSI. Among depths at LCI, there was significant genetic differentiation between shallow and medium versus deep and very deep depths in contrast there were no significant differences in Phi(ST) values among depths at LSI. The assignment program AFLPOP, however, correctly assigned 95.7% of the LCI and LSI samples to the depths from which they were collected, differentiating among populations as little as 10 to 20 m in depth from one another. Discriminant function analysis of the data showed significant differentiation among samples when categorized by collection site as well as collection depth. F-ST outlier analyses identified 2 loci under positive selection and 3 under balancing selection at LCI. At LSI 2 loci were identified, both showing balancing selection. This data shows that adult populations of M. cavernosa separated by depths of tens of meters exhibits significant genetic structure, indicative of low population connectivity among and within sites and are not supplying successful recruits to adjacent coral reefs less than 30 m in depth.

AB The distribution of freshwater taxa is a good biogeographic model to study pattern and process of vicariance and dispersal. The subfamily Leuciscinae (Cyprinidae, Teleostei) consists of many species distributed widely in Eurasia and North America. Leuciscinae have been divided into two phyletic groups, leuciscin and phoxinin. The phylogenetic relationships between major clades within the subfamily are poorly understood, largely because of the overwhelming diversity of the group. The origin of the Far Eastern phoxinin is an interesting question regarding the evolutionary history of Leuciscinae. Here we present phylogenetic analysis of 31 species of Leuciscinae and outgroups based on complete mitochondrial genome sequences to clarify the phylogenetic relationships and to infer the evolutionary history of the subfamily.
   Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the Far Eastern phoxinin species comprised the monophyletic clades Tribolodon, Pseudaspius, Oreoleuciscus and Far Eastern Phoxinus. The Far Eastern phoxinin clade was independent of other Leuciscinae lineages and was closer to North American phoxinins than European leuciscins. All of our analysis also suggested that leuciscins and phoxinins each constituted monophyletic groups. Divergence time estimation suggested that Leuciscinae species diverged from outgroups such as Tincinae to be 833 million years ago (Mya) in the Late Cretaceous and leuciscin and phoxinin shared a common ancestor 70.7 Mya. Radiation of Leuciscinae lineages occurred during the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene. This period also witnessed the radiation of tetrapods. Reconstruction of ancestral areas indicates Leuciscinae species originated within Europe. Leuciscin species evolved in Europe and the ancestor of phoxinin was distributed in North America. The Far Eastern phoxinins would have dispersed from North America to Far East across the Beringia land bridge. The present study suggests important roles for the continental rearrangements during the Late Cretaceous to form the present-day distribution of organisms. Furthermore, the Late Cretaceous biotic turnover influenced for the modern terrestrial biodiversity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Invasions by non-indigenous macroinvertebrates often cause ecological and economic problems, and commercial ships have been implicated as a principal mechanism for their dispersal. We explored the presence and species diversity of adult macroinvertebrates transported by transoceanic and coastal vessels arriving to ports on the Atlantic coast of Canada. We sampled 67 ballast tanks from 62 ships operating along discrete geographic pathways and tested whether mid-ocean exchange or voyage length affects the probability for translocation of macroinvertebrates. Additionally, we assessed the relationship between macroinvertebrate presence and the amount of sediment in ballast tanks. We document the presence of highly invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenas), mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii), common periwinkle (Littorina littorea), soft shell clam (Mya arenaria) and blue mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) in ballast tanks of surveyed ships. Mid-ocean exchange did not affect macroinvertebrate occurrence, suggesting that current ballast water management regulations are ineffective for this taxonomic group. Viable individuals were recorded in vessels undertaking shorter voyages (average and maximum of 4.5 and 15 days, respectively) and presence was not related to the amount of sediment in tanks. While presence and densities of macroinvertebrates were low, invasion risk may nonetheless be significant during reproductive seasons owing to high fecundity of some taxa. The highest risk may be posed by decapods since gravid females may carry thousands to several million eggs per clutch, and after several weeks of brooding, two or more subsequent clutches may be fertilized by retained sperm from an earlier mating.

AB Accumulative disturbances can erode a coral reef's resilience, often leading to replacement of scleractinian corals by macroalgae or other non-coral organisms. These degraded reef systems have been mostly described based on changes in the composition of the reef benthos, and there is little understanding of how such changes are influenced by, and in turn influence, other components of the reef ecosystem. This study investigated the spatial variation in benthic communities on fringing reefs around the inner Seychelles islands. Specifically, relationships between benthic composition and the underlying substrata, as well as the associated fish assemblages were assessed. High variability in benthic composition was found among reefs, with a gradient from high coral cover (up to 58%) and high structural complexity to high macroalgae cover (up to 95%) and low structural complexity at the extremes. This gradient was associated with declining species richness of fishes, reduced diversity of fish functional groups, and lower abundance of corallivorous fishes. There were no reciprocal increases in herbivorous fish abundances, and relationships with other fish functional groups and total fish abundance were weak. Reefs grouping at the extremes of complex coral habitats or low-complexity macroalgal habitats displayed markedly different fish communities, with only two species of benthic invertebrate feeding fishes in greater abundance in the macroalgal habitat. These results have negative implications for the continuation of many coral reef ecosystem processes and services if more reefs shift to extreme degraded conditions dominated by macroalgae.

AB The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) has become widely accepted as a framework for understanding and assessing the benefits that ecosystems provide to human well-being. Its classification of services into the categories of provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural, has been increasingly widely adopted. However, several authors have recently argued that the MA's definition and classification of services may not be the most appropriate for monetary assessments. This paper seeks to understand in greater depth the sources of problems arising from the use of the MA's definition and classification of services for economic valuation. Firstly, we review and disentangle the critical literature to date. Secondly, we undertake a practical examination of existing primary valuation studies, which we analyse according to the MA classification and then compare with an output based-classification. We use water ecosystem services provided by tropical forests as an example for our analysis. Our results provide further evidence of the risk of double counting and the problems related to the secondary use of valuation estimates, as a consequence of service overlapping and service ambiguity.

AB 1. Fire is a major driver of ecosystem structure and function worldwide. It is also widely used as a management tool to achieve conservation goals. A common objective is the maintenance of fire mosaics comprising spatially heterogeneous patches of differing fire history. However, it is unclear what properties of fire mosaics most enhance conservation efforts. Here we focus on the spatial and temporal properties of fire-prone landscapes that influence the distribution of small mammals.
   2. We surveyed small mammals in 28 landscapes (each 12 6 km(2)) representing a range of fire histories in the Murray Mallee region (104 000 km(2)) of semi-arid Australia. Generalised linear mixed models were used to examine the influence of five landscape properties on the capture rate of individual species and the species richness of native small mammals. We investigated the influence of the proportional extent of fire age-classes, the diversity of fire age-classes, the extent of the dominant vegetation type, rainfall history and biogeographic context.
   3. Three of four study species were associated with the spatial extent of fire age-classes. Older vegetation was found to provide important habitat for native small mammals. Overall, however, rainfall history and biogeographic context were dominant influences: for example, the species richness of native mammals was positively associated with above-average rainfall. There was little evidence that the diversity of fire age-classes influenced either the capture rate of individual species or species richness.
   4. Synthesis and applications. In fire-prone environments, habitat availability can change markedly over short time-scales. Sufficient habitat at a suitable seral stage within the landscape is a key requirement for species conservation. In mallee ecosystems, the retention of older vegetation is recommended to create more desirable fire mosaics for native small mammals. In addition to such spatial properties of mosaics that are amenable to manipulation, an understanding of how ecological processes affect the biota (such as variation in rainfall-driven productivity) is also essential for informed conservation management.

AB Species relocation programmes are increasingly performed with the intention of establishing a self-sustaining population of threatened or declining native species. However, the use of experimental quantitative approaches in species relocation programmes is still relatively uncommon, despite a number of international studies recommending clear guidelines and standards. This paper evaluates species relocation programmes conducted within Australia to assess how programmes performed in relation to such standards. The search techniques identified 54 species relocation programmes, the majority of which were reintroductions (52%) and supplementations (30%). Only 25 (46%) of the species relocation programmes claimed success, with a lack of effective predator control recognized as contributing to the failure of 14 programmes. There was considerable variation in the quality of species relocation programmes in relation to key features such as whether the programme integrated experimental approaches with testable hypotheses, whether there were explicit statements of criteria for success, whether suitable habitat was identified for the release site and whether long-term monitoring was conducted. We propose guidelines to improve scientific rigour and success rates of species relocation programmes.

AB Abiotic stress conditions are the major limitations in modem agriculture. Although many genes associated with plant response(s) to abiotic stresses have been indentified and used to generate stress tolerant plants, the success in producing stress-tolerant crops is limited. New technologies are providing opportunities to generate stress tolerant crops. Biotechnological approaches that emphasize the development of transgenic crops under conditions that mimic the field situation and focus on the plant reproductive stage will significantly improve the opportunities of producing stress tolerant crops. Here, we highlight recent advances and discuss the limitations that hinder the fast integration of transgenic crops into agriculture and suggest possible research directions.

AB Tourist movement is a complex process. It can be modelled from a number of different perspectives; for example, Tourism, Geography, Economics, Mathematics, Computer Sciences and Psychology. This paper aims to establish a sound methodology, using Semi-Markov processes to model the spatial and temporal movement of tourists. The objective is to understand, predict, control for, and optimise the decisions made by tourists in their choice of attractions. Semi-Markov processes have a Markov chain and a renewal process embedded within their structure, and as such, can be used to provide a wide variety of practical models. One of the outcomes of this approach is the introduction of a measure to assess the attractiveness of particular tourist attractions based on spatial and temporal interactions between the attractions. A case study conducted at Phillip Island Nature Park, Victoria, Australia is used to validate the model. The study's results support the proposed model's efficiency. The results are also practical and useful for assisting park managers and tourist operators with park planning and marketing decisions: for example, knowing which attractions are the most popular, how long tourists will spend at any one site; and what the likely routes are that they will follow.

AB The natural hydrology of streams and rivers is being extensively modified by human activities. Water diversion, dam construction, and climate change have the potential to increase the frequency and intensity of low-flow events. Flow is a dominant force structuring stream aquatic insect communities, but the impacts of water diversion are poorly understood. Here we report results of an experimental stream flow diversion designed to test how aquatic insect communities respond to a low-flow disturbance. We diverted 40% to 80% of the water in three replicate streams for three summers, leading to summer flow exceedance probabilities of up to 99.9%. Shifts in habitat availability appeared to be a major driver of aquatic insect community responses. Responses also varied by habitat type: total insect density decreased in riffle habitats, but there was no change in pool habitats. Overall, the total biomass of aquatic insects decreased sharply with lowered flow. Collector-filterers, collector-gatherers, and scrapers were especially susceptible, while predatory insects were more resistant. Despite extremely low flow levels, there was no shift in aquatic insect family richness. The experimental water withdrawal did not increase water temperature or decrease water quality, and some wetted habitat was always maintained, which likely prevented more severe impacts on aquatic insect communities.

AB Aim
   Increasing our understanding of the effects of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and determining the location of refugia requires studies on widely distributed species with dense sampling of populations. We have reconstructed the biogeographic history of Clitarchus hookeri (White), a widespread species of New Zealand stick insect that exhibits geographic parthenogenesis, using phylogeographic analysis and ecological niche modelling.
   Location
   New Zealand.
   Methods
   We used DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes from C. hookeri and two undescribed Clitarchus species. We also used distribution data from our own field surveys and museum records to reconstruct the geographic distribution of C. hookeri during the present and the LGM, using ecological niche modelling.
   Results
   The ecological niche models showed that the geographic distribution of C. hookeri has expanded dramatically since the LGM. Our model predicted large areas of suitable LGM habitat in upper North Island, and small patches along the east coast of South Island. The phylogeographic analysis shows that populations in the northern half of North Island contain much higher levels of genetic variation than those from southern North Island and South Island, and is congruent with the ecological niche model. The distribution of bisexual populations is also non-random, with males completely absent from South Island and very rare in southern North Island.
   Main conclusions
   During the LGM C. hookeri was most likely restricted to several refugia in upper North Island and one or more smaller refugia along the east coast of South Island. The unisexual populations predominate in post-glacial landscapes and are clearly favoured in the recolonization of such areas. Our study exemplifies the utility of integrating ecological niche modelling and phylogeographic analysis.

AB Aim We studied the history of colonization, diversification and introgression among major phylogroups in the American pika, Ochotona princeps (Lagomorpha), using comparative and statistical phylogeographic methods. Our goal was to understand how Pleistocene climatic fluctuations have shaped the distribution of diversity at mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) loci in this alpine specialist.
   Location North America's Intermountain West.
   Methods We accumulated mtDNA sequence data (c. 560-1700 bp) from 232 pikas representing 64 localities, and sequenced two nuclear introns (mast cell growth factor, c. 550 bp, n = 148; protein kinase C iota, c. 660 bp, n = 139) from a subset of individuals. To determine the distribution of major mtDNA lineages, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis on the mtDNA sequence data, and we calculated divergence times among the lineages using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. Relationships among nuclear alleles were explored with minimum spanning networks. Finally, we conducted coalescent simulations of alternative models of population history to test for congruence between nDNA and mtDNA responses to Pleistocene glacial cycles.
   Results We found that: (1) all individuals could be assigned to one of five allopatric mtDNA lineages; (2) lineages are associated with separate mountain provinces; (3) lineages originated from at least two rounds of differentiation; (4) nDNA and mtDNA markers exhibited overall phylogeographic congruence; and (5) introgression among phylogroups has occurred at nuclear loci since their initial isolation.
   Main conclusions Pika populations associated with different mountain systems have followed separate but not completely independent evolutionary trajectories through multiple glacial cycles. Range expansion associated with climate cooling (i.e. glaciations) promoted genetic admixture among populations within mountain ranges. It also permitted periodic contact and introgression between phylogroups associated with different mountain systems, the record of which is retained at nDNA but not mtDNA loci. Evidence for different histories at nuclear and mtDNA loci (i.e. periodic introgression versus deep isolation, respectively) emphasizes the importance of multilocus perspectives for reconstructing complete population histories.

AB P>This study assessed the short-term responses of humpback whales to whale-watching vessels during their southward migration along the south coast of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The behavior of pods was recorded from commercial whale-watching vessels during tours and compared to pods observed in the absence of vessels from the shore in the same area. While some individuals showed obvious signs of horizontal avoidance, others approached vessels, initiating interactions. Calf pods were more sensitive to the presence of vessels than non-calf pods. Dive times and the overall percentage of time whales spent submerged were higher in the presence of vessels, but respiration intervals did not differ. Some surface behaviors occurred less often in the presence of vessels. Whales' responses differed according to whether vessels were operating in accordance with regulations or not. Whales were more likely to avoid a vessel moving within the permitted 100 m approach limit than vessels outside the limit. Whales showed some behavioral changes when vessels operated in accordance with whale-watching regulations, compared with whales in the absence of vessels. Pods that showed no obvious horizontal responses to vessels changed their diving and surface activity when compared with pods in the absence of vessels. Because the long-term impacts of effects of vessels are unknown, management of the humpback whale-watching industry should adopt a conservative approach. Improved knowledge of long-term impacts of multiple exposures to vessels is required to inform management of the effects of whale-watching.

AB Quaternary glacial cycles have played an important role in shaping the biodiversity in temperate regions. This is well documented in Northern Hemisphere, but much less understood for Southern Hemisphere. We used mitochondrial DNA and nuclear elongation factor 1 alpha intron sequences to examine the Pleistocene glacial impacts on the phylogeographical pattern of the freshwater crab Aegla alacalufi in Chilean Patagonia. Phylogenetic analyses, which separated the glaciated populations on eastern continent into a north group (seven populations) and a south group (one population), revealed a shallow phylogenetic structure in the north group but a deep one in the non-glaciated populations on western islands, indicating the significant influence of glaciation on these populations. Phylogenies also identified the Yaldad population on ChiloE Island as a potentially unrecognized new species. The non-glaciated populations showed higher among population genetic divergence than the glaciated ones, but lower population genetic diversity was not detected in the latter. The two glaciated groups, which diverged from the non-glaciated populations at similar to 96 800-29 500 years ago and similar to 104 200-73 800 years ago, respectively, seem to have different glacial refugia. Unexpectedly, the non-glaciated islands did not serve as refugia for them. Demographic expansion was detected in the glaciated north group, with a constant population increase after the last glacial maximum. Nested clade analyses suggest a possible colonization from western islands to eastern continent. After arriving on the continent and surviving the last glacial period there, populations likely have expanded from high to low altitude, following the flood of melting ice. Aegla alacalufi genetic diversity has been primarily affected by Pleistocene glaciation and minimally by drainage isolation.

TI Mining social mixing patterns for infectious disease models based on a
   two-day population survey in Belgium
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSMISSION; SPREAD; PARAMETERS; CONTACTS
AB Background: Until recently, mathematical models of person to person infectious diseases transmission had to make assumptions on transmissions enabled by personal contacts by estimating the so-called WAIFW-matrix. In order to better inform such estimates, a population based contact survey has been carried out in Belgium over the period March-May 2006. In contrast to other European surveys conducted simultaneously, each respondent recorded contacts over two days. Special attention was given to holiday periods, and respondents with large numbers of professional contacts.
   Methods: Participants kept a paper diary with information on their contacts over two different days. A contact was defined as a two-way conversation of at least three words in each others proximity. The contact information included the age of the contact, gender, location, duration, frequency, and whether or not touching was involved.
   For data analysis, we used association rules and classification trees. Weighted generalized estimating equations were used to analyze contact frequency while accounting for the correlation between contacts reported on the two different days.
   A contact surface, expressing the average number of contacts between persons of different ages was obtained by a bivariate smoothing approach and the relation to the so-called next-generation matrix was established.
   Results: People mostly mixed with people of similar age, or with their offspring, their parents and their grandparents. By imputing professional contacts, the average number of daily contacts increased from 11.84 to 15.70. The number of reported contacts depended heavily on the household size, class size for children and number of professional contacts for adults. Adults living with children had on average 2 daily contacts more than adults living without children. In the holiday period, the daily contact frequency for children and adolescents decreased with about 19% while a similar observation is made for adults in the weekend. These findings can be used to estimate the impact of school closure.
   Conclusion: We conducted a diary based contact survey in Belgium to gain insights in social interactions relevant to the spread of infectious diseases. The resulting contact patterns are useful to improve estimating crucial parameters for infectious disease transmission models.

AB 1. Water withdrawal for irrigated agriculture is one of the leading uses of freshwater resources in the world; however, effects of low flow disturbances on lotic ecosystems are poorly understood. We studied an intensively managed agricultural catchment to determine: (i) how macroinvertebrate assemblages and environmental variables respond to water withdrawals of varying magnitude and duration; (ii) what environmental variables are associated with macroinvertebrate responses and (iii) the resiliency of macroinvertebrate communities to irrigation water withdrawals.
   2. We sampled above and below four irrigation diversions that create a gradient of increasing water withdrawal from upstream to downstream (i.e. 0%, 22%, 87%, 90% and 97% water withdrawn) along a 36 km river section. Three reaches were sampled above and below each point of diversion from June to September 2004 and 2005, which represented average and drought water conditions respectively.
   3. Irrigation water withdrawals were associated with both direct and indirect changes to the physicochemical environment. Direct effects (e.g. decreased velocity, depth and wetted habitat) were approximately proportional to the amount of water withdrawn, while indirect effects (e.g. increased conductivity and temperature) occurred when water withdrawals exceeded 85% of ambient levels.
   4. Changes in macroinvertebrate communities were more strongly related to indirect than direct effects of irrigation water withdrawals. In an average water year, community changes were associated with interacting thresholds of reduced discharge and increased conductivity. During a drought year, community changes were related to the interacting thresholds of reduced discharge and increased temperature.
   5. Between years, macroinvertebrate responses differed with the magnitude and duration of low flow conditions. In 2004, high-intensity, relatively short-duration water withdrawals (< 2 months) and alterations to the physicochemical environment changed the relative abundance of macroinvertebrate communities, while macroinvertebrate indices and proportional abundances of functional feeding groups remained unchanged. In contrast, discharge reductions exceeding 90% of ambient levels and temperatures above 30 degrees C from July to September 2005 were associated with shifts in community composition from a dominance of collector-gatherer and filterer Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa to predatory insects, non-insect taxa and scraping elmid beetles.
   6. On an annual basis macroinvertebrate communities appeared resilient to the impacts of water withdrawals following winter high flows. In contrast, recovery was not observed after discharge and physicochemical variables returned to predisturbance conditions for only one month.
   7. Irrigation water withdrawals appear to impact macroinvertebrates through indirect effects that intensify with the magnitude and duration of water withdrawals and annual water availability. Preserving environmental conditions within natural ranges of variability, especially during low water years, appears critical to mitigating adverse biological responses to water withdrawals.

AB The plant functional group approach has the potential to clarify ecological patterns and is of particular importance in simplifying the application of ecological models in high biodiversity ecosystems. Six functional groups (pasture grass, pasture sapling, top-canopy tree, top-canopy liana, mid canopy tree, and understory tree) were established a priori based on ecosystem inhabited, life form, and position within the forest canopy profile on eastern Amazonian region. Ecophysiological traits related to photosynthetic gas exchange were then used to characterize such groups. The ecophysiological traits evaluated showed considerable variations among groups. The pasture grass functional group (a C-4 photosynthetic pathway species) showed high instantaneous water use efficiency (A (max)/g (s)@A (max)), high photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (A (max)/N (area)), and high ratio of A (max) to dark respiration (A (max)/R (d)). Among the species with the C-3 photosynthetic pathway, the top-canopy liana group showed the highest mean of A (max)/g (s)@A (max), statistically distinct from the lowest average presented by the understory tree group. Furthermore, the pasture sapling group showed the lowest average of A (max)/R (d), statistically distinct from the high average observed for the understory tree group. Welch-ANOVAs followed by Games-Howell post hoc tests applied to ecophysiological traits produced reasonable distinctions among functional groups, although no significant distinction was detected between the groups top-canopy tree and pasture sapling. Species distribution within the functional groups was accurately reproduced by discriminant analyses based on species averages of ecophysiological traits. The present work convincingly shows that the functional groups identified have distinct ecophysiological characteristics, with the potential to respond differently to environmental factors. Such information is of great importance in modeling efforts that evaluate the effects of dynamic changes in tropical plant communities over ecosystem primary productivity.

AB The smelt genus Retropinna nominally includes three small (< 150 mm) freshwater fish species endemic to south-eastern Australia and New Zealand. For the two Australian species, the broad range of R. semoni (Weber) on the mainland suggests some vulnerability to isolation and genetic divergence, whereas the apparent confinement of R. tasmanica McCulloch to Tasmania is curious if, as suspected, it is anadromous. Analyses of Australian material using allozyme electrophoresis show five genetically distinct species with contiguous ranges and no evidence of genetic exchange. Three occur along the eastern seaboard (including three instances of sympatry), another in coastal and inland south-eastern Australia and Tasmania and a fifth species in the Lake Eyre Basin. There is no indication of a simple 'tasmanica' v. 'semoni' dichotomy, but instead a complex pattern involving discrete clusters for the Upper Murray plus Darling rivers, Lower Murray, Glenelg River and Tasmanian regions, with coastal western Victorian samples having varying affinity to these groups. The overall pattern is one of deep divergences among species and strong genetic sub-structuring within and provides a strong argument for extended studies to prepare for appropriate conservation measures.

AB Interactions between photosynthetic substrate supply and temperature in determining the rate of three respiration components (leaf, belowground and ecosystem respiration) were investigated within three environmentally controlled, Populus deltoides forest bays at Biosphere 2, Arizona. Over 2 months, the atmospheric CO2 concentration and air temperature were manipulated to test the following hypotheses: (1) the responses of the three respiration components to changes in the rate of photosynthesis would differ both in speed and magnitude; (2) the temperature sensitivity of leaf and belowground respiration would increase in response to a rise in substrate availability; and, (3) at the ecosystem level, the ratio of respiration to photosynthesis would be conserved despite week-to-week changes in temperature. All three respiration rates responded to the CO2 concentration-induced changes in photosynthesis. However, the proportional change in the rate of leaf respiration was more than twice that of belowground respiration and, when photosynthesis was reduced, was also more rapid. The results suggest that aboveground respiration plays a key role in the overall response of ecosystem respiration to short-term changes in canopy photosynthesis. The short-term temperature sensitivity of leaf respiration, measured within a single night, was found to be affected more by developmental conditions than photosynthetic substrate availability, as the Q(10) was lower in leaves that developed at high CO2, irrespective of substrate availability. However, the temperature sensitivity of belowground respiration, calculated between periods of differing air temperature, appeared to be positively correlated with photosynthetic substrate availability. At the ecosystem level, respiration and photosynthesis were positively correlated but the relationship was affected by temperature; for a given rate of daytime photosynthesis, the rate of respiration the following night was greater at 25 than 20 degrees C. This result suggests that net ecosystem exchange did not acclimate to temperature changes lasting up to 3 weeks. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that the three respiration terms differ in their dependence on photosynthesis and that, short- and medium-term changes in temperature may affect net carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB A fuzzy rule-based approach was applied to a macroinvertebrate habitat suitability modelling problem. The model design was based on a knowledge base summarising the preferences and tolerances of 86 macroinvertebrate species for four variables describing river sites in springs up to small rivers in the Central and Western Plains of Europe. As the modelling problem asked for a model with an interpretable structure and a shaded indication of the river habitat suitability for a macroinvertebrate species, we opted for fuzzy classifiers. For each species, four different types (A, N, P, C) of habitat suitability models were developed, including 'ammonium concentration', 'nitrate concentration', 'phosphate concentration' or,electrical conductivity', as third input variable in addition to the primary two input variables 'stream width' and 'stream velocity'. The models were evaluated on field data collected at 445 sites in the Province of Overijssel (the Netherlands). For the majority of the 86 species, the significance of the model validation is biased by the highly non-uniform distribution of the data points over the input and output space, due to the fact that sites of high ecological quality are largely outnumbered by sites at deteriorated conditions. The evaluation by the validation data set was regarded objective for 12 species, only one of them being an indicator for reference conditions. Given the present environmental conditions of rivers in EU Member States, shifts in abundance levels of more common species are as such more suitable to detect gradual changes in water quality than shifts in abundance levels of species characterising reference conditions. Good scores were obtained with the performance measure 'percentage of correctly fuzzy classified instances' for the 12 corresponding N- and P-models, whereas the A- and C-models showed a low to moderate performance. This work illustrates that fuzzy rule-based models, designed using a comprehensive knowledge base, have properties that are of great interest for river management tools. The main components of a fuzzy rule-based model are the if-then rules, allowing for the expression of non-linear relations and the fuzzy sets, guaranteeing gradual transitions between classes. Due to the fact that these model components can be understood intuitively, the fuzzy rule-based approach results in highly transparant habitat suitability models. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Timing is essential in seasonally changing habitats. Survival and reproduction are enhanced through precise adjustment to environmental conditions. Avian seasonal behaviour, that is, diverse activities associated with reproduction, moult and migration, has an endogenous basis and is ultimately linked to changes in environmental factors such as food supply. However, behaviour occurs in social contexts, and interactions with conspecifics are intimately linked to seasonal activities. Time programmes set the stage for social behaviour, which in turn fine-tunes seasonal activities. We propose that avian schedules are genuinely 'sociable': birds communicate seasonal behaviour by both intentional and inadvertent information transfer and negotiate it in competitive and cooperative interactions. Studying the interplay between seasonal and social behaviour can add to our understanding of animal behaviour, including mechanisms by which birds could cope with changing environmental conditions.

AB Standardization of commercial catch and effort data is important in fisheries where standardized abundance indices based on fishery-dependent data are a fundamental input to stock assessments. The goal of the standardization is then to minimize bias due to the confounding of apparent abundance patterns with fishing power. There is a high risk of confounding between fishing power and abundance in fisheries where the fleet has altered their fishing technology over the years. Also, the spatial aspects and the fishing history can be so heterogeneous that any standardization really involves an extrapolation, for example to a hypothetical standard vessel. When the standardization involves an extrapolation, then the appropriate modeling strategy is to build a so-called estimation model, rather than a predictive model. Strategies to build such an estimation model from fishery-dependent data include: pay careful attention to subject matter, and collect information about potential confounding effects to include in the model (putting a high value on the acquisition of data on covariates); model variable catchability at a highly disaggregated scale; aim for realistic coefficients when fitting the model and pay relatively less attention to achieving precision or maximizing explained variance; adopt modern statistical methods to combine data from different sources; and if data are deficient, then apply precautionary allowances. These strategies offer some protection against bias due to confounding, in the absence of formal criteria for identifying the best model.

AB Many species vary in their ecology across their geographic ranges in response to gradients in environmental conditions. Such variation, which can influence life history traits and subsequent demography of populations, usually occurs over large spatial scales. However, describing and understanding the causes of such variation is difficult precisely because it occurs over such large spatial scales. In this study, we document spatial variation in the ecology of a common reef fish, Stegastes beebei, in the Galapagos Islands and test a number of potential causal mechanisms. The pattern resembles that seen in latitudinal variation: individuals are larger, occur in higher densities, and live longer in the coldest region of the islands than those in the warmest region. However, in this system, demography varies among regional populations separated by < 150 km. Preferred nutritious algae are more available in the cold region and comprise a greater proportion of the diet of fish in this region. Per gram reproductive effort appears to be strongly related to temperature, despite differences in the gross magnitude and timing of reproduction in different regions. A model of reproductive output suggests that fish in the warmest region are allocating a greater proportion of available energy to reproduction, resulting in apparent regional life history tradeoffs. Our data suggest that regional demographic differences in S. beebei may be driven by a combination of variation in food availability and an environmentally mediated life history tradeoff.

AB The biodiversity of Madagascar is extraordinarily distinctive, diverse, and endangered. It is therefore urgent that steps be taken to document, describe, interpret, and protect this exceptional biota. As a collaborative group of field and laboratory biologists, we employ a suite of methodological and analytical tools to investigate the vertebrate portion of Madagascar's fauna. Given that species are the fundamental unit of evolution, where micro-and macroevolutionary forces converge to generate biological diversity, a thorough understanding of species distribution and abundance is critical for understanding the evolutionary, ecological, and biogeographic forces that have shaped Malagasy vertebrate diversity. We illustrate the means by which we apply Mayr's "three basic tasks" of the systematist [Mayr, E. (1942) Systematics and the Origin of Species from the Viewpoint of a Zoologist (Harvard Univ. Press, Cambridge, MA)] to identify, classify, and study the organisms that together constitute Madagascar's vertebrate community. Using field inventory methods, specimen-based studies, and morphological and molecular analyses, we formulate hypotheses of species identity that then serve as the foundation for subsequent studies of biology and history. Our experience, as well as that of other investigators, has shown that much of the vertebrate species diversity in Madagascar is "cryptic" for both biological and practical reasons. Beyond issues of cryptic biological diversity, the resolution of species identity in Madagascar has been hampered because of a lack of vouchered comparative material at the population level. Through our activities, we are attempting to remedy these limitations while simultaneously enhancing research capacity in Madagascar.

AB Reconstructing the chronology of mammalian evolution is a debated issue between molecule- and fossil-based inferences. A methodological limitation of molecules is the evolutionary rate variation among lineages, precluding the application of the global molecular clock. We considered 2422 first and second codon positions of the combined ADRA2B, IRBP, and vWF nuclear genes for a well-documented set of placentals including an extensive sampling of rodents. Using seven independent calibration points and a maximum-likelihood framework, we evaluated whether molecular and paleontological estimates of mammalian divergence dates may be reconciled by the local molecular clocks approach, allowing local constancy of substitution rates with variations at larger phylogenetic scales. To handle the difficulty of choosing among all possible rate assignments for various lineages, local molecular clocks were based on the results of branch-length and two-cluster tests. Extensive lineage-specific variation of evolutionary rates was detected, even among rodents. Cross-calibrations indicated some incompatibilities between divergence dates based on different paleontological references. To decrease the impact of a single calibration point, estimates derived from independent calibrations displaying only slight reciprocal incompatibility were averaged. The divergence dates inferred for the split between mice and rats (similar to13-19 Myr) was younger than previously published molecular estimates. The most recent common ancestors of rodents, primates and rodents, boreoeutherians, and placentals were estimated to be, respectively, similar to60, 70, 75, and 78 Myr old. Global clocks, local clocks, and quartet dating analyses suggested a Late Cretaceous origin of the crown placental clades followed by a Tertiary radiation of some placental orders like rodents.

AB Much current research on community ecology concerns indirect effects, cascading trophic interactions, and the role of top-down vs. bottom-up processes, as well as subsidization of matter and energy between different systems. We addressed all these topics by exploring interactions between the urchin Parechinus angulosus and both recruits and juveniles of the abalone Haliotis midae, in the light of the fact that juvenile abalone shelter beneath the urchins. In field experiments at six sites. urchins were eliminated from removal plots to determine the degree to which juvenile abalone (individuals 3-35 mm in length) depend upon urchins. Comparisons were made with undisturbed and disturbance-control plots. We hypothesized that after removal of urchins: (1) there would be an immediate decline of juvenile abalone, since they are intimately associated with the urchins; (2) abalone recruits (recent settlers <3 mm in length) would be unlikely to suffer immediately or directly because, unlike juveniles, they are only weakly associated with the urchins; (3) foliar algae would proliferate due to decreased grazing by urchins; (4) there would be a consequent reduction in crustose coralline algae due to overgrowth by foliar algae; and (5) the decline of crustose corallines would reduce recruitment of abalone due to a loss of settlement and nursery habitat. In urchin-removal plots, juvenile abalone declined dramatically, becoming virtually extinct locally. Their disappearance was slowest in crevices compared with exposed habitats, but even there they failed to survive longer than five months. Contrary to expectations, abalone recruits also disappeared from urchin-removal plots, possibly because the cover of sediment almost doubled there. Also contrary to our hypotheses, neither foliar macroalgae nor encrusting corallines responded to urchin removal. The explanation of these results is that P. angulosus was able to gather drift kelp when this food source was available, rather than acting as an active grazer. This feeding pattern has profound consequences and explains why urchins failed to influence algal community composition. By sheltering beneath urchins, juvenile abalone gain protection from predators and may also benefit from an enhanced food supply. Bottom-up subsidization of urchins by drift kelp is thus responsible for the feeding behavior of the urchins, and indirectly facilitates their role in harboring juvenile abalone. This role is of immense importance for the lucrative abalone fishery, and depletion of urchins could lead to a collapse of abalone populations. Human exploitation of top predators that consume urchins, such as rock lobsters and some fishes, has conceivably exaggerated the role of urchins in sustaining juvenile abalone.

AB Larvae of the Hawaiian amphidromous goby Lentipes concolor settled after a mean length of larval life (LLL) of 86.2 +/-8.5 days (n=236, range=63-106 days) at a mean size of 16.0 +/-0.7=L-T (n=154, range=14.1 17.9 mm). Mean LLL for L concolor was about twice that typically reported for tropical marine gobiids. Variation in LLL (CV=10%) and size at settlement (CV=4%) were low, and comparable to that for marine gobiids. LLL and L-T were weakly positively correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.50, P <0.0001). Larvae settled after shorter planktonic lives and at smaller sizes during months with warmer ocean temperatures. Inter-island variation in LLL did not support a dominant south-east to north-west larval drift, following the dominant south-east to north-we-st flow of prevailing currents in the Archipelago, Instead, recruits on Maui Island, centrally located in the archipelago, had shorter LLL than recruits to upstream Hawai'i and downstream Kaua'i islands. These findings have important implications for understanding the complex life history dynamics of amphidromous fishes as well as their management. (C) 2001 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB The formulation of the physiological processes of plant carbon and nitrogen that have recently been implemented in CLASS-the Canadian Land Surface Scheme is presented, including plant photosynthesis of sunlit and shaded leaves, root nitrogen uptake, tissue respiration, growth, and senescence. Results from this formulation provide the vegetation parameters (e.g. stomatal resistance, leaf area index, and root length and distribution) for simulating energy and water exchange, and contribute to the carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical calculations and ecosystem CO2 flux estimations in CLASS. The model was parameterized for deciduous trees and run at a time step of 30 min. Modelled results were tested with measurements of leaf CO2 exchange, half-hourly and daily plant CO., exchange, and annual plant carbon budgets from the Old Aspen (Populus tremuloides) site in the Southern Study Area (SSA-OA) of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). Model tests at leaf level and half-hourly timescale improve confidence in the predictive capabilities of the model at canopy level and longer timescale. At half-hourly timescale, simulated plant CO2 exchange explained 81% of the variance in the measured CO2 flux derived from eddy correlation measurements and soil chamber measurements in the three comparing weeks in 1994. At a coarser timescale, simulated daily plant CO, exchange explained 86% of the variance in the measured values during 1994 and 1996. Annual gross primary production (GPP) accumulated from half-hourly values in the model in 1994 and 1996 averaged about 1053 g C m(-1) for this aspen site, close to the estimations from field eddy correlation measurements. Of this carbon fixation, 59% was consumed by autotrophic respiration (R-a) for plant growth and maintenance in the model, similar to estimations from chamber measurements. Sensitivity analyses show that the modelled plant GPP, R-a and net primary production NPP ( = GPP - R-a) were very sensitive to the changes in temperature, implying that this boreal aspen ecosystem is strongly constrained by temperature conditions.

AB The Marble gallwasp Andricus kollari has a native range divided into two geographically separated lifecycles. In Eastern Europe and Turkey, the lifecycle involves a sexual generation on Turkey oak, Quercus cerris, while in Iberia and North Africa the sexual generation host is cork oak, Q. suber. Over the last 500 years, A. kollari has expanded its range into northern Europe, following human planting of Q. cem's from Italy and the Balkans. We ask: (i) what is the genetic relationship between eastern and western distributions of Andricus kollari? Can we determine which lifecycle is ancestral, and how long ago they diverged? (ii) To what extent have eastern and western native ranges contributed to northwards range expansion? (iii) Is there any evidence for hybridization between the two life cycle types? We present analyses of allozyme data for 13 polymorphic loci and of sequence variation for a 433 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. These show: (i) that four haplotype lineages (one in Spain, two in Hungary/Italy and one in Turkey) diverged more or less simultaneously between 1 and 2 million years ago, suggesting the existence of at least four refuges through recent ice age cycles. Our data cannot resolve which lifecycle type is ancestral. (ii) Populations north of putative refuges are divided into two sets. Populations in south-west France are allied to Spain, while ail remaining populations in northern Europe have been colonized from Italy and the Balkans. (iii) The transition from one race to another in south-west France is marked by abrupt transitions in the frequency of refuge-specific private alleles and corresponds closely to the northern limit of the distribution of cork oak. Although hybrids were detected in north-west France, none were detected where the two lifecycles meet in south-western France. The biology of oak gallwasps predicts that any hybrid zone will be narrow and limited to regions where Q. cem's and Q. suber meet. Our data suggest that eastern and western A. kollari are effectively separate species.

AB Photosynthesis is a complex metabolic process that originated on the early Earth, Recently reported evidence based on the molecular evolutionary analysis of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway suggests that the photosystem in the anoxygenic purple photosynthetic bacteria is the most ancient known, and that the photosynthetic apparatus in the oxygen-evolving cyanobacteria and relatives was the most recent to appear. This and other evidence indicate that photosynthesis has had a complex and nonlinear evolutionary history and that different parts of the photosynthetic apparatus have distinct evolutionary origins.

AB Nitrogen controls on fine root substrate quality (that is, nitrogen and carbon-fraction concentrations) were assessed using nitrogen availability,gradients in the Harvard Forest chronic nitrogen addition plots, University of Wisconsin Arboretum, Blackhawk Island, Wisconsin, and New England spruce-fir transect. The 27 study sites encompassed within these four areas collectively represented a wide range of nitrogen availability (both quantity and form), soil types, species composition, aboveground net primary production, and climatic regimes. Changes in fine root substrate quality among sites were most frequently and strongly correlated with nitrate availability. For the combined data set, fine root nitrogen concentration increased (adjusted R-2 = 0.46, P < 0.0001) with increasing site nitrate availability. Fine root "extractive" carbon-fraction concentrations decreased (adjusted R-2 = 0.32, P < 0.0002), "acid-soluble" compounds increased (adjusted R-2 = 0.35, P < 0.0001), and the "acid-insoluble" carbon fraction remained relatively high and stable (combined mean of 48.7 +/- 3.1% for all sites) with increasing nitrate avail-ability. Consequently, the ratio of acid-insoluble C-total N decreased (adjusted R-2 = 0.40, P < 0.0001) along gradients of increasing nitrate availability. The coefficients of determination for significant linear regressions between site nitrate availability and fine root nitrogen and carbon-fraction concentrations were generally higher for sites within each of the four study areas. Within individual study sites, tissue substrate quality varied between roots in different soil horizons and between roots of different size classes. However, the temporal variation of fine root substrate quality indices within specific horizons was relatively low. The results of this study indicate that fine root substrate quality increases with increasing nitrogen availability and thus supports the substrate quality component of a hypothesized conceptual model of nitrogen controls on fine root dynamics that maintains that fine root production, mortality, substrate quality, and decomposition increase with nitrogen availability in forest ecosystems in a manner that is analogous to foliage.

AB We investigated whole tree water relations in 56-65 m tall, old-growth Pseudotsuga menziesii trees within the Wind River Canopy Crane site, Carson, Washington, USA. We measured at predawn and solar noon the vertical gradients in xylem pressure potential using a pressure chamber. On an Abies amabilis sapling located in the understory at the base of one of the study trees, predawn and solar noon xylem pressure potentials were also measured. Xylem pressure potential data were measured from late June through early September 1996 on foliage sampled from 1 to 64.5 m, Over this height gradient, predawn water potentials ranged from -0.23 to -1.10 MPa. Solar noon values showed an even greater range (from -0.44 to -2.51 MPa). At predawn, the water potential gradient approached the theoretical hydrostatic gradient (-0.0105 vs -0.010 MPa m(-1)). The gradient at solar noon was steeper (-0.0331 MPa m(-1)). Instantaneous stomatal conductances were not greatly different between young, sapling-sized and old-growth trees [0.091+/-0.033 (SD) vs 0.086+/-0.045 cm s(-1), respectively]. Stomata of both size classes of trees appeared very sensitive to increasing vapor pressure deficits, a comparison of stable carbon isotope values from the old-growth and sapling-sized trees indicated lower stomatal conductances in the old-growth. This study provides sound documentation regarding the utility of the cohesion theory in the interpretation of water potential gradients. This study also emphasizes inherent differences between sapling-sized and tall, old-growth trees.

AB We explore the tree of mammalian mtDNA sentences using particularly the LogDet transform on amino acid sequences, the distance Hadamard transform, and the Closest Tree selection criterion. The amino acid composition of different species show significant differences even within mammals. After compensating for these differences, nearest-neighbor bootstrap results suggest that the tree is locally stable, though a few groups show slightly greater rearrangements when a large proportion of the constant sites are removed. Many parts of the trees rye obtain agree with those on published protein ML trees. Interesting results include a preference fur rodent monophyly. The detection of a few alternative signals to those on the optimal tree were; obtained using the distance Hadamard transform (with results expressed as a Lento plot). One rearrangement suggested was the interchange of the position of primates and rodents on the optimal tree, The basic stability of the tree, combined with two calibration points (whale/cow and horse/rhinoceros), together with a distant secondary calibration from the mammal/bind divergence, allows inferences of the times of divergence of putative clades. Allowing for sampling variances due to finite sequence length, mast major divergences amongst lineages leading to modern orders, appear to occur well before the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary. Implications arising from these early divergences are discussed, particularly the possibility of competition between the small dinosaurs and the new mammal clades.

AB If the light-use efficiency (LUE) of species in a canopy is constant, canopy photosynthesis (CP) is proportional to the number of photons (Phi) absorbed by the canopy (CP = LUE x Phi). Likewise, if nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) is constant, canopy photosynthesis is proportional to the amount of total leaf nitrogen (LN) (CP = NUE x LN). We applied these concepts to monospecific and mixed (1:1) stands of annuals (Abutilon theophrasti and Ambrosia artemisiifolia) at two stages, established in an ambient (360 mu l l(-1)) or elevated (700 mu l l(-1)) CO2 atmosphere. In both CO2 concentrations, across the two species, daily canopy photosynthesis gave strong linear regressions with zero intercepts both against the number of absorbed photons and against total leaf nitrogen in the canopy. Doubling CO2 increased LUE by 20-80 % and NUE by 20-100 %. LUE tended to be higher in Ambrosia than in Abutilon, and also higher in the later stage of canopy development than in the younger stage. Interference by Abutilon increased the LUE of Ambrosia. On the other hand, NUE tended to be higher in Abutilon than in Ambrosia, and to be higher in younger than in later stages. Interference by Abutilon decreased the NUE of Ambrosia. Thus, there are trade-offs (negative correlations) between LUE and NUE, which result from differences in leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area and from differences in leaf area development in the canopy. LUE increased with increasing leaf nitrogen concentration, while NUE increased with increasing light availability in the canopy. (C) 1998 Annals of Botany Company.

AB Root responses to tillage vary and the driving factors are not well understood. Characterization of root response is requisite to optimize fertilizer placement and to understand limitations to no-till production. Corn (Zea mays L.) root length and weight were measured in the top 0.3 m of coarse-textured soil (Psammentic Hapludalf) in southwestern Ontario, Canada after 5, 6 and 7 yr of conventional and no-till management. Root length density in the top 0.1 m was greater under no-till (17 km m(-3)) than under conventional till (7 km m(-3)) 2 yr out of 3. Root length density was 4 km m(-3) lower under no-till than under conventional till in the 0.15 to 0.3 m layer 1 yr out of 3, but otherwise root growth below 0.1 m was unaffected by tillage. Each year, root length and weight were distributed more horizontally under no-till than under conventional till. Corn grain yields did not vary with tillage, even though soil water content was often greater under no-till. The increase in soil water (of between 0.01 and 0.03 m(3) m-3) was partly due to increased water holdings capacity-water held between -8 and -200 kPa matric potential was usually greater under no-till (0.07 m(3) m(-3)) than under conventional till (0.06 m(3) m(-3)) in the top 0.15 m. The shift in root distribution was apparently driven by soil structure because variation in bulk density with tillage and depth followed the same trends as variation in root length. Bulk density was greater under no-till (1.5 Mg m(-3)) than under conventional till (1.4 Mg m(-3)) in the top 0.15 m. In the top 0.075 m, the proportion of the total space occupied by capillary pores (< 36 mu m diameter) was greater under no-till (17%) than under conventional till (15%), there were more dry-stable aggregates under no-till (9% of total soil in the 0.85-5.7 mm size fraction) than under conventional till (7%), and a greater proportion of these aggregates were water-stable under no-till (25%) than under conventional till (16%). Greater bulk density may trigger formation of lateral roots, and greater aggregation contribute to the more superficial development by deflecting roots from their gravitropic pathway. Given the more superficial root distribution under no-till, shallower placement of downwardly mobile nutrients such as nitrogen may be more efficient than knife-injection.

AB Field measurements of maximum net photosynthesis (P-max), leaf nitrogen (N) content (leaf N per area and percent N), and specific leaf area (SLA) were made for Amazonian tree species within and across early successional sites of known ages after abandonment from slash-and-burn agriculture. We examined five species across a successional sere near San Carlos de Rio Negro, Venezuela, to test whether plasticity was associated with successional status and to determine whether changes in foliar properties during secondary succession can be attributed to shifts in species composition, in resource availability, or both. Average leaf N concentration was high (nearly 3%) for a pioneer species (Cecropia ficifolia) early in succession (1-3 yr after abandonment) but was always lower for the other early and mid- to-late succession species, especially later in succession (1-2% at 5-10 yr after abandonment). Net photosynthetic capacity (P-max/area and P-max/mass) varied as much as sixfold, being higher in pioneer species such as Cecropia and Vismia on recently abandoned sites and lower in late successional species such as Miconia and Licania on 10-yr abandoned agricultural sites. Total daily light availability also varied widely (14-fold) from its peak 1 yr after farm abandonment to low levels 9 yr into succession.
   During the first 5 yr of secondary succession, there were significant (P < 0.05) differences in P-max and leaf N concentration among species in any given year. In most species, P-max values declined with increasing time since abandonment within any given site. There were important differences in photosynthetic plasticity among species: P-max tended to be much greater in earlier than later successional species soon after abandonment. Also, the difference in P-max among species narrowed (or reversed) over time since abandonment, largely because of decreasing P-max in pioneer species. The results suggest that changes in both species composition and in resource availability combine to produce the common pattern of decreasing leaf N concentration and photosynthetic rates during early rain forest succession after agriculture.
   Early successional species showed strong (r(2) greater than or equal to 0.57, P = 0.0001) mass-based photosynthesis-N relationships but weak (r(2) = 0.40 or lower, P = 0.0001) area-based relationships both across the secondary successional sere after agriculture and across sites varying in types of disturbance. Both mass- and area-based photosynthesis-N relationships were poorer or not significant (P > 0.05) for mid- to late-successional species. Higher instantaneous P-max/N and greater slopes of the photosynthesis-N relationships in early than late successional species suggest that pioneer species may show greater carbon assimilation capacity with elevated leaf N concentration on early successional sites than co-occurring species. The data suggest that early and late successional species may differ in the mode and degree of leaf-level physiological plasticity across succession.

AB Photosynthesis-ir-radiance response curves and leaf nitrogen contents were measured weekly by destructive sampling over the life cycles of leaves 10, 15, 20 and 25 of sunflower plants (cv. Prosol 35) grown in large pots in the open under optimum conditions of temperature and high irradiance. Individual leaf responses were adequately described by a hyperbola of three parameters, viz. P(max), the rate of photosynthesis in saturating irradiance; R, the rate of dark respiration adjusted for temperature (30-degrees-C); and epsilon, the apparent quantum efficiency of photosynthesis at low irradiance. P(max) (range 0-40 mumol CO2 m-2 s-1) and R (0-4 mumol CO2 m-2 s-1) were non-linearly related to nitrogen content per unit leaf area (N(L)) (range 0.3-2.9 g N m-2) across all leaf positions and for all leaf ages. Epsilon (mean value 0-050 mol mol-1, s.e. 0.001) was independent of N(L). The equations for net photosynthesis derived from pot studies were shown to explain (r2=0.80) leaf photosynthesis in a crop of the same cultivar over a wide range of N(L) and irradiance.

AB A model of photosynthesis (PGEN) is presented. The model assumes that optimal use is made of the leaf nitrogen available for partitioning between the carboxylase and thylakoid components. This results in predictions of Rubisco and chlorophyll concentrations very similar to those measured elsewhere. A function is incorporated which represents the detrimental effects of negative leaf water potentials on the Calvin cycle, producing a quantitative and mechanistic trade-off between CO2 entering, and H2O leaving, the leaf. Thus, an optimal stomatal conductance and associated internal partial pressure of CO2 exists for any given set of environmental conditions. The model calculates this optimal state for the leaf, which is its output. The model was subjected to changes in the following parameters: soil water potential, irradiance, ambient CO2 partial pressure, leaf temperature, leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, leaf nitrogen content, root dry weight and leaf width. These perturbations resulted in changes in predicted optimal conductance which were very similar to what has been observed. In general, as the capacity of the leaf to fix CO2 increased, so did the predicted optimal conductance, with the internal partial pressure of CO2 being maintained close to 22Pa.

AB In 1983/1984, Diadema antillarum suffered mass mortalities throughout its West Atlantic range. Its populations were reduced by 95% and subsequently have failed to recover. These die-offs led to sustained increases in the abundance of soft algae, including types eaten by herbivorous reef fishes. I monitored adult populations of three herbivorous surgeonfishes (Acanthurus coeruleus, A. chirurugus and A. bahianus) between 1978 and 1990, and the recruitment of their pelagic juveniles between 1979 and 1989, on six patch reefs in Panama. Adult populations of A. coeruleus and A. chirurgus, which largely restrict their feeding to reef substrata, increased by averages of 250 and 160%, respectively, after the die-off of D. antillarum in 1983. No increases occurred in the adult populations of A. bahianus, which often feeds in off-reef habitats unaffected by D. antillarum. Average annual levels of juvenile recruitment of all three surgeonfishes did not differ before and after the die-off. These results support the hypothesis that adult populations of two herbivorous fishes that are strongly reliant on reef algae for food previously were limited by competition with D. antillarum.

TI CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF MAMMAL COMMUNITIES OVER SUCCESSIONAL TIME
   SCALES
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article
ID FOREST; FIRE
AB Multivariate analyses were used to describe graphically the post-fire patterns of change in the structure of forest and heathland small-mammal communities over successional time in Australia. Data were collected from 16 forest sites representing a temporal sequence after fire, and from one heath (shrubland) site which has been followed continuously over a 15 yr period, with regeneration from two successive fire cycles. These small-mammal communities follow a successional trajectory that may be described using factor analysis to represent seven species as factors in two or three dimensions. The trajectory illustrates the shift in community structure from one dominated by species of Pseudomys (native mice), through a period of domination by dasyurid marsupials into the longest period where species of Rattus (native rats) dominate, until they too are reduced in numbers.
   The strongest factor reflects the differences observed between communities from unburnt or mature seral stages and those in the early stages of regeneration after fire. This form of multivariate analysis is sensitive to the scale of the temporal data analysed and successional patterns are likely to emerge only when data from annual or greater temporal scales are used. The trajectories tend to follow a cycle as they move back towards their unburnt or undisturbed mature state. The order in which species enter the succession appears linked to the functional group to which the species belongs, which is consistent with assembly rules for these functional groups proposed previously for these habitats.

AB In the context of a recent massive increase in research on plant root functions and their impact on the environment, root ecologists currently face many important challenges to keep on generating cutting-edge, meaningful and integrated knowledge. Consideration of the below-ground components in plant and ecosystem studies has been consistently called for in recent decades, but methodology is disparate and sometimes inappropriate. This handbook, based on the collective effort of a large team of experts, will improve trait comparisons across studies and integration of information across databases by providing standardised methods and controlled vocabularies. It is meant to be used not only as starting point by students and scientists who desire working on below-ground ecosystems, but also by experts for consolidating and broadening their views on multiple aspects of root ecology. Beyond the classical compilation of measurement protocols, we have synthesised recommendations from the literature to provide key background knowledge useful for: (1) defining below-ground plant entities and giving keys for their meaningful dissection, classification and naming beyond the classical fine-root vs coarse-root approach; (2) considering the specificity of root research to produce sound laboratory and field data; (3) describing typical, but overlooked steps for studying roots (e.g. root handling, cleaning and storage); and (4) gathering metadata necessary for the interpretation of results and their reuse. Most importantly, all root traits have been introduced with some degree of ecological context that will be a foundation for understanding their ecological meaning, their typical use and uncertainties, and some methodological and conceptual perspectives for future research. Considering all of this, we urge readers not to solely extract protocol recommendations for trait measurements from this work, but to take a moment to read and reflect on the extensive information contained in this broader guide to root ecology, including sections I-VII and the many introductions to each section and root trait description. Finally, it is critical to understand that a major aim of this guide is to help break down barriers between the many subdisciplines of root ecology and ecophysiology, broaden researchers' views on the multiple aspects of root study and create favourable conditions for the inception of comprehensive experiments on the role of roots in plant and ecosystem functioning.

AB We assessed the changes in meteorological drought severity and drought return periods during cropping seasons in Afghanistan for the period of 1901 to 2010. The droughts in the country were analyzed using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Global Precipitation Climatology Center rainfall and Climate Research Unit temperature data both at 0.5 degrees resolutions were used for this purpose. Seasonal drought return periods were estimated using the values of the SPEI fitted with the best distribution function. Trends in climatic variables and SPEI were assessed using modified Mann-Kendal trend test, which has the ability to remove the influence of long-term persistence on trend significance. The study revealed increases in drought severity and frequency in Afghanistan over the study period. Temperature, which increased up to 0.14 degrees C/decade, was the major factor influencing the decreasing trend in the SPEI values in the northwest and southwest of the country during rice- and corn-growing seasons, whereas increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall were the cause of a decrease in SPEI during wheat-growing season. We concluded that temperature plays a more significant role in decreasing the SPEI values and, therefore, more severe droughts in the future are expected due to global warming.

AB Soils provide a broad set of vital ecosystem services (ES), yet soils are under threat worldwide. To avoid further degradation of soils and, in consequence, provision of soil-based ES, soil science has been calling for a comprehensive consideration of soil quality in decision-making, as soils are marginalized as a mere surface. Although a myriad of soil quality indicators exist, their disciplinary focus complicates discussion of conflicting soil uses. We present a novel approach to base soil quality not on soil function assessment alone but on a soil's ability to support various ES. The soil quality index SQUID (Soil Quality InDicator) links a set of ten different soil functions to various ESs using an expert-based Delphi approach. We apply it to ten suburban municipalities in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, where fast development of urban structures has led to significant loss of fertile soils over the last two decades. To estimate the potential and the problems of the SQUID index, we compare it to an established soil quality index designed for spatial planning (BOKS - soil concept Stuttgart). Results suggest that SQUID is at a disadvantage for general overviews, but can be highly useful when detailed trade-off assessments are required. We conclude that the SQUID index might be a promising approach to better integrate soil quality into decision-making, as it has the potential to overcome disciplinary boundaries and to foster trade-off discussions between different, possibly conflicting soil use interests.

AB Understanding the molecular basis of repeatedly evolved phenotypes can yield key insights into the evolutionary process. Quantifying gene flow between populations is especially important in interpreting mechanisms of repeated phenotypic evolution, and genomic analyses have revealed that admixture occurs more frequently between diverging lineages than previously thought. In this study, we resequenced 47 whole genomes of the Mexican tetra from three cave populations, two surface populations and outgroup samples. We confirmed that cave populations are polyphyletic and two Astyanax mexicanus lineages are present in our data set. The two lineages likely diverged much more recently than previous mitochondrial estimates of 5-7 mya. Divergence of cave populations from their phylogenetically closest surface population likely occurred between similar to 161 and 191 k generations ago. The favoured demographic model for most population pairs accounts for divergence with secondary contact and heterogeneous gene flow across the genome, and we rigorously identified gene flow among all lineages sampled. Therefore, the evolution of cave-related traits occurred more rapidly than previously thought, and trogolomorphic traits are maintained despite gene flow with surface populations. The recency of these estimated divergence events suggests that selection may drive the evolution of cave-derived traits, as opposed to disuse and drift. Finally, we show that a key trogolomorphic phenotype QTL is enriched for genomic regions with low divergence between caves, suggesting that regions important for cave phenotypes may be transferred between caves via gene flow. Our study shows that gene flow must be considered in studies of independent, repeated trait evolution.

AB Plant viruses possess adaptations for facilitating acquisition, retention, and inoculation by vectors. Until recently, it was hypothesized that these adaptations are limited to virus proteins that enable virions to bind to vector mouthparts or invade their internal tissues. However, increasing evidence suggests that viruses can also manipulate host plant phenotypes and vector behaviors in ways that enhance their own transmission. Manipulation of vector-host interactions occurs through virus effects on host cues that mediate vector orientation, feeding, and dispersal behaviors, and thereby, the probability of virus transmission. Effects on host phenotypes vary by pathosystem but show a remarkable degree of convergence among unrelated viruses whose transmission is favored by the same vector behaviors. Convergence based on transmission mechanism, rather than phylogeny, supports the hypothesis that virus effects are adaptive and not just by-products of infection. Based on this, it has been proposed that viruses manipulate hosts through multifunctional proteins that facilitate exploitation of host resources and elicitation of specific changes in host phenotypes. But this proposition is rarely discussed in the context of the numerous constraints on virus evolution imposed by molecular and environmental factors, which figure prominently in research on virus-host interactions not dealing with host manipulation. To explore the implications of this oversight, we synthesized available literature to identify patterns in virus effects among pathogens with shared transmission mechanisms and discussed the results of this synthesis in the context of molecular and environmental constraints on virus evolution, limitations of existing studies, and prospects for future research.

AB Quantitative genetic theory provides a means of estimating the evolutionary potential of natural populations. However, this approach was previously only feasible in systems where the genetic relatedness between individuals could be inferred from pedigrees or experimental crosses. The genomic revolution opened up the possibility of obtaining the realized proportion of genome shared among individuals in natural populations of virtually any species, which could promise (more) accurate estimates of quantitative genetic parameters in virtually any species. Such a 'genomic' quantitative genetics approach relies on fewer assumptions, offers a greater methodological flexibility, and is thus expected to greatly enhance our understanding of evolution in natural populations, for example, in the context of adaptation to environmental change, eco-evolutionary dynamics, and biodiversity conservation.

TI Genetic rescue increases fitness and aids rapid recovery of an

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS

ID INBREEDING DEPRESSION; MODELS; SIZE; BENEFITS; PRIMERS; PROGRAM
AB Genetic rescue has now been attempted in several threatened species, but the contribution of genetics per se to any increase in population health can be hard to identify. Rescue is expected to be particularly useful when individuals are introduced into small isolated populations with low levels of genetic variation. Here we consider such a situation by documenting genetic rescue in the mountain pygmy possum, Burramys parvus. Rapid population recovery occurred in the target population after the introduction of a small number of males from a large genetically diverged population. Initial hybrid fitness was more than two-fold higher than non-hybrids; hybrid animals had a larger body size, and female hybrids produced more pouch young and lived longer. Genetic rescue likely contributed to the largest population size ever being recorded at this site. These data point to genetic rescue as being a potentially useful option for the recovery of small threatened populations.

AB Microsatellite markers have played a major role in ecological, evolutionary and conservation research during the past 20years. However, technical constrains related to the use of capillary electrophoresis and a recent technological revolution that has impacted other marker types have brought to question the continued use of microsatellites for certain applications. We present a study for improving microsatellite genotyping in ecology using high-throughput sequencing (HTS). This approach entails selection of short markers suitable for HTS, sequencing PCR-amplified microsatellites on an Illumina platform and bioinformatic treatment of the sequence data to obtain multilocus genotypes. It takes advantage of the fact that HTS gives direct access to microsatellite sequences, allowing unambiguous allele identification and enabling automation of the genotyping process through bioinformatics. In addition, the massive parallel sequencing abilities expand the information content of single experimental runs far beyond capillary electrophoresis. We illustrated the method by genotyping brown bear samples amplified with a multiplex PCR of 13 new microsatellite markers and a sex marker. HTS of microsatellites provided accurate individual identification and parentage assignment and resulted in a significant improvement of genotyping success (84%) of faecal degraded DNA and costs reduction compared to capillary electrophoresis. The HTS approach holds vast potential for improving success, accuracy, efficiency and standardization of microsatellite genotyping in ecological and conservation applications, especially those that rely on profiling of low-quantity/quality DNA and on the construction of genetic databases. We discuss and give perspectives for the implementation of the method in the light of the challenges encountered in wildlife studies.

AB Subtropical forests are globally important in providing ecological goods and services, but it is not clear whether functional diversity and composition can predict aboveground biomass in such forests. We hypothesized that high aboveground biomass is associated with high functional divergence (FDvar, i.e., niche complementarity) and community-weighted mean (CWM, i.e., mass ratio; communities dominated by a single plant strategy) of trait values. Structural equation modeling was employed to determine the direct and indirect effects of stand age and the residual effects of CWM and FDvar on aboveground biomass across 31 plots in secondary forests in subtropical China. The CWM model accounted for 78, 20, 6 and 2% of the variation in aboveground biomass, nitrogen concentration in young leaf, plant height and specific leaf area of young leaf, respectively. The FDvar model explained 74,13, 7 and 0% of the variation in aboveground biomass, plant height, twig wood density and nitrogen concentration in young leaf, respectively. The variation in aboveground biomass, CWM of leaf nitrogen concentration and specific leaf area, and FDvar of plant height, twig wood density and nitrogen concentration in young leaf explained by the joint model was 86, 20,13, 7, 2 and 0%, respectively. Stand age had a strong positive direct effect but low indirect positive effects on aboveground biomass. Aboveground biomass was negatively related to CWM of nitrogen concentration in young leaf, but positively related to CWM of specific leaf area of young leaf and plant height, and FDvar of plant height, twig wood density and nitrogen concentration in young leaf. Leaf and wood economics spectra are decoupled in regulating the functionality of forests, communities with diverse species but high nitrogen conservative and light acquisitive strategies result in high aboveground biomass, and hence, supporting both the mass ratio and niche complementarity hypotheses in secondary subtropical forests.

AB Predicted increases in the frequency and intensity of droughts across the temperate biome have highlighted the need to examine the extent to which forests may differ in their sensitivity to water stress. At present, a rich body of literature exists on how leaf- and stem-level physiology influence tree drought responses; however, less is known regarding the dynamic interactions that occur belowground between roots and soil physical and biological factors. Hence, there is a need to better understand how and why processes occurring belowground influence forest sensitivity to drought. Here, we review what is known about tree species' belowground strategies for dealing with drought, and how physical and biological characteristics of soils interact with rooting strategies to influence forest sensitivity to drought. Then, we highlight how a belowground perspective of drought can be used in models to reduce uncertainty in predicting the ecosystem consequences of droughts in forests. Finally, we describe the challenges and opportunities associated with managing forests under conditions of increasing drought frequency and intensity, and explain how a belowground perspective on drought may facilitate improved forest management.

AB AimGlobal climate change has profound and diverse effects on biological diversity. Identifying present-day climate refugia is an increasingly recognized strategy for the management of biodiversity loss. Such refugia are potential safe havens that enhance environmental diversity by buffering the effects of large scale change, facilitating species persistence at regional scales and conserving unique genetic diversity. Although their ecological effects are well studied, the potential of upwelling centres to act as refugia in a scenario of climate warming remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate whether upwelled waters act as refugia in a region heavily affected by recent climatic changes.
   LocationShores of south-western Iberia and north-western Africa.
   MethodsWe compared changes in distribution of the canopy-forming macroalga Fucus guiryi with sea surface temperature patterns in five upwelling areas and adjacent warmer regions. Population diversity and structure was inferred from genotypic analyses using nine microsatellite loci.
   ResultsFucus guiryi has disappeared from large expanses of non-upwelling shores, currently persisting in areas characterized by strong upwelling and reduced or non-significant rates of warming. Populations of F. guiryi were more abundant towards upwelling centres. Furthermore, the genetic characterization of populations revealed distinct genetic groups associated with each upwelling system.
   Main conclusionsWithin a large region of predominantly changing climate, we highlight the fundamental importance of upwelling areas as favourable, comparatively stable climates where F. guiryi has retreated and persists, preserving unique portions of the species' genetic pool.

AB Species and phylogenetic lineages have evolved to differ in the way that they acquire and deploy resources, with consequences for their physiological, chemical and structural attributes, many of which can be detected using spectral reflectance form leaves. Recent technological advances for assessing optical properties of plants offer opportunities to detect functional traits of organisms and differentiate levels of biological organization across the tree of life. Here, we connect leaf-level full range spectral data (400-2400 nm) of leaves to the hierarchical organization of plant diversity within the oak genus (Quercus) using field and greenhouse experiments in which environmental factors and plant age are controlled. We show that spectral data significantly differentiate populations within a species and that spectral similarity is significantly associated with phylogenetic similarity among species. We further show that hyperspectral information allows more accurate classification of taxa than spectrally-derived traits, which by definition are of lower dimensionality. Finally, model accuracy increases at higher levels in the hierarchical organization of plant diversity, such that we are able to better distinguish clades than species or populations. This pattern supports an evolutionary explanation for the degree of optical differentiation among plants and demonstrates potential for remote detection of genetic and phylogenetic diversity.

TI Light, earthworms, and soil resources as predictors of diversity of 10

AB Management of biodiversity and ecosystem services requires a better understanding of the factors that influence soil biodiversity. We characterized the species (or genera) richness of 10 taxonomic groups of invertebrate soil animals in replicated monocultures of 14 temperate tree species. The focal invertebrate groups ranged from microfauna to macrofauna: Lumbricidae, Nematoda, Oribatida, Gamasida, Opilionida, Araneida, Collembola, Formicidae, Carabidae, and Staphylinidae. Measurement of invertebrate richness and ancillary variables occurred similar to 34 years after the monocultures were planted. The richness within each taxonomic group was largely independent of richness of other groups; therefore a broad understanding of soil invertebrate diversity requires analyses that are integrated across many taxa. Using a regression-based approach and similar to 125 factors related to the abundance and diversity of resources, we identified a subset of predictors that were correlated with the richness of each invertebrate group and richness integrated across 9 of the groups (excluding earthworms). At least 50% of the variability in integrated richness and richness of each invertebrate group was explained by six or fewer predictors. The key predictors of soil invertebrate richness were light availability in the understory, the abundance of an epigeic earthworm species, the amount of phosphorus, nitrogen, and calcium in soil, soil acidity, and the diversity or mass of fungi, plant litter, and roots. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that resource abundance and diversity strongly regulate soil biodiversity, with increases in resources (up to a point) likely to increase the total diversity of soil invertebrates. However, the relationships between various resources and soil invertebrate diversity were taxon-specific. Similarly, diversity of all 10 invertebrate taxa was not high beneath any of the 14 tree species. Thus, changes to tree species composition and resource availability in temperate forests will likely increase the richness of some soil invertebrates while decreasing the richness of others.

AB In this article, we describe a recent development in the analysis of attrition: using classification and regression trees (CART) and random forest methods to generate inverse sampling weights. These flexible machine learning techniques have the potential to capture complex nonlinear, interactive selection models, yet to our knowledge, their performance in the missing data analysis context has never been evaluated. To assess the potential benefits of these methods, we compare their performance with commonly employed multiple imputation and complete case techniques in 2 simulations. These initial results suggest that weights computed from pruned CART analyses performed well in terms of both bias and efficiency when compared with other methods. We discuss the implications of these findings for applied researchers.

AB Thermal adaptations of soil microorganisms could mitigate or facilitate global warming effects on soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and soil CO2 efflux. We incubated soil from warmed and control subplots of a forest soil warming experiment to assess whether 9 years of soil warming affected the rates and the temperature sensitivity of the soil CO2 efflux, extracellular enzyme activities, microbial efficiency, and gross N mineralization. Mineral soil (0-10 cm depth) was incubated at temperatures ranging from 3 to 23 degrees C. No adaptations to long-term warming were observed regarding the heterotrophic soil CO2 efflux (R-10 warmed: 2.31 +/- 0.15 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), control: 2.34 +/- 0.29 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); Q(10) warmed: 2.45 +/- 0.06, control: 2.45 +/- 0.04). Potential enzyme activities increased with incubation temperature, but the temperature sensitivity of the enzymes did not differ between the warmed and the control soils. The ratio of C : N acquiring enzyme activities was significantly higher in the warmed soil. Microbial biomass-specific respiration rates increased with incubation temperature, but the rates and the temperature sensitivity (Q(10) warmed: 2.54 +/- 0.23, control 2.75 +/- 0.17) did not differ between warmed and control soils. Microbial substrate use efficiency (SUE) declined with increasing incubation temperature in both, warmed and control, soils. SUE and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10) warmed: 0.84 +/- 0.03, control: 0.88 +/- 0.01) did not differ between warmed and control soils either. Gross N mineralization was invariant to incubation temperature and was not affected by long-term soil warming. Our results indicate that thermal adaptations of the microbial decomposer community are unlikely to occur in C-rich calcareous temperate forest soils.

AB Despite recent efforts to develop the science of reintroduction biology, there is still no general and broadly accepted definition of reintroduction success. We investigate this issue based on the postulates (1) that successful reintroduction programs should produce viable populations and (2) that reliable assessments of ultimate success require that populations have reached their regulation phase. We assessed if the viability of these reintroduced populations could be evaluated using the same criteria as for remnant populations, such as the Internation Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria. Using modeling, we projected the viabilities of theoretical populations with various life history and environmental characteristics and we tested whether population sizes (criterion D of the IUCN) and other potential predictors are relevant proxies of the risk of extinction (criterion E of the IUCN) in the case of remnant populations with an unknown past history and in the case of reintroduced populations that have reached their carrying capacity. We found that, as for remnant populations, population size can be used as a relevant indicator (although subject to considerable uncertainty) of the viability of reintroduced populations. However, the results demonstrate the importance of the reintroduction failure filter, that is, the fact that the reintroduced populations that have successfully reached their carrying capacity are those with the highest and more stable growth rates, especially if populations have been reintroduced with a few individuals. As a consequence, the general relationship between the current size of a population and its projected viability will, most likely, differ considerably between remnant and reintroduced populations. Overall, our results demonstrate that there are no theoretical limitations on the application of some of the criteria widely used for remnant populations to define reintroduction success, although these criteria are very conservative for reintroduced populations and might be rescaled to account for the demographic filter that early extinction constitutes for these populations.

AB Variations of plant C: N: P stoichiometry could be affected by both some environmental fluctuations and plant physiological processes. However, the trade-off mechanism between them and their influencial factors were not understood completely. In this study, C, N, P contents and their stoichiometry of S. salsa's plant organs (leaves, stems, and roots), together with their environmental factors including salinity, pH, soil N and soil P, were examined in the intertidal and supratidal habitats of coastal wetlands during the different sampling times (May, July, September, November). The results showed that both plant organ and sampling times affected C, N, and P and stoichiometry of S. salsa in the intertidal and supratidal habitats, however, their influencial conditions and mechanisms were different. In the intertidal habitat, the different slopes of C-P and N-P within interspecific organs suggested that plant P, C: P and N: P of S. salsa were modulated by P concentrations that allocated in the specific organs. However, the slopes of C-N were found to be not significant within interspecific organs, but during the sampling times. These differences of plant N and C: N were related with the physiological demand for N in the specific life history stage. In the supratidal habitat, no significant differences were found in the slopes of C-N, C-P, and N-P within interspecific organs. However, different slopes of C-N among the sampling times also indicated a self-regulation strategy for plant N and C: N of S. salsa in different ontogenetic stages. In contrast to the intertidal habitat, seasonal variations of P, C: P and N: P ratios within interspecific organs reflected the soil P characteristics in the supratidal habitat. Our results showed that the stoichiometric constraint strategy of plant S. salsa in this region was strongly correlated with the local soil nutrient conditions.

AB Intercropping is a sustainable agricultural practice used worldwide for highly efficient utilization of resources. However, short crops often grow under the shade of the canopy of tall crops in intercropping systems. Plants evolved two main strategies to deal with shade: avoidance and tolerance. Soybean (Glycine max), a legume crop, is often planted in intercropping. But little is known about a strategy that soybean may employ to deal with shade at seedling stage. Therefore, we determined morphological and physiological traits related to shade tolerance and shade avoidance in seedlings of two varieties. Generally, both varieties showed similar shade tolerance traits, such as increased specific leaf area and chlorophyll (Chl) content, and reduced photosynthetic capacity and the Chl a/b ratio. The light-limiting environment eliminated the benefits of shade tolerance traits for the carbon gain, which led to similar real-time photosynthesis and biomass in intercropping. By contrast, two varieties expressed different changes in shade avoidance traits. The variety Guixia 3 exhibited clear preference of shade avoidance that resulted in a high main stem, hypocotyl elongation, and biomass allocation towards the stem. The variety Gongxuan 1 showed those traits less. We suggested that the genetic variation occurs within soybean, thus the shade avoidance related traits might be important for variety selection for intercropping. Hence, the evaluation of performance should focus on shade avoidance in soybean genotypes in future experiments.

AB Climate change is not being felt equally around the world. Regions where warming is most rapid will be among those to experience impacts first, will need to develop early responses to these impacts and can provide a guide for management elsewhere. We describe the research history in one such global marine hotspot-south-east Australia-where a number of contentions about the value of hotspots as natural laboratories have been supported, including (1) early reporting of changes (2) early documentation of impacts, and (3) earlier development and promotion of adaptation options. We illustrate a transition from single discipline impacts-focused research to an inter-disciplinary systems view of adaptation research. This transition occurred against a background of change in the political position around climate change and was facilitated by four preconditioning factors. These were: (1) early observations of rapid oceanic change that coincided with (2) biological change which together provided a focus for action, (3) the strong marine orientation and history of management in the region, and (4) the presence of well developed networks. Three case studies collectively show the critical role of inter-disciplinary engagement and stakeholder participation in supporting industry and government adaptation planning.

AB The response of fire to climate change may vary across fuel types characteristic of differing vegetation types (i.e. litter vs. grass). Models of fire under climatic change capture these differing potential responses to varying degrees. Across south-eastern Australia, an elevation in the severity of weather conditions conducive to fire has been measured in recent decades. We examined trends in area burned (1975-2009) to determine if a corresponding increase in fire had occurred across the diverse range of ecosystems found in this part of the continent. We predicted that an increase in fire, due to climatic warming and drying, was more likely to have occurred in moist, temperate forests near the coast than in arid and semiarid woodlands of the interior, due to inherent contrasts in the respective dominant fuel types (woody litter vs. herbaceous fuels). Significant warming (i.e. increased temperature and number of hot days) and drying (i.e. negative precipitation anomaly, number of days with low humidity) occurred across most of the 32 Bioregions examined. The results were mostly consistent with predictions, with an increase in area burned in seven of eight forest Bioregions, whereas area burned either declined (two) or did not change significantly (nine) in drier woodland Bioregions. In 12 woodland Bioregions, data were insufficient for analysis of temporal trends in fire. Increases in fire attributable mostly to warming or drying were confined to three Bioregions. In the remainder, such increases were mostly unrelated to warming or drying trends and therefore may be due to other climate effects not explored (e.g. lightning ignitions) or possible anthropogenic influences. Projections of future fire must therefore not only account for responses of different fuel systems to climatic change but also the wider range of ecological and human effects on interactions between fire and vegetation.

   QUESTIONS
AB Dispersal knowledge is essential for conservation management, and demand is growing. But are we accumulating dispersal knowledge at a pace that can meet the demand? To answer this question we tested for changes in dispersal data collection and use over time. Our systematic review of 655 conservation-related publications compared five topics: climate change, habitat restoration, population viability analysis, land planning (systematic conservation planning) and invasive species. We analysed temporal changes in the: (i) questions asked by dispersal-related research; (ii) methods used to study dispersal; (iii) the quality of dispersal data; (iv) extent that dispersal knowledge is lacking, and; (v) likely consequences of limited dispersal knowledge. Research questions have changed little over time; the same problems examined in the 1990s are still being addressed. The most common methods used to study dispersal were occupancy data, expert opinion and modelling, which often provided indirect, low quality information about dispersal. Although use of genetics for estimating dispersal has increased, new ecological and genetic methods for measuring dispersal are not yet widely adopted. Almost half of the papers identified knowledge gaps related to dispersal. Limited dispersal knowledge often made it impossible to discover ecological processes or compromised conservation outcomes. The quality of dispersal data used in climate change research has increased since the 1990s. In comparison, restoration ecology inadequately addresses large-scale process, whilst the gap between knowledge accumulation and growth in applications may be increasing in land planning. To overcome apparent stagnation in collection and use of dispersal knowledge, researchers need to: (i) improve the quality of available data using new approaches; (ii) understand the complementarities of different methods and; (iii) define the value of different kinds of dispersal information for supporting management decisions. Ambitious, multi-disciplinary research programs studying many species are critical for advancing dispersal research.

AB The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is widespread throughout the plant kingdom and important for plant nutrition and ecosystem functioning. Nonetheless, most terrestrial ecosystems also contain a considerable number of non-mycorrhizal plants. The interaction of such non-host plants with AM fungi (AMF) is still poorly understood. Here, in three complementary experiments, we investigated whether the non-mycorrhizal plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the model organism for plant molecular biology and genetics, interacts with AMF. We grew A.thaliana alone or together with a mycorrhizal host species (either Trifolium pratense or Lolium multiflorum) in the presence or absence of the AMFRhizophagus irregularis. Plants were grown in a dual-compartment system with a hyphal mesh separating roots of A.thaliana from roots of the host species, avoiding direct root competition. The host plants in the system ensured the presence of an active AM fungal network. AM fungal networks caused growth depressions in A.thaliana of more than 50% which were not observed in the absence of host plants. Microscopy analyses revealed that R.irregularis supported by a host plant was capable of infecting A.thaliana root tissues (up to 43% of root length colonized), but no arbuscules were observed. The results reveal high susceptibility of A.thaliana to R.irregularis, suggesting that A.thaliana is a suitable model plant to study non-host/AMF interactions and the biological basis of AM incompatibility.

AB Aquatic species living in running waters are widely acknowledged to be vulnerable to climate-induced, thermal and hydrological fluctuations. Climate changes can interact with other environmental changes to determine structural and functional attributes of communities. Although such complex interactions are most likely to occur in a multiple-stressor context as frequently encountered in large rivers, they have received little attention in such ecosystems. In this study, we aimed at specifically addressing the issue of relative long-term effects of global and local changes on benthic macroinvertebrate communities in multistressed large rivers. We assessed effects of hydroclimatic vs. water quality factors on invertebrate community structure and composition over 30years (19792008) in the Middle Loire River, France. As observed in other large European rivers, water warming over the three decades (+0.9 degrees C between 19791988 and 19992008) and to a lesser extent discharge reduction (80m3s1) were significantly involved in the disappearance or decrease in taxa typical from fast running, cold waters (e.g. Chloroperlidae and Potamanthidae). They explained also a major part of the appearance and increase of taxa typical from slow flowing or standing waters and warmer temperatures, including invasive species (e.g. Corbicula sp. and Atyaephyra desmarestii). However, this shift towards a generalist and pollution tolerant assemblage was partially confounded by local improvement in water quality (i.e. phosphate input reduction by about two thirds and eutrophication limitation by almost one half), explaining a significant part of the settlement of new pollution-sensitive taxa (e.g. the caddisfly Brachycentridae and Philopotamidae families) during the last years of the study period. The regain in such taxa allowed maintaining a certain level of specialization in the invertebrate community despite climate change effects.

AB Aim We examined the century-long post-fire responses of reptiles to (1) determine the time-scales over which fauna fire relationships occur, (2) assess the capacity of a conceptual model to predict faunal response to fire, and (3) investigate the degree to which models of fauna fire relationships can predict species occurrence and are transferable across space. Location A 104,000 km2 area in the semi-arid Murray Mallee region of south-eastern Australia. Methods We surveyed reptiles at 280 sites across a century-long post-fire chronosequence. We developed generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) of the relationship between time since fire and the occurrence of 17 species in two subregions, and compared modelled responses with predictions derived from the conceptual model. The predictive capacity of GAMMs was then assessed (1) within the subregion the model was developed and (2) when transferred into a novel subregion. Results Eleven species displayed a significant relationship with time-since-fire, with changes in species probability of occurrence continuing up to 100 years post-fire. Predictions of the timing of species post-fire peak in occurrence were accurate for 9 of 13 species models for which a significant fire response was detected, but little success was achieved in predicting the shape of a species' response. GAMMs predicted species occurrence more accurately when applied within the subregion in which they were developed than when transferred into a novel subregion, primarily due to some species responding to fire more strongly in one part of their geographic range. Main conclusions Fire influences the occurrence of reptiles in semi-arid ecosystems over century-long time frames. Habitat-use conceptual models have value in predicting the peak occurrence of species following fire, particularly for species with distributions strongly shaped by fire. Species relationships with fire can differ across their geographic range, probably associated with variation in climatic influences on post-fire succession and the consequent provision of habitat resources.

AB The main goal of species distribution modeling is to identify important underlying factors related to broad-scale ecological patterns in order to make meaningful explanations or accurate predictions. When standard statistical methods such as regression are used to formulate these models, assumptions about the spatial structure of the data and the model parameters are often violated. Autocorrelation and non-stationarity are characteristics of spatial data and models, respectively, and if present and unaccounted for in model development, they can result in poorly specified models as well as inappropriate spatial inference and prediction. While these spatial issues are addressed here in an ecological context using species distribution models, they are broadly relevant to any statistical modeling applications using spatial data.

AB 1. Maternal reproductive investment is thought to reflect a trade-off between offspring size and fecundity, and models generally predict that mothers inhabiting adverse environments will produce fewer, larger offspring. More recently, the importance of environmental unpredictability in influencing maternal investment has been considered, with some models predicting that mothers should adopt a diversified bet-hedging strategy whilst others a conservative bet-hedging strategy. 2. We explore spatial egg size and fecundity patterns in the freshwater fish southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis) that inhabits a diversity of streams along gradients of environmental quality, variability and predictability. 3. Contrary to some predictions, N. australis populations inhabiting increasingly harsh streams produced more numerous and smaller eggs. Furthermore, within-female egg size variability increased as environments became more unpredictable. 4. We argue that in harsh environments or those prone to physical disturbance, sources of mortality are size independent with offspring size having only a minor influence on offspring fitness. Instead, maternal fitness is maximized by producing many small eggs, increasing the likelihood that some offspring will disperse to permanent water. We also provide empirical support for diversified bet-hedging as an adaptive strategy when future environmental quality is uncertain and suggest egg size may be a more appropriate fitness measure in stable environments characterized by size-dependent fitness. These results likely reflect spatial patterns of adaptive plasticity and bet-hedging in response to both predictable and unpredictable environmental variance and highlight the importance of considering both trait averages and variance. 5. Reproductive life-history traits can vary predictably along environmental gradients. Human activity, such as the hydrological modification of natural flow regimes, alters the form and magnitude of these gradients, and this can have both ecological and evolutionary implications for biota adapted to now non-existent natural environmental heterogeneity.

AB Urban processes lead to species loss. Palmas is a young city under construction; thus, it provides a rare opportunity to analyze changes in bird richness in a developing city. Eighty city blocks, which were classified into five different categories according to different levels of urbanization, were sampled. Bird counting took place during a dry season and a rainy season in four parallel transects in each block. In these blocks, we estimated 20 variables related to woody vegetation, land cover and type of urban use. The estimated bird species richness for the study area was very high (151 species); nevertheless, species reduction occurred as a function of the urbanization processes. Although representing only 11% of the city surface, the not-urbanized blocks showed the highest species richness, which corresponded to 96.3% of the richness estimated in the city. The average species richness for most trophic groups, families, open-field or forest species and resident or migratory species decreased significantly in urbanized blocks. According to a Hierarchical Partitioning analysis the environmental variables that made the greatest positive contribution to the variation in bird species richness in urbanized blocks were the percentage of block area planned for residential use, the density of native trees and the percentage area covered by unpaved roads, whereas the commercial block density, the density of exotic trees and the percentage of block area built had the greatest negative contribution. Based on our results, policies aimed to maintain Cerrado native species in urbanized blocks would contribute to reduce bird species loss. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There have been significant diversions of water from rivers and streams around the world; natural flow regimes have been perturbed by dams, barriers and excessive extractions. Many aspects of the ecological 'health' of riverine systems have declined due to changes in water flows, which has stimulated the development of thinking about the maintenance and restoration of these systems, which we refer to as environmental flow methodologies (EFMs). Most existing EFMs cannot deliver information on the population viability of species because they: (1) use habitat suitability as a proxy for population status; (2) use historical time series (usually of short duration) to forecast future conditions and flow sequences; (3) cannot, or do not, handle extreme flow events associated with climate variability; and (4) assume process stationarity for flow sequences, which means the past sequences are treated as good indicators of the future. These assumptions undermine the capacity of EFMs to properly represent risks associated with different flow management options; assumption (4) is untenable given most climate-change predictions. We discuss these concerns and advocate the use of demographic modelling as a more appropriate tool for linking population dynamics to flow regime change. A 'meta-species' approach to demographic modelling is discussed as a useful step from habitat based models towards modelling strategies grounded in ecological theory when limited data are available on flow-demographic relationships. Data requirements of demographic models will undoubtedly expose gaps in existing knowledge, but, in so doing, will strengthen future efforts to link changes in river flows with their ecological consequences.

AB The implications of shallow water impacts such as fishing and climate change on fish assemblages are generally considered in isolation from the distribution and abundance of these fish assemblages in adjacent deeper waters. We investigate the abundance and length of demersal fish assemblages across a section of tropical continental shelf at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, to identify fish and fish habitat relationships across steep gradients in depth and in different benthic habitat types. The assemblage composition of demersal fish were assessed from baited remote underwater stereo-video samples (n = 304) collected from 16 depth and habitat combinations. Samples were collected across a depth range poorly represented in the literature from the fringing reef lagoon (1-10 m depth), down the fore reef slope to the reef base (10-30 m depth) then across the adjacent continental shelf (30-110 m depth). Multivariate analyses showed that there were distinctive fish assemblages and different sized fish were associated with each habitat/depth category. Species richness, MaxN and diversity declined with depth, while average length and trophic level increased. The assemblage structure, diversity, size and trophic structure of demersal fishes changes from shallow inshore habitats to deeper water habitats. More habitat specialists (unique species per habitat/depth category) were associated with the reef slope and reef base than other habitats, but offshore sponge-dominated habitats and inshore coral-dominated reef also supported unique species. This suggests that marine protected areas in shallow coral-dominated reef habitats may not adequately protect those species whose depth distribution extends beyond shallow habitats, or other significant elements of demersal fish biodiversity. The ontogenetic habitat partitioning which is characteristic of many species, suggests that to maintain entire species life histories it is necessary to protect corridors of connected habitats through which fish can migrate.

AB 1 The plant stress, plant vigour and pulsed stress hypotheses describe the relationships between drought stress, plant quality and herbivore performance. We used an aphid-Brassica system to test these hypotheses under different drought treatments. 2 The quantity of water added per plant/week was 75%, 50% and 25% of the control (unstressed) water regime for low, medium and high drought stress, respectively, and 50% applied fortnightly for pulsed drought stress. The performance of a senescence (generalist) and a flush feeder (specialist) aphid species and host plant quality were assessed. 3 Drought treatments had a similar effect on the fecundity and intrinsic rate of increase of both aphid species. Aphid performance on unstressed and highly drought-stressed plants was significantly lower compared with medium drought stress. On average, 20% greater fecundity and 40% greater intrinsic rates of increase were recorded for both aphid species at medium drought stress compared with unstressed plants. 4 Plant biomass and relative water contents were significantly greater for unstressed plants compared with high and pulsed drought treatments. Foliar nitrogen concentration was significantly greater in the high drought stress and pulsed treatments, and the dominant glucosinolate (glucobrassicin) concentration was significantly greater in drought stress treatments. 5 The present study supports the plant stress hypothesis, although the plant vigour and pulsed stress hypotheses are not supported by our data. The implications of these findings for plantherbivore interactions under changing environmental conditions are discussed.

AB The effect of environmental stress on the magnitude of inbreeding depression has a long history of intensive study. Inbreeding-stress interactions are of great importance to the viability of populations of conservation concern and have numerous evolutionary ramifications. However, such interactions are controversial. Several meta-analyses over the last decade, combined with omic studies, have provided considerable insight into the generality of inbreeding-stress interactions, its physiological basis, and have provided the foundation for future studies. In this review, we examine the genetic and physiological mechanisms proposed to explain why inbreeding-stress interactions occur. We specifically examine whether the increase in inbreeding depression with increasing stress could be due to a concomitant increase in phenotypic variation, using a larger data set than any previous study. Phenotypic variation does usually increase with stress, and this increase can explain some of the inbreeding-stress interaction, but it cannot explain all of it. Overall, research suggests that inbreeding- stress interactions can occur via multiple independent channels, though the relative contribution of each of the mechanisms is unknown. To better understand the causes and consequences of inbreeding- stress interactions in natural populations, future research should focus on elucidating the genetic architecture of such interactions and quantifying naturally occurring levels of stress in the wild.

AB We present an approach to modeling potential climate-driven changes in habitat for tree and bird species in the eastern United States. First, we took an empirical-statistical modeling approach, using randomForest, with species abundance data from national inventories combined with soil, climate, and landscape variables, to build abundance-based habitat models for 134 tree and 147 bird species. We produced lists of species for which suitable habitat tends to increase, decrease, or stay the same for any region. Independent assessments of trends of large trees versus seedlings across the eastern U.S. show that 37 of 40 species in common under both studies are currently trending as modeled. We developed a framework, ModFacs, in which we used the literature to assign default modification factor scores for species characteristics that cannot be readily assessed in such models, including 12 disturbance factors (for example, drought, fire, insect pests), nine biological factors (for example, dispersal, shade tolerance), and assessment scores of novel climates, long-distance extrapolations, and output variability by climate model and emission scenario. We also used a spatially explicit cellular model, SHIFT, to calculate colonization potentials for some species, based on their abundance, historic dispersal distances, and the fragmented nature of the landscape. By combining results from the three efforts, we can create projections of potential climate change impacts over the next 100 years or so. Here we emphasize some of the lessons we have learned over 16 years in hopes that they may help guide future experiments, modeling efforts, and management.

AB Aim To investigate the impact of positional uncertainty in species occurrences on the predictions of seven commonly used species distribution models (SDMs), and explore its interaction with spatial autocorrelation in predictors.
   Methods A series of artificial datasets covering 155 scenarios including different combinations of five positional uncertainty scenarios and 31 spatial autocorrelation scenarios were simulated. The level of positional uncertainty was defined by the standard deviation of a normally distributed zero-mean random variable. Each dataset included two environmental gradients (predictor variables) and one set of species occurrence sample points (response variable). Seven commonly used models were selected to develop SDMs: generalized linear models, generalized additive models, boosted regression trees, multivariate adaptive regression spline, random forests, genetic algorithm for rule-set production and maximum entropy. A probabilistic approach was employed to model and simulate five levels of error in the species locations. To analyse the propagation of positional uncertainty, Monte Carlo simulation was applied to each scenario for each SDM. The models were evaluated for performance using simulated independent test data with Cohen's Kappa and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.
   Results Positional uncertainty in species location led to a reduction in prediction accuracy for all SDMs, although the magnitude of the reduction varied between SDMs. In all cases the magnitude of this impact varied according to the degree of spatial autocorrelation in predictors and the levels of positional uncertainty. It was shown that when the range of spatial autocorrelation in the predictors was less than or equal to three times the standard deviation of the positional error, the models were less affected by error and, consequently, had smaller decreases in prediction accuracy. When the range of spatial autocorrelation in predictors was larger than three times the standard deviation of positional error, the prediction accuracy was low for all scenarios.
   Main conclusions The potential impact of positional uncertainty in species occurrences on the predictions of SDMs can be understood by comparing it with the spatial autocorrelation range in predictor variables.

AB Field studies were conducted for two consecutive years under sub-temperate climatic conditions at Nauni in district Solan of Himachal Pradesh (30 degrees 52'N, 77 degrees 11'E 1175 asl) on loamy sand Inceptisols to investigate the effect of different mulches (hay: HM, black polyethylene: BP) on root growth, nutrient uptake, water-use efficiency (WUE) and yield of strawberry cv. Chandler under drip (DI) and surface irrigation (SI) systems. Unmulch (UM) and rainfed treatments were kept as control. Higher soil moisture content was registered under both the mulch materials during entire crop growth period. However, it was greater under BP mulch as compare to HM. The moisture conservation increased by 2.80-12.80% under BP mulch as compared to UM. HM treatment, irrespective of irrigation method increased the minimum soil temperature (2.8-5.2 degrees C) and reduced the maximum soil temperature (2.7-5.8 degrees C) as compared to UM. BP mulch increased the minimum soil temperature from 0.4 to 2.5 degrees C. Application of irrigation moderated the soil (minimum 2.6 and maximum 1.4 degrees C) temperature. Both the mulch materials were effective in enhancing root growth, nutrient uptake. WUE and yield. Application of mulch enhanced the root growth (63%), nutrient uptake (179.20%), WUE (84.40%) and yield (343%) under DI. However, respective increase under SI was 23.60, 83.80, 109.40 and 219.20%. Under DI, 51% of irrigation water was saved and about 19% higher fruit yield was obtained as compared with SI treatment. Linear regression model could significantly describe the variations in nutrient uptake (N, P and K) and WUE of strawberry under sub-temperate climatic conditions, root mass density was better indicator for estimating nutrient uptake of strawberry.

AB In Mediterranean regions, drought is one of the main factors shaping fluvial ecosystems. Droughts cause a shift from lotic to lentic conditions, triggering a gradual fragmentation of the longitudinal hydrological continuum, and a severe alteration of water chemical properties. However, within a biogeochemical perspective, little is known about how and to which extend droughts modify the chemical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM). In this study, the variability of DOM properties along a fragmented fluvial system is explored, during a summer severe drought, by means of (a) the ratio between dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations (DOC:DON); (b) DOC bioavailability (BDOC) and (c) DOM optical properties (SUVA index, fluorescence index, and excitation-emission fluorescence matrices). DOM and water measurements were collected from isolated water parcels that became disconnected from the fluvial continuum at different times, and were compared with data obtained in the following autumn, when the fluvial continuum was re-established. Analysis of DOM chemical properties evidenced that these properties during drought clearly differed from those observed in autumn, but changes did not follow an arbitrary pattern. Thus, the sampling sites with lotic water bodies showed DOM properties similar to those observed in autumn reflecting the dominance of terrestrial inputs. But, once hydrological fragmentation occurred, there was a gradual increase in the contribution of autochthonous DOM as the time elapsed since the pools were established, and the geochemical conditions shifted from oxidized to reduced conditions. In consequence, the fragmentation of fluvial continuum generates a set of distinct biochemical hot spots (i.e., each water parcel), revealing that extreme drought greatly amplifies the qualitative heterogeneity of organic matter in a fluvial system.

AB In preparation for a large-scale coral restoration project, we surveyed host population genetic structure and symbiont diversity of two reef-building corals in four reef zones along the Florida reef tract (FRT). There was no evidence for coral population subdivision along the FRT in Acropora cervicornis or Montastraea faveolata based on microsatellite markers. However, in A. cervicornis, significant genetic differentiation was apparent when extending the analysis to broader scales (Caribbean). Clade diversity of the zooxanthellae differed along the FRT. A. cervicornis harbored mostly clade A with clade D zooxanthellae being prominent in colonies growing inshore and in the mid-channel zones that experience greater temperature fluctuations and receive significant nutrient and sediment input. M. faveolata harbored a more diverse array of symbionts, and variation in symbiont diversity among four habitat zones was more subtle but still significant. Implications of these results are discussed for ongoing restoration and conservation work.

AB Habitat fragmentation affects the integrity of many species, but little is known about species-specific sensitivity to fragmentation. Here, we compared the genetic structure of four freshwater fish species differing in their body size (Leuciscus cephalus; Leuciscus leuciscus; Gobio gobio and Phoxinus phoxinus) between a fragmented and a continuous landscape. We tested if, overall, fragmentation affected the genetic structure of these fish species, and if these species differed in their sensitivity to fragmentation. Fragmentation negatively affected the genetic structure of these species. Indeed, irrespective of the species identity, allelic richness and heterozygosity were lower, and population divergence was higher in the fragmented than in the continuous landscape. This response to fragmentation was highly species-specific, with the smallest fish species (P. phoxinus) being slightly affected by fragmentation. On the contrary, fish species of intermediate body size (L. leuciscus and G. gobio) were highly affected, whereas the largest fish species (L. cephalus) was intermediately affected by fragmentation. We discuss the relative role of dispersal ability and effective population size on the responses to fragmentation we report here. The weirs studied here are of considerable historical importance. We therefore conclude that restoration programmes will need to consider both this societal context and the biological characteristics of the species sharing this ecosystem.

AB Recovery of biodiversity and other ecosystem functions to pre-disturbance levels is a central goal of natural disturbance-based approaches to ecosystem management. In boreal mixedwood forests, green-tree retention has been proposed as an alternative approach to traditional clearcutting that may minimize initial displacement of species assemblages and speed recovery of the biota. Here we evaluated the effectiveness of six levels of dispersed green-tree retention for conservation of ground beetle biodiversity in four boreal mixedwood cover types that span a gradient of stand development following wildfire. Each cover type x treatment combination was replicated three times in an operational scale experiment using 10ha compartments. Ground beetle assemblages (59 species and 45 419 individuals) responded to increasing levels of dispersed, green-tree retention, but even relatively high levels of retention (up to 50% retention) did not retain species assemblages characteristic of uncut forest stands. This latter effect was most pronounced in compartments in later successional stages; i.e., those with developing conifer understories, or mixed and/or conifer-dominated overstories. Beetle assemblages in high levels of retention (50-75%) were statistically similar across all cover types, although we detected modest differences among the 5-year recovery of assemblages, based on initial cover type differences. Thus, recovery to initial conditions likely will be slower in mixed and conifer stands than in deciduous stands. We suggest that recovery of beetle assemblages is strongly linked to stand reinitiation through deciduous "suckering" postharvest. Increasing levels of harvest appear to homogenize carabid assemblages across the four dominant cover types, and thus higher levels of retention (>50%) will be required to preserve assemblages of later successional stages. Regional renewal of assemblages, however, will require landscape-level planning.

AB The suitability of two algae species, Gracilaria lemaneiformis and Sargassum pallidum, for use as food sources for the abalone Haliotis discus hannai Ino was evaluated. Abalones were fed one of five experimental diets: 1) kelp Laminari japonica: 2) G. lemaneiformis: 3) S. pallidum; 4) a mixed diet of L. japonica and G. lemaneiformis (1:1); and 5) a mixed diet of L. japonica and S. pallidum (1:1) for a period of 4 months. The survival, growth (shell length and body weight), condition index (body weight/shell length), and feed utilization were measured. Survival was excellent (100%) in all groups. Growth rate (body weight) was highest in the abalone fed kelp exclusively, followed by the mixed diet of kelp and G. lemaneiformis. The abalone fed S. pallidum had the lowest increase in body weight and the lowest feed intake. The mixed diet of kelp and G. lemaneiformis yielded the biggest increase in shell length. There were no significant differences in the condition index among all the treatment groups. The mean daily feed intake of L japonica was highest, followed by the mixed diets of kelp and G. lemaneiformis, and was lowest for S. pallidum. Abalone exhibited a preference for L japonica. The feed conversion efficiency was highest for G. lemaneiformis. Results suggest that G. lemaneiformis can be used as a partial substitute for kelp in the diet of cultured abalone.

AB Temporal changes in soil C content vary as a result of complex interactions among different factors including climate, baseline soil C levels, soil texture, and agricultural management practices. The study objectives were: to estimate the changes in soil total C contents that occurred in the past 18 to 21 yr in soils under agricultural management and in never-tilled grassland in southwest Michigan; to explore the relationships between these changes and soil properties, such as baseline C levels and soil texture; and to simulate C changes using a system approach model (SALUS). The data were collected from two long-term experiments established in 1986 and 1988. Georeferenced samples were collected from both experiments before establishment and then were resampled in 2006 and 2007. The studied agricultural treatments included the conventional chisel-plow and no-till management systems with and without N fertilization and the organic chisel-plow management with cover crops. Total C was either lost in the conventional chisel-plowed systems or was only maintained at the 1980s levels by the conservation management systems. The largest loss in the agricultural treatments was 4.5 Mg ha(-1) total C observed in the chisel-plow system without N fertilization. A loss of 17.3 Mg ha(-1) occurred in the virgin grassland sod. Changes in C content tended to be negatively related to baseline C levels. Under no-till, changes in C were positively related to silt + clay contents. The SALUS predictions of soil C changes were in excellent agreement with the observed data for most of the agricultural treatments and for the virgin soil.

AB Ecosystem-based management is the management system being applied to 6.4 million hectares of the coast of British Columbia, Canada, an area referred to as the Great Bear Rainforest. This approach, intended to manage for ecosystem integrity and community wellbeing, is similar in many respects to ecosystem management approaches elsewhere. However, several novel elements are involved in application of ecosystem-based management on British Columbia's coast: shifts in power that have led to increased aboriginal control and the formation of coalitions between groups that were formerly in opposition; development of explicit models relating management strategies to land-use objectives and separating knowledge from values; use of ecological thresholds and natural variability to establish management targets. Current management is based on transitional targets that differ from science-based targets. Many challenges remain in moving to full implementation of ecosystem-based management, including the difficulties involved in moving from one management model to a fundamentally different one, limited resources for implementation, dealing with complex systems, the lack of freely available multi-disciplinary data, and the difficulty of bringing concepts of uncertainty and risk into public policy discussions in a transparent manner.

AB Fine roots and rhizomorphs have important implications for the global carbon balance, but the processes underlying these carbon sinks are not well understood. In this study, we coupled continuous minirhizotron observations with an array of solid-state CO(2) sensors. We calculated soil respiration using a gradient flux method. Using a Kaplan-Maier survival analysis, we determined a median longevity of 347 d for fine roots and of 400 d for rhizomorphs. Radiocarbon ((14)C) analysis suggested an age of 7 yr for fine roots < 1 mm and 17 yr for roots of 1 mm in diameter. We found rapid changes in root length (maximum of 38.1 cm m(-2) d(-1)) and rhizomorph length ( maximum of 105.4 cm m(-2) d(-1)) during sampling of four consecutive days. Changes in rhizomorph length were more variable than root length, and rhizomorphs were negatively correlated with daily changes in soil moisture. The variation in root length may be associated to prior environmental conditions. Fine root length was correlated with daily CO(2) production, and variation in daily fine root length could contribute up to 4680 g C ha(-1) d(-1). We observed a clockwise diurnal hysteresis effect in soil respiration with soil temperature that changed in amplitude and shape along the year. Our results show the importance of shorter intervals of minirhizotron measurements to understand rapid fine roots and rhizomorphs variation. Furthermore, continuous minirhizotron measurements should be couple with continuous measurements of multiple sensor arrays to explain biophysical factors that regulate belowground carbon dynamics.

AB 1. Organisms can impact ecosystems via multiple pathways, often with positive and negative impacts on inhabitants. Understanding the context dependency of these types of impacts remains challenging. For example, organisms may perform different functions at different densities.
   2. Anadromous salmon accumulate > 99% of their lifetime growth in marine ecosystems, and then return to spawn, often at high densities, in relatively confined freshwaters. While previous research has focused on how salmon nutrients can fertilize benthic communities, we examined how an ecosystem engineer, sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka, influences seasonal dynamics of stream benthic communities through their nest-digging activities in south-western Alaska, USA. Benthic invertebrate and algal abundance were quantified every 7-14 days during the open water seasons of 10 streams in riffle and run habitats across multiple years, leading to 25 different stream-year combinations that spanned a large gradient of salmon density.
   3. In streams with few or no salmon, benthic algal and insect biomass were fairly constant throughout the season. However, in streams with more than 0.1 salmon m(-2), algal and insect biomass decreased by an average of 75-85% during salmon spawning. Algal biomass recovered quickly following salmon disturbance, occasionally reaching pre-salmon biomass. In contrast, in streams with more than 0.1 salmon m(-2), aquatic insect populations did not recover to pre-salmon levels within the same season. We observed no positive impacts of salmon on algae or insects via fertilization from carcass nutrients.
   4. Salmon, when their populations exceed thresholds in spawning density, are an important component of stream disturbance regimes and influence seasonal dynamics of benthic communities. Human activities that drive salmon densities below threshold densities, as has likely happened in many streams, will lead to altered seasonal dynamics of stream communities. Human activities that alter animal populations that are sources of biogenic disturbance can result in shifts in community dynamics.

AB A better understanding of relationships between human activities and water chemistry is needed to identify and manage sources of anthropogenic stress in Great Lakes coastal wetlands. The objective of the study described in this article was to characterize relationships between water chemistry and multiple classes of human activity (agriculture, population and development, point source pollution, and atmospheric deposition). We also evaluated the influence of geomorphology and biogeographic factors on stressor-water quality relationships. We collected water chemistry data from 98 coastal wetlands distributed along the United States shoreline of the Laurentian Great Lakes and GIS-based stressor data from the associated drainage basin to examine stressor-water quality relationships. The sampling captured broad ranges (1.5-2 orders of magnitude) in total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), total suspended solids (TSS), chlorophyll a (Chl a), and chloride; concentrations were strongly correlated with stressor metrics. Hierarchical partitioning and all-subsets regression analyses were used to evaluate the independent influence of different stressor classes on water quality and to identify best predictive models. Results showed that all categories of stress influenced water quality and that the relative influence of different classes of disturbance varied among water quality parameters. Chloride exhibited the strongest relationships with stressors followed in order by TN, Chl a, TP, TSS, and DIN. In general, coarse scale classification of wetlands by morphology (three wetland classes: riverine, protected, open coastal) and biogeography (two ecoprovinces: Eastern Broadleaf Forest [EBF] and Laurentian Mixed Forest [LMF]) did not improve predictive models. This study provides strong evidence of the link between water chemistry and human stress in Great Lakes coastal wetlands and can be used to inform management efforts to improve water quality in Great Lakes coastal ecosystems.

AB 1. Species distribution modelling is an important and well-established tool for conservation planning and resource management. Modelling techniques based on central estimates of species responses to environmental factors do not always provide ecologically meaningful estimates of species-environment relationships and are being increasingly questioned.
   2. Regression quantiles (RQ) can be used to model the upper bounds of species-environment relationships and thus estimate how the environment is limiting the distribution of a species. The resulting models tend to describe potential rather than actual patterns of species distributions.
   3. Model selection based on null hypothesis testing and backward elimination, followed by validation procedures, are proposed here as a general approach for constructing RQ limiting effect models for multiple species.
   4. This approach was applied successfully to 16 of the most abundant marine fish and cephalopods in the eastern English Channel. Most models were validated successfully and null hypothesis testing for model selection proved effective for RQ modelling.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Modelling the upper bounds of species-habitat relationships enables the detection of the effects of limiting factors on species' responses. Maps showing potential species distributions are also less likely to underestimate species responses' to the environment, and therefore have subsequent benefits for precautionary management.

AB The arid Yilgarn region of Western Australia contains numerous isolated calcrete aquifers, within which a diverse subterranean fauna has been discovered. Genetic and morphological studies of subterranean dytiscid beetles and amphipods have suggested that individual calcretes are equivalent to closed island habitats, which have been isolated for millions of years. Here we test this 'subterranean island' hypothesis further by phylogeographic analyses of subterranean oniscidean isopods (Haloniscus), using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data derived from the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses provided evidence for significant phylogeographic structuring of isopod populations, with evidence for at least 24 divergent mtDNA lineages, each restricted in their distribution to a single calcrete aquifer. The high level of divergence among calcrete populations (generally > 25%) and several mtDNA lineages within calcretes (> 16%) suggests that each lineage is likely to represent a distinct species. These analyses, together with comparative phylogeographic data from dytiscid beetles and amphipods, provide strong support for the 'subterranean island' hypothesis, applying to both air-breathing and fully aquatic arthropod groups. The finding of several epigean lineages that grouped with stygobitic Haloniscus populations, and the overall phylogeographic structure of populations, suggests that the majority of stygobitic species evolved within individual calcretes following independent colonisation by epigean ancestors.

AB Water uptake by plant roots is a main process controlling water balance in field profiles and vital for agro-ecosystem management. Based on the sap flow measurements for maize plants (Zea mays L.) in a field under natural wet- and dry-soil conditions, we studied the effect of vertical root distribution on root water uptake and the resulted changes of profile soil water. The observations indicate that depth of the most densely rooted soil layer was more important than the maximum rooting depth for increasing the ability of plants to cope with the shortage of water. Occurrence of the most densely rooted layer at or below 30-cm soil depth was very conducive to maintaining plant water supply under the dry-soil conditions. In the soil layers colonized most densely by roots, daytime effective soil water saturation (S (e)) always dropped dramatically due to the high-efficient local water depletion. Restriction of the rooting depth markedly increased the difference of S (e) between the individual soil layers particularly under the dry-soil conditions due likely to the physical non-equilibrium of water flow between the layers. This study highlights the importance of root distribution and pattern in regulating soil water use and thereby improving endurance of plants to seasonal droughts for sustainable agricultural productivity.

AB We investigated the behavioural changes of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins Tursiops aduncus in response to boat-based tourism at both group and individual levels. The behaviour, movement and dive patterns of nursing females off the south coast of Zanzibar were investigated between January and March 2000 to 2002 and statistical comparisons were made between observations made at different levels of tourist activity. Behavioural data was collected during boat surveys using scan sampling of groups and focal individual follows of 5 female dolphins with calves. The movement patterns of dolphin groups were not affected by the presence of a few (1 to 2) tourist boats without swimmers. However, the groups displayed a significantly larger proportion of erratic (non-directional) movements as tourist activities increased and when swimmers were present. The proportion of active, peduncle, tail-out and porpoise dives also increased as tourist activity increased. Further, females travelled more frequently as tourist activities increased; this may have a negative effect on the time available for females to nurse their calves. Intense non-regulated dolphin tourism in this area may lead to a shift in habitat use by nursing females, and the apparent changes in dolphin behaviour due to the increased levels of tourism may ultimately reduce fitness at both individual and population levels. We urge that the guidelines already issued by the Department of Fisheries and Marine Products, Zanzibar, be implemented and complied with as a first important step towards sustainable dolphin tourism.

AB Understanding the phylogeographic processes affecting endangered species is crucial both to interpreting their evolutionary history and to the establishment of conservation strategies. Lions provide a key opportunity to explore such processes; however, a lack of genetic diversity and shortage of suitable samples has until now hindered such investigation. We used mitochondrial control region DNA (mtDNA) sequences to investigate the phylogeographic history of modern lions, using samples from across their entire range. We find the sub-Saharan African lions are basal among modern lions, supporting a single African origin model of modern lion evolution, equivalent to the 'recent African origin' model of modern human evolution. We also find the greatest variety of mtDNA haplotypes in the centre of Africa, which may be due to the distribution of that the modern lion may currently consist of three geographic populations on the basis of their recent evolutionary history: North African-Asian, southern African and middle African. Future conservation strategies should take these evolutionary subdivisions into consideration.

AB Interspecific differences in sapling growth responses to soil resources could influence species distributions across soil resource gradients. I calibrated models of radial growth as a function of light intensity and landscape-level variation in soil water and foliar N for saplings of four canopy tree species, which differ in adult distributions across soil resource gradients. Model formulations, characterizing different resource effects and modes of influencing growth, were compared based on relative empirical support using Akaike's Information Criterion. Contrary to expectation, the radial growth of species associated with lower fertility (Acer rubrum and Quercus rubra) was more sensitive to variation in soil resources than the high fertility species Acer saccharum. Moreover, there was no species tradeoff between growth under high foliar N versus growth under low foliar N, which would be expected if growth responses to foliar N mediated distributions. In general, there was functional consistency among species in growth responses to light, foliar N, and soil water availability, respectively. Foliar N influenced primarily high-light growth in F. grandifolia, A. rubrum, and Q. rubra (but was not significant for A. saccharum). In A. saccharum and A. rubrum, for which soil water availability was a significant predictor, soil water and light availability simultaneously limited growth (i.e., either higher light or water increased growth). Simple resource-based models explained 0.74-0.90 of growth variance, indicating a high degree of determinism. Results suggest that nitrogen effects on forest dynamics would be strongest in high-light early successional communities but that water availability influences growth in both early successional and understory environments.

ID SOIL; WINTER; ROOTS; YIELD
AB The aim of our experiments was to investigate whether nutrient deficiency or toxicity is the cause for growth inhibition of wheat and barley in waterlogged soils. Experiments using two soils (top and subsoil) differing largely in various characteristics revealed a growth inhibition of wheat and barley in the case of subsoil due to water logging, without Fe or Mn toxicity. Water culture experiments with anaerobic (N-2) and aerobic aeration confirmed that oxygen deficiency did not induce nutrient toxicity (Fe, Mn) but caused sub-optimum nutrient supply (N, P, K, Mn, Cu, Zn) of wheat and barley plants. In a split-root water culture experiment with barley, cultivating half of the root system in varying combinations of aerobic/anaerobic and with/without K supply, it was shown that sufficient K uptake occurred only when K and oxygen were applied in the same root compartment. We suggest that due to O-2 deficiency in the root medium, synthesis of ATP may be inhibited leading thus to a decrease in nutrient uptake. Nutrient deficiency rather than toxicity appears to be the major cause for the poor plant growth in waterlogged soils.

AB Because complete species inventories are expensive and time-consuming, scientists and land managers seek techniques to alleviate logistic constraints on measuring species richness, especially over large spatial scales. We developed a method to identify indicators of species richness that is applicable to any taxonomic group or ecosystem. In an initial case study, we found that a model based on the occurrence of five indicator species explained 88% of the deviance of species richness of 56 butterflies in a mountain range in western North America. We validated model predictions and spatial transferability of the model using independent, newly collected data from another, nearby mountain range. Predicted and observed values of butterfly species richness were highly correlated with 93% of the observed values falling within the 95% credible intervals of the predictions. We used a Bayesian approach to update the initial model with both the model-building and model-validation data sets. In the updated model, the effectiveness of three of the five indicator species was similar, whereas the effectiveness of two species was reduced. The latter species had more erratic distributions in the validation data set than in the original model-building data set. This objective method for identifying indicators of species richness could substantially enhance our ability to conduct large-scale ecological assessments of any group of animals or plants in any geographic region and to make effective conservation decisions.

AB Comprehensive long-term studies of isolated populations provide valuable comparative data that may be used to evaluate different methods for quantifying the relationship between genetic diversity and fitness. Here, we report on data collected from large and well-characterized cohorts of the two numerically dominant species of Darwin's finches on Isla Daphne Major, Galapagos, Ecuador - Geospiza fortis and G. scandens. Multilocus microsatellite (SSR) genetic diversity estimates (heterozygosity and (d) over bar (2)) and pedigree-based estimates of the inbreeding coefficient (f) were compared to each other and to two fitness components: lifespan and recruitment. In the larger sample of G. fortis, heterozygosity (H) was correlated with both fitness components, but no relationship was detected in the smaller sample of G. scandens. Analyses of the inbreeding coefficient detected highly significant relationships between f and recruitment, but no relationship between f and overall lifespan. The (d) over bar (2) statistic showed no relationship to either fitness component. When the two SSR-based estimators were compared to f, (d) over bar (2) was correlated with f in G. fortis in the predicted direction, while in G. scandens the relationship was positive. Multilocus heterozygosity was correlated with f in G. fortis but not in the G. scandens sample. A pedigree simulation demonstrated that the variation in true autozygosity can be large among individuals with the same level of inbreeding. This observation may supplement the interpretation of patterns relevant to the local (locus-specific) and general (genome-wide) effects hypotheses, which have been proposed to explain the mechanism responsible for associations between genetic diversity and fitness.

AB The effects were studied of both nitrogen and phosphorus limitation and irradiance on the performance and operation of photosynthesis in tomato leaves (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Plants were grown at low N, high N, low P or high P supply and at two irradiances. Using mature leaves, measurements were made of the irradiance dependencies of the relative quantum efficiencies of photosystems I and II, and of the rate of carbon dioxide fixation. Measurements were also made of foliar starch and chlorophyll concentrations. The results showed that photosynthetic light-harvesting and electron-transport activity acclimate to nutrient stress and growth irradiance such that the internal relationships between electron transport by photosystems I and II do not change; the linear relationship between Phi(PSII), and Phi(PSI) was not affected. It was also evident that under N stress photosynthesis was reduced by a decreased light absorption and by the decreased utilization of assimilates, while P stress mainly affected the carboxylation capacity. Under N stress foliar starch levels increased and the oxygen sensitivity of CO2 fixation decreased, whereas P stress resulted in decreased starch levels and increased oxygen sensitivity of CO2 fixation. The relationship between starch accumulation and oxygen sensitivity (increased starch correlated with decreased oxygen sensitivity) was always the same across the nutrient treatments. These results are consistent with N deprivation producing an increasing limitation of photosynthesis, possibly by feedback from the leaf carbohydrate pool, whereas, although P deprivation produces a decreased rate of CO2 fixation, this is accompanied by a increase in oxygen sensitivity, suggesting that feedback limitation is decreased under P stress.

AB The comparative-experimental approach uses identically designed, replicated experiments at different sites along environmental gradients in order to gain insight into the changing dynamics of communities with changing environmental conditions. Such studies reveal how ecological processes vary in intensity and interact to produce community structure. Early emphases were on the community consequences of shifting top-down impacts, competition and disturbance with environmental stress. Recent advances include the more precise quantification of gradients and thus a better understanding of species responses to the environment, and the revelation that bottom-up forces can vary significantly on within-region scales, with major consequences for the impact of top-down forces and thus community dynamics. Here the use of the method to examine the role of geographic location (coastal ecosystems in different hemispheres) and oceanographic conditions (upwelling vs downwelling) on these bottom-up/top-down linkages is advanced. We show that a bottom-up factor (prey recruitment) and a top-down effect (predation rate) vary consistently with oceanographic conditions within each coastal ecosystem, and also between geographic locations (New Zealand, Oregon). In general, both recruitment and predation rates are higher in Oregon. It is postulated that these differences are common responses to oceanographic variation, and that between-hemisphere differences result from the stronger and more persistent upwelling in the California Current ecosystem.

The likelihood ratio test allowed us to discriminate among different evolutionary hypotheses. The phylogeny of the six major HCV types was accurately inferred. and the final tree was rooted by reconstructing the hypothetical HCV common ancestor with the maximum likelihood method. The presence of phylogenetic noise and the relative nucleotide substitution rates in the different HCV genes were also examined. These results offer a general guideline for the future of HCV phylogenetic analysis and also provide important insights on HCV origin and evolution.

AB Long-term studies of hybrid zones can provide valuable insight into a number of questions that have long attracted the attention of evolutionists. These questions range from the stability and fate of hybrid zones to the relative fitness of hybrids. In this paper we report the results of a 14-year survey of the Allonemobius fasciatus-Allonemobius socius hybrid zone. Populations were collected intensively in 1986 and 1987 and then more sporadically through the end of the 1980s and throughout the 1990s. By documenting changes in the genetic composition of populations near and within the zone during this period of time we assessed: the strength of the reproductive isolation between the two species; the relative growth rates (which can be considered a surrogate of relative fitness) of genotype classes corresponding to hybrids and to pure species individuals; and, the power of single-year and multi-year measurements of relative growth rates to predict changes in the genetic composition of mixed populations through time. In brief, we found very large year-to-year variation in the relative growth rates of pure species and hybrid individuals. This variation may reflect the fact that both species are at the edge of their range and perhaps at the limits of their ability to deal with environmental perturbations. As a consequence of the variation, even multi-year estimates of relative growth rates often provided imprecise predictions regarding the future genotypic composition of mixed populations. Despite our limited ability to predict the dynamics of individual populations, some trends are apparent. A. socius, the southern species, has clearly increased in frequency along a transect through the Appalachian Mountains, indicating that the zone is moving north in this region. In contrast, the zone appeared to be more stable along the East Coast transect. Within mixed populations, character-index profiles are often bimodal and stable through time, indicating relatively strong reproductive isolation between the two species that is not being reinforced, nor is it breaking down.

AB 1. Detailed understanding of the specific physiology of sexes in dioecious species is required to explain patterns in gender dimorphism. Under controlled-environment conditions we tested the hypothesis that sexes of the dioecious tree holly Ilex aquifolium L. (Aquifoliaceae) differed in growth and long-term potential water-use efficiency, as measured by carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13), and that these differences were dependent on the environmental context.
   2. Patterns of response in Delta C-13 to the various combinations of light and water were gender-specific. Under more xeric conditions, females maintained significantly higher Delta C-13 than males.
   3. Female plants exhibited significantly greater relative diameter growth rates than male plants.
   4. As expected, Delta C-13 significantly increased with decreasing irradiance, and decreased with increasing limitation in water supply. Light and water effects were not independent, with a more pronounced drought effect in decreasing leaf Delta C-13 under unshaded than under shaded conditions.
   5. Our results suggest that between-sex differences in physiology are context-dependent. Future studies attempting to assess gender dimorphism should take more account of gender-specific interactions with the environment. Gender-specific efficiency in water use could play a decisive role in explaining gender differences in growth and ecological interactions.

AB The south-west Australian flora shows a diverse array of evolutionary patterns and exceptionally high species diversity. A significant component of this flora consists of relictual species which often have naturally fragmented and geographically restricted distributions. Many of these species appear to apportion significant levels of genetic diversity among populations. Diversity at both the population and species level presents a major challenge to the development of appropriate conservation strategies for this flora. To be effective these strategies should not only aim to preserve current levels of species diversity, but also consider intraspecific variation and the evolutionary and ecological processes associated with the generation and maintenance of that variation. The identification and characterisation of conservation units, based on population genetic structure and phylogeographic patterns within species, provide a useful basis upon which more general conservation principals can be developed for the maintenance of these processes. Population genetic structure and phylogeographic studies are used to show how conservation units can be identified in Lambertia orbifolia, Acacia anomala, Stylidium coroniforme, Stylidium nungarinense and Banksia cuneata, and taxa from a range of other genera. Determining conservation units in these taxa defines not only suitable units for their conservation but also the appropriate geographical scale for management. These findings indicate the potential this approach can have in determining strategies and priorities for the conservation of the south-west Australian flora.

AB Mitochondrial DNA control region sequences of spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) allowed us to investigate gene flow, genetic structure, and biogeographic relationships among these forest-dwelling birds of western North America. Estimates of gene flow based on genetic partitioning and the phylogeography of haplotypes indicate substantial dispersal within three long-recognized subspecies. However, patterns of individual phyletic relationships indicate a historical absence of gene flow among the subspecies, which are essentially monophyletic. The pattern of haplotype coalescence enabled us to identify the approximate timing and direction of a recent episode of gene flow from the Sierra Nevada to the northern coastal ranges. The three subspecies comprise phylogenetic species, and the northern spotted owl (S. o. caurina) is sister to a clade of California (S. o. occidentalis) plus Mexican spotted owls (S. o. lucida); this represents a novel biogeographic pattern within birds. The California spotted owl had substantially lower nucleotide diversity than the other two subspecies; this result is inconsistent with present patterns of population density. A causal explanation requires postulating a severe bottleneck or a selective sweep, either of which was confined to only one geographic region.

AB Plantago lanceolata and Trifolium repens were grown under ambient (400 mu mol. mol(-1)) and elevated (650 mu mol mol(-1)) atmospheric CO2 conditions. Plants were inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae and given a phosphorus supply in the form of bonemeal. Six sequential harvests were taken in order to determine whether the effect of elevated CO2 on internal mycorrhizal colonization and external hyphal production was independent of the stimulatory effect of elevated CO2 on plant growth. At a given time, elevated CO2 increased the percentage of root length colonized (RLC), the total length of colonized root and the external mycorrhizal hyphal (EMH) density and decreased the ratio of EMH to total length of colonized root. When plant size was taken into account, the CO2 effect on RLC and total length of colonized roof was greatly reduced land only apparent for early harvests in T. repens) and the effects on the EMH parameters disappeared. Root tissue P concentration was unchanged at elevated CO2, but there was a decrease in shoot P at the later harvests. There was no direct effect of elevated CO2 on P inflow for the earlier period (< 50 d) of the experiment. However, over the last period, there was a significant negative effect of elevated CO2 on P inflow for both species, independent of plant size. It is concluded that elevated CO2 had no direct effect on mycorrhizal colonization or external hyphal production, and that any observed effects on a time basis were due to faster growing plants at elevated CO2. However, for older plants, elevated CO2 had a direct negative effect on P inflow This decrease in P inflow coincides with the observed decrease in shoot P concentration. This is discussed in terms of downregulation of photosynthesis often seen in elevated CO2 grown plants, and the potential for mycorrhizas (via external hyphal turnover to alleviate the phenomenon. The direction for future research is highlighted, especially in relation to carbon flow to and storage in the soil.

AB Seahorses (Hippocampus spp) are heavily exploited in Vietnam, but conservation and management measures are currently limited by the ambiguous taxonomic definitions of the genus in the region. Seven species of seahorse are identified in this paper as inhabiting the coastal waters of Vietnam. We used morphometric and DNA sequence data (from the cytochrome b region of the mitochondrial genome) to delimit the species. Species descriptions are put forward and we provide illustrations and an identification key to the species. The species are provisionally assigned to Hippocampus spinosissimus Weber 1913, H, comes Cantor 1850, H. trimaculatus Leach 1814, H. kuda Bleeker 1852, H. kelloggi Jordan and Snyder 1902, H. mohnikei Bleeker 1854 and H. histrix Kaup 1856. The current level of confusion in seahorse nomenclature means that some of these distinct species in Vietnam (in particular H. spinosissimus, H. kuda H. kelloggi and H. mohnikei) may have to be renamed once a comprehensive. revision of the genus has been completed.

AB The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and margay (L. wiedii) are sister-species of Neotropical cats which evolved from a lineage that migrated into South America during the formation of the Panamanian land bridge 3-5 million years ago. Patterns of population genetic divergence of each species were studied by phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences in individuals sampled across the distribution of these taxa. Abundant genetic diversity and remarkably concordant phylogeographic partitions for both species were observed, identifying parallel geographic regions which likely reflect historical faunal barriers. Inferred aspects of phylogeography, population genetic structure, and demographic history were used to formulate conservation recommendations for these species. In addition, observed patterns of sequence variation provided insight into the molecular evolution of the mtDNA control region in closely related felids.

AB The distribution of nitrogen among compounds involved in photosynthesis varies in response to changes in environmental conditions such as photon flux density. However, the extent to which the nitrogen distribution within leaves adjusts in response to increased atmospheric CO2 is unclear.
   A model was used to determine the nitrogen distribution which maximises photosynthesis under realistic light regimes at both current and elevated levels of CO2, and a comparison was made with observed leaf nitrogen distributions reported in the literature.
   The model accurately predicted the distribution of nitrogen within the photosynthetic system for leaves grown at current levels of CO2, except at very high leaf nitrogen contents. The model predicted that, under a doubling of CO2 concentration from its current level, the ratio of electron transport capacity to Rubisco activity (J(max):V-cmax) should increase by 40%. In contrast, measurements of J(max):V-cmax taken from the literature show a slight but non-significant increase in response to an increase in CO2. The discrepancy between predicted and observed J(max):V-cmax suggests that leaf nitrogen distribution does not acclimate optimally to elevated CO2. Alternatively, the discrepancy may be due to effects of CO2 which the model fails to take into account, such as a possible decrease in the conductance to CO2 transfer between the intercellular spaces and the sites of carboxylation at elevated CO2.

AB Encrusting marine algae are found at all depths in the photic zone from polar to tropical seas worldwide, yet little is known about their ecology. Crusts (including red, brown, and green algae as well as lichens and Cyanobacteria) tend to predominate in areas of high disturbance (e.g. from herbivores or sand scour) or high stress (= low potential productivity, e.g. high on the shore). Patterns of crust and herbivore distribution and abundance were quantified in the intertidal zone in Washington state, and then the two environmental parameters predicted to be critical to among-crust variation in survival were manipulated: disturbance potential by varying abundances of herbivores, or by eliminating herbivores and artificially disturbing crusts with nylon and steel brushes; productivity potential by transplanting crusts along an environmental gradient from the high to the low intertidal zone and onto a submerged raft. Within-functional-group variation among crusts was studied by transplanting eight species (varying in calcification, thickness, tightness of construction, and other characters), and measuring their survival and growth over 2-3 yr in the different environments. Crusts varied widely in their responses to both disturbance and productivity potential. In general, thick, calcified, or very tightly constructed crusts withstood being steel-brushed at regular intervals. Nylon brushing sometimes actually benefitted these crusts relative to the controls (unbrushed but cleaned monthly), probably because of the reduction in fouling. In contrast, thinner or more loosely-constructed species showed poor survival when steel-brushed and often suffered significant losses even when nylon-brushed. Most crusts tended to do best in habitats having higher productivity potential (lower intertidal zone), showing mortality or reduced growth when transplanted into more stressful areas, although two species were healthiest under ''stressful'' conditions, i.e. desiccated or submerged in high pools. Experiments in the laboratory with herbivores (littorinid snails, limpets, and a chiton) demonstrated that they did not always consume the species that are mechanically easiest to remove (as indicated by the steel brushing experiments). Three species were avoided, including a brown known to contain high concentrations of phenolics, a blue-green crust, and a lichen with a blue-green phycobiont. All crusts grew very slowly, even in their optimal habitats; the fastest species grew laterally at < 20 mm/yr, and the slowest measurable at < 0.5 mm/yr. Some species showed no lateral growth over 2 yr. This low ability to sequester space, and their two-dimensional growth form, means that crusts often rely on grazers or other disturbance to keep from being overgrown. In other cases, they grow in areas where desiccation or low light levels apparently eliminate other algal forms. Crusts survive disturbance by either resisting it (through calcification or toughness), tolerating it (by being thick or regenerating rapidly), or avoiding it (by having an opportunistic life history, living in refugia such as crevices or high tidepools, or being unpalatable). Their life histories are highly variable, allowing them to exploit habitats in different ways.
   For example, in the mid intertidal zone in Washington the three dominant crust species include: (1) a fast-growing, frequently-recruiting brown (Ralfsia pacifica Hollenberg) that senesces after several years and sloughs away; (2) a fast-growing but rarely-recruiting red (''Petrocelis'') that lives for decades; and (3) a very slow-growing and rarely-recruiting red [Hildenbrandia rubra (Sommerfelt) Meneghini] that persists even when overgrown, and regenerates following disturbance. These diverse morphologies and life history strategies help make this morphology an ecological success.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizae participate in P uptake by maize (Zea mays L.). Previous studies using pot-grown plants have shown that P uptake by maize is greater when soil is not disturbed between cropping and planting. This study was conducted to determine if mycorrhizal colonization and shoot P absorption in the field are higher under reduced tillage, under conditions of soil fertility and tillage management representative of commercial farming. Maize was sampled in 1990 and 1991 from plots maintained under no-till (NT), and ridge tillage (RT). These were contrasted with maize from plots given moldboard plow (MP) tillage each year, which disturbs the soil to a greater extent. Plots were fertilized at recommended rates. In the early part of both years, shoot P concentration in NT and RT were significantly greater than under MP. These differences in shoot P did not persist after the six-leaf stage. Greater development of mycorrhizae in the early season was seen in the RT and NT systems relative to that in MP. There were no significant effects of tillage on final yield, possibly due to the relatively high soil P levels. Under NT and RT, arbuscular colonization had a maximum at 48 d after planting (DAP) of 55% and 60%, respectively, followed by a linear decrease to near 10% at 166 DAP. Under MP, a plateau of 45% arbuscular colonization was sustained between 48 and 97 DAP, followed by a linear decrease similar to that in NT and RT.

TI IMPROVEMENT OF STRUCTURAL STABILITY OF A CLAY LOAM WITH DRYING

DT Article

AB A stable soil structure is important to maintain agricultural productivity and reduce environmental pollution. This study was conducted to identify mechanisms by which structure is rendered more stable after short-term changes in cropping history. Changes in cropping systems were found to increase the response of soil structural stability on drying of a Brookston clay loam (mesic Typic Haplaquoll). Three years of bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) production following 20 y of continuous corn (Zea mays L.) improved the stability of aggregates > 0.25 mm as water content decreased. This increased response on drying was a primary factor in the short-term beneficial effect of bromegrass on stability and was attributed to organic material displaced using a tetraborate buffer at pH 9.4. The decrease in the dispersible-clay fraction with decreasing water content was unaffected by changes in cropping history, but the response of the dispersible-clay fraction to a change in water content also involved tetraborate-sensitive material.

AB We examined the relationships between soil factors, nutrients in grasses and foraging behaviour of wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) and zebra (Equus burchelli) in a semi-arid nature reserve in South Africa. We tested the hypotheses that: (1) Soil nutrient levels determine the abundance and distribution of grass species; (2) nutrient levels within grass species are correlated with soil nutrient levels; (3) the spatial distribution and diet composition of ungulates is influenced by the nutrient availability in grasses. The distribution of soil factors in upper ground levels did explain the differential abundance of grass species in the reserve. Ordination of nutrient levels in grass species showed high levels of particular nutrients in certain species, but no one species showed uniformly high levels of all nutrients. Moreover, grasses on fertile soils did not necessarily accumulate higher nutrient levels than grasses on poor soils. Thus, nutrient levels in grasses were not correlated with soil nutrient levels. Wildebeest and zebra responded to monthly variations in the levels of N and P in grasses by moving seasonally to habitat types characterized by grass communities containing a high proportion of nutritional species, rather than by selecting particularly nutritious species within communities. We suggest that within semi-arid savannas, areas with a higher diversity of grass communities will be more likely to have some of these communities containing high nutrient levels at any given season, than a lower diversity area. Therefore, the higher-diversity area would be likely to support more herbivores, and thus diversity would control carrying capacity.

AB One of the main manifestations of the Grain-for-Green Programme ( GFGP) is land use change, which will affect the trade-off of ecosystem services. Since the implementation of the GFGP in Dali Autonomous Prefecture in 2000, land use/cover has undergone dramatic changes. This study used the CLUE-S model to simulate land use change in 2030, and explored the spatial pattern and relationship of different ecosystem services under the four scenarios of GFGP. The results show that, GFGP can help to improve indirect services of ecosystems, such as carbon storage and soil conservation. However, direct services of the ecosystem will decline, such as food production and water yield. Compared with 2010, the overall supply level of the four ecosystem services is the most balanced in the moderate GFGP scenario. In this scenario, total food production decreased by 179,000 tons and water yield decreased by 57 million cubic meters. Carbon storage and soil conservation continued to grow, increasing by 21.86 million tons and 17.87 million tons, respectively. The changes of ecosystem services in the strong GFGP scenario are extreme. The increases in carbon storage and soil conservation are at the expense of a significant reduction in food production and water yield. It can be concluded that GFGP may lead to intensifying ecosystem services trade-offs. Through comparing the changes of ecosystem services under different GFGP scenarios, it is found that the implementation intensity of GFGP should be deeply concerned in policy making.

AB With the advent of Sentinel-2, it is now possible to generate large-scale chlorophyll content maps with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, suitable for monitoring ecological processes such as vegetative stress and/or decline. However methodological gaps exist for adapting this technology to heterogeneous natural vegetation and for transferring it among vegetation species or plan functional types. In this study, we investigated the use of Sentinel-2A imagery for estimating needle chlorophyll (Ca+b) in a sparse pine forest undergoing significant needle loss and tree mortality. Sentinel-2A scenes were acquired under two extreme viewing geometries (June vs. December 2016) coincident with the acquisition of high-spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery, and field measurements of needle chlorophyll content and crown leaf area index. Using the high-resolution hyperspectral scenes acquired over 61 validation sites we found the CI chlorophyll index R-750/R-710 and Macc index (which uses spectral bands centered at 680 nm, 710 nm and 780 nm) had the strongest relationship with needle chlorophyll content from individual tree crowns (r(2) = 0.61 and r(2) = 0.59, respectively; p < 0.001), while TCARI and TCARI/OSAVI, originally designed for uniform agricultural canopies, did not perform as well (r(2) = 0.21 and r(2) = 0.01, respectively). Using lower-resolution Sentinel-2A data validated against hyperspectral estimates and ground truth needle chlorophyll content, the red-edge index CI and the Sentinel-specific chlorophyll indices CI-Gitelson, NDRE1 and NDRE2 had the highest accuracy (with r(2) values > 0.7 for June and > 0.4 for December; p < 0.001). The retrieval of needle chlorophyll content from the entire Sentinel-2A handset using the radiative transfer model INFORM yielded r(2) = 0.71 (RMSE = 8.1 mu g/cm(2)) for June, r(2) = 0.42 (RMSE = 12.2 mu g/cm(2)) for December, and r(2) = 0.6 (RMSE = 10.5 mu g/cm(2)) as overall performance using the June and December datasets together. This study demonstrates the retrieval of leaf Ca+b with Sentinel-2A imagery by red-edge indices and by an inversion method based on a hybrid canopy reflectance model that accounts for tree density, background and shadow components common in sparse forest canopies.

AB Southeast Asia and southern China (SEA-SC) harbor a highly diverse and endemic flora and fauna that is under increasing threat. An understanding of the biogeographical history and drivers of this diversity is lacking, especially in some of the most diverse and threatened groups. The Asian leaf-litter frog genus Leptolalax Dubois 1980 is a forest-dependent genus distributed throughout SEA-SC, making it an ideal study group to examine specific biogeographic hypotheses. In addition, the diversity of this genus remains poorly understood, and the phylogenetic relationships among species of Leptolalax and closely related Leptobrachella Smith 1928 remain unclear. Herein, we evaluate species-level diversity based on 48 of the 53 described species from throughout the distribution of Leptolalax. Molecular analyses reveal many undescribed species, mostly in southern China and Indochina. Our well-resolved phylogeny based on multiple nuclear DNA markers shows that Leptolalax is not monophyletic with respect to Leptobrachella and, thus, we assign the former to being a junior synonym of the latter. Similarly, analyses reject monophyly of the two subgenera of Leptolalax. The diversification pattern of the group is complex, involving a high degree of sympatry and prevalence of microendemic species. Northern Sundaland (Borneo) and eastern Indochina (Vietnam) appear to have played pivotal roles as geographical centers of diversification, and paleoclimatic changes and tectonic movements seem to have driven the major divergence of clades. Analyses fail to reject an "upstream" colonization hypothesis, and, thus, the genus appears to have originated in Sundaland and then colonized mainland Asia. Our results reveal that both vicariance and dispersal are responsible for current distribution patterns in the genus.

AB Predicted impacts of climate change on crops-including yield declines and loss of conservation lands-could be mitigated by exploiting existing diversity within crops. Here we examine this possibility for wine grapes. Across 1,100 planted varieties, wine grapes possess tremendous diversity in traits that affect responses to climate, such as phenology and drought tolerance. Yet little of this diversity is exploited. Instead many countries plant 70-90% of total hectares with the same 12 varieties-representing 1% of total diversity. We outline these challenges, and highlight how altered planting practices and new initiatives could help the industry better adapt to continued climate change.

AB Genetic diversity underpins the ability of populations to persist and adapt to environmental changes. Substantial empirical data show that genetic diversity rapidly deteriorates in small and isolated populations due to genetic drift, leading to reduction in adaptive potential and fitness and increase in inbreeding. Assisted gene flow (e.g. via translocations) can reverse these trends, but lack of data on fitness loss and fear of impairing population uniqueness often prevents managers from acting. Here, we use population genetic and riverscape genetic analyses and simulations to explore the consequences of extensive habitat loss and fragmentation on population genetic diversity and future population trajectories of an endangered Australian freshwater fish, Macquarie perch Macquaria australasica. Using guidelines to assess the risk of outbreeding depression under admixture, we develop recommendations for population management, identify populations requiring genetic rescue and/or genetic restoration and potential donor sources. We found that most remaining populations of Macquarie perch have low genetic diversity, and effective population sizes below the threshold required to retain adaptive potential. Our simulations showed that under management inaction, smaller populations of Macquarie perch will face inbreeding depression within a few decades, but regular small-scale translocations will rapidly rescue populations from inbreeding depression and increase adaptive potential through genetic restoration. Despite the lack of data on fitness loss, based on our genetic data for Macquarie perch populations, simulations and empirical results from other systems, we recommend regular and frequent translocations among remnant populations within catchments. These translocations will emulate the effect of historical gene flow and improve population persistence through decrease in demographic and genetic stochasticity. Increasing population genetic connectivity within each catchment will help to maintain large effective population sizes and maximize species adaptive potential. The approach proposed here could be readily applicable to genetic management of other threatened species to improve their adaptive potential.

AB Natural populations are becoming increasingly fragmented which is expected to affect their viability due to inbreeding depression, reduced genetic diversity and increased sensitivity to demographic and environmental stochasticity. In small and highly inbred populations, the introduction of only a few immigrants may increase vital rates significantly. However, very few studies have quantified the long-term success of immigrants and inbred individuals in natural populations. Following an episode of natural immigration to the isolated, severely inbred Scandinavian wolf (Canis lupus) population, we demonstrate significantly higher pairing and breeding success for offspring to immigrants compared to offspring from native, inbred pairs. We argue that inbreeding depression is the underlying mechanism for the profound difference in breeding success. Highly inbred wolves may have lower survival during natal dispersal as well as competitive disadvantage to find a partner. Our study is one of the first to quantify and compare the reproductive success of first-generation offspring from migrants vs. native, inbred individuals in a natural population. Indeed, our data demonstrate the profound impact single immigrants can have in small, inbred populations, and represent one of very few documented cases of genetic rescue in a population of large carnivores.

AB Instream and floodplain wood can provide many benefits to river ecosystems, but can also create hazards for inhabitants, infrastructure, property, and recreational users in the river corridor. We propose a decision process for managing large wood, and particularly for assessing the relative benefits and hazards associated with individual wood pieces and with accumulations of wood. This process can be applied at varying levels of effort, from a relatively cursory visual assessment to more detailed numerical modeling. Decisions to retain, remove, or modify wood in a channel or on a floodplain are highly dependent on the specific context: the same piece of wood that might require removal in a highly urbanized setting may provide sufficient benefits to justify retention in a natural area or lower-risk urban setting. The proposed decision process outlined here can be used by individuals with diverse technical backgrounds and in a range of urban to natural river reaches so that opportunities for wood retention or enhancement are increased.

AB Fire size and fire severity are two crucial parameters for describing fire regimes that reflect spatial heterogeneities of fire spread behavior and its interaction with the environment. Determining how environmental controls regulate these two metrics of the fire regime is of critical importance for predicting response of fire to climate change and designing strategic fire management plans. Here, we evaluated influences and relative contributions of fire weather, topography, and vegetation on fire size and fire severity in a Chinese boreal forest ecosystem. We also compared how relative contributions vary along a continuous gradient of spatial scales using a moving-window resampling approach. Results showed fire weather was the dominant driving factor for fire size, while vegetation and topography exerted stronger influences on fire severity. Such relative influences on fire size and fire severity possessed different scale dependence. For fire size, small burns (<130 ha) were mainly constrained by vegetation as it accounted for nearly 43% relative importance, but larger burns (>200 ha) were more strongly influenced by extreme fire weather conditions, which accounted for more than 50% relative importance. In contrast, the relative importance of fire weather on fire severity was always less than 20% across the entire range of spatial scales, while relative contributions of vegetation were relatively stable and always greater than 45%. Our study suggests that fuel treatments may have little effect on reducing fire size in boreal forests, but may function to mitigate the severity of future fires. Vegetation type and terrain conditions are important factors to consider for improving efficiency of fuel management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The leaf economics spectrum (LES) describes a major axis of plant functional trait variation worldwide, defining suites of leaf traits aligned with resource-acquisitive to resource-conservative ecological strategies. The LES has been interpreted to arise from leaf-level trade-offs among ecophysiological traits common to all plants. However, it has been suggested that the defining leaf-level trade-offs of the LES may not hold within specific functional groups (e.g., herbs) nor within many groups of closely related species, which challenges the usefulness of the LES paradigm across evolutionary scales. Here, we examine the evolution of the LES across 28 species of the diverse herbaceous genus Helianthus (the sunflowers), which occupies a wide range of habitats and climate variation across North America. Using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we find repeated evolution of more resource-acquisitive LES strategies in cooler, drier, and more fertile environments. We also find macroevolutionary correlations among LES traits that recapitulate aspects of the global LES, but with one major difference: leaf mass per area is uncorrelated with leaf lifespan. This indicates that whole-plant processes likely drive variation in leaf lifespan across Helianthus, rather than leaf-level trade-offs. These results suggest that LES patterns do not reflect universal physiological trade-offs at small evolutionary scales.

AB As urbanization accelerates, urban biodiversity conservation is becoming a great concern for the maintenance of urban ecosystem functions. In particular, forest bird communities in urban areas have been recognized as a conservation target because of their functions in food webs and ecosystem services. But our understanding of which local- and landscape-scale factors influence native bird communities within urban green spaces is still insufficient to provide managers with information for effectively planning biodiversity management programs. Here we examine how local habitat characteristics, human disturbance, and habitat connectivity influence the diversity of forest bird communities in 44 small forest patches (0.5-20.0 ha) embedded in an urbanized landscape. Patch size exerted a positive influence on the diversity of most bird functional groups, and it had the greatest effects on total abundance and species richness. The second most important factor was human disturbance. Remnant patches with lower levels of human disturbance had higher diversity than newly established patches where intense human activities occurred more frequently. In addition, vegetation complexity and habitat connectivity were positively related to total species richness and abundance, respectively, but they were less important. Management strategies for the conservation of urban forest birds, therefore, should consider not only local improvements in habitat structure - through increased patch size, reduced human disturbance, and increased vegetation complexity - but also the maintenance of habitat connectivity.

AB Urban greenspace provides myriad ecosystem services. To fully understand the ecological services provided by urban greenspace, it is crucial to first accurately quantify the composition and configuration, and change of urban greenspace.
   (1) Quantify the dynamics of greenspace in highly urbanized areas. (2) Compare and evaluate the efficacy of medium and high resolution image data on quantifying urban greenspace dynamics.
   Using two very well-developed urban districts of Beijing, we compare and contrast the changes in urban greenspace from 2005 to 2009 based on two different datasets, the most commonly used Landsat TM data with 30 m resolution, and 2.5 m high spatial resolution imagery.
   We found urban greenspace in the two well-developed urban districts of Beijing to be very dynamic, in contrast to findings from previous research that greenspace in inner cities tends to remain largely unchanged. Such dynamics, however, could only be revealed by high spatial resolution imagery because medium resolution data, such as TM data greatly underestimated the percent cover of greenspace. The underestimate neglects smaller elements of greenspace as well as changes in configuration of larger patches, limiting the ability of TM data to detect such changes.
   Our results underscore the importance and necessity of using high spatial resolution data to adequately quantify the distribution of urban greenspace and its change. Results from this study have important implications for urban greenspace management and planning. In addition, the dynamics revealed support emerging conceptions of urban areas as hierarchical patch mosaics.

AB Three decades of study have revealed dozens of examples in which natural systems have crossed biophysical thresholds ('tipping points')-nonlinear changes in ecosystem structure and function-as a result of human-induced stressors, dramatically altering ecosystem function and services. Environmental management that avoids such thresholds could prevent severe social, economic and environmental impacts. Here, we review management measures implemented in ecological systems that have thresholds. Using Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework, we analysed key biophysical and institutional factors associated with 51 social-ecological systems and associated management regimes, and related these to management success defined by ecological outcomes. We categorized cases as instances of prospective or retrospective management, based upon whether management aimed to avoid a threshold or to restore systems that have crossed a threshold. We find that smaller systems are more amenable to threshold-based management, that routine monitoring is associated with successful avoidance of thresholds and recovery after thresholds have been crossed, and that success is associated with the explicit threshold-based management. These findings are powerful evidence for the policy relevance of information on ecological thresholds across a wide range of ecosystems.

AB Fencing with grazing exclusion is an effective grassland restoration and management practice used to achieve sustainability of grassland ecosystems worldwide. However, how the fencing with grazing exclusion affects ecosystem services related to carbon and nitrogen dynamics in grassland ecosystems has remained controversial over the past two decades. We investigated plant biomass, diversity and function groups, as well as soil bulk density, pH, soil carbon and nitrogen contents and the carbon/nitrogen ratio within the upper 0-1 m soil layer in fenced grassland with grazing exclusion and in grazed grassland on the Loess Plateau (China) in 2012 and 2013. We estimated the carbon and nitrogen pools of the plants and soils to determine how the grazing exclusion affected them. Results showed that soil carbon content in the topsoil, plant biomass and diversity, and grasses increased, while bulk density, pH and forbs decreased after grazing exclusion. The increases in soil carbon content, the cumulative organic carbon pool and the rate of change in the cumulative organic carbon pool mainly occurred in the upper 20 cm soil layer after 8 years of grazing exclusion. Our study suggested that the 8-year grazing exclusion had a great influence on the carbon pools, but there were no changes in the soil nitrogen pool. Identifying the main factors that affect the carbon and nitrogen dynamics after grazing exclusion among the soil and plant properties should be given more attention in future studies.

AB Despite microbes' key roles in driving biogeochemical cycles, the mechanism of microbe-mediated feedbacks to global changes remains elusive. Recently, soil transplant has been successfully established as a proxy to simulate climate changes, as the current trend of global warming coherently causes range shifts toward higher latitudes. Four years after southward soil transplant over large transects in China, we found that microbial functional diversity was increased, in addition to concurrent changes in microbial biomass, soil nutrient content and functional processes involved in the nitrogen cycle. However, soil transplant effects could be overridden by maize cropping, which was attributed to a negative interaction. Strikingly, abundances of nitrogen and carbon cycle genes were increased by these field experiments simulating global change, coinciding with higher soil nitrification potential and carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux. Further investigation revealed strong correlations between carbon cycle genes and CO2 efflux in bare soil but not cropped soil, and between nitrogen cycle genes and nitrification. These findings suggest that changes of soil carbon and nitrogen cycles by soil transplant and cropping were predictable by measuring microbial functional potentials, contributing to a better mechanistic understanding of these soil functional processes and suggesting a potential to incorporate microbial communities in greenhouse gas emission modeling.

AB Halyomorpha halys has recently established in countries outside of its Asian area of origin. In the North Eastern USA, this pest causes severe economic loss in agricultural crops. Breeding populations have been confirmed in Switzerland and Canada; however, their pathways of entry and genetic diversity remain unknown. To determine invasion pathways and source population(s), the diversity of specimens from Asia, North America, and Europe was investigated. Genetic diversity in Asia was higher than that in the Canada and Switzerland. Although three haplotypes were detected among Canadian H. halys, one haplotype dominated. In contrast, two out of three haplotypes were found frequently among Swiss samples. Based on molecular data and interception records it appears likely that H. halys in Canada is derived from the movement of established US populations. Further, North American populations likely originated from the Hebei/Beijing regions of China. The area of origin of the Swiss samples remains unclear. Although the dominant haplotype in Switzerland was consistent with Asian samples collected in the Hebei and Beijing provinces, it was not the dominant haplotype in these regions and further sampling is necessary to its confirm the distribution and abundance in the area of origin. The remaining two haplotypes were unique to Switzerland and no matches were found among our Asian samples. Interestingly, no haplotypes were shared between the North American and Swiss samples, indicating that the two invasions were separate and distinct events and did not result from the movement of goods and materials between USA and Europe.

AB As proposed by Darwin, climbers have been assumed to allocate a smaller fraction of biomass to support organs in comparison with self-supporting plants. They have also been hypothesized to possess a set of traits associated with fast growth, resource uptake and high productivity.
   In this review, these hypotheses are evaluated by assembling and synthesizing published and unpublished data sets from across the globe concerning resource allocation, growth rates and traits of leaves, stems and roots of climbers and self-supporting species.
   The majority of studies offer little support for the smaller allocation of biomass to stems or greater relative growth rates in climbers; however, these results are based on small sized (1 kg) plants. Simulations based on allometric biomass equations demonstrate, however, that larger lianas allocate a greater fraction of above-ground biomass to leaves (and therefore less biomass to stems) compared with similar sized trees. A survey of leaf traits of lianas revealed their lower average leaf mass per area (LMA), higher N and P concentration and a slightly higher mass-based photosynthetic rate, as well as a lower concentration of phenolic-based compounds than in woody self-supporting species, consistent with the specialization of lianas towards the fast metabolism/rapid turnover end of the global trait spectra. Liana stems have an efficient hydraulic design and unique mechanical features, while roots appear to penetrate deeper soil levels than in trees and are often able to generate hydraulic pressure. Much remains to be learned, however, about these and other functional specializations of their axial organs and the associated trade-offs. Developmental switches between self-supporting, searcher and climbing shoots within the same individual are a promising field of comparative studies on trait association in lianas. Finally, some of the vast trait variability within lianas may be reduced when species with different climbing mechanisms are considered separately, and when phylogenetic conservatism is accounted for.

AB Predicting climate-driven changes in plant distribution is crucial for biodiversity conservation and management under recent climate change. Climate warming is expected to induce movement of species upslope and towards higher latitudes. However, the mechanisms and physiological processes behind the altitudinal and latitudinal distribution range of a tree species are complex and depend on each tree species features and vary over ontogenetic stages. We investigated the altitudinal distribution differences between juvenile and adult individuals of seven major European tree species along elevational transects covering a wide latitudinal range from southern Spain (37 degrees N) to northern Sweden (67 degrees N). By comparing juvenile and adult distributions (shifts on the optimum position and the range limits) we assessed the response of species to present climate conditions in relation to previous conditions that prevailed when adults were established. Mean temperature increased by 0.86 degrees C on average at our sites during the last decade compared with previous 30-year period. Only one of the species studied, Abies alba, matched the expected predictions under the observed warming, with a maximum abundance of juveniles at higher altitudes than adults. Three species, Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris, showed an opposite pattern while for other three species, such as Quercus ilex, Acer pseudoplatanus and Q. petraea, we were no able to detect changes in distribution. These findings are in contrast with theoretical predictions and show that tree responses to climate change are complex and are obscured not only by other environmental factors but also by internal processes related to ontogeny and demography.

AB Background: Pleistocene climatic oscillations have played a major role in structuring present-day biodiversity. The southern Mediterranean peninsulas have long been recognized as major glacial refugia, from where Northern Europe was post-glacially colonized. However, recent studies have unravelled numerous additional refugia also in northern regions. We investigated the phylogeographic pattern of the widespread Western Palaearctic lizard Podarcis muralis, using a range-wide multilocus approach, to evaluate whether it is concordant with a recent expansion from southern glacial refugia or alternatively from a combination of Mediterranean and northern refugia.
   Results: We analyzed DNA sequences of two mitochondrial (cytb and nd4) and three nuclear (acm4, mc1r, and pdc) gene fragments in individuals from 52 localities across the species range, using phylogenetic and phylogeographic methods. The complex phylogeographic pattern observed, with 23 reciprocally monophyletic allo- parapatric lineages having a Pleistocene divergence, suggests a scenario of long-term isolation in multiple ice-age refugia across the species distribution range. Multiple lineages were identified within the three Mediterranean peninsulas Iberia, Italy and the Balkans - where the highest genetic diversity was observed. Such an unprecedented phylogeographic pattern - here called "refugia within all refugia" - compasses the classical scenario of multiple southern refugia. However, unlike the southern refugia model, various distinct lineages were also found in northern regions, suggesting that additional refugia in France, Northern Italy, Eastern Alps and Central Balkans allowed the long-term persistence of this species throughout Pleistocene glaciations.
   Conclusions: The phylogeography of Podarcis muralis provides a paradigm of temperate species survival in Mediterranean and extra-Mediterranean glacial refugia. Such refugia acted as independent biogeographic compartments for the long-term persistence of this species, for the differentiation of its genetic lineages, and for the short-distance post-glacial re-colonization of neighbouring areas. This finding echoes previous findings from recent phylogeographic studies on species from temperate ecoregions, thus suggesting the need for a reappraisal of the role of northern refugia for glacial persistence and post-glacial assembly of Holarctic biota.

AB Lianas are an important growthform in tropical forests, and liana abundance and biomass may be increasing in some regions. Explanations for liana proliferation hinge upon physiological responses to changing resource conditions that would favour them over trees. Testing a chemical basis for such responses, we assessed 22 foliar traits in 778 lianas and 6496 trees at 48 tropical forest sites. Growthform differences in chemical allocation occurred on a leaf mass and area basis. Light capture-growth and maintenance-metabolism chemicals averaged 14.5 and 16.7% higher mass-based concentration in lianas than in trees globally, whereas structure and defence chemicals averaged 9.0% lower in lianas. Relative differences in chemical allocation by lianas and trees were mediated by climate with peak differences at about 2500 similar to mm similar to year-1 and 25 similar to degrees C. Differences in chemical traits suggest that liana expansion could be greatest in forests undergoing increased canopy-level irradiance via disturbance and climate change.

AB The effects of overexpression of Rubisco activase on photosynthesis were studied in transgenic rice expressing barley or maize Rubisco activase. Immunoblot and SDS-PAGE analyses showed that transgenic lines from both gene constructs expressed the foreign Rubisco activase at high levels. The activation state of Rubisco in transgenic lines was slightly higher than that in non-transgenic plants (NT). In addition, light activation of Rubisco was significantly more rapid in transgenic lines compared with NT. These findings indicate that the overexpression of Rubisco activase can enhance Rubisco activation. However, despite enhanced activation of Rubisco in these transgenic plants, the CO2 assimilation rate at ambient CO2 conditions was decreased. This decrease in CO2 assimilation rate was observed in both young developing and mature leaves independent of nitrogen nutrition. The contents of nitrogen and Chl did not differ significantly between transformants and NT; however, Rubisco content was substantially decreased in transgenic lines. There was no evidence for reduced transcription of RbcS or RbcL in these transgenic lines; in fact, transcript levels were marginally increased compared with NT. These results indicate that the overexpression of Rubisco activase leads to a decrease in Rubisco content, possibly due to post-transcriptional mechanisms.

AB Genetic rescue is a management intervention whereby a small population is supplemented with individuals from other populations in an attempt to reverse the effects of inbreeding and increased genetic load. One such rescue was recently documented in the population of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) within the National Bison Range wildlife refuge (Montana, USA). Here, we examine the locus-specific effects of rescue in this population using a newly developed genome-wide set of 195 microsatellite loci and first-generation linkage map. We found that the rate of introgression varied among loci and that 111 loci, 57% of those examined, deviated from patterns of neutral inheritance. The most common deviation was an excess of homozygous genotypes relative to neutral expectations, indicative of directional selection. As in previous study of this rescue, individuals with more introduced alleles had higher reproductive success and longevity. In addition, we found 30 loci, distributed throughout the genome, which seem to have individual effects on these life history traits. Although the potential for outbreeding depression is a major concern when translocating individuals between populations, we found no evidence of such effects in this population.

AB Assisted migration has been proposed as one tool to reduce some of the negative ecological consequences of climate change. The idea is to move species to locations that could better suit them climatically in the future. Although human-mediated movements are not a recent phenomenon, assisted migration has lately been the source of debate, in particular within conservation biology circles. In this paper, we outline the major perspectives that help define differing views on assisted migration and shed some light on the ethical roots of the debate in the context of Canadian forests. We emphasize that there are many different forms of assisted migration, each responding to different (often unstated) objectives and involving unique risks and benefits, thus making the debate more nuanced than often portrayed. We point out certain seeming contradictions whereby the same argument may be used to both support and oppose assisted migration. The current debate on assisted migration primarily focuses on ecological risks and benefits; however, numerous uncertainties reduce our capacity to quantitatively assess these outcomes. In fact, much of the debate can be traced back to fundamental perspectives on nature, particularly to the ethical question of whether to deliberately manage natural systems or allow them to adapt on their own. To facilitate discussion, we suggest that the focus should move towards a clearer identification of values and objectives for assisted migration.

AB We conducted interviews of a representative sample of 106 retired fishers in Italy, Spain and Greece, asking specific questions about the trends they perceived in dolphin and shark abundances between 1940 and 1999 (in three 20 year periods) compared to the present abundance. The large marine fauna studied were not target species of the commercial fleet segment interviewed (trawl fishery). The fishers were asked to rank the perceived abundance in each period into qualitative ordinal classes based on two indicators: frequency of sightings and frequency of catches (incidental or intentional) of each taxonomic group. The statistical analysis of the survey results showed that both incidental catches and the sighting frequency of dolphins have decreased significantly over the 60+ years of the study period (except for in Greece due to the recent population increase). This shows that fishers' perceptions are in agreement with the declining population trends detected by scientists. Shark catches were also perceived to have diminished since the early 1940s for all species. Other long-lived Mediterranean marine fauna (monk seals, whales) were at very low levels in the second half of the 20(th) century and no quantitative data could be obtained. Our study supports the results obtained in the Mediterranean and other seas that show the rapid disappearance (over a few decades) of marine fauna. We show that appropriately designed questionnaires help provide a picture of animal abundance in the past through the valuable perceptions of fishers. This information can be used to complement scientific sources or in some cases be taken as the only information source for establishing population trends in the abundance of sensitive species.

ID PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE; HERBARIUM RECORDS; ACCURACY; RANGE
AB We explored the effect of varying pseudo-absence data in species distribution modelling using empirical data for four real species and simulated data for two imaginary species. In all analyses we used a fixed study area, a fixed set of environmental predictors and a fixed set of presence observations. Next, we added pseudo-absence data generated by different sampling designs and in different numbers to assess their relative importance for the output from the species distribution model. The sampling design strongly influenced the predictive performance of the models while the number of pseudo-absences had minimal effect on the predictive performance. We attribute much of these results to the relationship between the environmental range of the pseudo-absences (i.e. the extent of the environmental space being considered) and the environmental range of the presence observations (i.e. under which environmental conditions the species occurs). The number of generated pseudo-absences had a direct effect on the predicted probability, which translated to different distribution areas. Pseudo-absence observations that fell within grid cells with presence observations were purposely included in our analyses. We discourage the practice of excluding certain pseudo-absence data because it involves arbitrary assumptions about what are (un)suitable environments for the species being modelled.

AB Refugia featured prominently in shaping evolutionary trajectories during repeated cycles of glaciation in the Quaternary, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. The Southern Hemisphere instead experienced cycles of severe aridification but little is known about the temporal presence and role of refugia for arid-adapted biota. Isolated mountain ranges located in the Australian arid zone likely provided refugia for many species following Mio/Pliocene (< 15 Ma) aridification; however, the evolutionary consequences of the recent development of widespread sand deserts is largely unknown. To test alternative hypotheses of ancient vs. recent isolation, we generated a 10 gene data set to assess divergence history among saxicolous geckos in the genus Heteronotia that have distributions confined to major rocky ranges in the arid zone. Phylogenetic analyses show that each rocky range harbours a divergent lineage, and substantial intraspecific diversity is likely due to topographic complexity in these areas. Old divergences (similar to 4 Ma) among lineages pre-date the formation of the geologically young sand deserts (< 1 Ma), suggesting that Pliocene climate shifts fractured the distributions of biota long before the spread of the deserts.

AB We present a novel approach to the statistical analysis and prediction of multispecies data. The approach allows the simultaneous grouping and quantification of multiple species' responses to environmental gradients. The underlying statistical model is a finite mixture model, where mixing is performed over the individual species' responses to environmental gradients. Species; with similar responses are grouped with minimal information loss. We term these groups species archetypes. Each species archetype has an associated GLM that can be used to predict distributions with appropriate measures of uncertainty. Initially, we illustrate the concept and method using artificial data and then with application to real data comprising 200 species from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon on 13 oceanographic and geological gradients from 12 degrees S to 24 degrees S. The 200 species from the GBR are well represented by 15 species archetypes. The model is interpreted through maps of the probability of presence for a fine scale set of locations throughout the study area. Maps of uncertainty are also produced to pro vide statistical context. The presence of each species archetype was strongly influenced by oceanographic gradients, principally temperature, oxygen and salinity. The number of species in each group ranged from 4 to 34. The method has potential application to the analysis of multispecies distribution patterns and for multispecies management. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Seasonal timing of life-history events is often under strong natural selection. The Clock gene is a central component of an endogenous circadian clock that senses changes in photoperiod (day length) and mediates seasonal behaviours. Among Pacific salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.), seasonal timing of migration and breeding is influenced by photoperiod. To expand a study of 42 North American Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations, we tested whether duplicated Clock genes contribute to population differences in reproductive timing. Specifically, we examined geographical variation along a similar latitudinal gradient in the polyglutamine domain (PolyQ) of OtsClock1a and OtsClock1b among 53 populations of three species: chum (Oncorhynchus keta), coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). We found evidence for variable selection on OtsClock1b that corresponds to latitudinal variation in reproductive timing among these species. We evaluated the contribution of day length and a freshwater migration index to OtsClock1b PolyQ domain variation using regression trees and found that day length at spawning explains much of the variation in OtsClock1b allele frequency among chum and Chinook, but not coho and pink salmon populations. Our findings suggest that OtsClock1b mediates seasonal adaptation and influences geographical variation in reproductive timing in some of these highly migratory species.

AB Land-use changes have strong impacts on biological communities. Among them, land abandonment is threatening a large number of conservation-concern species associated with semi-natural habitats shaped by 'traditional' farming. We focused on the red-backed shrike as a model for investigating the effect of land abandonment on a threatened bird species, and used historical data to model dynamic scenarios. We explored variations in habitat suitability from the 1950s to the present and predicted possible future variations. After investigating local habitat preferences of the species, we formulated a spatially explicit model of habitat suitability for shrikes according to current land-use types; then, we evaluated past habitat suitability, by applying the model to three known past scenarios, and simulated the habitat changes after land abandonment. By combining a habitat-association approach with past and future land use scenarios, we assessed and predicted the effects of habitat changes caused by abandonment. Shrike occurrence was favoured by the cover of four types of grassland and of shrubland with trees, and negatively affected by broadleaved woodlands. The current average habitat suitability is less than half of what it was in the 1950s. Future predictions in a complete abandonment scenario suggest that important decrease could be expected 10 or 20 years after abandonment, and that after 30 years the red-backed shrike would be completely extinct. Alternative scenarios involving partial abandonment suggested that subsidy policies may mitigate the effects of abandonment. Knowing land-use dynamics allowed the exploration of effects of land-use changes and corroborated the importance of low-intensity farming for conservation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bathymodiolinae mussels have been used as a biological model to better understand the evolutionary origin of faunas associated with deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. Most studies to date, however, have sampled with a strong bias towards vent and seep species, mainly because of a lack of knowledge of closely related species from organic falls. Here we reassess the species diversity of deep-sea mussels using two genes and a large taxon sample from the South-Western Pacific. This new taxonomic framework serves as a basis for a phylogenetic investigation of their evolutionary history. We first highlight an unexpected allopatric pattern and suggest that mussels usually reported from organic falls are in fact poorly specialized with regard to their environment. This challenges the adaptive scenarios proposed to explain the diversification of the group. Second, we confirm that deep-sea mussels arose from organic falls and then colonized hydrothermal vents and cold seeps in multiple events. Overall, this study constitutes a new basis for further phylogenetic investigations and a global systematic revision of deep-sea mussels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Hierarchical partitioning (HP) is an analytical method of multiple regression that identifies the most likely causal factors while alleviating multicollinearity problems. Its use is increasing in ecology and conservation by its usefulness for complementing multiple regression analysis. A public-domain software "hier.part package'' has been developed for running HP in R software. Its authors highlight a "minor rounding error'' for hierarchies constructed from >9 variables, however potential bias by using this module has not yet been examined. Knowing this bias is pivotal because, for example, the ranking obtained in HP is being used as a criterion for establishing priorities of conservation.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Using numerical simulations and two real examples, we assessed the robustness of this HP module in relation to the order the variables have in the analysis. Results indicated a considerable effect of the variable order on the amount of independent variance explained by predictors for models with >9 explanatory variables. For these models the nominal ranking of importance of the predictors changed with variable order, i.e. predictors declared important by its contribution in explaining the response variable frequently changed to be either most or less important with other variable orders. The probability of changing position of a variable was best explained by the difference in independent explanatory power between that variable and the previous one in the nominal ranking of importance. The lesser is this difference, the more likely is the change of position.
   Conclusions/Significance: HP should be applied with caution when more than 9 explanatory variables are used to know ranking of covariate importance. The explained variance is not a useful parameter to use in models with more than 9 independent variables. The inconsistency in the results obtained by HP should be considered in future studies as well as in those already published. Some recommendations to improve the analysis with this HP module are given.

AB The genus Littoraria is one of very few molluscan groups that are closely associated with mangroves. We document its global evolutionary radiation and compare biogeographic patterns with those of mangrove plants, based on phylogenetic and fossil evidence. Using sequences from three genes (nuclear 28S rRNA, mitochondrial 12S rRNA and COI) we reconstruct a phylogeny of 37 of the 39 living morphospecies. Six monophyletic subgenera are defined (Bulimilittorina, Lamellilitorina, Littoraria, Palustorina, Protolittoraria, Littorinopsis) and we synonymize L. coccinea and L. glabrata. A deep division between Palustorina from the Indo-West Pacific and Littoraria from the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific is estimated by a Bayesian relaxed-clock method to be of Middle Eocene to Palaeocene age (43.2-62.7 Ma), which far predates the Early Miocene (18 Ma) closure of the Tethyan Seaway; this, as in mangrove plants, may reflect vicariance by climatic cooling, rather than tectonic processes. The age of Littoraria angulifera in the Atlantic is, however, consistent with Early Miocene vicariance of a Tethyan ancestor. We infer that speciation events are mainly of Miocene or older age, and that diversification has not been driven by depletion of mangrove habitats during recent glacial intervals. Parsimonious reconstruction of ancestral habitats suggests that the genus has inhabited mangrove or wood substrates since its origin, while the rock-dwelling habit of the four members of Protolittoraria is derived. Three species span the Eastern Pacific Barrier, and one is amphi-Atlantic, consistent with a long larval phase of up to 10 weeks. Allopatric speciation is inferred, but usually with subsequent range overlap. Ovoviviparity (interpreted as an adaptation to life in mangroves) has arisen twice. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Kin selection plays an important role in the evolution of social behaviour in terrestrial systems. The extent to which kin selection influences the evolution of social behaviour in marine systems is largely unexplored. Generally, it is considered that kin selection is irrelevant in marine systems, because it is assumed that the dispersing larval phase of marine organisms will break up kin associations. Here, we challenge this assumption and investigate the opportunity for kin selection in a coral reef fish: the humbug damselfish Dascyllus aruanus. This fish lives in groups composed of a large male and a number of smaller females and nonbreeders. We use 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci to assess the relatedness of 265 individuals from 35 groups. The mean coefficient of relatedness among group members is 0.01 +/- 0.04, suggesting that individuals are not associated with close relatives. However, the distribution of pairwise relatedness of individuals within groups has an overabundance of positive values, and indicates that there might be 35 pairs of close relatives within groups. Further analyses reveal that close relatives likely are similar in size and small in size, suggesting that they might have recruited together. We conclude that it is possible for kin selection to operate in D. aruanus, but kin recognition will be a prerequisite for such selection. This study reveals that individuals can be associated with close relatives, and there is a hidden potential for kin selection, during certain parts of the life cycle of coral reef fishes.

AB Metapopulation theory predicts that species richness and total population density of habitat specialists increase with increasing area and regional connectivity of the habitat. To test these predictions, we examined the relative contributions of habitat patch area, connectivity of the regional habitat network and local habitat quality to species richness and total density of butterflies and day-active moths inhabiting semi-natural grasslands. We studied butterflies and moths in 48 replicate landscapes situated in southwest Finland, including a focal patch and the surrounding network of other semi-natural grasslands within a radius of 1.5 km from the focal patch. By applying the method of hierarchical partitioning, which can distinguish between independent and joint contributions of individual explanatory variables, we observed that variables of the local habitat quality (e.g. mean vegetation height and nectar plant abundance) generally showed the highest independent effect on species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. Habitat area did not show a significant independent contribution to species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. The effect of habitat connectivity was observed only for total density of the declining butterflies and moths. These observations indicate that the local habitat quality is of foremost importance in explaining variation in species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. In addition, declining butterflies and moths have larger populations in well-connected networks of semi-natural grasslands. Our results suggest that, while it is crucial to maintain high-quality habitats by management, with limited resources it would be appropriate to concentrate grassland management and restoration to areas with well-connected grassland networks in which the declining species currently have their strongest populations.

AB Roads often negatively affect terrestrial wildlife, via habitat loss or fragmentation, noise, and direct mortality. We studied moose (Alces alces) behavior relative to a road network, in an area with a history of moose-vehicle accidents, to determine when moose were crossing roadways or using areas near roads and to investigate if environmental factors were involved in this behavior. We tracked 47 adult moose with Global Positioning System collars in a study area crossed by highways and forest roads. We hypothesized that moose would avoid crossing roads but would make occasional visits to roadsides to feed on sodium-rich vegetation and avoid biting insects. Further, we expected moose avoidance to be greater for highways than forest roads. We recorded 196,710 movement segments but only observed 328 highway and 1,172 forest-road crossings (16 and 10 times lower than expected by chance). Moose usually avoided road proximity up to >= 500 in on each side but 20% of collared moose made visits to areas within 50 in of highways, which might have resulted from moose searching for sodium in vegetation and roadside salt pools. In fact, vegetation along highways had higher sodium concentrations and was browsed in similar proportions to vegetation in adjacent forest, despite moose avoidance of these zones. Moose, however, did not use areas near roads more during periods of biting insect abundance. Our results supported the hypothesis of scale-dependent selection by moose; avoidance of highways at a coarse scale may confer long-term benefits, whereas selection of highway corridors at finer scales may be part of a strategy to overcome short-term limiting factors such as sodium deficiency. We found a positive relationship between home-range size and the proportion of road axes they contained, Suggesting that moose either compensated for habitat loss or made specific movements along highways to gather sodium. The presence of sodium along highways likely increases moose-vehicle accident risks. Removal of salt pools or use of a de-icing salt other than sodium chloride should render highway surroundings less attractive to moose.

AB The common carp Cyprinus carpio is widely distributed and frequently considered a nuisance species outside its native range. Common carp are abundant in Clear Lake., Iowa, where their presence is both a symptom of degradation and an impediment to improving water quality and the sport fishery. We used radiotelemetry to quantify seasonal distribution, aggregation, and habitat selection of adult and subadult common carp in Clear Lake during 2005-2006 in an effort to guide future control strategies. Over a 22-month period, we recorded 1,951 locations of 54 adults and 60 subadults implanted with radio transmitters. Adults demonstrated a clear tendency to aggregate in an offshore area during the late fall and winter and in shallow, vegetated areas before and during spring spawning. Late-fall and winter aggregations were estimated to include a larger percentage of the tracked adults than spring aggregations. Subadults aggregated in shallow, vegetated areas during the spring and early summer. Our study, when considered in combination with previous research, suggests repeatable patterns of distribution, aggregation, and habitat selection that should facilitate common carp reduction programs in Clear Lake and similar systems.

AB Urban developments and road networks extend their impacts on the surrounding habitats along a variable distance, affecting birds living in natural environments. This study identifies the threshold distances upon which several cities and roads, located across a large mosaic landscape of ca. 300 km(2) in central Spain, alter the abundance patterns of the native avifauna. Total species richness, total bird abundance, and abundance of different guilds of birds which are potentially sensitive to human disturbances were modelled by means of tree regression analyzes. Nearby cities do not affect the total bird species richness in natural habitats of the study region. Total bird abundance increases near urban areas, mainly through its positive influence on urban-exploiter species. The effect of roads is negative and highly generalized, although threshold distances to roads vary among different groups of species. The bird communities of deciduous woodlands (ash groves, oak patches and poplars) show higher resilience to deletereous influences from nearby cities and roads. It would be desirable not to build new scattered urban developments within the remnant natural areas of this heavily fragmented region, because their existence and connection to the nearby cities by new roads would add 'invisible' negative effects on the native bird fauna (e.g. on some threatened species from open habitats), considering the buffer distances determining most significant impacts (400 m for urban areas, and 300 m for roads).

AB 1. According to the guidelines of the European Water Framework Directive, assessment of the ecological quality of streams and rivers should be based on ecotype-specific reference conditions. Here, we assess two approaches for establishing a typology for Mediterranean streams: a top-down approach using environmental variables and bottom-up approach using macroinvertebrate assemblages.
   2. Classification of 162 sites using environmental variables resulted in five ecotypes: (i) temporary streams; (ii) evaporite calcareous streams at medium altitude; (iii) siliceous headwater streams at high altitude; (iv) calcareous headwater streams at medium to high altitude and (v) large watercourses.
   3. Macroinvertebrate communities of minimally disturbed sites (n = 105), grouped using UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages) on Bray-Curtis similarities, were used to validate four of the five ecotypes obtained using environmental variables; ecotype 5, large watercourses, was not included as this group had no reference sites.
   4. Analysis of similarities (anosim) showed that macroinvertebrate assemblage composition differed among three of the four ecotypes, resulting in differences between the bottom-up and top-down classification approaches. Siliceous streams were clearly different from the other three ecotypes, evaporite and calcareous ecotypes did not show large differences in macroinvertebrate assemblages and temporary streams formed a very heterogeneous group because of large variability in salinity and hydrology.
   5. This study showed that stream classification schemes based on environmental variables need to be validated using biological variables. Furthermore, our findings indicate that special attention should be given to the classification of temporary streams.

AB Invasive alien species can pose a severe threat to biodiversity and stability of the ecosystems they invade. Predicting distribution patterns of invasive species in regions outside their native range is a fundamental component of early warning systems. Crofton weed (Eupatorium adenophorum Spreng.) was first discovered in the Yunnan Province of China around the 1940s. The well-documented invasion history of this plant species provided the opportunity for us to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of biological invasion by crofton weed. Using the datasets documenting 441 known localities invaded by crofton weed in China over the past 50 years and 23 environmental variables generated by the genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP) model, we tested the predictability of crofton weed distribution with a high degree of accuracy. Both the Kappa statistics and the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that it is possible to predict the geographical spread of crofton weed in China. Precipitation in the coldest quarter of the year, extremely low air temperature, and maximum annual air temperature strongly influenced the predictions. Our results indicate that crofton weed may break out in Yungui Plateau, Sichuan Basin, southeastern Coastlands, Hainan Island, and Taiwan although currently it is either absent or has only recently been recorded in these regions. Redundancy analysis (RDA) ordination results demonstrated that temperature and precipitation play an important role in confining the spread of crofton weed. Over the past 20 years, crofton weed has spread from subtropical areas with higher annual mean temperature and lower climatic fluctuations to much cooler and dryer areas at higher altitudes. The distribution of crofton weed was restricted mainly to regions with mean annual air temperature ranging from 10 to 22 degrees C and annual precipitation from 800 to 2000 mm. Our results could help in developing and implementing early detection measures to minimize the ecological impacts of crofton weed invasion in China.

AB 1. Management decisions are increasingly based on matrix models intended to predict the long-term fate of endangered species. However, certain elements of these models, such as life-state transition probabilities (vital rates), are difficult to parameterize and their values may vary depending on external conditions such as weather. Details of how weather might influence population performance are rare, yet necessary to assess the effects of global climate change on a species' distribution.
   2. Based on a 26-year data set of a population of Himantoglossum hircinum in a nature reserve in Germany, variations of life-history traits and vital rates were studied. Matrix analysis was used to identify the most important life-state transitions for population growth. Multiple linear regression was used to quantify the response of population traits and vital rates to changing weather conditions.
   3. Population size increased exponentially and density effects could not be observed. Flowering plants and large plants had the highest and second highest reproductive value, respectively. The population's finite rate of increase fluctuated strongly among years; life-history traits varied strongly and were interlinked, thereby violating the assumptions of matrix modelling in a population viability analysis.
   4. Some vital rates and the population growth rate showed a trend over the total period. A certain and sometimes large amount of that variability could be attributed to variability of weather conditions, with warmer winter conditions favouring population performance. Prediction of population size was fairly accurate within a time frame of 10 years, but size class structure was not.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Matrix modelling proved to be unreliable for predicting long-term population dynamics, despite the long-term data set used for matrix construction. This can be explained by weather-dependent variability of vital rates driving population dynamics. A minimum study period of 4 years is necessary to produce relevant information for model development. Our study emphasizes the need for critical evaluation of management decisions based only on single short-term studies and for studies covering longer time intervals than 2-3 years.

AB Field experiments were conducted in Sicily (south Italy) to assess chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence parameters in response of potato crop to nitrogen dose, to variation in genotype and in plant age, and to detect relationships between Chl content, fluorescence parameter F(v)/F(m), and tuber yield. The experiment included five nitrogen doses (0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 g m(-2)) and four genotypes (Spunta, Sieglinde, Daytona, and Igea). Chl fluorescence parameters (initial fluorescence, F(0), maximum fluorescence, F(m), variable fluorescence, F(v), F(v)/F(m), T(max) (the time required to reach F(m)), and Chl content were measured weekly between the appearance of the fifth and sixth leaves and the onset of plant senescence. A positive linear relationship was established between nitrogen supply and Chl content, F(0), and Tmax. Nitrogen supply up to 10 g m(-2) also had a positive effect on F(m) and F(v), but above this rate it reduced F(v)/F(m). Spunta had the highest Chl content, F(m), F(v), and F(v)/F(m), but the lowest F(0), whereas Sieglinde had the lowest Chl content, F(v), F(v)/F(m), and T(max) and the highest F(0). The cvs. Igea and Daytona exhibited intermediate Chl fluorescence parameters. Chl content and Tmax decreased with increasing plant age, whereas F(0), Fm, and Fv increased until complete canopy development and thereafter declined until crop maturity. Tuber and plant dry matter yield were significantly correlated with Chl content, F(0), and T(max). Thus Chl fluorescence and content detect differences in the response of potato to N supply, can discriminate between genotypes, predict plant age, and yield performance under field conditions.

AB An historical data set, collected in 1958 by Southward and Crisp, was used as a baseline for detecting change in the abundances of species ill the rocky intertidal of Ireland. In 2003, the abundances of each of 27 species was assessed using the same methodologies (ACFOR [which stands for the categories: abundant, common, frequent, occasional and rare] abundances scales) at 63 shores examined in the historical study. Comparison of the ACFOR data. over a 45-year period, between the historical Survey and re-survey, showed statistically significant changes in the abundances of 12 of the 27 species examined. Two species (one classed as northern and one introduced) Increased significantly in abundance while ten species (five classed as northern, one classed as southern and Four broadly distributed) decreased in abundance. The possible reasons for the changes in species, abundances were assessed not only in the context of anthropogenic effects, such as climate change and commercial exploitation, but also of operator error. The error or differences recorded among operators (i.e. research scientists) when assessing species abundance using ACFOR categories was quantified oil four shores. Significant change detected ill three of the 12 species fell within the margin of operator error. This effect of operator may have also contributed to the results of no change in the other 15 species between the two census periods. It was not possible to determine the effect of operator oil Our results, Which Call Increase the occurrence of a false positive (Type 1) or of a false negative (Type 2) outcome.

AB This paper outlines the general characteristics of customary sea tenure (CST) in Oceania and identifies areas in which these characteristics overlap with modern rights-based fisheries management systems such as ITQs and CDQs. It also examines the effectiveness of CST regimes at regulating marine resource use and access by focusing on a particular case from the Solomon Islands. The institutional robustness or vulnerability of CST is assessed by examining various performance criteria for two communities in the Roviana Lagoon, Western Solomons. These criteria include people's (1) settlement patterns in relation to their property, (2) cultural consensus, (3) cultural attitudes with regard to governance and management, and (4) fishing efforts and yields. The results show that a number of historical processes have shaped CST systems into heterogeneous and dynamic institutions, and that CST regimes can vary even on small geographical scales. Understanding the circumstances in which CST regimes are more likely to be successful has facilitated the design and implementation of co-management fishery prescriptions (MPAs) for protecting particular species and habitats in the region. More generally, the paper proposes that by discerning the effectiveness of local governance institutions at regulating resource use and access - taking into consideration that these are embedded in particular historical and political contexts - we can better predict whether or not an introduced fishery management system will work. This knowledge can also assist in designing hybrid management schemes that cross-fertilize community-based management, modern rights-based fishery management (e.g., ITQs and CDQs), and other government regulations. This integration is particularly relevant when these policies are to be implemented in coastal communities that have or have had traditional rights-based fishery management systems of their own and/or are more socio-culturally homogeneous. Given the long history of failed fishery management, it is now of vital importance to design innovative fishery management prescriptions that integrate natural and social science research more comprehensively.

AB Despite their vulnerability to forest disturbances in the Neotropics, the consequences of forest perturbation on mixed species flocks are poorly understood in the threatened Southeast Asian rainforests. We examined the effects of local-scale habitat disturbance on mixed species flocks along an escalating gradient of anthropogenic modification (i.e., forest interior, forest edge, and urban) in a sub-montane tropical rainforest in Peninsular Malaysia that is presently experiencing low intensity development. Mixed species flocks in the forest interior and forest edge habitats (9.3 +/- 2.3 and 8.4 +/- 2.3, respectively) had significantly higher number of species than those observed in the urban habitat (5.1 +/- 1.7). Flock participation was influenced by environmental characteristics (e.g., canopy cover). Flocking species sensitive to habitat disturbance were likely to be from the Families Corvidae, Nectariniidae, and Sylviidae: had narrow to restricted altitudinal ranges; and were exclusively dependent on primary forest and understory micro-habitats. We conclude that sub-montane mixed species flocks are affected by even small scale urbanization and that they, particularly with species richness as a parameter, can be used as effective ecological indicators. With the looming development pressure on the sub-montane/montane habitats in Peninsular Malaysia and the Southeast Asian region, urgent conservation actions are needed for the preservation of their biotas.

AB Carbon flux of Amazonian primary forest vegetation has been shown to vary both spatially and temporally. Process-based models are adequate tools to understand the basis of such variation and can also provide projections to future scenarios. The parameterization of such process-based models requires information from the vegetation in question simply because ecosystem-level gas exchange is a direct result of the tightly coupled interaction between local vegetation and regional climate. In this study, data are presented concerning canopy structure [ leaf area index (LAI), and the ratio of leaf dry mass to leaf area (LMA)], leaf chemistry [area-based foliar nitrogen content (N-area) and carbon isotope composition (delta C-13)], and photosynthetic gas exchange [ maximum carbon assimilation rates (A(max)), stomatal conductance (g(s)@A(max)), maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax), and respiration rates (R-d)] versus relative height from an extensive survey of primary forest vegetation of the Santarem region ( eastern Amazon, Santarem, Federal State of Para, Brazil). Ground-level LAI values ranged between 4.5 and 5.9. Both A(max) and V-cmax showed large variations within the canopy profile with values ranging between 2.4 and 15.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and between 10.1 and 105.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Also, N-area varied between 0.75 to 4.19 gN m(-2), and similar to A(max) and V-cmax, showed higher values at the top of the canopy. Variations were detected among sites in patterns of vertical distribution of N-area and LAI, indicating spatial heterogeneity of the forest. Also, no statistically significant evidence of seasonal variations on parameters was observed, indicating that there is limited gas exchange acclimation by the vegetation to wet or dry seasons.

AB Processes operating at multiple spatial scales govern the structure and functioning of ecological communities. We conducted a resource manipulation and propagule addition experiment in grassland to evaluate the interaction of local resource availability and propagule pools in governing local-scale plant colonization, biodiversity, and above-ground productivity. The availabilities of establishment microsites and water were manipulated in field plots for two years through the application of experimental soil disturbances and irrigation, respectively. Resource manipulations led to increased invasibility of the community, as predicted by the theory of fluctuating resources. Rates of colonization, enhanced by the sowing of 32 grassland species, increased plant diversity and above-ground productivity, but to a greater extent under conditions of resource enrichment. Although resource enrichment generally increased diversity and productivity, these responses were contingent upon species availability and tended to be more pronounced in the presence of an expanded propagule pool. These findings suggest that biodiversity at the level of the available propagule pool and fluctuations in resources interact to regulate local resident diversity and productivity by determining opportunities for species sorting, by mediating community assembly, and by governing the potential for functional compensation in the community.

AB We present generalized regression analysis and spatial prediction (GRASP) conceptually as a method for producing spatial predictions using statistical models, and introduce and demonstrate a specific implementation in Splus that facilitates the process. We put forward GRASP as a new name encapsulating an existing concept that aims at making spatial predictions using generalized regression analysis. Regression modeling is used to establish relationships between a response variable and a set of spatial predictors. The regression relationships are then used to make spatial predictions of the response. The GRASP process requires point measurements of the response, as well as regional coverages of predictor variables that are statistically (and preferably causally) important in determining the patterns of the response. This approach to spatial prediction is becoming more commonplace, and it is useful to define it as a general concept. For instance, GRASP could use a survey of the abundance of a species (the response), and existing spatial coverages of environmental (e.g. climate, landform) variables (the predictors) for a region. A multiple regression can be used to establish the statistical relationship between the species abundance and the environmental variables. These regression relationships can then be used to predict the species abundance from the environmental surfaces. This process defines relationships in environmental space and uses these relationships to predict in geographic space. We introduce GRASP (the implementation) as an interface and collection of functions in Spins designed to facilitate modern regression analysis and the use of these regressions for making spatial predictions. GRASP standardizes the modeling process and makes it more reproducible and less subjective, while preserving analysis flexibility. The set of functions provides a toolbox that allows quick and easy data checking, model building and evaluation, and calculation of predictions. The current version uses generalized additive models (GAMs), a modern non-parametric regression technique the advantages of which are discussed. We demonstrate the use of the GRASP implementation to model and predict the natural distributions of two components of New Zealand fern biodiversity: (1) the natural distribution of an icon species, silver fern (Cyathea dealbata); and (2) the natural pattern of total fern species richness. Key steps are demonstrated, including data preparation, options setting, data exploration, model building, model validation and interpretation, and spatial prediction. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Using a combination of model simulations and detailed measurements at a hierarchy of scales conducted at a sandhills forest site, the effect of fertilization on net ecosystem exchange (NEE ) and its components in 6-year-old Pinus taeda stands was quantified. The detailed measurements, collected over a 20-d period in September and October, included gas exchange and eddy covariance fluxes, sampled for a 10-d period each at the fertilized stand and at the control stand. Respiration from the forest floor and above-ground biomass was measured using chambers during the experiment. Fertilization doubled leaf area index (LAI) and increased leaf carboxylation capacity by 20%. However, this increase in total LAI translated into an increase of only 25% in modelled sunlit LAI and in canopy photosynthesis. It is shown that the same climatic and environmental conditions that enhance photosynthesis in the September and October periods also cause an increase in respiration The increases in respiration counterbalanced photosynthesis and resulted in negligible NEE differences between fertilized and control stands. The fact that total biomass of the fertilized stand exceeded 2.5 times that of the control, suggests that the counteracting effects cannot persist throughout the year. In fact, modelled annual carbon balance showed that gross primary productivity (GPP ) increased by about 50% and that the largest enhancement in NEE occurred in the spring and autumn, during which cooler temperatures reduced respiration more than photosynthesis. The modelled difference in annual NEE between fertilized and control stands (approximately 200 g C m(-2) y(-1)) suggest that the effect of fertilization was sufficiently large to transform the stand from a net terrestrial carbon source to a net sink.

AB Genetic analysis of introduced populations, especially in morphologically conservative taxa, can clarify introduction histories, identify management units and source populations, provide a more realistic estimate of the frequency of successful invasion, and suggest strategies for preventing further introductions. In the last 7 years, populations of swamp eels, referred to the Asian genus Monopterus (Family Synbranchidae) on the basis of external morphology, have been discovered in aquatic habitats near Atlanta, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; North Miami, Florida; and most recently in close proximity to Everglades National Park in Homestead, Florida. Swamp eels are large predators capable of dispersal over land and have the potential to disrupt already threatened ecosystems. We analyzed mitochondrial DNA sequences from four known populations in the continental United States and samples from Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and two locations in China to determine introduction histories, source populations, genetic diversity, and relationships among populations. Our results indicate that there have been at least three independent introductions of genetically distinct forms. Introduced populations in close proximity (separated by <40 km) are genetically distinct. The level of sequence difference among introduced populations reaches levels seen among sister families of teleost fishes for the same region of the mitochondrial genome. These genetically distinct introduced populations in all likelihood represent at least two and possibly three species. Regardless of species status, these genetically distinct lineages may be expected to vary in ecological or life-history traits, representing different potential threats to the ecosystems where they have been introduced. Given the success of swamp eels in invading many habitats around the world, further study of these eels is warranted to elucidate the characteristics of successful invaders and invasions.

AB The polyomavirus JC virus (JCV), the etiological agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, is ubiquitous in the human population, infecting children asymptomatically, then persisting in the kidney. The main mode of transmission of JCV is from parents to children through long-term cohabitation. Twelve JCV subtypes that occupy unique domains in Europe, Africa, and Asia have been identified. Here, we attempted to elucidate the evolutionary relationships among JCV strains worldwide using the whole-genome approach with which a highly reliable phylogeny of JCV strains can be reconstructed. Sixty-five complete JCV DNA sequences, derived from various geographical regions and belonging to 11 of the 12 known subtypes, were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using three independent methods: the neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods. The trees obtained with these methods consistently indicated that ancestral JCVs were divided into three superclusters, designated as Types A, B, and C. A split in Type A generated two subtypes, EU-a and -b, mainly containing European and Mediterranean strains. The first split in Type B generated Af2 (the major African subtype). Subsequent splits in Type B generated B1-c (a minor European subtype) and all seven Asian subtypes (B1-a, -b, -d, B2, MY, CY, and SC). Type C generated a single subtype (Af1), consisting of strains derived from western Africa. While the present findings provided a basis on which to classify JCV into types or subtypes, they have several implications for the divergence and migration of human populations.

AB Blastocystis hominis, a parasite of the human intestine, has recently been positioned within stramenopiles by the small subunit rRNA phylogeny. To further confirm its phylogenetic position using multiple molecular sequence data, we determined the nucleotide sequences putatively encoding small subunit ribosomal RNA, cytosolic-type 70 kDa heat shock protein, translation elongation factor 2, and the non-catalytic 'B' subunit of vacuolar ATPase of B. hominis (HE87-1 strain). Moreover, we determined the translation elongation factor 2 sequence of an apicomplexan parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, that belongs to alveolates. The maximum likelihood analyses of small subunit rRNA and cytosolic-type 70-kDa heat shock protein clearly demonstrated that B. hominis (HE87-1 strain) is positioned within stramenopiles, being congruent with the previous small subunit RNA analysis, including the sequences of B. hominis (Nand strain) and a Blastocystis isolate from guinea pig. Although no clear resolution among major eukaryotic groups was obtained by the individual phylogenies based on the four molecules analyzed here, a combined analysis of various molecules, including these, clearly indicated that Blastocystis/stramenopiles are the closest relatives of alveolates.

AB Changes in the amount of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; EC 4.1.1.39) synthesized and degraded and the levels of rbcL and rbcS mRNAs were examined in the eighth leaf blades of rice from emergence to senescence. Synthesis of Rubisco was very active during leaf expansion, became quite low at the time of full expansion and then declined further during senescence. The changes in the levels of rbcL and rbcS mRNAs coordinated approximately with those in the amount of Rubisco synthesized. Thus, it is suggested that the amount of Rubisco synthesized is determined primarily by the levels of rbcL and rbcS mRNAs during the life span of the leaves. Degradation of Rubisco started just before the time of full expansion and became far more active than its synthesis during senescence. Since the synthesis of Rubisco during senescence scarcely contributed to its amount, it can be concluded that the degradation of Rubisco is the major determinant for the amount of Rubisco in senescent leaves. The decline in the level of rbcL mRNA occurred much earlier in the developmental stage and proceeded at a much faster rate than that of rbcL DNA, indicating that the level of rbcL DNA is not a major determinant for the level of rbcL mRNA in senescent leaves of rice.

AB Widespread hunting had fragmented and severely reduced elephant populations in South Africa by 1900. Elephant numbers increased during the 1900s, although rates of recovery of individual populations varied. The Kruger National Park elephant population increased rapidly, to more than 6000 by 1967, with recruitment boosted by immigration from Mozambique. The Addo Elephant National Park population was reduced to 11 elephants in 1931 and remains relatively small (n = 325). Loss of genetic variation is expected to occur whenever a population goes through a bottleneck, especially when post-bottleneck recovery is slow. Variation at nine polymorphic microsatellite loci was analysed for Kruger and Addo elephants, as well as museum specimens of Addo elephants shot prior to the population bottleneck. Significantly reduced genetic variation and heterozygosity were observed in Addo in comparison to Kruger (mean alleles/locus and H-E: Addo 1.89, 0.18; Kruger 3.89, 0.44). Two alleles not present in the current Addo population were observed in the museum specimens. Addo elephants represent a genetic subset of the Kruger population, with high levels of genetic differentiation resulting from rapid genetic drift. The Kruger population is low in genetic diversity in comparison to East African elephants, confirming this population also suffered an appreciable bottleneck.

AB Despite numerous reports on the positive effects of vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) on plant growth in temperate soils, surprisingly little data exist on the importance of VAM for crop growth on acid sandy soils of West Africa. A pot experiment conducted with local genotypes of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) with and without phosphorus (P) application in a sterilized sandy soil from a farmer's field in Niger shelved large growth-enhancing effects of VAM. Phosphorus application led to 18- and 24-fold increases in pearl millet root and shoot dry matter independently of VAM, whereas the shout and root dry matter of sorghum and cowpea depended largely on the interaction between P application and VAM. With P, VAM increased total uptake of P, K, Ca, Mg and Zn by 2.5- to 6-fold in sorghum and cowpea. On severely P deficient West African soils P application can lead to large increases in early root growth, a prerequisite for early mycorrhizal infection and a subsequent significant contribution of VAM to enhanced plant growth and nutrient uptake.

AB To elucidate the evolutionary mechanisms of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein at the single-site level, the degree of amino acid variation and the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions were examined in 186 nucleotide sequences for gp120 (subtype B), Analyses of amino acid variabilities showed that the level of variability was very different from site to site in both conserved (C1 to C5) and variable (V1 to V5) regions previously assigned. To examine the relative importance of positive and negative selection for each amino acid position, the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions that occurred at each codon position were estimated by taking phylogenetic relationships into account. Among the 414 codon positions examined, we identified 33 positions where nonsynonymous substitutions were significantly predominant. These positions where positive selection may be operating, which we call putative positive selection (PS) sites, were found not only in the variable loops but also in the conserved regions (C1 to C4), In particular, we found seven PS sites at the surface positions of the alpha-helix (positions 335 to 347 in the C3 region) in the opposite face for CD4 binding. Furthermore, two PS sites in the C2 region and four PS sites in the C4 region were detected in the same face of the protein. The PS sites found in the C2, C3, and C4 regions were separated in the amino acid sequence but close together in the three-dimensional structure, This observation suggests the existence of discontinuous epitopes in the protein's surface including this alpha-helix, although the antigenicity of this area has not been reported yet.

AB The effects of N and P deficiency, isolated or in combination, on leaf gas exchange and fast chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence emission were studied in common bean cv. Negrito. 10-d-old plants grown in aerated nutrient solution were supplied with high N (HN, 7.5 mol m(-3)) or low N (LN, 0.5 mol m(-3)), and also with high P (HP, 0.5 mol m(-3)) or low P (LP, 0.005 mol m(-3)). Regardless of the external P supply, in LN plants the initial fluorescence (F-0) increased 12 % in parallel to a quenching of about 14 % in maximum fluorescence (F-m). As a consequence, the variable to maximum fluorescence ratio (F-v/F-m) decreased by about 7 %, and the variable to initial fluorescence ratio (F-v/F-0) was lowered by 25 % in relation to control plants. In LP plants, F-v/F-m remained unchanged whilst F-v/F-0 decreased slightly as a result of 5 % decline in F-m. Under N deficiency, the net photosynthetic rate (PN) halved at 6 d after imposition of treatment and so remained afterwards. As compared to LN plants, PN declined in LP plants latter and to a less extent. From 12 d of P deprivation onwards, PN fell down progressively to display rates similar to those of LN plants only at the end of the experiment. The greater PN in LP plants was not reflected in larger biomass accumulation in relation to LN beans. In general, P and N limitation affected photosynthesis parameters and growth without showing any synergistic or additive effect between deficiency of both nutrients.

AB 1. The response of photosynthesis to radiation is an often-studied but poorly understood process, represented empirically in most photosynthesis models. However, in scaling photosynthesis from leaf to canopy, predictions of canopy photosynthesis are very sensitive to parameters describing the response of leaves to Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD).
   2. In this study, a mechanistic, yet still simple, approach is presented that models the degree of light saturation in leaves explicitly, assuming a heterogeneous environment of PPFD and chlorophyll.
   3. Possible mechanisms determining the ratio of chlorophyll to nitrogen are considered, including a direct dependence on PPFD, a mechanism involving the red/far-red ratio of light in the canopy, and an approach based upon maximizing photosynthesis.
   4. Comparison of model predictions with two data sets of light, nitrogen and chlorophyll from canopies of Populus and Corylus suggests that the red/far-red mechanism is the most realistic. The data also show that the trees studied do not always optimize their nitrogen partitioning to maximize photosynthetic yield.
   5. We then apply the model to the data sets, to predict the shape of light response curves of leaves within canopies and assess the applicability of simple scaling schemes, in which full acclimation of photosynthesis to PPFD justifies the use of big-leaf models. We conclude that, at least for the data used, basic assumptions of such schemes do not hold.

AB Techniques for DNA and protein assay make possible genetic studies on any species. In recent years, molecular methods have been applied to a number of conservation-relevant genetic issues for marine organisms ranging from zooplankton to whales. To introduce these symposium proceedings, I will mention some of the unusual challenges and opportunities afforded by marine taxa for genetic research in conservation, Marine organisms often are less accessible for behavioral and natural history observation than are their terrestrial counterparts. Many marine organisms have exceptional dispersal and migratory capabilities. Species' ranges can be vast. Life histories may include high fecundities and explosive reproductive potentials. Many marine species of conservation concern are harvested commercially or illegally and thus economic, social, jurisdictional, and forensic matters often arise in population management, in addition to biological considerations, For a diversity of marine taxa, molecular markers have uncovered previously unknown aspects of behavior, natural history, and population demography that can inform conservation and management decisions. The studies compiled in this volume highlight the scope and imaginative uses of genetic information for conservation challenges in the marine realm.

AB This article investigates the relationship between the similarity of resource capture abilities and the amount of competition between two consumer species that exploit common resources. Most of the analysis is based on a consumer-resource model introduced by Robert MacArthur. Contrary to many statements in the literature and in textbooks, measures of competition may decrease as similarity increases and may be greatest when similarity of the two species' sets of resource capture rates is very low. High competition with low similarity may occur whether competition is measured by a competition coefficient near equilibrium or is measured by the proportional increase in a species' population density when its competitor is removed. However, these two measures may differ considerably and may change in opposite directions with a given change in similarity. The general conditions required for such counterintuitive relationships between similarity and competition are that the consumer species have relatively low resource requirements for successful reproduction and that the resources be self-reproducing. These same conditions also frequently lead to exclusion of one or more resources via apparent competition, and this is always true of MacArthur's model. A variety of other models of competition are analyzed, and circumstances most likely to produce large competitive effects with little overlap are identified.

AB Few explicit hypotheses for the relationships of unionid mussels exist. The absence of explicit phylogenetic hypotheses is problematic and is in part responsible for the lack of taxonomic stability seen in this group. In this paper we examine the relationships of mussels in the genus Potamilus, based upon the DNA sequences of a 600 base pair portion of the first subunit of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COI) gene. We also examine the genetic distinctiveness of populations of the inflated heelsplitter P. inflatus. The molecular phylogeny indicates that Potamilus is paraphyletic with Leptodea fragilis and Lampsilis ornata nested between P. capax and the remaining Potamilus species. With the exception of Fl capax, the remaining Potamilus species are depicted as monophyletic and form three distinct clades: (1) a reciprocally monophyletic P. inflatus clade; (2) a Fl ohiensis/P. amphichaenus clade; and (3) a P. purpuratus/P. p. coloradoensis/P. alatus clade. While bootstrap values indicate a high degree of support for these three clades, relationships among these three clades are not as strongly supported.
   The genetic distinctiveness of two populations of the inflated heelsplitter exceeds that seen between some other species in the genus. These populations represent geographically isolated, genetically distinct entities, and we therefore recommend the recognition of both the Amite and the Black Warrior populations of P. inflatus as separate species.

AB In the Sahel, short periods of intra-seasonal drought, caused by unfavourable rainfall distribution, often have stronger effect on crop growth than fluctuations in annual rainfall. The interactive effects of nutrient deficiency and water shortage (during panicle initiation, flowering and grain filling) on yield and yield components of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.), were studied on-farm along a cultivated slope, during three years with close to average annual rainfall. Grain yield was correlated to plant nutrient availability but not to annual rainfall, which was explained by the capacity of the crop to compensate for damage caused by water shortage during early growth phases. The performance of each yield component was positively correlated to cumulative rainfall during the growth phase when it was formed. Leaf area index (LAI) was very low, and leaf development followed rainfall distribution. Water and nutrients interacted during each growth phase for all fertility levels. Fertilised millet suffered less during water shortage at panicle initiation and at grain filling compared to non-fertilised miller. However, compared to favourable soil water conditions yield components were systematically lower for all treatments, indicating the synergistic effect of water and nutrients. The results suggest that water availability plays an exclusive role during flowering. Grain number dropped significantly due to water shortage and was similar for all treatments. Despite extremely high spatial variability in yields (varying with a factor 46 within the field), a significant slope effect was observed, of progressively increasing yields when moving downslope. Spatial redistribution of surface runoff resulting in higher soil water availability on lower slope positions, contributed to the yield gradient, which was reinforced for fertilised millet. For each drought period, yield components suffered systematically more upslope than downslope. This slope effect was smoothed out for manured millet, which indicates that manure increased soil infiltrability on crusted zones upslope. The slope interaction observed here - indicating that downslope (i) the risk for crop failure during droughts is lower and (ii) the response to fertilisers is greater - suggests that farmers can benefit relatively more from fertilisers applied in lower parts of the watershed. Taking advantage of spatial soil and water variability is an interesting system of low technology precision farming, which combined with water harvesting systems to master droughts, can constitute options for increased crop yields in the Sahel.

AB We evaluated the hypothesis that photosynthetic traits differ between leaves produced at the beginning (May) and the end (November-December) of the rainy season in the canopy of a seasonally dry forest in Panama. Leaves produced at the end of the wet season were predicted to have higher photosynthetic capacities and higher water-use efficiencies than leaves produced during the early rainy season. Such seasonal phenotypic differentiation may be adaptive, since leaves produced immediately preceding the dry season are likely to experience greater light availability during their lifetime due to reduced cloud cover during the dry season. We used a construction crane for access to the upper canopy and sampled 1- to 2-month-old leaves marked in monthly censuses for six common tree species with various ecological habits and leaf phenologies. Photosynthetic capacity was quantified as light- and CO2-saturated oxygen evolution rates with a leaf-disk oxygen electrode in the laboratory (O-2max) and as light-saturated CO2 assimilation rates of intact leaves under ambient CO2 (A(max)). In four species, pre-dry season leaves had significantly higher leaf mass per unit area. In these four species, O-2max and A(max) per unit area and maximum stomatal conductances were significantly greater in pre-dry season leaves than in early wet season leaves, In two species, A(max) for a given stomatal conductance was greater in pre-dry season leaves than in early wet season leaves, suggesting a higher photosynthetic water-use efficiency in the former. Photosynthetic capacity per unit mass was not significantly different between seasons of leaf production in any species. In both early wet season and pre-dry season leaves? mean photosynthetic capacity per unit mass was positively correlated with nitrogen content per unit mass both within and among species. Seasonal phenotypic differentiation observed in canopy tree species is achieved through changes in leaf mass per unit area and increased maximum stomatal conductance rather than by changes in nitrogen allocation patterns.

AB Studies were undertaken to evaluate the effects of mechanical impedance on root exudation by maize (Zea mays L., var Dea) and to examine the importance of these effects in relation to the stage of plant development. Plants were grown under sterile and hydroponic conditions. Mechanical impedance was simulated using glass beads of 1 mm diameter. This treatment was compared with a control without beads. Results demonstrated that plant growth was influenced by mechanical impedance. Mechanical impedance markedly affected the growth of the shoot, whether this was measured as leaf area or total dry matter. Besides increasing root/shoot biomass ratios, mechanical impedances also stimulated root exudation of organic and inorganic compounds. Stressed plants lost more nitrogenous compounds than control plants. Otherwise, the percentage of released carbon decreased. Depending on the developmental stage of the plant, there was a large variation in the magnitude and time course on mechanical impedance effects. The effects of mechanical impedance persist and accentuate with time.
